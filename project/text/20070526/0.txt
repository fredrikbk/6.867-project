a duel at dow chemical behind two firings competing visions or too many secrets midland mich andrew liveris and romeo kreinberg once lived nine houses from each other on a winding street in this town that for more than a century has been home to their employer dow chemical co but the two executives had different visions for the company mr liveris who bested mr kreinberg on the climb to becoming chief executive in believes dow should remain an integrated chemicals giant mr kreinberg whom mr liveris tapped in to head dows "performance" division argued his part of the company which makes high margin products like automotive adhesives should be given more autonomy from the low margin part of dow the "basics" division which cranks out commodities such as caustic soda last month the hard charging executives collided on the night of april mr kreinberg was eating a hot dog at his asian influenced brick house on valley drive when he got a call from mr liveriss secretary asking him to show up in the ceos office at a m the next day according to mr kreinberg when he got there mr liveris and a handful of top dow officials told him they had discovered he secretly had been plotting with investment bankers and omani investors to buy out dow he could leave the company one of two ways they said walk away or be pushed out mr kreinberg years old denied the charges and refused to resign he was fired on the same day dow also fired j pedro reinhard a dow board member and senior adviser dow says mr reinhard worked with mr kreinberg to arrange the unauthorized buyout now the parties are engaged in dueling lawsuits dow has sued messrs kreinberg and reinhard in federal court seeking to get back stock related compensation from the pair mr kreinbergs suit filed in new york state court and mr reinhards suit filed in federal district court in new york deny any wrongdoing and seek damages the securities and exchange commission has launched an informal inquiry looking into trading in dow stock as market rumors about a possible dow buyout were intensifying this spring according to a person familiar with the matter news of the sec inquiry plus disclosure of merger discussions last year between dow and dupont co was reported friday by the new york times in an interview mr kreinberg says that though he periodically talked with investment bankers it was only as part of his authorized duties to execute dows strategy of expanding its reach by doing deals dow declined to make mr liveris available for this article but in an interview last month days after the firings the year old ceo said he was "certain and i capitalize certain" that messrs kreinberg and reinhard were orchestrating a buyout of dow a person close to dow says the company has found phone records expense reports and email traffic detailing the pairs effort dow declined to provide any evidence it might have because the dispute has moved into court "the firings had absolutely nothing to do with disagreements between liveris and kreinberg " says chris huntley a dow spokesman "they were fired because they were doing what they should not have been doing " at the center of the firings is a february meeting between messrs kreinberg and reinhard and bankers from j p morgan chase &amp co mr kreinberg contends mr liveris twisted the substance of that meeting to justify getting rid of him because he had been arguing the ceos strategy wasnt bold enough mr reinhard through his lawyer declined to comment for this article but in a statement accompanying his lawsuit he said he "will continue to categorically deny that i have been part of any secret effort to take over or acquire dow chemical " whats not in dispute is that dow is under the gun from wall street its racing to do deals in an effort to transform its business from commodities that are hit hard when the chemical cycle swoons to differentiated products that command robust prices all the time because of high prices for natural gas the main ingredient for dows chemicals the company is negotiating a series of joint ventures to shift production in its basics business to the middle east and asia where gas is cheaper and away from north america and europe where gas is more expensive the company also is pushing to beef up its performance business which is what prompted dow to approach dupont last year though dupont rebuffed the overture what mr liveris doesnt want to do is shed either side of dows business he argues dows integration provides significant economies of scale mr kreinberg says he was arguing that the basics business was holding his faster running performance business back thats long been debated at dow the board has considered whether dow would operate better "if it were not an integrated company with two businesses " according to a person with knowledge of the boards discussions mr kreinberg joined the company as an insulation salesman in and spent about two decades in europe before moving to midland in to head dows business in polyolefins a commodity plastic by he had become senior vice president in charge of dows entire plastics business essentially half the company while many dow managers held meetings in the ashman court a serviceable hotel in midland mr kreinberg was known for an annual dow gathering in rio de janeiro there every spring at carnaval he hosted a three day meeting for about of dows top customers and their spouses many of them from latin america the gathering was at the caesar park hotel a high rise on the beach mr liveris an australian rose through dows ranks in asia a region whose explosive growth would put it at the center of the companys global strategy he led the companys operations in thailand and then oversaw all dows asia pacific business then in he moved to midland and later was given control of dows performance chemicals business mr liveriss turf at dow was profitable at a time when a spike in natural gas prices torpedoed dows earnings in after having talked to people including mr kreinberg the board tapped mr liveris as chief operating officer and the next year named him ceo mr liveris reorganized dow to stress the performance business and named mr kreinberg to head it in presentations to dow executives and board members starting in early mr kreinberg says he argued dow should give that business more autonomy "maybe not splitting it up but running it differently " he says "i was supporting that we should create an environment that could permit a different kind of culture running it under different umbrellas " until very recently the relationship between messrs liveris and kreinberg appeared good in march the company announced a reorganization of its executive ranks that was intended largely to give the performance side more freedom that move involved naming a four person executive leadership committee that included mr kreinberg then came word of the controversial meeting involving j p morgan mr kreinberg says he flew to london in early february for a meeting with a consultant to discuss the price at which dow would buy gas for a chemicals complex it is planning to build in oman mr reinhard later joined the two men for lunch mr kreinberg says during the lunch two j p morgan bankers came by as for how they got there "i guess there was conversation among people who know each other " mr kreinberg says adding he doesnt know the details the bankers asked the dow executives about potential dow deals that had been rumored in the media among them one with reliance industries ltd indias largest private sector company they also asked how dow would respond to a buyout offer mr kreinberg says "my response was it would be a very negative reaction " he says "because i never thought the company was interested to do that " dow portrays the meeting very differently when in the spring rumors intensified of dow buyout talks involving j p morgan as bankers dow executives phoned j p morgan bank officials confirmed that bankers from the firms london office had been involved in buyout talks regarding dow but said they would stop according to a person familiar with the matter on april mr liveris dined with james dimon j p morgans chief executive at the dow club a warren of private rooms in the midland country club the dinner had been scheduled to ensure the relationship between their two companies hadnt been tarnished by the buyout rumors according to a person familiar with the matter the dow suit doesnt mention mr dimon by name referring only to a bank ceo it says that on april the two ceos talked again by phone and the bank ceo named messrs kreinberg and reinhard as the dow officials who had been talking to j p morgan two days later dow fired the pair mr dimon has declined to discuss his conversations with mr liveris but stanley arkin mr kreinbergs lawyer says he was later told by lawyers for j p morgan that mr dimon told mr liveris that messrs kreinberg and reinhard made clear when asked that they didnt have authority to sell dow dow officials say that if the meeting truly had been harmless messrs kreinberg and reinhard should have told them about it joann s
