american honor once we knew who and what to honor on memorial day those who had given all their tomorrows as was said of the men who stormed the beaches of normandy for our todays but in a world saturated with selfhood where every death is by definition a death in vain the notion of sacrifice today provokes puzzlement more often than admiration we support the troops of course but we also believe that war being hell can easily touch them with an evil no cause for engagement can wash away and in any case we are more comfortable supporting them as victims than as warriors former football star pat tillman and marine cpl jason dunham were killed on the same day april but as details of his death fitfully emerged from afghanistan tillman has become a metaphor for the current conflict a victim of fratricide disillusionment coverup and possibly conspiracy by comparison dunham who saved several of his comrades in iraq by falling on an insurgents grenade is the unknown soldier the new york times which featured abu ghraib on its front page for consecutive days put the story of dunhams medal of honor on the third page of section b not long ago i was asked to write the biographical sketches for a book featuring formal photographs of all our living medal of honor recipients as i talked with them i was of course chilled by the primal power of their stories but i also felt pathos they had become strangers honored strangers but strangers nonetheless in our midst in my own boyhood figures such as jimmy doolittle audie murphy and john basilone were household names and it was assumed that what they had done defined us as well as them telling us what kind of nation we were but the medal recipients alive today are virtually unknown except for a niche audience of warfare buffs their heroism has become the military equivalent of genre painting theres something wrong with that what they did in battle was extraordinary jose lopez a diminutive mexican american from the barrio of san antonio was in the ardennes forest when the germans began the counteroffensive that became the battle of the bulge as enemy soldiers approached his position he grabbed a machine gun and opened fire killing them all he killed two dozen more who rushed him knocked down by the concussion of german shells he picked himself up packed his weapon on his back and ran toward a group of americans about to be surrounded he began firing and didnt stop until all his ammunition and all that he could scrounge from other guns was gone by then he had killed over of the enemy and bought his comrades time to establish a defensive line yet their stories were not only about killing several medal of honor recipients told me that the first thing they did after the battle was to find a church or some other secluded spot where they could pray not only for those comrades theyd lost but also the enemy theyd killed desmond doss for instance was a conscientious objector who entered the army in and became a medic because of his religious convictions and refusal to carry a weapon the men in his unit intimidated and threatened him trying to get him to transfer out he refused and they grudgingly accepted him late in he was with them in okinawa when they got cut to pieces assaulting a japanese stronghold everyone but mr doss retreated from the rocky plateau where dozens of wounded remained under fire he treated them and then began moving them one by one to a steep escarpment where he roped them down to safety each time he succeeded he prayed "dear god please let me get just one more man " by the end of the day he had single handedly saved gis why did they do it some talked of entering a zone of slow motion invulnerability where they were spectators at their own heroism but for most the answer was simpler and more straightforward they couldnt let their buddies down big for his age at jack lucas begged his mother to help him enlist after pearl harbor she collaborated in lying about his age in return for his promise to someday finish school after training at parris island he was sent to honolulu when his unit boarded a troop ship for iwo jima mr lucas was ordered to remain behind for guard duty he stowed away to be with his friends and discovered two days out at sea convinced his commanding officer to put him in a combat unit rather than the brig he had just turned when he hit the beach and a day later he was fighting in a japanese trench when he saw two grenades land near his comrades he threw himself onto the grenades and absorbed the explosion later a medic assuming he was dead was about to take his dog tag when he saw mr lucass finger twitch after months of treatment and recovery he returned to school as hed promised his mother a ninth grader wearing a medal of honor around his neck the men in world war ii always knew although news coverage was sometimes scant that they were in some sense performing for the people at home the audience dwindled during korea by the vietnam war the journalists were omnipresent but the men were performing primarily for each other one story that expresses this isolation and comradeship involves a seal team ambushed on a beach after an aborted mission near north vietnams cua viet river base after a five hour gunfight cmdr tom norris already a legend thanks to his part in a harrowing rescue mission for a downed pilot later dramatized in the film bat stayed behind to provide covering fire while the three others headed to rendezvous with the boat sent to extract them at the waters edge one of the men mike thornton looked back and saw tom norris get hit as the enemy moved in he ran back through heavy fire and killed two north vietnamese standing over norriss body he lifted the officer barely alive with a shattered skull and carried him to the water and then swam out to sea where they were picked up two hours later the two men have been inseparable in the years since the pows of vietnam configured a mini america in prison that upheld the values beginning to wilt at home as a result of protest and dissension john mccain tells of lance sijan an airman who ejected over north vietnam and survived for six weeks crawling because of his wounds through the jungle before being captured close to death when he reached hanoi sijan told his captors that he would give them no information because it was against the code of conduct when not delirious he quizzed his cellmates about camp security and made plans to escape the north vietnamese were obsessed with breaking him but never did when he died after long sessions of torture sijan was in sen mccains words "a free man from a free country " leo thorsness was also at the hanoi hilton the air force pilot had taken on four migs trying to strafe his wingman who had parachuted out of his damaged aircraft mr thorsness destroyed two and drove off the other two he was shot down himself soon after this engagement and found out by tap code that his name had been submitted for the medal one of mr thorsnesss most vivid memories from seven years of imprisonment involved a fellow prisoner named mike christian who one day found a grimy piece of cloth perhaps a former handkerchief during a visit to the nasty concrete tank where the pows were occasionally allowed a quick sponge bath christian picked up the scrap of fabric and hid it back in his cell he convinced prisoners to give him precious crumbs of soap so he could clean the cloth he stole a small piece of roof tile which he laboriously ground into a powder mixed with a bit of water and used to make horizontal stripes he used one of the blue pills of unknown provenance the prisoners were given for all ailments to color a square in the upper left of the cloth with a needle made from bamboo wood and thread unraveled from the cells one blanket christian stitched little stars on the blue field "it took mike a couple weeks to finish working at night under his mosquito net so the guards couldnt see him " mr thorsness told me "early one morning he got up before the guards were active and held up the little flag waving it as if in a breeze we turned to him and saw it coming to attention and automatically saluted some of us with tears running down our cheeks of course the vietnamese found it during a strip search took mike to the torture cell and beat him unmercifully sometime after midnight they pushed him into our cell so bad off that even his voice was gone but when he recovered in a couple weeks he immediately started looking for another piece of cloth " we impoverish ourselves by shunting these heroes and their experiences to the back pages of our national consciousness their stories are not just boys adventure tales writ large they are a kind of moral instruction they remind of something weve heard many times before but is worth repeating on a wartime memorial day when were uncertain about what we celebrate were the land of the free for one reason only were also the home of the brave mr collier wrote the text for "medal of honor portraits of valor beyond the call of duty" workman
