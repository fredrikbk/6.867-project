violating company ethics rules mounted a scathing counterattack on chief executive h lee scott jr and other top brass claiming they accepted sweetheart deals travel and concert tickets from suppliers and engaged in improper relationships claiming in a court filing that wal mart applies its conduct rules arbitrarily julie roehm accuses mr scott of among other things accepting "preferential prices" on boats and jewelry from financier irwin jacobs whose companies do everything from sell boats to wal mart to buy unsold goods from the retailer she contends that mr scotts relationship with mr jacobs goes "beyond a business relationship" and violates the corporations conflicts of interest guidelines wal mart dismissed the assertions made in a filing in u s district court in michigan as did mr jacobs while it remains to be seen whether any of ms roehms accusations will stick they represent yet another distraction for the worlds biggest retailer and its ceo mr scott wal mart has seen sales growth at its u s stores bog down amid increasing competition from other retailers and growing resistance to locating stores in urban areas wal mart also has stumbled in its efforts to attract upscale shoppers like those flocking to competitor target corp at a time when wal marts traditional blue collar customers are being hurt by high gasoline prices and other economic pressures the filing is the latest sally in a nasty battle that began after wal mart fired ms roehm in december in its own court filing in march wal mart accused ms roehm of having an improper romantic relationship with a subordinate accepting gifts from suppliers and misusing her company expense account now ms roehm is turning the tables it isnt clear how wal marts ethics rules might apply to the activities alleged by ms roehm its policy says its employees "must avoid conflicts of interest in supplier selection such as directing business to a supplier owned or managed by a relative or a friend " it also warns executives arent allowed to "have social or other relationships with suppliers if such relationship would create the appearance of impropriety or give the perception that business influence is being exerted " the policy also bars employees from soliciting jobs for relatives or friends in a telephone interview mr jacobs called the accusations of preferential treatment "totally outrageous" and without any substance he acknowledged a long friendship with mr scott the two are close enough that their families have vacationed together and mr jacobs attended the wedding of mr scotts daughter but he said there is no favoritism "they pay their way we pay our way " he said "ive frequently told mr scott its very difficult for me to go with him because he always picks up the check id like at some point to level up he wont allow that to happen " a wal mart spokesman said "this lawsuit is about julie roehm and her misconduct her court filing shows how weak her case is " he also said "the allegations of impropriety involving our ceo lee scott are untrue " ms roehm and former wal mart vice president sean womack were fired in december after the company accused them of violating its policies against fraternization and later claimed they had carried on an affair she sued wal mart arguing there was no valid reason for her dismissal and asking the court to award her unspecified damages lost pay stock options severance and bonus in march the bentonville ark company countersued and released details of what it said were a "series of messages" obtained by mr womacks wife and reports from unnamed co workers who described a torrid affair between him and ms roehm ms roehms salvo includes a fierce defense of her short tenure as senior vice president of marketing communications and challenges the companys portrayals of her in its counter suit she denied accepting gifts insisted suppliers were told to bill the company for any meals and while insisting she acted appropriately neither admitted nor denied some of the most salacious descriptions of her relationship with mr womack in addition ms roehm cited an excerpt from an affidavit by mr womacks wife shelley attesting that she had provided just one email to wal mart and that another ostensibly damning email didnt name ms roehm ms roehms filing alleges that mr scott personally benefited from his relationship with mr jacobs the chairman of boat supplier genmar holdings inc and owner of jacobs trading and flw tour two private companies with wal mart business relationships the two mens relationship began years before mr scott became ceo without identifying any specific instances ms roehm alleged the ceo obtained travel "a number of yachts" and "a large pink diamond" at preferential prices due to the relationship the wal mart spokesman declined to comment on specifics of the allegations mr jacobs said he has never sold mr scott a diamond or provided air travel he said he has suggested boat dealers to mr scott but was never involved in any sales ms roehm also alleged that wal mart looked the other way when senior executives conducted affairs with subordinates and allowed executives who owned retail stores to negotiate with subordinates on leases for those properties "many wal mart executives do not abide by wal marts alleged firm policy forbidding conflicts of interest " she said in the filing despite policies prohibiting conflicts of interest and the misuse of company assets "actions apparently speak louder than words at wal mart " her court filing says she cited the role of mr scotts son eric at jacobs trading the wal mart salvage supplier eric scott has worked for various companies owned by mr jacobs for several years several years ago he worked full time for a boat manufacturing unit of genmar and now works part time for a salvage company owned by mr jacobs he shares an office with jacobs trading near wal marts headquarters wal marts

said he saw an opportunity for "putting eric to work " noting his past experience as a wal mart employee buying merchandise from overseas manufacturers eric scott said in an earlier interview that he inquired about a job with mr jacobs who in turn put him in touch with a manager at genmar he also said he doesnt recall discussing the matter with his father "i dont remember there ever being a
