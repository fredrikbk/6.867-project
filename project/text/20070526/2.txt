an enemy of convenience jerry falwell could always draw a crowd and his funeral this week was no exception in death as in life he aroused strong feelings from all sides but conservatives will miss him a lot less than liberals although some press accounts have touted him as a major figure on the right his influence peaked decades ago he founded moral majority in a year later he claimed a good deal of credit for the election of ronald reagan while the mobilization of conservative christians did help the gop falwell overstated his own role he did attract a great deal of attention mostly unfavorable he could be smooth and articulate but he regularly lapsed into rhetorical overkill and factual inaccuracy during the campaign for instance he claimed to have had a heated exchange with president jimmy carter about gays on the white house staff a transcript revealed that no such exchange had ever taken place the name "moral majority" struck many americans as arrogant and self righteous as christian activist ralph reed once wrote "if you say youre moral youre saying others arent " polls showed that falwell himself lacked majority support in a nbc poll had an unfavorable impression of him compared with just with a favorable impression the rest did not know enough to have an opinion in gallup found unfavorable to favorable and the harris poll found that had negative feelings about his efforts to help president reagans reelection many republicans and conservative leaders regarded falwell as a liability during the race a democratic campaign aide told time "jerry falwell is a no risk whipping boy " ed rollins who ran president reagans re election campaign later agreed "jerry falwell no question is a very high negative " politicians also noticed that moral majority was mainly a direct mail operation and had never built much of a grassroots organization with ebbing support from the political world falwell quit as president of the group in it folded two years later since then the religious right has had a complex political history for a time the christian coalition loomed as a powerful successor and it eventually crumbled although conservative christians took up a key role in republican politics they were far from monolithic having a variety of leaders and viewpoints their activists came to see falwell as a small part of their heritage if they thought of him at all liberals however did not forget falwell as a political consultant once advised his fellow democrats "find your candidate a nasty enemy tell people they are threatened in some way its a cheap trick but the simplest " falwell obliged by continuing to supply fresh ammunition in for example he went wildly over the top by saying that god may have allowed the attacks as payback for the nations moral laxity accordingly his name remained a fixture in liberal speeches and fundraising letters long after his actual power had shrunk when he endorsed school choice and opposed abortion liberals cited his position as a reason for taking the other side when he supported samuel alitos nomination to the supreme court sen john kerry mentioned him and other conservatives in a floor speech "this right wing reaction can only mean one thing they know what kinds of opinions judge alito will issue in line with their extreme ideology " during his presidential race howard dean obsessed about falwell mr dean once told activists that they "have the power to take back this country so that the american flag doesnt belong any longer to john ashcroft and jerry falwell " on another occasion he said "dont you think jerry falwell reminds you a lot more of the pharisees than he does of the teachings of jesus " mr dean went on to head the democratic national committee and as late as last month falwells name was frequently appearing on the partys web site the most recent entries repeatedly attacked sen john mccain for delivering the commencement address at falwells liberty university these attacks had little substance mr mccain was merely making amends for a gratuitous insult against falwell during the campaign mr mccain did not attend falwells funeral neither did any other gop presidential candidate instead of karl rove purportedly falwells accomplice in the vast right wing conspiracy the white house sent an obscure aide in the wake of falwells death responsible liberals reacted with dignity and restraint said ralph neas head of people for the american way "we extend our condolences to rev jerry falwells family and friends he was an effective advocate for his vision of america a vision with which we strongly disagreed " on the other hand much of the liberal blogosphere was gleeful "praise god jerry falwell is dead " says one posting such comments are not only distasteful but politically obtuse over the last years mentioning the name "jerry falwell" probably raised far more money for the left than for the right mr pitney is a professor of politics at claremont mckenna college
