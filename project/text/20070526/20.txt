even blank spaces are famous on the sgt pepper album cover "masterpiece it was years ago today with sgt pepper the beatles indulged their whims and changed rock forever" by russ smith leisure &amp arts may there are few things in this world that i enjoy as much as reading the wall street journals "masterpiece anatomy of a classic" feature but certainly one of them is listening to the music of the beatles especially even after all these years the classic album known as "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band " therefore i was more than a little happy that this weekends "masterpiece" essay sang the praises of this album in celebration of the th anniversary of its release however the essay contained one factual error that this beatle fan had to address that is the inclusion of leo gorcey on the list of cultural icons who appeared on the albums cover the cover executed by peter blake whose talents had been recommended to the beatles by renowned gallery dealer robert fraser famously did not include mr gorcey although he did indeed appear in the final photograph for the cover his image was removed after he of all the living persons asked by the band to appear on the album cover requested a fee the only other figure whose image was removed was mohandas k gandhi this was done at the suggestion of the executives at emi who were still dealing with the fallout over john lennons remarks about the bands popularity as compared with that of jesus the spaces created by the removal of the images of mr gorcey and the mahatma can still be seen on the album cover the gorcey gap is between the varga girl and huntz hall in the upper right corner of the photograph and the gandhi gap is to the right of lewis carroll near the palm tree below t e lawrence and above diana dors also while mae west originally turned down the bands request to appear on the cover "why would i be in a lonely hearts club " she relented after brian epstein had the band members sign a personal letter to her asking her to reconsider just a little beatles trivia for you many thanks again for the excellent feature jim zinsmeister highland park n j i dont believe mr smiths article put the record into its proper context the beatles did not invent the "concept" album nor "psychedelia " "pepper" was a response to the genre an unusual move for the group who heretofore had led rock in new directions while it is brilliant in places it is an artifact of the times beatle albums "rubber soul" and "abbey road" still astonish and sound as if they were recorded today of course quibbling about which beatle album is best is like trying to rank picassos les demoiselles davignon and guernica mere mortals should not attempt to do so ken haltom slaughter beach del i too was years old when i first heard "sgt peppers lonely hearts club band " my reaction was the same as that of mr smith and his brother "the world has changed rock music will never be the same " the album by the beatles is so revered that dozens of "tribute" bands deck themselves out in "sgt pepper" suits and play clubs across the country last year i saw such bands in louisville ky las vegas and liverpool england demand for the magic and memories of "sgt pepper" lives on for fans both young and old long may that magic live jim patterson san francisco
