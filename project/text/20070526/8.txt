dumbfounded by the news mr turner helped put glass lewis on the map when he joined the firm as managing director of research after its founding in but when glass lewis executives agreed to sell the firm to xinhua finance ltd they neglected to tell him about it he too was upset mr turner according to people familiar with his thinking was concerned about possible conflicts since businesses within xinhua court the same corporate managers whom glass lewis might criticize another potentially troubling aspect xinhua once had ties to chinas communist party mr turner quit the person firm in recent days five months after the transaction closed citing the firms change of ownership in a resignation letter which was seen by the wall street journal about the same time in another high profile

business contacts mr weil was troubled by a number of things involving xinhua including what he saw as a lack of disclosure related to business ties among some xinhua executives and directors according to people familiar with his thinking xinhua has stated there were no disclosure issues katherine rabin glass lewiss chief executive says there was no discord over the xinhua deal at least among nonemployee shareholders except for mr levitt who is now connected to glass lewiss main competitor these shareholders she said "are pleased with the xinhua finance transaction and the process that led to the transaction and the conduct of the glass lewis management team with respect to it " still the departure of the high profile mr turner who at the sec gained a reputation as someone who demanded strict adherence to accounting and ethical standards has called into question glass lewiss credibility and its future mr turner gave the upstart glass lewis "immediate credibility in the marketplace" as it sought to take on institutional shareholder services inc or iss the established proxy advisory firm said joseph carcello director of research for the corporate governance center at the university of tennessee "lynn was the public face of glass lewis so with him leaving particularly under these circumstances i dont know what they have to offer its quite a blow to them " mr turners departure along with questions about xinhua may also make it tougher for glass lewis to hold itself out as the arbiter of good corporate behavior "glass lewis has catered to the real corporate activists and this kind of taint to that kind of customer is a real issue " said glen hellman president of proxy governance inc a smaller rival "what does it mean when mr turner cant stay there or keep his name associated with it " glass lewiss ms rabin said issues that have been raised about xinhua have nothing to do with "the operations of glass lewis nor the quality of its work or the integrity of our people " as for mr turners departure she added "glass lewis is not dependent on any one person even one as talented as lynn " clients such as the california public employees retirement system or calpers are still on board "i think its a case of were a customer of their services and were satisfied with the services and products weve received " said patricia macht assistant executive officer for public affairs at calpers she added that calpers has monitored the governance questions involving xinhua but otherwise "it isnt really something that were focused on " where mr turner goes from here is unclear people who have spoken with him say he plans to take the summer off some critics and even some friends have questioned mr turners decision to stick with glass lewis for five months even though he had privately objected to the deal with xinhua mr turner departed after selling stock in xinhua he received in exchange for glass lewis shares but it isnt known how much money he made mr turner told friends he stayed because he had work he wanted to wrap up mr turners next move will be closely watched given his prominence in accounting and corporate governance circles

investor advocate known for sometimes strident views mr turner was also willing to take his old profession to task he and mr levitt engaged in a lengthy battle with major accounting firms to curtail consulting services they could offer to audit clients which they believed posed conflicts mr turner also criticized companies for what appeared to be gaming of their numbers subsequent corporate scandals proved many of his concerns right after leaving the sec mr turner continued to wield significant influence playing a behind the scenes role people familiar with the matter say to help draft
