journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources counterfeiting technologies to spot fakes are short lived faced with a surge in counterfeit goods businesses are ramping up their use of sophisticated technologies aimed at spotting fakes but businessweek reports on how every advance has a short lifespan before crooks find new ways to cover their tracks companies world wide lose some &# billion annually to counterfeit products according to the international chamber of commerce and the toll is expected to double by few products are immune from imitators from luxury brands and pharmaceuticals to airplane parts and gasoline but these days businesses are leaving microscopic traces in those products marking gasoline with nanoparticles for example that can reveal whether the fuel is real or adulterated the use of these organic tracing compounds might not stop at petroleum products alcohol producers might one day put markers on wine and liquor another commonly faked product businesses are also dyeing goods with invisible dna markers attaching holograms and engraving products with microscopic laser etchings that investigators and
