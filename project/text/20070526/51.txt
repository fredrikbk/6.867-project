pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece reinventing the wheel the london eye is an engineering marvel with tourist appeal anatomy of a classic if ever proof were needed that an economic recession can be a fruitful thing consider the london eye the monumental "observation wheel" that overhangs the south bank of the thames close to the palace of westminster this architectural and engineering marvel emerged as a concept in the early s when there was relatively little conventional work for british architects which meant they had plenty of thinking time the difference is that its creators architects david marks and julia barfield followed through and years later in millennium year made it happen mr marks and ms barfield a husband and wife professional couple had pedigree having worked in the powerhouse high tech architecture studios of norman foster and richard rogers before setting up their own business in shortly after the british economy went into reverse and stayed that way for some years but in londons sunday times newspaper joined forces with the recently established architecture foundation to promote an ideas competition for millennium landmarks mr marks and ms barfield then both submitted a beautiful concept model of what looked like a new type of ferris wheel the judges i confess i was one of them and so was mr foster admired its elegant design and its ambitious scale but thought it was an old idea couldnt we do something more original for the millennium so the proposal indeed the whole competition got nowhere no winner was declared later the gigantic jellyfish of richard rogerss millennium dome downriver in greenwich emerged as the official london landmark for the year but as history has proved the better idea was right under our noses this is where mr marks and ms barfield showed their mettle undaunted they continued to refine their concept and to seek financial backing and a site it was a long hard struggle but by joining forces with british airways the project proved to be fundable the most elegant big wheel in the world standing feet high was only permitted right in the heart of historic london because it was intended to be a temporary structure with a life of only six years once it was up and london took it to its heart that period was extended indefinitely in that sense the london eye is like pariss eiffel tower the celebratory object that stayed around after the party architects may have conceived it not only mr marks and ms barfield but architect turned yacht designer nic bailey who came up with the oval air conditioned capsules but it needed fresh engineering thinking to get it built unlike old style ferris wheels where the cars hang inside the structure as it rotates here the pods are on the outside so as to obtain the best view their rotation is not dependent on gravity but on electric motors synchronized by computerized radio signals sent from the hub finally the whole wheel is hung from one side only so as to hover over the river this meant some nifty foundation work two separate forests of concrete piles one taking the eyes weight the other stopping it from toppling over sideways plunge feet into the ground the company now known as jacobs engineering was responsible as with all the best engineering structures building it became a public spectacle it was floated up the thames in segments on giant barges complete with the worlds largest floating cranes in attendance it was then assembled flat on pontoons in the river its giant central spindle was attached to the perimeter by a skein of steel cables the suspension bridge variety but acting like bicycle spokes and then came an unforgettable week as the whole wheel weighing tons without its capsules each a further tons was hauled slowly from the horizontal to an acute angle where it stayed leaning alarmingly for several days while the final work was done to bring it to its vertical position this was not easy and at one point a crane cable snapped and the project came to a worrying halt the banks of the thames were packed with spectators there was real concern that the structure was despite all the calculations just too heavy to lift but in the end the combination of techniques garnered from bridge and oil rig construction worked just as planned even more remarkably at a time when ambitious architectural projects funded by a national lottery were being built all over britain the london eye costing gbp million or about &# million at the time was entirely commercially funded today it is a must visit attraction in the british capital carrying an average of visitors a day each trip is one minute revolution it opened in late and immediately became exactly the iconic object that the millennium dome downstream had tried and failed to be that was perhaps unfair the dome was also a prodigious feat of engineering and architecture but in the end what decides these things is the public response and the public has always responded to a buccaneering spirit in engineering the idea that enormous risks are being taken that enormous reward is the prize but that total disaster is a looming possibility that in short is the achievement of mr marks and ms barfields london eye the process of making it was every bit as compelling as the ride on the finished product they are diffident people the way they tell it it was just a matter of a following b but they surely fall into the category of designer as hero and heroine in this sense they are in the tradition of the great th century british engineer isambard kingdom brunel who with his extraordinarily ambitious railways and steamships overcame obstacles with flair and style mr marks and ms barfield are of course much in demand these days if only more architects had ideas this good in their idle moments mr pearman is architecture critic of the sunday times london and editor of the riba journal
