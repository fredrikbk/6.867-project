pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings chicagos new dramaturgs the citys politicians are writing smoking out of the script chicago memo to itinerant actors the next time youre doing "a streetcar named desire" in chicago and the director tells you to enter from stage left with a can of beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other just say no otherwise you could get a ticket smoking in public has been illegal in chicago for the past year and a half and earlier this month the illinois house approved a statewide ban that gov rod blagojevich says he plans to sign but chicago actors have continued to smoke on stage in plays whose scripts call for their characters to do so now though the city councils buildings committee has ordered them to cut it out or pay a fine alderman burton f natarus asked his colleagues to exempt actors from the ordinance as some other cities with similar bans have done but his proposal was voted down by a to margin "its an adversity to people who come to see those plays and the stagehands " alderman ed smith told a reporter for the chicago sun times he thinks that local directors and producers should instead scissor references to smoking out of the plays they present what does the chicago theater community think of that suggestion not much to put it mildly "there are plenty of scenes where i cant imagine what youd do without smoking " says charles newell artistic director of the court theatre the university of chicagos much admired professional theater company "i mean how could you possibly do a noel coward play without it and we often use directors like joanne akalaitis who are aggressive even intentionally provocative about using smoking as a way of physicalizing the internal agitation of a character shes going to hit the roof when she hears about this of course well try to come up with creative ways to get around it but honestly i havent gone down that path yet because i dont want to believe thats what things have come to in chicago people are always knocking us as provincial as second city all the time banning smoking is just going to play into those stereotypes " mr newell is referring to a famous nickname coined by a j liebling in "chicago the second city " the book in which he mocked the windy citys pretensions to cultural distinction dismissing it as hopelessly inferior to new york on all counts "chicagoans with the price of airplane tickets do their theatregoing here in new york " liebling wrote "it is not considered smart to admit having seen any play in chicago because this implies either a that you havent seen the real play or b that you havent the airplane fare or c and possibly worst of all that you are indifferent to nuances and might therefore just as well go back to fond du lac wisconsin where you went to high school " lieblings sneers may have stung once upon a time but nowadays chicago is about as provincial as paris or london a city with companies like the court theatre and chicago shakespeare theater musical ensembles like the chicago symphony and the lyric opera museums like the art institute of chicago and buildings like frank lloyd wrights robie house and mies van der rohes crown hall need not take a back seat to anyplace else in the world alas charles newell is dead on the mark by preventing its artists from making art as they see fit the city council is exposing chicago to the contempt of those who rightly judge the civility of a community by the quality and integrity of its cultural life not only is onstage smoking as mr newell points out a widely used directorial technique but innumerable plays specifically require their characters to smoke to perform "streetcar" without cigarettes or "twelve angry men" without a smoke filled jury room is to insult the intelligence of audiences who come to see these well known plays expecting to see them performed as written this column isnt a backdoor apologia for the tobacco industry i dont smoke and dont like to be around those who do nor do i have any use for the specious argument that banning onstage smoking is a violation of the first amendment rights of actors directors and playwrights such a ban isnt unconstitutional but its stupid which is even worse it makes chicago look like a backwoods burg full of philistine pols with nothing better to do than mind other peoples business maybe thats what its become i read the other day that doug sohn the proprietor of hot dougs the best hot dog joint in the world got hit with a &# ticket for attempting to serve his customers a haute dog consisting of foie gras and duck sausage with truffle sauce in case you hadnt heard chicagos ever vigilant sensitivity fascists have also bullied the city council into outlawing the sale of pate de foie gras claiming that its manufacture constitutes cruel and unusual punishment to the innocent ducks out of whose livers that famously succulent foodstuff is made excuse me but since when did carl sandburgs city of the big shoulders turn into nannytown u s a as for those chicagoans who dont care to have their nostrils brutalized by the smell of a lone cigarette burning halfway across a crowded theater they have an inalienable right of their own the right to head for the nearest exit i urge them to exercise it and leave the actors to go about their stage business undisturbed mr teachout the journals drama
