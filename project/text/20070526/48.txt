fit in early one friday afternoon about years ago wendy baker then a senior vice president at the insurance company continental was leaving her office when she ran into another female executive "where is everyone " ms baker asked many of the companys executive men were off at a golf outing "were the ones in charge here why arent we out there " ms baker said almost immediately she recalls she began taking golf lessons and soon she and a group of friends were playing socially on a weekly basis within two years she had developed enough talent to feel comfortable using golf in her business dealings today ms baker is president of lloyds america the u s arm of the british insurance syndicate and a respectable handicap golfer in a sense business golf is a collusion that has developed over the years

males closing deals at exclusive country clubs those who play a lot of business golf say the reality is much more subtle they say the sports primary value is to get away from an office environment to network and build relationships in the hopes of doing deals down the road "i dont think ive ever made the ask for &# million on the ninth green or anything like that that would be pretty gauche " says donna shalala a longtime golfer who was in the clinton cabinet and is now president of the university of miami "but i have certainly developed relationships on the course that have led to raising a lot of money for the university " executives are also putting more thought into how to play and whom to play with business foursomes are now more diverse with something women and middle managers
