pursuits food &amp drink seafood an uncommon salmon cooking the fish connoisseurs crave with a top chef first catch of a four week season ive cooked plenty of fish but today my hands nearly tremble as i try to cut into a &# a pound fillet of copper river king salmon from south central alaska its from the seasons first major supply of fresh wild salmon and one of the most expensive exclusive and hyped fish on earth my instructor is chef tom colicchio owner of acclaimed restaurants in new york and elsewhere and head judge on bravos "top chef" television show mr colicchio is known for letting pristine ingredients flavors come through he appears slightly annoyed at sharing his kitchen with an amateur i fumble his instructions to cut the salmon "without pushing down on the flesh " so he takes over and slices effortlessly "this is good fish " he murmurs as he handles the bright orange flesh stoking my fear of ruining it even among luxurious ingredients the copper river king aka chinook comes with a unique set of bragging rights along with its slightly less coveted cousin the copper river sockeye its the first major variety of wild salmon to come to market each year its season which began may lasts just about a month with lots of flavorful fats many connoisseurs consider it the worlds best salmon just getting your hands on some of the seasons first catches is a coup my seattle fishmonger pure food fish had a waiting list of customers wanting first dibs the price the morning after the first fish were caught was &# a pound it dropped &# later that day when another planeload came in mr colicchio bids me to sniff and caress an pounder he obtained from his own supplier in order to observe how firm and resilient it is "what does it smell like " he asks when i answer correctly "sea water " i feel we bond a little over fish appreciation to best show off the salmons taste mr colicchio recommends a simple approach using a steel saute pan sear one side flip add butter and baste the fish nonstop by spooning the butter back over the top its a method that works well for any fish mr colicchio says and can be used with chicken or steak too the irony according to mr colicchio is that most people who engage in the sport of tracking down this prize mess up their endgame by choosing the thicker part of the fillet over the thinner sloping portion "this is better " he says pointing to abundant lines of white fat that make it like well marbled beef extra succulent to me salmon usually makes for good but not ecstatic eating i explain this to mr colicchio "hopefully this will change your mind " he says as he begins to add chunks of softened butter to the pan using a spoon he tilts the pan towards him and starts cascading burbling butter over the now golden fish its a lot of butter but mr colicchio says that even with heavily marbled meat or fish the outside will dry during the cooking process unless lubricated with fat today were paying homage to this springtime delicacy by garnishing it with seasonal vegetables asparagus peas rhubarb chanterelle mushrooms and ramps some of which the chef blanches in salted boiling water he ladles a quarter cup of this flavorful water into a saucepan to which he adds more chunks of butter and swirls them together "im making an emulsion this is our sauce " he says allowing me to try my hand at swirling as i breathe in the kitchens haze of intoxicating briny butter smell when the commercial fishing season opened where the copper river empties into the gulf of alaska my king was making his way toward the rivers treacherous mile course of chilly rapids the fish must traverse like a heat of hurdle jumpers to survive the journey it packed on unusual amounts of fat the good tasting omega rich variety it was ensnared in a gill net sometime between a m and p m on that monday and then bled from an artery and immediately chilled on board the fishing vessel that kind of careful handling is part of the mystique of the copper river king a fish as pampered managed and marketed as a hollywood starlet by that evening my salmon had been sold off to one of the big seafood processors in cordova alaska then loaded onto an alaska airlines carrying over pounds of copper river king sol amon the owner of pure food fish had a man waiting at the seattle airport for several hundred pounds which were immediately filleted divvied up and sold to the customers on the waiting list twenty five years ago this all would have sounded like a fish tale to the copper river fishermen who were selling their catch to canneries for about &# a pound then a former fisherman named jon rowley sat in a seattle bar with a bunch of cordova fishermen in town for a trade show and tried to convince them that he could sell their special salmon to restaurants for big bucks they would have to gut them bleed them and chill them on board their vessels he told them turning off the majority but by one of the fishermen got into business with mr rowley who created a seattle food trend out of copper river king and went on to spend years promoting it around the country these efforts captured the imagination of chefs as far flung as mr colicchio who serves the fish at his flagship craft restaurants in new york and dallas before i can again insert myself into the process mr colicchio has nearly completed assembly of our dish he bastes the fillet with butter emulsion and adds slices of rhubarb and chanterelle mushrooms the blanched vegetables and a shaving of lemon peel he plates it artfully garnishes with minced chives and hands me a fork i spear a chunk of salmon from the thicker part of the fillet dripping with the butter emulsion sauce its tasty but mirrors my experience with most salmon good eating though nothing revelatory i look at the chef forlorn "eat here " he says gesturing with his fork to that thinner belly part he told me about and from which he is eating i take a bite and there it is rich velvety tender and so moist it seems to be spurting juice like no salmon i ever tasted before im planning to brag shopping list from the market  ounce salmon fillets  lb asparagus  stalk rhubarb
