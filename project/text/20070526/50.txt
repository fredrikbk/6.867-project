pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations slow down and absorb why do people want to come here same reasons as a hundred years ago for a job for opportunity to rise to be in a place where one generation you can be a bathroom attendant at a brooklyn store and the next your boy can be the star of "ted macks amateur hour " with everyone in the neighborhood listening on the radio or today "american idol " with everyone watching and a million dollar contract in the wings to be in a place of weird magic where the lightning strikes boom you got the job in the restaurant crack now youre the manager boom youve got a mortgage you have a home "never confuse movement with action " said ernest hemingway but america gives you both what an awake place and what a tortured and self torturing one your own family will be embarrassed by you if you dont rise if you fall if you fail and the country itself is never perfect enough for its countrymen were on a constant puritan self healing mission a constant search and destroy mission for our nations blemishes racism sexism ethnocentrism out damn spots i asked myself a question this week and realized the answer is "only one " the question is have i ever known an immigrant to america whos lazy i have lived on the east coast all my life mostly in new york and immigrants both legal and illegal have been and are part of my daily life from my childhood when they surrounded me to an adulthood in which they well surround me and the only lazy one i knew was a young woman european not mature enough to be fully herself who actually wanted to be a good worker but found nightlife too alluring and hangovers too debilitating but she was the only one and i think she went home everyone else who comes here works hard grindingly hard and i admire them but its more than that i love them and im rooting for them when i see them in church it is filipino women who taught me the right posture for prayer central americans helped teach me the bible i want to kiss their hands i want to say "thank you " they have enriched my life and our countrys naturally i hope the new immigration bill fails it is less a bill than a big dirty ball of mischief malfeasance and mendacity with a touch of class malice and its being pushed by a white house that is at once cynical and inept the bills capitol hill supporters have a great vain popinjays pride in their own higher compassion they are inclusive and youre not you cur you gun totin truckdrivers hat wearin yahoo its all so complex and youd understand this if you werent sort of dumb but its not so complex the past quarter century an unprecedented wave of illegal immigrants has crossed our borders the flood is so great that no one no one can see or fully imagine all the many implications all the country changing facts of it no one knows exactly what uncontrolled immigration is doing and will do to our country so what should we do we should stop slow down and absorb we should sit and settle we should do what you do after eating an eight course meal we should digest what weve eaten we should close our borders we should do whatever it takes to close them tight and solid will that take the army then send the army does it mean building a wall then build a wall but the wall must have doors which can be opened a little or a lot down the road once we know where we are should all legal immigration stop no we should make a list of what our nation needs such as engineers and nurses and then admit a lot of engineers and nurses we should take in what we need to survive and flourish as we end illegal immigration we should set ourselves to the americanization of the immigrants we have they havent only joined a place of riches its a place of meaning we must teach them what it is theyve joined and why it is good and what is expected of them and what is owed we stopped americanizing ourselves years ago weve got to start telling the story of our country again as to the eight or or or million illegals who are here how interesting that our government doesnt know the number we should do nothing dramatic or fraught or unlike us we should debate what to do at length debate isnt bad theres a lot to say we can all join in we should do nothing extreme only things that are commonsensical here is the truth america has never deported millions of people and america will never deport millions of people its not what we do its not who we are its not who we want to be the american people would never accept evening news pictures of sobbing immigrants being torn from their homes and put on a bus we wouldnt accept it because we have hearts and as much as we try to see history in the abstract we know history comes down to the particular to the sobbing child in the bus we dont round up and remove nor should we tomorrow on one of our whims grant full legal status and a cadillac car we take it a day at a time we wait and see whats happening we do the small discrete things a nation can do to make the overall situation better for instance "you commit a violent crime you are so out of here " and "here let me help you learn english " lets take time and find out if the immigrants who are here see their wages click up and new benefits kick in as the endless pool stops expanding it would be good to see them gain lets find out if its true that americans wont stoop to any of the jobs illegals do i dont think it is years ago i worked in a florist shop removing the thorns from roses it was painful work and i was happy to do it and i am very american i was a badly paid waitress in the holiday inn on route in new jersey the young will do a great deal and not only the young the dislike for americans evinced by the americans wont do hard work crowd is simply astonishing and shameful it says more about the soft and ignorant lives they lived in kennebunkport and greenwich than it does about the american people digest absorb teach settle in settle down protect our country
