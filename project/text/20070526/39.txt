politics &amp economics ceo leads swiss backlash over executive pay in switzerland long a haven for big money a backlash is developing against outsized executive compensation the push is being spurred by an unlikely source a ceo thomas minder a year old chief executive of small cosmetics manufacturer trybol ag is going to shareholder meetings at swiss giants like novartis sa to challenge their ceo pay packages mr minder has been collecting signatures to call a national vote as permitted under the swiss constitution to amend swiss law to force more transparency and accountability on executive compensation he says his goal is to create ways for shareholders to veto pay packages and create more "sensible" pay practices in switzerland a country where wealth has traditionally been welcomed rather than frowned upon across europe growing disenchantment with high executive pay is increasingly a political issue in france the losing candidate for the presidency segolene royal called on airbus to withdraw its proposed job cuts after it disclosed that noel forgeard former chief executive of airbus and its parent european aeronautic defence &amp space co received million euros &# million in an exit pay package the company said the package was provided for in his contract but ms royal called the payment a "scandal " in germany finance minister peer steinbruck has said europes social model couldnt be sustained if the wages of low earners fall as company profits rise switzerland is set to introduce greater disclosure of executive compensation for companies listed on the swiss exchange starting next year companies must disclose the salaries of the highest paid member of the management board previously swiss companies released only the total salaries of the combined management board and the individual salary of the highest paid member of the supervisory board which is akin to a u s board of directors and the swiss government is considering further amendments to laws governing public companies aimed at improving corporate governance practices some of the companies that will be affected by any new rules include engineering and industrial concern abb ltd food maker nestle sa drug giant novartis and banks ubs ag and credit suisse group current law allows swiss companies to disclose less detail on executive pay than u s companies they arent required to disclose individual pay packages for chief executives and often dont have to mention benefits such as personal loans or housing allowances the governments efforts on further pay disclosure dont go far enough for mr minder however he wants to introduce a law that allows shareholders to block pay packages among other measures mr minder says he pays himself "far less" than swiss francs or about &# a year and took on his campaign because pay levels are so high that "executives dont suffer personal financial hardship even if their performance at the helm of the company is miserable " "we need to bring this relationship between pay and performance back into line " mr minder says among his proposals giving shareholders the right to block or approve pay packages a complete ban on "golden parachutes " or pay packages given to executives upon leaving a company and measures that would force institutional shareholders to disclose how they voted on issues such as approving bonuses in setting pay companies also should consider factors such as customer satisfaction and staff morale he says mr minder says he follows his own recommendations in setting his compensation he owns the company and he sets his pay considering factors including the companys revenue and the views of customers and its employees many large multinationals based in switzerland already voluntarily disclose more information than required by law about executive compensation in line with their international rivals the more detailed disclosures at nestle and novartis for example often draw public criticism at home at novartiss annual shareholders meeting in early march mr minder questioned the size of chief executive daniel vasellas pay package mr minder pointed out that the novartis ceos pay rose to about million francs &# million last year from about two million francs in while mr vasellas pay package wasnt put to a shareholder vote the company said his golden parachute the equivalent of five years salary wont be renewed when the ceos contract expires in novartis spokesman john gilardi said the decision to end the award of the golden parachute was a mutual decision made between mr vasella and the remuneration committee and is "completely unrelated to anything mr minder has done " mr gilardi said the value of mr vasellas package last year represented the cumulative value of share grants over a number of years more than of mr vasellas compensation is linked to performance related variables such as stock price the spokesman added novartis declined to comment on mr vasellas salary in saying the company hadnt then adopted the policy of disclosing the chairmans salary novartis said it needs to pay salaries that are competitive globally to attract the best scientists the average novartis employees salary rise has outpaced the swiss average he said spokespeople for ubs credit suisse and nestle declined to comment on mr minders cause they said their compensation practices reflected international standards and were necessary to attract global talent to their companies if mr minder collects signatures his proposals will be put to the swiss parliament and federal councilors they can come up with a counterproposal or allow a popular vote on mr minders proposals thanks to the swiss tradition of direct democracy mr minder has until may to hand in the signatures and he says he is "very well on track " without being specific a national vote may not follow for at least a year while the chances of success for a popular vote known as a plebiscite are very slim the move to force a vote makes the issue part of the mainstream political agenda said wolf linder a professor of politics at the university of berne "many political ideas have been brought to a vote by means of popular initiatives and often against the firm conviction of almost all political elites " he said
