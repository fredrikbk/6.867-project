politics &amp economics iowa enjoys bountiful campaign spending harvest how candidates early tilling for benefits small business owners des moines iowa ross reardon the general sales manager for who tv says his station has never taken presidential campaign ads earlier than june in the year before an election this year before memorial day the local nbc affiliate owned by local tv llc of cincinnati had already run spots from three democrats and one republican ron hoyt owner of carter printing has seen enough pick up in leaflet demand to pay for the costs of expanding his business buying his first machine to automatically address envelopes the landmark hotel fort des moines meanwhile took in a total of &# from six campaigns in the first three months of the year according to candidate spending reports filed with the federal election commission nearly triple its haul from the presidential field during the same period four years ago the supersize superexpensive superearly presidential campaign is fueling a bit of an economic boom here at least among the niche industries that cater to candidates their staffs and the crowds they are attracting besides offering a measure of the stepped up pace of the current race the flood of money and attention helps explain why iowa new hampshire and other small states have clung so tightly to their spots at the front of the primary line it isnt just the influence they gain in shaping the contests to choose the parties candidates that matters the campaigns need to make a good showing in these states translates into lots of spending that contributes to local economies several factors are feeding the current spending spree for the first time since and the first time since the first in the nation iowa caucuses became a force after the election both parties have wide open races so a dozen or so candidates are building some kind of iowa presence compared with half as many four years ago and this campaign is on track to break all spending records candidates in the first quarter spent &# million nationally compared with &# million in the same period during the previous presidential cycle this memorial day weekend alone seven candidates including all three democratic front runners will crisscross the state holding public events there are also quirks in this particular candidate crop vendors say that are feeding big spending the rock star quality of the field particularly sen barack obama d ill sen hillary rodham clinton d n y and republican rudy giuliani the former new york city mayor mean that routine events and crowds tend to be bigger than normal one day earlier this month former north carolina sen john edwards who has his own star power after having been the democrats vice presidential nominee in held a town hall meeting on womens issues at the des moines central library mark martens manager of the iowa branch of s e c t theater supplies inc was there two hours before the opening of the event helping to set up four large speakers several lights a podium size mixing console a multiple output box a small carefully aimed speaker so the candidate could hear questions all along with a corresponding jumble of wires this time four years ago "we wouldnt have been involved " mr martens said "in a normal cycle this would be a coffee shop event " which wouldnt require his services he added so far this year mr martens estimates he has worked with five candidates republican and democratic setting up around events while vendors appreciate the new business not all events are lucrative after costs a good profit from a midsize event like the edwards town hall gathering is only &# mr martens said but the smaller events establish the vendors reliability with the campaigns and ensure they get work when the candidates come back for better paying large rallies denise essman who runs an advertising company and a market research company has already conducted political research projects for democratic and republican candidates as a subcontractor to other research companies essman research conducts focus groups in depth interviews telephone surveys and polls for the campaigns while some of the early political work centered on the candidate debates ms essman says she has also started testing different issue positions with the local population ultimately some of those positions may end up on mailings or leaflets made a mile and a half down des moines grand avenue at carter printing "between now and the caucuses well probably be looking at of each months business " says carters owner mr hoyt and that is from dealing only with half of the candidates as a union shop carter only works with democrats the orders started coming around the same time they always do mr hoyt said but this year they have been larger and more urgent he usually doesnt see the kind of orders he is now receiving until well into the summer evidence of political work past and present are scattered throughout mr hoyts office with position papers for new mexico gov bill richardsons campaign waiting to be processed a few feet away from a showcase containing buttons from gary hart michael dukakis and john kerry the new addressing machine mr hoyt recently bought means he no longer has to subcontract large political mailings the machine may also ensure the mailings go out when his previous subcontractors are flooded with political mail while the business boost is helpful some event vendors worry the campaigns short notice swoops through iowa could put them in a pinch "were all kind of afraid the candidates will hit here in june when were already all superbusy" with celebrations weddings and festivals said brian decoster owner of big ten rentals in iowa city mr decosters company rents and installs equipment for a variety of events from podiums tents and generators to inflatable bouncy castles and a mobile virtual reality system in cedar rapids the audio visual company sound concepts inc sees a similar hectic short notice schedule with campaigns calling to stage events just days in advance most of the major campaigns for both parties have worked with sound concepts and owner marvin smejkal has noticed this cycles difference both in amount of work and level of strain despite the stress mr smejkal says the events can be fun if exhausting after a long night of work "youll hear people at a mcdonalds after youve gotten an hour worth of sleep talking about where the motorcades coming from the secret service all sorts of things " he said "we get a kick of hearing people talking about what we were involved in " the vendors tend to be nonpartisan and proud of the prominence of their work regardless of the party mr decoster mixes in with his offices collection of colorful items a gold painted pair of scissors a funhouse mirror and several fake palm trees an assortment of campaign photos and memorabilia he says people often ask "why do you have a picture of dick cheney on your desk " referring to a shot of the vice president talking to local crowd "well thats our microphone" in the photo he replies
