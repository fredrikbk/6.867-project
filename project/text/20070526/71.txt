the week ahead our take on coming events wal mart retailers riddle grow or invest by kris hudson amid the festivities at wal mart stores inc s annual shareholders meeting on friday analysts and investors plan to press for answers on a seminal concern how soon will the retailer significantly curtail its u s growth to focus more resources on its faltering base of existing stores it is a question that wal mart has faced repeatedly as a maturing retailer but pressure on wal mart to act dramatically on the issue is intensifying wal mart bentonville ark earlier this month posted its worst quarter in years notching anemic sales gains amid a fall in return on invested capital its share price in the doldrums for years has declined in the past year thus several spoilsports from wall street intend to broach the weighty issue of spending vs returns during the raucous daylong rally better known for cheerleading by executives flag waving by foreign delegations and surprise performances by hollywood actors or recording stars the meeting "should provide important incremental insight on how management proceeds with capital spending targets " william blair &amp co analyst mark miller wrote in a may note distributed to his firms clients "our belief is that wal mart management will acknowledge a broader i e lower range of square footage growth possibilities " other issues that could come up at the meeting include this weeks accusations by a fired former executive of violations of the company ethics policy by senior executives including chief executive h lee scott jr regarding expansion many analysts argue wal mart should acknowledge it has nearly saturated the u s market and curb its aggressive capital spending they would rather it spent more on share buybacks and focus on bolstering the u s stores it already operates many of those older stores are hamstrung by long checkout lines at peak hours cluttered merchandise and an inability to entice the clientele of higher end target corp wal mart intended to shell out about &# billion this year for capital projects an increase of from last year if it hits that forecast most of that will go to building million square feet of new and expanded stores some observers want to see wal marts square footage growth closely linked to capital spending cut dramatically for example bear stearns &amp co analyst christine augustine wants to see a square footage growth rate in the u s of just to from wal mart for next year down from a projected for this year such a pullback would free up billions of dollars for share buybacks or reinvesting in existing stores most analysts dont expect wal mart will go that far during its june meeting but they anticipate the retailer might divulge a hint as to its plans money candidates fund raising stakes grow by jackie calmes round two of the presidential candidates money primary is nearly two thirds over and the stakes for the second quarter fund raising like the dollar amounts keep getting higher that is especially true for republican sen john mccain last quarters loser with congress in recess this coming week he and the democratic senators who juggle legislating and presidential campaigning can stump full time just as those currently out of a job do routinely think republicans mitt romney and rudy giuliani on tap for all are private events and phone time to shake the money trees before the june second quarter deadline sen mccain hasnt waited for congress to break he has simply skipped votes in order to stay on the road focusing on fund raising far more than he did last winter to avoid a repeat of the first quarter then the arizonans &# million put him third behind former massachusetts gov romneys &# million and former new york mayor giulianis nearly &# million spawning questions about the strength of the mccain campaign his goal is about &# million supporters say mr romneys challenge is to maintain the donor support that earned him a second look in april after earlier bad polls and press had deflated his candidacy many republican givers are sitting on their wallets reflecting party dissatisfaction with the field a business week analysis found more than of president bushs big donors his "pioneers" and "rangers" havent contributed to anyone like most candidates mr romneys initial donors indicated he had picked the low hanging fruit of personal and political family members including many fellow mormons typically strategists say contributions fall off in the second quarter as much as apparently mr romney is parlaying his initial success and favorable reviews after two recent republican debates into more cash longtime party fund raiser ted welch says he easily collected more than &# with a soiree at his nashville tenn home on short notice the recent attention to mr romney including a time magazine cover "certainly helped " mr welch says "even though the magazine article itself wasnt very good at all " baseball fanatic mr giuliani has named supporters under years old to a team of "sluggers " "all stars" and "mvps" competing to raise as much as &# million for the title of "all american team captain " among the players donald trump jr on the democratic side sen hillary clinton is under pressure though not as much as mr mccain after being surprised in the first quarter by upstart rival sen barack obama each raised more than &# million but nearly &# million of mrs clintons total was from supporters who "maxed out" by giving additional funds that can be spent only for the general election if she is the nominee sen clinton has been trying to broaden her support to younger voters two coming events will feature pop star christina aguilera but the younger crowd has been drawn to the year old sen obama running as the fresh faced candidate of change "he represents a movement and shes just a candidate " says an unaffiliated democratic strategist executive pay next skirmish is at unitedhealth by scott thurm executive compensation will be back in the spotlight tuesday at the annual meeting of unitedhealth group inc shareholders will consider proposals to tie executive pay more closely to corporate performance to curb special retirement benefits and to give themselves an annual advisory vote on executive pay deals the health insurer is in investors sights after acknowledging that it backdated stock options to enrich executives prompting last years resignation of chief executive william mcguire similar shareholder measures failed to win majority support thursday at home depot inc which has also faced questions about compensation a "say on pay" resolution for an annual advisory vote was backed by of shares voted thats also the average level of support for similar measures at companies that have announced results this year according to institutional shareholder services the measures have won majority support so far at just two companies verizon communications inc and blockbuster inc defenders of the status quo might be encouraged by those results in electoral politics is a resounding defeat but corporate politics isnt played by the same rules first off is considered a strong showing for a new corporate governance proposal the advisory vote idea modeled on requirements in countries such as britain and australia first surfaced at u s annual meetings last year roughly of the shares voted at seven companies last year supported the concept this year both the number of companies confronting the issue and the level of support are up that makes the say on pay movement resemble another governance trend requiring unopposed directors to win a majority of votes cast to be elected rather than a plurality just three years after it first surfaced majority voting is now the rule at roughly of the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index according to claudia allen of neal gerber &amp eisenberg llp heres another reason may understate the demand for change isss patrick mcgurn says several of his clients institutional investors such as pension funds and mutual funds have told him that they consider the resolutions too weak they prefer to pressure directors directly by withholding votes for their re election that tactic contributed to the departures of former home depot ceo robert nardelli and pfizer inc ceo henry mckinnell finally consider the action in a more important arena congress a bill that would require annual advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation passed the house last month by a veto proof margin senate approval is hardly certain the white house threatens a veto and business groups oppose the measure thomas lehner policy director for the business roundtable says the law would paint all companies with a single brush requiring an advisory vote "even where pay has never been an issue " as a practical matter he says it would be hard for directors to interpret an up or down "no" vote on a compensation plan and make changes but supporters view the house republican votes in favor of the measure as an indication of the political winds home depots new ceo frank blake put it this way for his shareholders on thursday "were seeing a kind of societal shift around what shareholders are willing to pay their ceos " he said
