cross country union man raleigh n c presidential hopeful john edwards is fond of telling us that hes the son of a mill worker and although he now lives in a mansion and sports expensive haircuts he also has another thing in common with some wage earners hes betting his future employment on the power of organized labor but is this a safe bet in tar heel n c where organized labor is trying to unionize the largest meat processing plant in the world that is a pressing question and its one that even paula deen a popular host of a down home cooking show on food network may have to answer smithfield foods slaughters more than hogs a day in tar heel employs some people and pays competitive wages especially for the rural south but the united food and commercial workers union wants to organize the plant anyway arguing that it will protect workers so far smithfield workers arent going along they have voted against forming a union twice and would likely do so again if another secret ballot election is held undeterred union supporters have protested at one of ms deens book signings demanding that she cut ties to smithfield the union also wants to dispense with elections and unionize the plant through a controversial process called "card check" which merely requires gathering signatures from a majority of workers this is where mr edwards enters the fray he supports the union in its fight against smithfield and he supports legislation under consideration in congress that would make it easier to use the card check instead of an election mr edwards also recently sent a letter to smithfield ceo larry pope demanding that he "protect the right of workers" to bargain collectively he wants mr pope to support the card check this his support for dispensing with secret ballot elections in the name of workers rights makes mr edwards one of the most pro union presidential candidates in a long time and it is a departure from who he was when he was elected to the senate in as a southern centrist that reputation led then vice president al gore to consider tapping him as a running mate in and it was one reason why john kerry put him on the ticket in over the past three years mr edwards has moved sharply to the left indeed he has lashed himself to the mast of organized labor and steered hard to port his bet is that service worker unions will propel him to a surprise victory in the early nevada presidential caucus giving him a shot at beating the better financed campaigns of hillary clinton and barack obama he also feels that he has found an underserved constituency people displaced by the new economy and he is on to something outside of edge cities and burgeoning metro areas the painful churning in the economy is easy to spot think boarded up textile mills granted this isnt the image north carolina has as a prototypical new south state the banking capital of charlotte and the knowledge worker mecca of the research triangle are more familiar symbols but north carolina used to have one of the nations highest rates of employment and economic production in manufacturing which offered good pay and stable employment for people with relatively little education over the past decade however there was a big change manufacturing made up just of north carolinas gross state product in down from in nationally manufacturings share of economic output only fell half as much from to during that time notwithstanding solid growth in charlotte and other areas north carolina has trailed the nation in most measures of economic performance since the mid s many north carolinians still work in small industrial cities and rural counties but for the most part theyve had to be retrained at great effort and havent yet replaced their former incomes recognizing public trepidation about these events mr edwards and the labor movement lay blame on the north american free trade agreement other free trade pacts and the decline of unionization but international trade didnt start with nafta nor did the downward trend in manufacturing many textile executives in this state even supported nafta hoping to join with lower cost factories south of the border and thereby compete with asia producers the problem is that the chinese and others are now making better quality products than they used to american consumers are getting more for their money the union response has been to push for higher wages and to oppose moving or laying off workers that has made it harder to keep manufacturing jobs consider the textile giant pillowtex which was once a fixture in cabarrus county under the name fieldcrest cannon in the late s it was unionized by the union of needletrades industrial and textile employees unite in the company emerged from bankruptcy and sought partners to complete a turnaround and keep at least some of its domestic production one was springs industries in south carolina but unite helped scuttle the springs deal in april fearing the loss of its newly won foothold at pillowtex a few months later pillowtex closed its cabarrus county mill leaving the union nothing left to stand on it turns out that exercising political power through a union isnt a substitute for innovation retraining and other steps necessary to make economies competitive look at the numbers from to the states with the highest rates of union membership which include california new york and michigan among others had slower growth than the bottom states north carolina is among just five states with union membership rates below but it also has a predilection for raising taxes the tax foundation estimated this year it that it has the th heaviest tax burden in the country up from th in further unionizing the workforce will likely only make the state look more like the old northeast and rustbelt than the new south as mr edwards urges private sector unionization as the best way to protect middle class jobs he can only hope that unions are better at fulfilling electoral promises than economic ones mr hood president of the john locke foundation is the author of "selling the dream" praeger publishers
