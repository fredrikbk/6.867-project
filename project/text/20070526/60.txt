remembrances harold bud froehlich in workshop of wheaties makers engineer crafted a novel undersea vessel harold froehlichs "alvin" is as durable as general mills inc s more famous wheaties and cheerios crawling along the ocean floor the three person submersible invented by mr froehlich at general mills has made breakthroughs in understanding seabed biology sifted through the wreckage of the titanic even recovered a lost hydrogen bomb although virtually every component has been upgraded since it was commissioned in mr froehlichs basic design remains intact and is being incorporated in more advanced submersibles still on the drawing board "its a wonderful tool for recruiting new generations of scientists " says christopher german chief scientist for deep submergence at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts mr froehlich a general mills engineer who died may at age in a minneapolis suburb studied wind currents before turning to ocean currents after service aboard navy tankers during world war ii and a stint as a boeing co aeronautical engineer in he was hired by general mills in his hometown of minneapolis the large engineering staff at the grain milling company better known for its cereals worked on a navy torpedo and gun parts during the war and then took on a variety of navy projects as a defense contractor mr froehlich designed giant balloons that ascended to the stratosphere with remote sensing instruments to spy behind the iron curtain according to the book "water baby the story of alvin " but there was a problem unlike later surveillance satellites the balloons flew in often unpredictable paths as a member of a two man experimental flight crew in mr froehlich made an unscheduled landing in a linden n j backyard other general mills balloons made unscheduled landings in iowa montana new mexico and wisconsin according to news reports at the time mr froehlich held patents on a number of balloon innovations in he was named head of general mills nuclear equipment department which designed mechanical arms for use in reactors another use for the arms was in submersibles after hearing that the navy was in the market for a new deep water craft mr froehlich persuaded general mills to let him design it his unconventional submersible which he named the seapup had a foot inch steel sphere cockpit that could double as a detachable escape pod in an emergency he took some lessons from balloon work he told the minneapolis star tribune in "the same basic engineering principle is used to control both ballast " mr froehlich oversaw the building of what became alvin named for woods hole researcher allyn vine and not the cartoon chipmunk contrary to a persistent story the submersible was conceived in the minneapolis workshop where general mills built the equipment for making cereal more than miles from the nearest ocean "the bureau of ships was skeptical about a wheaties company designing a submarine " mr froehlich told minnesota public radio in yet with his small maneuverable design general mills beat out several other defense contractors its spherical cockpit fitted with plexiglass windows inches thick was subjected to pressures found at feet below the ocean surface alvin was delivered to woods hole in and mr froehlich participated in one of the early test dives "to the great depth of feet " he told a general mills newsletter in the submersible soon began making news in it recovered a hydrogen bomb that had fallen from a u s air force bomber off the coast of spain in the mid s it discovered foot long red tube worms that derived their energy from sulfur rich deep sea vents in oceanographer robert ballard landed the submersible on the floor of the north atlantic just behind the stern of the rms titanic and videotaped the wreckage in exquisite detail at one point mr ballard used alvins arm to twist the brass handle on the ships safe but it refused to budge although mr froehlichs involvement with alvin ended shortly after its commissioning his design still stands out after more than dives one feature that woods holes mr german particularly likes the spherical three person cockpit that allows alvin to carry two scientists and a pilot in the early s a titanium hull was added that allows alvin to attain depths of feet among other renovations over the years a larger deeper diving replacement planned for launch around will retain mr froehlichs basic design according to mr german general mills sold its mechanical division in and today alvin is owned by the navy and operated by woods hole mr froehlich went to work for programmed and remote systems corp a general mills spinoff that produced robotic arms he later worked on electric generators for ocean buoys and at m co became a pioneer in the development of surgical staple technology he liked to demonstrate the stapler on himself says his son steven froehlich "hed come home and hed have staples up and down his arms and on his stomach " in recent years he collaborated with steven also an engineer on designs to heat greenhouses with organic waste products he retained affection for alvin and visited woods hole in recent years to check on its various upgrades "my only regret " he told the minneapolis star tribune in "is that alvin had to leave minnesota " frank william gay guided businesses for howard hughes frank william gay was for decades the leader of a coterie of mormons who surrounded howard hughes doing his confidential business and insulating the billionaire from the outside world starting in as a fresh faced brigham young university graduate mr gay rose to become chief executive of summa corp mr hughess main holding company in the mid s mr hughes preferred mormons because "they would neither smoke nor drink they traveled in pairs like nuns and knew how to keep a secret " according to a book by charles higham "howard hughes the secret life " that chronicled the life of mr hughes and his entourage in an interview friday another biographer pat broeske co author of "howard hughes the untold story" said of the group often headed by mr gay "they were the kind of guys with pocket protectors not skirt chasers " mr gay took charge of operations at mr hughess mysterious redoubt at romaine street in hollywood reputedly secured by the most advanced electronics and near to mr hughess interests in movies and say his biographers movie starlets as mr hughes became more reclusive mr gay took an increasing role in his business affairs sitting on the board of the hughes tool co and serving as chairman of the board of hughes air corp he also was put in charge of mr hughess las vegas operations in in a staff shake up after mr hughes vanished and turned up ensconced in a luxury hotel in the bahamas mr hughess inner circle could be as mysterious as the reclusive mr hughes they were his "last link with the outside world for years no one knew their names or anything about them " wrote ron laytner in his book "up against howard hughes the maheu story " referring to robert maheu who for several years was mr gays chief rival as mr hughess most trusted aide as mr hughes degenerated from an aviator airline tycoon film producer and world class lothario into an unkempt hermit with long fingernails and addictions to banana nut ice cream and less wholesome substances mr gay became involved in a series of power struggles for the control of mr hughess assets mr hughes died in at age mr gay who died may in kingwood texas at age won some battles including one with mr maheu for influence mr maheu declined to comment friday but in mr gay was stripped of the title of ceo of summa and then resigned as president ending three decades in the hughes business empire william lummis a cousin of mr hughes who was chairman of summa added the ceo title in an interview friday mr lummis had only words of praise "he had mr hughess interests at heart " mr lummis said of mr gay "theres no bitterness " mr gay remained on the executive committee of the howard hughes medical institute where he had been a member since and in was appointed by the delaware court of chancery to its board of trustees the next year in the medical institute sold its only asset the hughes aircraft co to general motors corp for &# billion catapulting the institute into the front ranks of medical philanthropy stephen miller william e colson created alternative for senior housing in the early s it took nearly two years for william e colson to find enough seniors for his first independent living venture a unit facility in san diego by the time he sold his holiday retirement corp in february the company owned more than apartments in communities in states and seven canadian provinces the price for the sale to fortress investment group llc more than &# billion as record numbers of the elderly began living into their s and beyond in recent decades holiday retirement constructed apartments for those able to live on their own with a little help in the areas of food transportation and entertainment holiday retirement aimed to attract middle class customers "since the government takes good care of the very poor and the rich can take care of themselves " mr colson told the philadelphia inquirer in the typical target customer was a schoolteacher says david schless president of the american seniors housing association who calls holiday retirement the worlds largest senior housing company mr colson who died after a long bout with cancer on may at age in seattle got his start in the business in the s working in his fathers nursing home building business when he founded what was then called holiday management in in salem ore few independent living communities had been operated on a for profit basis though centers operated by churches and other nonprofit groups had existed as far back as the s according to mr schless "people spend their first years learning they dont want to go to nursing homes " says patrick kennedy a former senior vice president of holiday retirement "what bill did was he created a new alternative and he created it at a price point that people could reach " unlike more comprehensive retirement communities holiday retirements facilities offer little medical care and residents who lose the ability to care for themselves eventually have to move out but what they lack in long term care they made up for in activities food and relatively low prices a north american average of under &# in monthly rent the company says rooms are rented as ordinary apartments and residents dont have to commit to a costly buy in despite his success mr colson maintained a low profile "i dont feel rich " he told the oregonian in "i couldnt pay all the bills until i was " stephen miller email us at remembrances wsj com
