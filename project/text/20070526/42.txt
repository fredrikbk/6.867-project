pursuits books oils glut  paintings you must see before you die edited by stephen farthing universe pages &# the average time a gallery visitor spends in front of a painting is no more than two or three seconds " according to stephen farthing an instructor at the university of arts in london but like the walls of a blockbuster exhibition " paintings you must see before you die" is over crammed with visual display and its reproductions are too small to invite a lingering gaze " paintings " then is a curious enterprise why do it mr farthing admitting that "the only way to understand how good a painting is" requires seeing it "in the flesh " proposes his book as a travel guide though its so heavy that you might think twice before packing it still mr farthing forges ahead and not without interesting results the paintings here cherry picked from world culture across the centuries were selected on the basis of four criteria historical importance memorable imagery the "degree of perfection in balancing" form and content and "the type of meaning that we generate as individuals" in other words personal taste and not just mr farthings personal taste the books subtitle claims that the paintings were "selected and reviewed by leading international critics " and many art critics and historians are among the writers who penned the brief entries that accompany the images but the contributors here include some with no apparent art expertise a "community organizer " a "semi professional clarinettist" and one michael farthing who we are told used to walk by hogarths "the pool of bethesda" when he was a gastroenterology professor at st bartholomews hospital in london the book is thus a bumpy joy ride through art history the first section "pre s " begins with "garden with pool " a wall painting from ancient egypt and ends with "the wilton diptych " devotional images created for englands richard ii in between are a pompeiian fresco a mayan procession scene a chinese landscape mr farthings cross cultural tack continues throughout an approach that proves to be both delightful and at times didactic we encounter the expected masterpieces of giotto titian vermeer and degas but also meet such far away artists as ogata korin japanese and candido lopez argentinian the juxtapositions have a point in showing both sir joshua reynoldss "mrs siddons as the tragic muse" and the japanese artist maruyama okyos "sketches of a black and white rabbit" c mr farthing points to how two radically different approaches to painting can in their own distinctive ways be utterly realistic such insights dont come as revelations exactly but they do make us sit up and take notice mr farthing is on shakier ground when he focuses on contemporary painting if only because history that merciless arbiter of quality hasnt had its say while insisting that art "encourages us to explore its meaning independent of fashion " hes not altogether immune to it chris ofilis dung adorned "the holy virgin mary" makes the cut presumably on notoriety alone the overheated reputation of gerhard richter a conceptual artist posing as a painter probably accounts for his inclusion but a few bum choices from historys welter dont diminish the breezy appeal of " paintings " nor for that matter does the authors decision to include two pictures by well stephen farthing since the book is a bit of a stunt to begin with why not mr naves is the art critic for the new york observer
