pursuits books the house of waugh a member of the british literary clan takes a droll but unsparing look at his forebears fathers and sons by alexander waugh doubleday pages &# who could decline an invitation to join the most celebrated literary family in england for a weekend in a country house with a fine wine cellar in a lovely setting far from the noisome proletariat alexander waugh grandson of the novelist evelyn waugh and an accomplished writer himself offers as much in "fathers and sons " his "autobiography of a family " he promises to introduce us to his progenitors not only his own father the incendiary columnist auberon but also auberons father the famously acerbic evelyn evelyns brother the prolific writer alec evelyn and alecs father arthur a publisher critic and author and even arthurs father dr alexander waugh that is a lot of waughs it should be noted that except for the current biographer all of them are dead but ones disappointment has to be muted because meeting the waughs alive en masse would have been a terrifying experience like stumbling into the house of addams let us imagine ourselves at the start of a somerset weekend running into the authors great great grandfather dr alexander waugh a repulsive red faced little fat man who is drunkenly smashing ornaments in the hall screaming at the servants and flagellating an irish setter with an ivory tipped whip a wasp settles on his wifes forehead instead of brushing it off he squashes it with the ivory tip so as to ensure that she does not escape the sting if we stay the night we will see him drag his son arthur out of bed to shove him into a downstairs cupboard where the little wretch foolish enough not to enjoy shooting animals is made to lavish kisses on his fathers gun case dr waugh in short is a sadist "the brute " as he is known to his descendants is also a skilled surgeon he is the inventor of a sinister apparatus known as "waughs long fine dissecting forceps " he is clearly not the fount of the literary genes that define succeeding generations but elements of his talent for sadism are passed on spasms of it keep surfacing in five generations like flecks of foam in the familys brilliantly translucent stream in the library if we could brave the occupants glare on our entering we find a porcine man in tweeds with murder in his heart this is evelyn waugh acclaimed by many notable writers as one of the greatest novelists in the english language "about as good as one can be " said george orwell "while holding untenable opinions" he is presently dipping his pen in vitriol to assassinate his father arthur either in a diary entry or in a novel as the model for a fatuous character one feels that if arthur insists yet again on sonorously reading from the entire dickens canon to the assembled family evelyn will assault him with dr waughs long fine dissecting forceps purged of his disgust and fortified by a glass of scotch evelyn will turn to creating masterpieces of english literature "brideshead revisited " "decline and fall " "a handful of dust " "vile bodies" and "scoop " the incomparable parody of yellow journalism wherein the megalomaniacal newspaper magnate lord copper mistakenly dispatches william boot a country columnist to report a typically bewildering civil war in an african republic the novel is as hilariously relevant today as it was when first published in same wars same idiocies lacking only a writer as gifted as evelyn to relieve the misery the australian emigre critic clive james recently awarded evelyn the accolade of "the supreme writer of english prose in the th century " a judgment evelyn would have endorsed if it did not mean agreeing with a pleb from the colonies but evelyn was so much more than a stylist or someone who could make us laugh out loud he was mocked for his brooding sense that the barbarians were not at the gate but inside the citadel indulged by the apostles of moral equivalence in the name of a vapid tolerance his foreboding has been all too cruelly vindicated evelyn was a literary genius quarrying the english language for buried treasure as funny in conversation as on the page but he was also a bully a bigot and a snob and a delinquent father on our visit to the waugh house the extended family is still talking not to evelyns face too dangerous about how cruel he was when he refused to visit or even write his son second lt auberon "bron" while the young man lay at deaths door in cyprus in having accidentally machine gunned himself on patrol in his armored car some nasties say he was actually shot in the back by his own men we are left with the eternal puzzle how could a man so imbued with disdain for his fellow men as evelyn was summon the empathy required for comic writing while his softer hearted father and his brother alec produced lesser works it is a question asked of many who have deployed humor to combat their own demons and evelyn had plenty not least in his struggles with youthful homosexuality suicidal urges and depression his embrace of catholicism at the age of helped but he remained a fugitive from boredom most of his life alexander cannot explain the paradox inherent in the depressive comic maybe nobody can perhaps he could have done more to assess the significance of evelyn but the book is focused after all on the relationships between fathers and sons in this alexander has plundered the archives of print and memory with zest he has threaded the character studies into an absorbing narrative he is often funny and always direct he keeps nothing from us sex money dishonesty greed envy the crippled emotions of some very clever people it is all here how did arthur coax one son out of masturbatory mania "think cricket " what childhood shock impaired auberons erotic sensibility as an adult the sight at age three of his nonagenarian step great great grandmother naked in her bath alexander notes "i never saw my fathers bare arse or his exposed genitals and am glad of that as a passing glimpse of either might have traumatized me for life " nor he tells us with some pride did father or son ever vouchsafe affection for each other a taboo in their tribe yet alexander is notably unabashed in revealing no reveling in would be better every disagreeable characteristic in the house of waugh bron wrote how his father evelyn dying in the downstairs lavatory left "a small pile of excrement on the carpet outside " alexander defends the publication of this detail as a faithful recording of evelyns final joke on himself the "great saltimbancs farewell somersault " most of us will be happier with the manifestations of evelyns wit in ink bron himself the authors father was psychologically maimed like a number of the earlier waughs by a childhood suffused with paternal coldness his own novels never quite measured up but as a journalist he was as talented as evelyn bron was a literary anarchist whose indulgence of the english license for eccentricity was undiluted by the national preference for understatement he poured forth a weekly torrent of iconoclastic columns acidic book reviews and every wednesday for years in the satirical magazine private eye his savagely funny diary i was often the butt of particularly rude entries myself largely because he nurtured a hopeless passion for my wife bron made so many enemies that his obituary in the guardian was illustrated with a drawing of his corpse being washed down the lavatory pan given his dark sense of humor he might not have objected to that image as much as his friends did they forgave bron everything for his being amusing in defiance of the nauseating political correctness that judges all cultures of equal merit he was also his friends insist at times capable of great personal sweetness alexander trained for his excursion into the family vaults by writing an irreverent biography of god his bible reading must have been good preparation for wrestling with the confusions of nomenclature in the waugh lineage their habit is to hand down christian names like old clothes three auberons flit through the pages two alexanders one alec and one alick sooner or later the reader cries "which waugh which waugh " still the effort is worth it one enters the house of waugh with trepidation and leaves with regret sir harold evans
