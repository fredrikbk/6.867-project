pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies small films big payoff why little movies are sometimes the most powerful big movie or little one the distinction lies largely in the eye and heart of the beholder theres less to those bloated sequels of "shrek " "spider man" and "pirates of the caribbean" than their production costs and attendance figures suggest while several brilliant little indies are pulling in impressive and impressed audiences last weekend "waitress" cracked the national box offices top list so did the british buddy cop spoof "hot fuzz " the artful zombie flick " weeks later" took third place on that list and the lovely irish fable "once " opening in only two theaters registered a higher per screen average than "shrek " which played on screens i can and do appreciate full scale studio stuff when its good more proof of that will be forthcoming in next weeks review of "knocked up " from my perspective though the best antidote to all thats bad and crass in movies these days is a small unassuming film that sneaks up on you and makes you its grateful captive the process is always surprising though not necessarily mysterious take the extremely short segments each by a different director that celebrate the city of light in the recently released "paris je taime " some work well others dont but one of them the seven minute piece directed by alexander payne is a perfect example of how the smallest of films can stir the soul in no time flat the scheme is straightforward carol a frumpy middle aged denver letter carrier played by margo martindale is telling her french class about one special day in her recent trip to paris as she speaks in earnest french with a fingernails on chalkboard accent we see her exploring the city on her own carol is an unprepossessing figure if not a faintly ridiculous one and she scrambles some of her facts jean paul sartre was not married to simon bolivar but her ridiculousness recedes and soon vanishes as she acknowledges old romantic yearnings thinks quiet thoughts about her mortality and considers her loneliness without flirting for a moment with self pity then something happens as she sits alone in a parisian park "something " as she recounts it "very difficult to describe " what carol succeeds in describing with piercingly simple eloquence is nothing less than her epiphany a stunning emotional climax to a snippet of film that defines a whole life that sort of compression is often a hallmark of little movies with big payoffs "once" is most readily described as a love story between two musicians who meet on the streets of dublin but its also about music creativity collaboration and the banked fires of love lost "waitress " which presents itself as a whimsically optimistic little fable in which everything works out for the best is all aswirl with strong feelings of anger anxiety and longing longing in its turn leads to another hallmark that like carols epiphany is difficult to describe though the word ineffable comes close the ineffable beauty for instance of wong kar wais "in the mood for love " which is all about romantic longing and which at its minute running time may be as magical as it is because of its compression having been distilled from the much longer and explicit or effable tale that the filmmaker originally shot or the ineffable if readily explicable passion of bernardo bertoluccis low budget minute long "besieged " in which david thewliss jason kinsky an english pianist and composer living in rome falls madly in love with his african housekeeper shandurai whos played luminously by thandie newton elusive charm accounts for the enduring popularity of "bottle rocket " the fragile little fable of cockeyed innocence that brought together first as a short and then as a short feature the talents of wes anderson and the brothers wilson luke and owen the same is true of "danny deckchair " the endearing australian film in which a cement truck driver played by rhys ifans sails off to a new life in a deck chair lifted aloft by helium filled balloons and lets not forget the erratic even bizarre charms of the "youre a big boy now " francis coppolas first non nudie nonhorror feature but charm counts less than complexity in other mini monuments to the power of movies susanne biers oscar nominated "after the wedding" all but explodes with dramatic revelations when the director of a danish orphanage in bombay flies home for a brief visit francois truffauts austere yet magnificent "the wild child" is a retelling of a true story about a feral child who was found living in the woods in france at the end of the th century the production looks home made though at the same time sumptuous as photographed in black and white by nestor almendros and truffaut himself plays dr itard the man who tries to civilize the boy yet the film explores the very essence of the civilizing process not to mention the contradictions implicit in parenting and one of my favorite little treasures "big night " only seems to be about the travails of two brothers struggling to keep an italian restaurant afloat on the new jersey shore though those travails are wonderfully dramatic the film is equally astute and ineffably charming in what it says about the conflict between business and art great depth doesnt require great length or grotesque cost morgensterns picks pleasure writ large although everything seems to be on dvd it isnt one small but significant omission is cedric klapischs "chacun chasse son chat" "when the cats away" which is not only about a lost cat but about lost neighborhoods in paris these three small fine features are however definitely and fortunately available vincent &amp theo ive recommended robert altmans film before in another context but it comes to mind again as a companion piece to "big night " this one too is about art and commerce though much more directly than the film about an italian restaurant tim roth gives a phenomenal performance as vincent van gogh penniless and sinking into insanity as he does paintings that will one day sell for unimaginable millions paul rhys is vincents brother theo a gallery owner who struggles to sell some of those paintings to a world that finds them of little interest and less value monetary or artistic off the map this distinctive leisurely film directed by campbell scott who co directed "big night" with stanley tucci is a classic coming of age story combined with a subtly absurdist drama set in the s the film demands patience and rewards it joan allen shines quietly as arlene groden a tenacious earth mother living with her depressed husband charley sam elliott and their pre teen daughter bo valentina de angelis in the high desert vastness of new mexico the story is told by bo whose precociousness can be a trial though shes an endearing character and an entertaining one juan ruiz anchia did the magnificent cinematography saraband originally made for tv this film by ingmar bergman is we are told the swedish masters last its a chamber piece in which the sublime sarabande of bachs suite no for unaccompanied cello figures significantly the film begins with a reunion between marianne and johan the couple played by liv ullmann and erland josephson in bergmans "scenes from a marriage " and the subject is love love that imprisons love that empowers since the audience for "saraband" was somewhat smaller than that for say "shrek " the film came and went in a flash but it lives vividly on dvd
