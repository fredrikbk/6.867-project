put it the index of collins consumption seems to have been pegged to the thermometer in july new york experienced a heat wave so scorching that the drawbridges over the harlem river wouldnt close fire trucks had to be called to spray down the overexpanded steel of the drawspans the price of lemons soared with the temperature rising &# a box in just one day the demand driving the price spike was attributed to the thirsty people of the city turning to lemonade and tom collinses the drink is still a fine way to soothe a sun beaten brow its simple enough to make gin lots of lemon juice sugar and soda water on the rocks change the gin for whiskey and you get a john collins substitute rum and you get a rum collins sometimes called a marimba collins and there are other variations such as making a collins with lime juice rather than lemon thats the way faye dunaway takes her tom collins when she sits down at a swanky restaurant with a bandaged jack nicholson in "chinatown " to get the same

the tom collins may have achieved its zenith in the decades after prohibition but it got its start in the th century named after a notorious hoax that spread in the summer of the original prank went something like this a friend would run into you on the street and with great concern tell you he just overheard someone named tom collins at a bar down the street saying hateful and libelous things about you you race to that bar to confront the bounder where you would be told that tom collins had just left for a bar several blocks away when you get there collins would already have decamped for another joint across town as you chase all over the city your friends convulse with laughter soon not in on the joke newspapers in cities across the country were reporting on people trying to find the scurrilous fellow "tom collins still among us " the decatur ill daily republican reported in june "this individual kept up his nefarious business of slandering our citizens all day yesterday but we believe that he succeeded in keeping out of the way of his pursuers in several instances he came well nigh being caught having left certain places but a very few moments before the arrival of those who were hunting him his movements are watched to day with the utmost vigilance " when the papers realized it was all a gag they got in on the act the daily republican kept playing along for months gamely reporting that collins had been spotted in san luis obispo calif on his way to arizona "next spring " the paper predicted collins "will jauntily enter the south american republics " it doesnt take much to imagine how tom collins came to be a drink how many times does someone have to barge into a saloon demanding tom collins before the bartender takes the opportunity to offer him a cocktail so named indeed you have to wonder if the whole tom collins stunt wasnt a marketing gimmick to promote pub crawling speaking of frauds i dont recommend ordering a collins at a restaurant or bar these days you will likely get a drink made not with lemon juice but with that backbone of the lazy bar all purpose lemon lime sour mix some bars make their own sour mix fresh but for the most part the stuff comes in bottles or jugs or out of the dispenser "gun " a factory produced concoction of citrus concentrates and corn syrup i resent drinks made with prefab mixes and would no more drink them

home looked for shortcuts canada dry holland house and others cranked out "collins mix" after the war and you can still buy little packets of the powdered stuff that is if you like the taste of alka seltzer examples of what bartender and author dale degroff calls the kool aid school of mixology such shortcuts ruined the tom collins and the drink has never recovered lets restore the tom collins to its rightful place that means getting lemons and the means by which to squeeze them one of the most valuable tools in my bar is a hinged citrus squeezer that operates like a garlic press juice half a lemon into a short highball glass with lots of ice add a teaspoon of sugar or simple syrup more or less a jigger of gin and a few ounces of fizzy water then all you need is someplace in the shade and someone else to mow the grass email me at eric felten wsj com tom collins  oz gin juice of lemon  oz simple syrup or tsp sugar  oz soda water build on the rocks in a short highball glass what was once
