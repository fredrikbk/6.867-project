blame the brokers not the sec please dont blame the sec for forcing consumers to abandon fee based brokerage accounts "sec decision forces investors to make choice " personal journal may blame the brokerage firms themselves for their continued refusal to allow their registered representatives to assume the two fundamental responsibilities imposed by the investment advisors act of the fiduciary duty to put a clients interest before ones own and the duty to disclose conflicts of interest to the client it would seem fairly straightforward to require anyone advising a client on say an investment decision affecting their life savings to have to put that clients interest first but the some stockbrokers in the u s today have no such duty rather they have only to satisfy a vague minimal standard of "suitability" when making investment recommendations by contrast the approximately registered investment advisors must satisfy the far more stringent and fair fiduciary duties imposed by the iaa the brokerage firms need only accept these fiduciary duties themselves in order to allow customers to keep their fee based accounts unfortunately the firms continue to cling to their minimal "suitability" standards while doing as much as possible to look like true registered investment advisors have you met anyone recently who actually called themselves a stockbroker rather than a financial advisor financial consultant or the title of the day wealth manager the result is an uneven playing field and a very unfortunate one for the investing public who of course are the ones most likely to trip on it milo benningfield benningfield financial advisors san francisco
