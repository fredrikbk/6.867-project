a new owner rupert murdochs courtship of the bancroft family appears to have triumphed with enough shares pledged to make news corp the owner of the newspaper you are now reading readers are naturally asking how this will change the journalism we practice our sincere answer is that we intend to stand for the same principles and standards we have for more than a hundred years the bancrofts have been wonderful stewards of the journal for a century and we are grateful for the support they have provided for our brand of independent journalism they are being assailed in some quarters for "selling out" for the money but those of us who work here know how often they have supported our writing despite its risks to advertising or circulation we dont doubt for a second that they are doing what they hope will be best for the journal as well as for their own families change is inevitable in a capitalist marketplace for the news business no less than for any other that includes the possibility of changes in ownership especially in an industry like ours roiled by the internet ask the tribune company or the reporters who once worked for something called knight ridder our june editorial "an independent newspaper " was portrayed by some as a request for a reprieve from such market forces but thats a canard as we said in that editorial "those of us who extol the virtues of joseph schumpeters creative destruction for others cant complain when it sweeps through our own industry " the journal has had to adapt many times over the years to changing technology and reading habits in the past five years alone we have redesigned the u s journal twice and the foreign editions once while adding a saturday paper and investing in online publishing to the extent that news corp can provide capital for further innovation the journals future as a business should be enhanced and make no mistake business success is vital to editorial independence precisely because it provides the resources to report and comment in ways that might offend advertisers or governments we also believe the reverse is true editorial independence enhances the prospects for business success the more credible a publication is especially one that specializes in financial and economic reporting the more readers and advertisers it is likely to have we like to think our readers buy the journal because of the credibility built over a century and we believe this is the heart of the "value proposition" that mr murdoch is willing to pay &# billion to purchase no sane businessman pays a premium of over the market price for an asset he intends to ruin there are nonetheless critics especially in the journalism world who claim this is precisely what mr murdoch will proceed to do and they have certainly had a merry time bashing him and the journal these past few months some of these voices however are commercial or ideological competitors who have their own interest in undermining the journals credibility both the new york times and the financial times have been especially aggressive in assailing the potential news corp purchase of the journal these also happen to be the two publications that mr murdoch has explicitly said he might invest more to compete against readers can judge if the tears these papers and their writers claim to shed for the journals future are real or of the crocodile variety the nastiest attacks have come from our friends on the political left they cant decide whose views they hate most ours or mr murdochs were especially amused by those who say mr murdoch might tug us to the political left dont count on it more than one liberal commentator has actually rejoiced at the takeover bid on the perverse grounds that this will ruin the journals news coverage which in turn will reduce the audience for the editorial page dont count on that either such an expectation overlooks that the principle of "free people and free markets" promoted in these columns has an appeal far beyond this newspaper we fill a market niche for such commentary that is too little met by other newspapers and media outlets but we have every confidence that if we vanished or let our standards fall the marketplace would find an alternative what ultimately matters are the ideas and their basic truth as for the journal news coverage the critics insult the standards and culture of our reporters and editors they arent potted plants who will abandon the habits of a lifetime because someone else owns dow jones yes we all must adapt to the new ways in which readers want to receive business and political news but to claim that the journal will cease being a credible source of such news is to malign the integrity of career professionals on this point readers also shouldnt misinterpret the "editorial independence" agreement between mr murdoch and the bancrofts this isnt intended to be some heat shield protecting journal editors from their new owner we know enough about capitalism to know that there is no separating ownership and control we see the editorial agreement instead as an expression of mr murdochs intention to maintain the values and integrity of the journal his invitation to have a member of the bancroft family join the news corp board is a similar gesture of good faith the ultimate verdict on the new journal era will of course be rendered by you our readers we realize that skepticism about media today is rampant and rightly so in journalism building trust is a daily and relentless business for our part today we can only say that we intend to stand for the same beliefs tomorrow and into the future as we have for a century see related letters "letters to the editor readers hopes and fears for journal after purchase" wsj august
