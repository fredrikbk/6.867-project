moguls dream murdoch wins his bid for dow jones news corp s success follows delicate dance between suitor target the bancroft family decision to sell dow jones &amp co capped a three month public tango between them and rupert murdoch the chairman and chief executive of news corp behind the scenes however the media mogul had orchestrated a deal over two years he quietly gathered intelligence on dow joness operations and consulted wall street figures to plot his moves an emissary for him talked with family members who had been dow jones dissidents a decade ago this spring mr murdoch found a willing dance partner in dow joness ceo an executive whose strategy was pinched by the downturn in the newspaper business and who would receive a big payday in a sale of the company the skirmishing involved a family trustee who wore multiple hats a legal titan who advised the family but whose firm had worked for news corp directors just three years earlier and owners who wrestled with their consciences over surrendering what many regarded as a public trust ultimately the bid for dow jones chronicler of economic events for years produced a saga in many ways as complex and dramatic as any that its journalists had covered here are the roles played by some of its key figures rupert murdoch planning to pounce nearly a decade ago mr murdoch visited peter r kann then chief executive of dow jones and put his interest in buying the company on the table "i know its not for sale but remember me if the family changes their mind " mr murdoch yesterday recalled having said he began to grow hopeful two years ago after boston lawyer and family trustee michael b elefante succeeded roy hammer as one of the familys representatives on the dow jones board "months later i heard mr elefante was asking questions and being a very independent director whereas roy hammer was completely at one with peter kann " mr murdoch said in an interview mr murdoch tapped a range of people for advice including bruce wasserstein of lazard llc and james b lee jr of j p morgan chase &amp co some such as mr wasserstein thought it was time to strike in january when dow jones unexpectedly announced mr kanns retirement as ceo though not as chairman but mr murdoch figured the family would give the new boss a chance to make his mark he did arrange a lunch in early with the new ceo richard f zannino with the help of mr lee whose kids played hockey with mr zanninos also staying mr murdochs hand was his concern about a big stake in news corp held by liberty media corp potentially threatening mr murdochs control but last fall news corp began to clear away this obstacle by agreeing on a deal to buy the stake in gauging family interest in selling mr murdoch had the help of an intermediary andrew steginsky a news corp shareholder and old friend of both mr murdoch and his son lachlan an investment adviser in princeton n j mr steginsky knew william cox iii a family member who a decade ago agitated for change at dow jones the two had served together on the board of a symphony orchestra mr steginsky flew to rome where mr cox lives in november and at an outdoor cafe told him mr murdoch was interested in buying dow jones and wanted to meet with the family the emissarys next stop was prague to see elisabeth chelberg in the mid s when known as elisabeth "lizzie" goth she had joined mr cox who is in seeking change at dow jones such as a sale of its lagging telerate financial data service at the prague airports communist era vip lounge ms chelberg and her husband and mr steginsky talked about whom mr murdoch should approach and whom he shouldnt mr steginsky later called members of another wing of the bancroft family and trustee mr elefante then on march mr murdoch had breakfast with mr zannino and toward the end of the meal said that he might bid for dow jones aware of the familys ambivalence about selling says someone close to the case mr murdoch knew his proposal had to be bold to get traction the stock was stuck in the mid s on april a messenger brought to dow jones offices in lower manhattan mr murdochs offer &# a share in cash martin peers and matthew karnitschnig richard zannino opening the door the offer became public knowledge may reported first by cnbc that led to a pivotal presentation by the dow jones ceo to the board the next day pressure on him was rising he had remarked when he took over in that new ceos typically had about months to show progress hed been in the job for more than a year and the stock hadnt done much he walked directors through the opportunities of being part of news corp such as better marketing and distribution of the journal he said turning down the offer would protect journalistic independence but open directors to shareholder pressure if the stock then sank directors knew that before the bid he had been targeting a &# stock in with this offer on the table it was already in the high s mr zannino who stood to receive some &# million if he lost his job or had his duties cut after a change in control says he took no position on the offer but some who heard his presentation saw it as favorable to the bid two voiced concern to other directors that mr zannino had nearly given up trying to run dow jones as an autonomous company and might leave if the offer failed mr zannino wrote to directors restating his commitment to running the company when the family in late may decided to meet with mr murdoch and discussed whom to take along mr elefante objected to bringing mr zannino said a person who was on a call discussing the matter the person said mr elefante argued that the meeting was about editorial independence not business he declined to comment the family instead brought along dow joness chairman m peter mcpherson during june some family members dragged things out in hopes other bids would emerge mr zannino believed the family was ill equipped to handle negotiations with news corp and favored having the board take them over but he was separated from direct talks with the family by mr mcpherson the main board family liaison on june the family did turn negotiations over to the board returned to a central role mr zannino worked with advisers on the structure of a panel to safeguard the independence of dow jones publications but after dow jones delivered the blueprint to news corp late on june a frustrated mr murdoch called mr zannino and bancroft legal adviser martin lipton to complain about it say people familiar with the matter news corp sent back an aggressively marked up copy giving the panel less power mr zannino recommended standing firm betting that news corp wouldnt walk away from its offer the first nonjournalist to lead dow jones he told associates it was important to "deliver the newsroom " that is have journalists on board with an offer news corp eventually agreed to a stronger editorial board than it initially proposed even so mr zannino received calls from some family members criticizing him as too ready to accept the news corp bid when the board voted on the offer in mid july mr zannino voted to accept it he remained in close contact with mr murdoch throughout negotiations the two have talked almost every day in recent weeks according to people familiar with the matter sarah ellison christopher bancroft family values both a dow jones director and a trustee of some of the family trusts mr bancroft had long embraced the family policy of letting dow jones executives run the company without interference from the start he objected to the offer from news corp and early on he was deeply affected by letters from dow jones employees pleading with the family not to sell to mr murdoch yet like the family as a whole mr bancroft sometimes sent conflicting signals mr bancroft divides his work hours between an office in the posh galleria area of dallas and a renovated bungalow in nearby denton texas pursuing small investment deals through his own firm he is married to a classical musician and active as a philanthropist he saw his job as preserving dow jones publications integrity while protecting the familys interests he wielded his authority too quietly to suit some in the divided family who wanted him to help pull them together mr bancroft had a rocky relationship with some relatives who resented his view that his duties as trustee didnt require him to consult with every individual family member mr bancroft angered some by snubbing family meetings which he regarded as rancorous occasions accomplishing little according to someone familiar with his thinking when second cousin william cox iii took him to task for not attending one gathering mr bancroft replied "if there is a real need for my company i will be there " though he seldom spoke publicly mr bancroft said on may that he would favor selling dow jones only if he saw a situation that would benefit the company and its shareholders and "at the moment i dont see anything that would do that " some family members worried his comments could scare off other suitors mr bancroft argued to the family that the murdoch offer undervalued dow jones and a better partner could be found after dow jones directors in late june took over the negotiations mr bancroft launched a last ditch effort to block a deal with news corp he approached hedge funds and other investors about funding him in a buyout of enough family shares to form a majority against the sale the effort failed opposition to the offer grew in late april when it became public on may mr elefante was able to say that family opposition equaled a slim majority of dow jones voting power the board as a result took no immediate action word in early may of a planned merger between reuters group plc and thomson corp changed matters mr elefante sought a briefing from merrill bankers they said the plan threatened dow jones and it needed greater scale the presentation convinced some family members they should explore options for a sale of dow jones at a meeting in boston the next week mr elefante told the family that he too now felt this way within days family members announced they would meet with mr murdoch and be receptive to other offers but mr elefante lost control on the negotiations in june as the family delayed engaging mr murdoch and directors worried he might walk away on june looking haggard mr elefante was one of the last to show up for a special board dinner at the ritz carlton hotel in lower manhattan at a board meeting the next day several independent directors advocated taking negotiating authority out of the hands of mr elefante and the family as a consensus for this course grew he didnt intervene after the board reached a tentative agreement with news corp in mid july mr elefante set about explaining to the family its options returning from the corporate boardroom to his more familiar role as a trustee he regained control of the process he proved deft at herding the family and his fellow trustees toward a deal he had become convinced was in the best interests of dow jones as the family became ever more emotional in its final deliberations mr elefante displayed grace under pressure some family members say in the end it was mr elefantes law firm that voted a number of key trusts in favor of the offer sealing the deal for mr murdoch matthew
