making the best of &# a barrel oil muzzling the guzzlers high gas prices drive effort to remake suvs if you love driving your suv but hate the cost and eco stigma that come with it auto makers are trying to help you resolve your issues in the past year sustained gas prices of &# a gallon have led to a decline in the market for sport utility vehicles trucks and other large vehicles that use a lot of fuel to win back customers auto makers are using a variety of new technologies to improve suvs fuel economy including cleaner burning diesel engines gasoline electric hybrids special lightweight parts and even power steering pumps that think for themselves daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz and jeep units recently began selling diesel versions of their large suvs ford motor co plans to offer diesel power in its full size pickup trucks and suvs in the next year or so and general motors corp is using smaller engines in one line of suvs and hybrid power in another even sports car builder porsche ag recently announced it will build a hybrid version of its speedy cayenne suv planned for sale by smaller fuel saving measures being used in a number of different cars include turbochargers that enable smaller more efficient engines to generate more power weight saving electronics to replace mechanical systems and light materials like aluminum carbon fiber and plastics some earlier hybrids including the honda accord and lexus rx h used their hybrid power more for speed than economy several of the latest suv models coming out alter the balance somewhat using changes in technology to offer more fuel economy the planned hybrid porsche cayenne is expected to get to miles per gallon on average compared with mpg for city driving and mpg for highway driving for the most fuel efficient of the current cayenne models other new models however deliver much more modest fuel economy improvements of just a few miles per gallon car makers have grown to depend on large vehicles especially trucks to drive profit and are eager to make them popular again large suvs have higher profit margins than family sedans because they are built on truck chassis that dont cost much to develop the auto makers hope that improvements in fuel efficiency will make it easier for car shoppers many of whom still like large vehicles to justify the purchase of a suv recently customers have gravitated toward smaller more fuel efficient models amid high gasoline prices and environmental pressures sales of the chevrolet tahoe a large suv with seats for seven passengers reached a peak of vehicles in but have generally slipped since then and totaled last year when gm redesigned the tahoe and its sister truck the gmc yukon for the model year one goal was to make them more fuel efficient the new gas powered tahoe has an epa fuel economy rating of mpg in city driving and mpg on the highway compared with the mpg rating of the previous version the new model is more powerful with horsepower up from but in a reporters test drive the already modest increase in efficiency on paper was barely noticeable on the road still a hybrid version of the tahoe due in dealerships late this year promises to deliver fuel economy consistently better than mpg about four years ago gm began building hybrid diesel electric city buses that featured transmissions with large electric motors built in shortly afterward the company began developing a smaller "scalable" system that would work in its large suvs chevrolet hasnt named a price for the hybrid tahoe but says the suv will cost less than the top of the line tahoe ltz model which this year costs about &# during the next year or so the escalade luxury suv from gms cadillac division will be available as a hybrid as will the companys silverado and sierra pickup trucks porsche known for building sports cars whose relatively small engines are fairly frugal with fuel recently demonstrated a prototype hybrid system for its cayenne suv that it plans to begin selling by the end of the decade it also plans to use the hybrid system in a large sedan called the panamera that is under development diesel power is another way to boost fuel economy and mercedes benz this year rolled out diesel versions of three of its largest vehicles the gl cdi sport utility is rated at mpg in the city and mpg on the highway compared with for the gasoline version that went on sale last year although the six cylinder diesel generates less horsepower than the eight cylinder gasoline engine it produces more torque the energy that gets the vehicle moving quickly from a standstill and gives it a peppier feel at low speeds mercedes hopes the fuel efficiency improvement is enough to persuade wavering consumers especially those with growing families to buy the &# seven passenger suv the company also added a diesel version of its ml class medium size suv which was the model with which the company entered the sport utility fray in the u s once a big seller the ml had also suffered in recent years with sales falling to last year from in other new diesel suvs that are on sale or coming soon include the jeep grand cherokee and dodge durango gas versions of both are known for poor fuel economy and have seen recent sales declines diesels dont meet emissions requirements in some states including california massachusetts and new york but some auto makers are expected to launch so called " state" diesel models within a year or two that will meet all state requirements car makers have also been making dozens of small tweaks to their vehicles to incrementally improve efficiency still such improvements seem to go more toward boosting power and speed than toward fuel economy while the fuel economy of bmw ags x crossover has improved by two to four mpg compared with five years ago much of the effort has gone to boosting horsepower by on the six cylinder model and on the eight cylinder version chevrolet points to small details that contributed to its hybrid tahoes improved fuel economy they include lighter parts like a hood and rear hatch and drive shaft made of aluminum instead of steel its wheels are lighter and more aerodynamic and the company even changed the seats making them noticeably thinner to save weight the optional power operated rear hatch and power folding second row seats arent available because they add weight chevrolet also removed the suvs roof rack and two tow hooks near the front bumper to clean up the truck aerodynamically besides a spokeswoman said "we noticed that people rarely use them " hybrid systems can actually make a car heavier amid the extra weight of batteries and other gear so in some cases auto makers are shedding weight to compensate it isnt clear whether the improvements in gas mileage will win over customers while most of the cars in development dont have prices yet hybrids tend to carry higher price tags and drivers cant always reap fuel savings without altering their driving techniques for instance by accelerating gradually from a full stop says david healy an analyst with burnham securities diesel powered vehicles tend to feel more familiar to most drivers and make it easier to realize better fuel economy "in the long term i think diesels have a better shot at winning over consumers " mr healy says see related article "investors are flocking to slew of offerings in hot energy markets" wsj aug
