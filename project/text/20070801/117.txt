the afternoon report iraqi reversal online edition iraqi politicians took a step backward from the reconciliation that u s military and political leaders say is the only way forward for the battered nation the largest sunni arab political bloc quit prime minister nouri al malikis cabinet wednesday saying mr maliki didnt respond to demands including pardoning detainees not charged with specific crimes and disbanding militias rafaa al issawi a leader of the mostly sunni iraqi accordance front said at a news conference that the blocs six cabinet ministers would submit their resignations later in the day the accordance front controls of the iraqi parliaments seats and its withdrawal from the national government is the second major pullout of a group in mr malikis coalition in april radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr pulled his ministers out of the government in baghdad in protest over the shiite led administrations refusal to set a timetable for the withdrawal of u s troops such pullouts from the coalition threaten its ability to deliver on benchmarks set out by president bush to justify the influx of new troops into baghdad including a new law for the distribution of iraqs oil resources even if the government had remained intact mr maliki would be hard pressed to deliver such laws soon as iraqs parliament shook off criticism from the u s and adjourned for a month long recess on july it wont meet again until sept which is just days before iraq commander gen david petraeus and u s ambassador ryan crocker will present a report to congress on the situation in iraq some republicans have indicated that without some sort of signs of improvement in iraq they might have to urge the president to change his strategy in iraq in short this is bad news especially since ethnic tensions also seem to be building with the kurds whose stronghold is in the oil rich northern tier of the nation in late june the wall street journals yochi dreazen reported that a kurdish push to make the norths oil capital kirkuk part of an autonomous iraqi kurdistan is infuriating the shiite muslim majority which wants the city under the control of the shiite dominated central government issues of federal versus regional control are also complicating the passage of iraqs oil legislation in june the congressional research service wrote that "it remains to be seen whether the package of hydrocarbon legislation under consideration will promote reconciliation or contribute to deeper political tension " conventional wisdom holds that violence must be tamped down in baghdad if the legislature is to get to the point where it could actually pass a law even a bad one but baghdad is still a particularly bloody place two bombings killed at least people there wednesday in separate attacks on both sunni and shiite neighborhoods and the u s military also announced the deaths of three more troops who were killed by an armor piercing bomb in eastern baghdad tuesday thats the same type of bomb the u s has accused iranian networks of supplying to militants but even if baghdad were quiet the parliament including mr malikis wobbly coalition would still be on vacation stocks gyrate
