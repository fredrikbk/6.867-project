capital markets corp if they enter the market through acquisitions they could provide an exit for investors in coremetrics or the other companies mr davis didnt put a timeline on when coremetrics plans to go public but highlands mr mullen says the companys strong growth puts it in position for an ipo or a merger "were at the scale where we can do both " he says corrections &amp amplifications
