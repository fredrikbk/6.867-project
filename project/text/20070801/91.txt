pfizer is seeking more ventures pfizer inc s venture capital program is headed for a major expansion instead of using venture dollars principally to find start ups with technologies that could help it commercialize products pfizer soon will begin investing in drug and health care technology companies said edmund p harrigan senior vice president world wide business development the buildup which comes as pfizer seeks to counter patent expirations and product pipeline problems means start ups will have greater access to the new york pharmaceutical companys resources and venture firms will be able to look to pfizer as an investment partner while companies such as glaxosmithkline plc have used venture capital to fund biotechnology concerns in a variety of fields pfizers venture effort formerly known as pfizer strategic investments group had a narrower focus the pfizer group funded diagnostics software and technology providers such as genomic health inc a developer of a cancer diagnostics molecular imaging company avid radiopharmaceuticals inc and entelos inc which makes computer models of disease the group which began investing in funded nine companies according to its web site pfizer which has lost u s market exclusivity for blood pressure pill norvasc and depression drug zoloft has been intensifying its effort to fortify its pipeline through collaborations the endeavor gained urgency in december when pfizer said it would discontinue development of the cholesterol drug torcetrapib expected to be the heir to its flagship cholesterol pill lipitor after deaths in a clinical trial it recently announced that barbara j dalton formerly of sr one ltd the venture capital unit of glaxosmithkline would come aboard in september to lead a venture investment group whereas pfizer strategic investments group supported the u s commercial organization ms daltons group is charged with the "fundamental task of increasing product flow " mr harrigan says he declined to say how much capital the unit will have to work with but said he has proposed a budget to chief executive jeffrey b kindler consistent with six to eight investments a year while pfizer strategic investments invested about &# million a deal this unit will be able to deploy significantly more he said though he didnt disclose how much ms dalton likely will hire two more members for the arm which includes debra yu and william burkoth who were part of the strategic investment group ms dalton declined to comment the unit may begin investing as soon as this year and will consider a variety of companies including biotech specialty pharmaceutical diagnostic drug delivery and other health care technology providers the expansion comes atop another program to reach biotech entrepreneurs in may pfizer announced that it has formed an incubator to help biotech start ups get going and will invest &# million a year over five years to support occupants of the la jolla calif research and development center the venture arm and incubator group work separately though they will collaborate informally according to mr harrigan the moves come as pfizer recognizes that it will have to more aggressively pursue innovation externally if it is to overcome the loss of drugs going generic despite spending &# billion annually on research pfizers discovery efforts havent yielded enough results said michael krensavage an analyst with raymond james financial inc "no matter how you look at it its been a disappointing pipeline " he said last year pfizer acquired world wide rights to manufacture and sell exubera an inhaled insulin from sanofi aventis for about &# billion but pfizer said second quarter world wide revenue from this product was &# million which the company called "disappointing " in its second quarter earnings statement pfizer said it plans to continue its effort to build a major presence in biopharmaceuticals this could help reduce pfizers dependence on conventional small molecule drugs which are subject to generic competition when their market exclusivity is exhausted last year pfizer acquired rinat neuroscience corp an antibody company backed by sv life sciences advisers llp technology partners and others earlier this year it purchased biorexis pharmaceutical corp which has a technology for producing new protein drugs the deal included pfizer acquiring positions held by biorexiss venture backers by hiring ms dalton pfizer gains another experienced biotech investor with connections that could help it compete for the best biotech venture capital deals michael lytton a general partner of oxford bioscience partners who has served with ms dalton on the board of closely held antibiotics company rib x pharmaceuticals inc said she helped rib x gain access to the financial and scientific resources of glaxosmithkline she also has chaired the new haven conn companys audit committee and has been an effective advocate for rib x during its recent financing rounds he said "she will be a terrific leader of pfizers venture efforts " mr lytton said "she is one of the most experienced and sound people i have worked with in the venture capital business " because of the narrow focus to date of pfizers venture group it often hasnt been considered as a potential syndicate partner he said "with barbaras leadership that could well change "
