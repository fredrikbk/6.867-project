iridium alliance talks advance as u s agencies scale back plans to monitor weather and climate changes from space satellite operator iridium satellite llc and an international earth imaging organization are accelerating talks about a potential &# billion partnership to plug anticipated coverage gaps iridiums discussions with the group on earth observations or geo a swiss based umbrella group supported by the european commission and more than countries and international organizations reflect growing global interest in placing weather and environmental sensors as supplemental payloads on iridiums next generation satellite fleet so called piggyback payloads offer an efficient and relatively inexpensive way to get widespread coverage for scientific and weather monitoring purposes without the cost of building launching and operating a new satellite fleet dedicated just to those uses for iridium which is devising plans to spend roughly &# billion over the next decade to replace its commercial communications satellites the talks hold the prospect of a potentially important and extra revenue stream preliminary estimates have the international observation group paying up to another &# billion to build operate and disseminate data from the proposed sensors on the new iridium satellites the international group projects providing an additional &# billion through in kind contributions and services the concept of a joint venture was disclosed in june at an industry conference in paris and iridium based in bethesda md earlier last week provided more details and confirmed that its talks with geo are more advanced than those with other potential partners geo and its officials "took a very prominent role in helping us assess" potential supplemental payloads don thoma iridiums executive vice president in charge of corporate development said in an interview mr thoma said some of the deliberations also have included u s agencies such as the national aeronautics and space administration and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration with nasa noaa and the air force curtailing the number of sensors on future u s weather satellites many federal programs and agencies are "looking for a way to get a ride to space" through an international agreement according to mr thoma jose achache director of geo said in june that his organization hadnt been "very successful" in convincing governments and other international groups to avoid redundancy by dropping plans to develop and launch a bunch of independent earth observation systems but by focusing on iridium mr achache said he hoped to demonstrate potential cost savings for future sensors that would provide information about agriculture fisheries climate change and major storms alexis livanos president of northrop grumman corp s space technology unit told the paris conference that international cooperation is the only option so "the cost of putting up a global system would be affordable " in a document mr achaches office recently sent to the groups members geo said it envisions launching more than separate sensors on iridium satellites designed to measure everything from temperature changes in the atmosphere to changes in radiation and ozone levels to wave heights and ocean levels data would be provided to users in less than an hour iridium "is interested in exploring various business models to reduce total cost and data stream" expenses according to the geo document the geo document also says that partnering with iridium will pave the way for earth observation measurements "with unprecedented detail in a comprehensive coordinated and sustained manner " the document mentions another advantage in using iridiums world wide communications network it would "further allow for the global harmonization" of existing sensors iridiums mr thoma said a decision has to be made around the end of the year whether to start negotiating a detailed partnership agreement with geo final sensor designs have to be locked in by late many of the new satellites intended to be more powerful than current versions are slated to be launched by the middle of the next decade they will be designed to last at least years versus a typical five year operational life for scientific satellites iridium provides voice and data services for businesses governments and other customers and it is expected to have about traditional customers by the time the new constellation is deployed the company previously broached the idea of finding commercial or governmental partners to provide piggyback payloads but until now it didnt provide specifics
