day sign up for the e mail here rupert murdoch once again proved himself to be an irresistible force of the global media industry winning enough support from the bancroft family to seal a deal for dow jones and its flagship wall street journal newspaper and generating both fear and excitement for the business of explaining the world to readers dow jones and mr murdochs news corp early this morning said the two companies boards signed an agreement for a roughly &# billion purchase it wasnt immediately clear whether that includes dow jones debt but as the journal reports the price per share remains the &# mr murdoch initially offered several tumultuous months ago members of the bancroft family and its trustees who control of dow jones voting stock have signed on to the deal the companies said and with a majority of publicly traded shares also expected to accept the premium over dow joness pre offer stock price the vote to be held later this year appears to be a formality the deal adds the journal barrons dow jones newswires and the companys other properties to a conglomerate whose operations range from the new york post and fox news to th century fox studios and myspace with sundry newspapers and broadcast media well placed on at least four continents what the new purchase brings is instant ascendancy in the financial media "combined with the planned beginning of the fox business news channel in october the purchase of dow jones makes mr murdoch the most formidable figure in business news coverage in this country perhaps worldwide " the new york times says for while dow joness vulnerability highlighted the precarious state of the newspaper business at a time when advertising money is flooding from print to online and in ways still difficult to predict mr murdoch has said he will invest in the journal "bolstering its coverage of national affairs and its european and asian editions which could pose a serious challenge to competitors like the financial times and the new york times " the times says "that could mean losing money in the short run something mr murdoch has always been willing to do to attract readers and gain influence " the biggest impact "could be in online and television where mr murdoch has said he sees the greatest opportunity " the journal adds "the market for online financial news is currently fragmented among numerous players " while mr murdoch has dreamed of buying dow jones for at least a decade as the journal recounts the addition of the journal brand authority and reporting resources to the planned fox business channel is widely seen as a justifying factor for the high price he is paying variety argues that while the inchoate channels chief rival cnbc says it wont let the journal break an exclusive news content sharing contract until it runs out in "a situation where the cable net remains in business with the company that is launching its chief competitor is seen as highly untenable " so a deal to buy out that contract could be mr murdochs next move but several people in mr murdochs camp tell the times he may not have a bigger playbook for what hell do with dow jones "theres a very low probability that theres a grand plan " one says what some members of the bancroft family some dow jones employees and critics of mr murdoch across the industry fear is that his plans could include the intrusion of his political and business agendas in the journals coverage a practice that has reportedly taken place at some of his other news outlets "its a bad thing for dow jones and american journalism that the bancroft family could not resist rupert murdochs generous offer " said jim ottaway leader of the family that controls of dow jones votes as usa today reports the bancrofts issued a statement expressing hope that the journal "will continue to enjoy and deserve the universal admiration and respect" it currently has however much some bancrofts resisted the offer the family decided it had no choice the journal says following the chandler familys decision to relinquish ownership of the los angeles times and its stake in tribune and the ridder familys exit from knight ridder the bancrofts were faced with cashing out "or watch their fortunes deteriorate as more readers and advertisers migrate to free online news sources such as yahoo and google " the los angeles times adds "in every family owned business and it is particularly played out in americas newspapers there are usually three groupings you can be in either those who are involved in the deal whove been involved and think its a good idea those who are totally against it because it is the familys heritage and then the third group that says couldnt we get even a little more money " andrew leckey director of the donald w reynolds national center for business journalism at arizona state university tells the newshour with jim lehrer "and these are the three groups that mr murdoch knew would start to deal with each other " many industry analysts suggest the value of the journal brand is in its credibility and that mr murdoch is too savvy a businessman to lose sight of that the dying words of clarence w barron who with his wife bought dow jones in are reported by the journal to be "whats the news " whatever mr murdochs critics are saying one certainty about the deal is how highly valued the answer to that question
