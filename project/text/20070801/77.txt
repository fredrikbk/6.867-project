lofty iberia gets a hard look airline faces stalled cost cuts rising competition as suitors circle madrid as private equity group tpg and british airways plc pore over the books of iberia lineas aereas de espana sa as a prelude to a possible billion euros &# billion bid they are seeking to answer an important question is the spanish airline really worth more than its european peers at a time of wrenching change for europes traditional flagship carriers which have been buffeted by high oil prices and relentless competition from low cost airlines iberia stands apart it has posted a profit for straight years it has a thriving long haul network and has worked hard to cut costs to compete with the legion of low cost airlines that now carry more than one third of europes airline passengers but the ba tpg bid values iberia at a premium to heavyweight european airlines such as deutsche lufthansa ag the carrier also faces plenty of operational challenges from the need for further cost cuts to the increase in competition on some of its most promising routes iberias board already indicated that the tpg led nonbinding bid of euros per share undervalued the company and it is hoping for a higher offer a tpg spokesman declined to comment iberia executives were unavailable to comment ahead of the companys first half results tomorrow iberia spokesman luis diaz guell said the companys operating margins are in line with the rest of europes big carriers such as air france klm sa lufthansa and british airways he also stressed the success iberia has had in attracting premium traffic to its latin american routes which are performing far better than the companys projections executives also have said the company is on track to meet its target of an to cost reduction by the end of compared with almost uniquely among european airlines iberia enjoys a strong net cash position which has increased to billion euros giving the company more margin to weather fuel price increases and fare wars other suitors briefly circled around iberia including air france klm many are hoping that a sale will propel consolidation in the sector particularly in the wake of the italian governments so far futile efforts to find a buyer for unprofitable alitalia spa since european aviation was fully liberalized only one big cross border deal has taken place the merger of air france and klm but analysts and many european airline executives believe consolidation is inevitable greater scale economies make it easier to cut costs and drive revenue as shown by air france klms performance since the merger a new "open skies" treaty between the u s and the european union also lowers some barriers to consolidation by giving all eu airlines equal access to the u s for all the progress iberia has made in recent years it is no ryanair holdings plc one of the most profitable airlines in the world as measured by profit margin iberia reported net profit of million euros in on sales of billion euros for a net profit margin of its operating margin of is largely in line with the rest of the sector but margins that thin can be wiped out by a &# a barrel increase in the price of oil "in a sector facing a lot of challenges iberia is certainly no ugly duckling but its also the most expensive among the network airlines " says chris avery airline analyst with j p morgan in london iberias future profitability hinges on two things its bet on long haul flights and its ability to slash costs the company has shifted capacity from domestic and european routes to more lucrative long haul flights especially to latin america through june iberia reduced capacity domestically and in europe compared with a year earlier while boosting long haul capacity even with the added seats iberia is flying more passengers on the lucrative long haul flights compared with a year earlier and it filled of its seats through june compared with a year earlier thanks to its plush new business class it boosted long haul revenue last year and expects to show better progress when it reports earnings tomorrow but iberias latin american goldmine has attracted increased competition after its merger air france klm became the leading carrier on flights to the region and expects to boost capacity to latin america by an average of per year through compared with iberias to expected annual average growth even lufthansa primarily focused on growth in asia is adding capacity to business routes such as munich sao paulo latin american carriers are also fighting back brazils tam linhas aereas recently announced the purchase of new airbus widebody jets to help complete its transformation from brazils leading domestic airline into an international player iberia also needs to pare costs throughout its operations after years of cutbacks iberias cost cutting appeared to stall last year when unit costs or the cost of flying one passenger one mile the standard industry measure rose more than even excluding fuel costs were flat on the year as a result the stellar long haul performance wasnt enough to offset bleeding in the rest of the network iberia made slightly less money on each seat in than it did in "network airlines always find some more fat to cut " says j p morgans mr avery "but so far the evidence isnt compelling" at iberia he says the airline has hedged half its fuel requirements this year at &# a barrel and has already slashed its fuel spending in the first half of the year with personnel costs now making up a quarter of all spending executives hope a new labor deal will get more work out of their pilots and further trim unit costs iberia however has a long history of combative labor negotiations with its unions especially pilots because iberia has spent years cutting costs it is harder to find new areas to produce savings the carrier put more seats onto each aircraft which trims unit costs it renewed its medium haul fleet with new aircraft that are more fuel efficient and need less maintenance it was among the first network airlines to follow low cost carriers and ditch free food onboard and it also slashed travel agent commissions and started selling more tickets over the internet which is cheaper for the airline to compete head to head with discount carriers iberia last year helped launch a stand alone budget airline clickair based in barcelona it has lower operating costs than the parent company because of more flexible labor contracts fewer frills onboard and because the short haul routes let the company work its planes more jason singer
