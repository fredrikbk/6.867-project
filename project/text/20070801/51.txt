have trombone will travel new york many jazz musicians have been called cultural ambassadors but few if any have taken the concept to the extremes found in the recent music of trombonist roswell rudd mr rudd one of jazzs greatest trombonists has spent the past decade or so in a series of ambitious collaborations with musicians from all over the world when contacted for this story he had just completed three weeks of performances with the beijing based opera singer li xuai feng in china and he was heading to siberia where he and a group of mongolian musicians with whom he has recorded were about to perform aided by a piece orchestra of local artists playing instruments indigenous to the region he has also just released "el espiritu jibaro" sunnyside a recording with yomo toro the puerto rican master of the cuatro a ten stringed guitar and he has completed another with the virtuosic cuban tres master david oquendo many jazz musicians have added an exotic instrument to their otherwise conventional ensembles but in mr rudds case hes often the misfit playing alongside musicians from other traditions developing unique sonic fusions earlier this summer mr rudd brought one of his best known cross cultural projects malicool to the jazz standard in new york for six performances the group formed in and its only recording an eponymous disc released by sunnyside records in is one of the most praised jazz recordings of the decade the malicool project began eight years ago after mr rudds manager verna gillis played him some recordings of toumani diabate a malian kora master the two musicians met in bamako mali in february and the music began to take shape "toumani is one of the best improvisors i have ever heard " said mr rudd via email "with our mutual flexibility we were able to create a musical nucleus that other musicians could easily connect into " in jazz the trombone is often a gruff flamboyant force accenting the emotional extremes of the song to work with the group of malian musicians he and mr diabate assembled mr rudd lightened his approach diminishing the force of his tone and extending the length of his solos to blend with the delicate hypnotic weave of african stringed instruments and balaphones that provide the rhythmic underpinning in malicools sound "i had to find an intensity that didnt overpower their sound " he said the two musicians composed most of the repertoire for the recording but mr rudd brought in one thelonious monk tune "jackie ing " mr rudd thought that the piece resembled some of the malian music he had heard in his visits to bamako however in teaching the music to his bandmates he was surprised by the depths they found in it "they pushed it over a rhythmic edge " he said "i almost had to learn the song all over again " following the recording mr diabate went on to form the symmetric orchestra a jazz influenced big band of malian musicians and released a stellar disc of their work "boulevard de lindependence" nonesuch last summer sadly due to visa problems mr diabate was unable to make the jazz standard engagement instead mr rudd performed with new york based musicians from west africa the gig suffered an additional calamity when the kora player hired to replace mr diabate couldnt make the engagement which robbed the group of a key sound yet in a way this was a blessing in disguise rather than trying to re create a very delicate music that may not have suited a nightclub setting the performance became a band workout with a series of dynamic solos on unusual material providing the peaks mr rudd carried the evening with one rich colorful solo after another mr rudd is years old and during his career he has been at the forefront of many new movements in jazz the yale graduates work was first noticed in the mid and late s while he was playing with a small cadre of young dixieland revivalists he then fell under the sway of monk the legendary pianist and composer and herbie nichols a lesser known but superb pianist mr rudd became a champion of their work co leading ensembles devoted to their repertoire in the mid s he was founding member of the new york art quartet one of the pivotal groups in the rise of the east coast school of avant garde jazz mr rudds interest in world music was nurtured by the great ethnomusicologist alan lomax mr rudds cousin charles kiel was a colleague of mr lomax and the trombonist collaborated with the renowned folklorist in and sporadically for the next years "we were working on a project called cantometrics" mr lomaxs system of statistically analyzing folk songs from all over the world mr rudd says "i helped analyze several thousand field recordings " mr rudd says the experience affected his approach to music "i cant say that my years with lomax impacted my performance style but hearing all these field recordings of them made me more aware of pure melodic resources and possibilities " one of the links mr rudd sees in his various collaborations is collective improvisation it was what first fascinated him about swing music and it enabled him to move comfortably into and within avant garde jazz circles he found that improvisatory verve among the malian musicians as well as his recent caribbean collaborators in contrast to the discreet meticulous sound of malicool "el espiritu jibaro" is a relaxed and rousing program of music in a variety of latin american styles mr rudd and mr toro trade pithy solos and the play of veteran percussionist bobby sanabria provides another highlight mr rudd contributed "bamako " a wistful meditative track on malicool to the sessions and here it is presented with equal success as a fiery merengue mr rudd hasnt forsaken more conventional jazz settings he recently released "airwalkers" clean feed a recording of duets with bassist mark dresser and later this summer he will debut a new quartet with piano bass and vocals at the newport jazz festival he allows that his international collaborations have affected his forays within standard jazz boundaries "i just sing on the trombone and put all the colors i can into it " he said "these projects enable me to bring more of whats possible in terms of melody and rhythm " mr johnson writes about jazz for the journal
