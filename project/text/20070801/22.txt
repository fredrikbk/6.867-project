corrected special education letters in yesterdays letters to the editor some early editions duplicated a paragraph in two separate letters due to an editing error the letters commented on the july page one article "staying the course schools beat back demands for special ed services " the full correct versions run below as the father of a mildly autistic first grade boy i would like to say thanks for your series of articles that have brought the challenges of special education to light when i tell family or friends the things we have had to endure they think i am exaggerating your articles and this one in particular make me want to plead and beg all the more for real school choice and vouchers the public school system in this country is broken union thugs and overpaid fat cat administrators dont want things to change or improve because they are making vast sums of money on the backs of our children they dont seem to care if that includes children with special needs hired chiselers like paul kelly the new york state review officer for special education cases and kathleen surgalla an assistant counsel for the state education department set such a good example for the children by living together it takes real ethics to stick it to handicapped children william h cole saint charles mo as the white parent of an adopted african american child with a host of mental and physical issues i read your article with a great deal of interest our family lives in rural minnesota and our son attends our small k public school despite all these supposed strikes against his receiving a solid education i can honestly say that we have never encountered the difficulties described by the subjects of your article not once have we been forced to an administrative hearing or ever been at odds with the school but our sons issues are true physical and mental disabilities it would appear that the subjects of your article are primarily encountering resistance to unlimited special education services due to "social disabilities " not true "learning disabilities " as one subject of your article put it "kids dont kill themselves because they cant pass algebra they kill themselves because they dont have friends " this emphasis on social problems is exactly what causes the disconnect between some special education families and their districts while parents want their schools to be all things to all kids the simple fact is that schools arent equipped nor should they be to handle every imaginable issue that comes their way a public school isnt a therapists office it isnt equipped to teach a child with problems in social settings to deal with these issues if a special education parent has a child with primarily social issues they would probably be better served spending less time in the courts and more time looking into private solutions for their children at their own expense while this may not be the most charitable response one would expect from a parent with a child such as mine it is the only sensible and rational answer there is michael j corbin medford minn
