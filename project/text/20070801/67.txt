it all began in the basement of a candy store dow jones saga reflects the forces that shaped the wall street journal clarence w barrons last words a secretary reported were "whats the news " a newshound to his dying day mr barron believed something many of his contemporaries scoffed at you could make money selling news about business like the founders of dow jones &amp co which mr barron and his wife jessie bought in he believed that someday financial news would be valuable even to people who didnt work on wall street in mr barrons era business news was considered parochial and dull mr barron and a succession of dow jones editors and publishers would change those perceptions using linotype ticker tape printing presses radio television and bits and bytes they would prove that timely reliable financial information was the fundamental currency of almost every part of life from building railroads to buying kitchen sinks at the same time they would create a profitable and principled corporation stretching around the world but dow jones would also have its share of failures including the national observer and telerate and an insider trading scandal the family that largely controlled the company descendants of jessie barron and her daughter from a prior marriage jane mrs hugh bancroft let the top executives run the business but the family didnt always agree with their decisions or with one another cautious and conservative the company was often behind the curve on developing new channels to deliver information recently it sometimes seemed as though wall street itself had turned against the company and its inert stock price like most of their successors for better and worse charles dow and edward jones were journalists first businessmen second they had been working for a wall street information broker for two years when they and a third partner charles bergstresser decided to go into the financial news business for themselves in they opened shop in the basement of a lower manhattan candy store which is now home to the new york stock exchange seven years later the wall street journal was born mr dow a reserved and tenacious reporter who took notes on his shirt cuffs had already earned the reputation as a man who got his quotes right mr jones was a high spirited bon vivant with a knack for analyzing financial reports in those days a financial journalist was a combination private detective stenographer and gossip columnist "gathering news was a bare knuckle business " wrote oliver gingold who joined dow jones in and stayed for six decades "many companies refused to issue annual reports even to their own stockholders " reporters spent long hours "waiting outside directors rooms or corporate offices for a chance at buttonholing an insider " messengers shadowing the reporters ran the news back to the office where scribes made carbon copies as many as at a time that were hand delivered to subscribers what soon distinguished dow jones from its competitors was its revolutionary approach to financial journalism instead of collaborating with companies and investors to manipulate the financial markets and taking a piece of the action they would try to impartially distinguish fact from rumor from the beginning they forbade their employees from investing in companies they were covering a rule sometimes observed in the breach an early wall street journal motto was succinct but audacious "the truth in its proper use " the early journal was aimed explicitly at "operators bankers and capitalists" who would find in it "essential statistics compiled so that their pith and bearing can be readily remembered " much of its early coverage focused on the booming railroads one news story was headlined "it is not true that the railroad trunk lines have agreed to pro rate with the western roads " for many years the journal had no real competition but its narrow focus and drab prose slowed its circulation growth at a time when many american newspapers were growing rapidly the paper had subscribers when mr barron bought the company in for &# but mr barron and many future editors and publishers liked the idea that their readers were an elite class wealthier better educated and more influential than average it meant the company could charge both subscribers and advertisers a premium for joining the club although opinion was banished from its news columns the journal published clearly marked editorials commenting on political and economic disputes william hamilton who became the editorial page editor in set the agenda unfettered free market capitalism for the most part that meant supporting republican political candidates and opposing taxes trade barriers and other "half baked socialist schemes " as mr hamilton wrote "wall street has no prejudices " he said disingenuously "it likes the man it can trust as for instance calvin coolidge it merely wonders why the democratic party does not develop the courage of its own convictions " years later president harry s truman said "that wall street journal is the republican bible " charles dows other lasting legacy was creating and branding a market statistic at a time when many people thought the financial markets were so irrational or corrupt as to be essentially chaotic mr dow thought the markets might be more like the ocean someone "who wishes to know the exact spot which marks the high tide sets a stick in the sand at the points reached by the incoming waves until the stick reaches a position where the waves do not come up to it " he explained he began publishing the combined average price of stocks mostly railroad companies in the dow jones average of industrial stocks appeared in the company also expanded into the telegraph ticker business in promising fast and simultaneous distribution of news to brokerage houses across the country the ticker news service though traditionally a less glamorous branch of the company than the newspaper has been its financial savior during some lean times mr jones left dow jones in to join a brokerage house where he could make more money to fund the high life he so enjoyed mr dow in failing health sold the company to mr barron and his wife three years later mr barron was the ideal steward for a company selling financial news when american businesses generating huge profits were flexing their muscles ebullient and self confident mr barron expanded the papers coverage while preserving its independence as the paper became more influential market manipulators applied more pressure on mr barron and his staff usually but not always with little effect "i dont make or unmake enterprises " mr barron wrote "i only decide what enterprises we will give a chance to unmake dow jones &amp co and the wall street journal " mr barron also continued other dow jones traditions using simple spare prose that would "economize the readers time" training the companys own staff discouraging reporters from being prima donnas and warning employees that despite their long hours they would never get rich working for dow jones during poor times reporters would be told to take "scotch vacations" time off with no pay but during the s as the dow jones industrial average more than tripled to the newspaper and its ticker service also flourished during the last years of his reign mr barron saw one of his longtime ideals coming true more ordinary americans were investing in the stock market buying a stake in the countrys growing wealth when mr barron died in october at the age of the mood of the u s was buoyant "the outlook for the fall months seems brighter than at any time in recent years " the journal proclaimed in august even after black tuesday oct the worst selloff in stock market history the journals page one headline read "stocks steady after decline " but the companys unshaken faith in the u s financial markets couldnt protect it from the depression the company watched helplessly as customers and advertisers walked away circulation of the journal dropped by almost as did the number of pages per issue as wall street and the u s economy began rebounding in the late s and s so did dow jones but the days when the stock market was a free for all for insiders and their dupes were ending the government was reining in the manipulators and leveling the playing field with better communication and transportation companies were scaling local boundaries and becoming regional or national by the s a businessman in portland maine might want the same financial news as a businessman in portland ore as bernard "barney" kilgore liked to say journal readers also wanted some relief from the gobbledygook of most financial reports they had found an ideal translator in mr kilgore a young journal reporter who wrote a series of columns called "dear george " in which he tried to deconstruct financial news for a hypothetical ordinary person the popularity of these stories persuaded the journals management that if they wanted to continue expanding their readership they had to tell a story as mr kilgore later said "the easiest thing in the world for any reader to do is to stop reading " mr kilgore became the journals managing editor in at the age of for the next years he methodically rebuilt the paper from the ground up increasing circulation from to million probably more than any editor before or since mr kilgore defined the mission culture and style of the wall street journal all in perfect tune with sweeping changes in american business and society "his perception was in seeing that the nation at work is the same everywhere labor capital enterprise and the problems that grow out of all three are the tie that binds " said a journal eulogy when mr kilgore died in unassuming but intensely ambitious mr kilgore recognized that the journal could and should be more than a trade paper it should appeal to "everyone who is engaged in making a living or is interested in how other people make a living " he said in other words dont write banking stories for bankers write for the banks customers brokers are nice people he said there just arent enough of them to keep a first class newspaper afloat he also joked that he had written a headline that could top almost any story the paper published "giant firm on the rocks " most newspapers in mr kilgores era were worshipping at the altar of the five ws the first sentence of a story would answer the questions who what where when and why the style made for fast objective stories but sometimes left the reader puzzling over what it all meant mr kilgore liked "situation" stories which described an event or debate and then appraised it from different angles a situation "doesnt have to have happened today to be news " he said he was also the architect of the papers distinctive front page six almost unbroken columns of type with no advertising which survived until mr kilgore wanted the new york and pacific coast editions of his "national newspaper" to look as much alike as possible which meant no photos because they couldnt be easily and clearly transmitted but better technology gradually enabled the company to set up printing plants and reporting bureaus across the country dow jones earned more than &# million in the last full year of mr kilgores formal leadership compared with some &# in when he became the companys president but mr kilgore was responsible for one high profile business failure hoping to attract younger readers the television generation in he started a weekly general interest newspaper the national observer to cover "the business of living " scrappy unpredictable and highly polished the observer attracted a respectable number of readers at its peak in but could never make national advertisers understand the value of a newspaper that seemed more like a magazine impatient with its drag on earnings warren phillips chairman of dow jones in announced that the "long effort to make the observer self sufficient" hadnt succeeded in its years of publication the paper cost the company about &# million some people believed that if mr kilgore hadnt died in at the age of he would have been able to save what he called his "baby " so iconic a figure was mr kilgore in the dow jones culture that succeeding generations of managers encountering a new idea or problem asked themselves "what would barney do " but the observers demise was a small setback compared with the vitality of the wall street journal which had become the largest paid circulation newspaper in america between and circulation more than doubled to million advertising rates rose more than a year between and but advertisers didnt seem to mind occasionally they had to be turned away because the journals presses were operating at capacity the staff expanded to cover such traditionally "noncore" subjects as law real estate entertainment and health care and if most journal employees were still not going to get rich even in the boom years they enjoyed generous benefits other media companies couldnt help but notice most publishers had traditionally considered business a secondary topic interesting only to a handful of readers the topic of money and how to invest it stepped out of the shadows white collar workers and wealthy retirees had iras and tax shelters zero coupon bonds and reverse mortgages anyone who earned an income had to become an amateur money manager to maximize returns they needed information competitors investors daily financial times money magazine the new york times usa today and eventually television set up shop in dow joness territory but something even more threatening to dow joness supremacy was slowly advancing into americas offices including the journals own newsrooms computers although the internet was still years away for most people it was clear even in the s that computers were an extremely fast and efficient means of distributing information in michael bloomberg started a company offering a fast but user friendly system of analyzing and manipulating electronic securities data although dow jones went public in the bancrofts remained in control and for the most part kept their hands off the company except for taking dividend checks they were almost as protective of their executives as they were of their own family and they continued the tradition begun with mr kilgore of putting journalists in charge of the company mr phillips rose from the copy desk to managing editor before serving as chief executive for years his successor peter kann who won a pulitzer prize for his coverage of the india pakistan war also held the position for years until he reached mandatory retirement age this year the family accepted the leaner profit margins and sometimes big blunders as unfortunate but pardonable and the chief executives returned the favors in the company approved a new class of shares for the bancroft family that had times the voting power of common shares this allowed family members to cash out some of their common shares while retaining control if the family stuck together the thinking went dow jones would be invulnerable to hostile suitors these actions buffered the company from corporate raiders but also gave its managers and directors a false sense of security and management kept the family happy with a steady flow of dividends everyone knew dow jones had to diversify by the late s it had become clear that the journal was not immune to business cycles furthermore cable and computers were going to sell financial information faster and cheaper than newspapers what the journal had that so many competitors didnt was a superior product its information was valuable because it was quick and dependable it just needed to be repackaged to take advantage of new technology dow jones needed to get into two businesses electronic data publishing and cable television despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars dow jones didnt do either successfully whether these failures were due to lack of nerve or poor execution the result was the same dow jones was left behind in dow jones bought a stake in telerate founded in it was a leader in the booming business of digital market data particularly real time prices of u s treasury securities on which it had a virtual monopoly the company had grown rapidly in the s supplying statistics to tens of thousands of dedicated terminals around the world in the early s the company reported annual earnings growth of more than for five straight years even as the british news service reuters was beginning to take some of telerates business dow jones continued to buy pieces of the company in dow jones raised its stake to in to and in to total control in all dow jones paid &# billion for telerate the two companies also turned out to be a ruinous mismatch to hold its own with reuters and the wunderkind bloomberg telerate would have to be imaginative nimble and focused and it would have to invest millions more in developing new programs for managing data but dow jones executives had little experience with that kind of work while reuters and bloomberg were plowing millions back into their systems dow jones was using telerate to beef up the companys bottom line although dow jones finally realized telerate needed a massive infusion of capital if it was to remain competitive in it budgeted &# million for a complete overhaul it was too late bloomberg and reuters had eclipsed telerate by when dow jones sold the division it had cost the company more than &# billion the companys attempts to get into television were less costly but equally fruitless in early dow jones in partnership with westinghouse broadcasting co agreed to buy the ailing financial news network for about &# million it was an agreement in principle only and before it was consummated general electric co s cable news service cnbc offered &# million which the fnn promptly accepted dow jones and westinghouse called foul and a brisk bidding war ensued when the dust settled cnbc owned fnn and dow jones was still looking for a way to get into television in in partnership with itt dow jones bought wnyc tv from new york city for &# million and started wbis perhaps because it had been outbid for fnn dow jones lavished millions of dollars on the project hiring an expensive staff and building a state of the art television studio only a year later dow jones and itt sold wbis for &# million and laid off some employees that year dow jones reported its first annual loss other large traditional newspapers were also struggling newsprint staff and distribution were all expensive compared with electronic information advertisers and subscribers had more choices about where to spend their money and time but even by comparison with its cohort dow joness profit margins were thin except for its profitable interactive edition wsj com which now has paid subscribers there appeared to be no engines of growth for the company while its core product was struggling the journal remained one of the largest and most respected newspapers in the country but dow jones as a whole seemed to have no clear idea of how to leverage its brand in the late s two sets of dow jones stockholders one from wall street and one from the bancroft family began agitating for change from wall street money managers michael price and james cramer acting separately acquired nearly of the outstanding shares they werent the kinds of investors who waited uncomplainingly for assets to appreciate two young members of the bancroft family elisabeth goth and william cox iii also decided they could no longer rubber stamp the decisions of the companys management and board in interviews for several newspaper and magazine articles they made it clear they expected more from their trust fund than they were getting but the rest of the family and the board hunkered down and waited for the threat to pass and it did only months after buying his dow jones stake mr cramer sold it telling the new york times "im discouraged im going elsewhere " and the senior bancrofts effectively quashed the young cousins rebellion although dow jones stock performed poorly in recent years the company was far from deaths door under norman pearlstine the journals managing editor between and and his successor paul e steiger the journal was reinvented again the paper added color and photographs grew to four sections and added a saturday edition the journals news department won pulitzer prizes during mr steigers tenure including one for its breaking news coverage of the sept terrorist attacks even though its own office was covered in debris from the collapse of the world trade center across the street reporters and editors decamped to dow jones headquarters in south brunswick n j to produce the paper that day and many remained there for nearly a year before the new york office was habitable again into the new millennium readers and journalists alike continued to consider the journal one of the best written best reported newspapers in the country deputy managing editor byron e "barney" calame who retired in kept such a stern watch over the papers ethics and language that editors debating a questionable quote or assertion once again asked themselves "what would barney do " the journals new sections the weekend journal and the personal journal and the saturday edition were created to expand readership and attract consumer advertising during the dot com bubble advertising was strong and dow joness stock price jumped to more than &# a share in but when that bubble burst dow jones and particularly the wall street journal was hit hard for the fourth quarter of dow joness earnings fell more than from a year earlier since then ad revenue and circulation growth at the journal have stalled the company has trimmed expenses as well as the physical size of the paper and for the first time since mr kilgore banned the practice sold advertising space on its front page it also expanded its electronic portfolio by acquiring marketwatch an online financial news service in with the mandatory retirement of both the companys chairman mr kann and the managing editor mr steiger this year the company presented a tempting target to the right buyer now rupert murdoch becomes the heir to the credo posted on clarence barrons office wall a century ago "the wall street journal must stand for the best that is in wall street and reflect that which is best in united states finance "
