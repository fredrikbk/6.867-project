common sense with asset boom essentially over is it time to buy smartmoney the great asset boom is over market historians may want to mark last wednesday july on their calendars to note the end of an era thats the day the cerberus led high yield debt offering for chrysler collapsed or perhaps its july the day the dow jones industrial average closed over or maybe its june when private asset manager blackstone group went public after last weeks stock market carnage and debt market paralysis they already seem like distant memories lets step back a moment from the subprime crisis which morphed into a mortgage backed securities crisis into a collateralized debt obligation crisis into a junk bond collapse and now a credit freeze what should be clear by now is that global liquidity is part of one continuous stream and when one of the springs that feeds it in this instance mortgage money dries up the stream shrinks to a trickle this is not as most had expected because long term interest rates have risen after briefly surging above hardly catastrophic they are again well below that level investors were so fixated on interest rates that they lost sight of the other side of the equation asset values high leverage makes sense as long as asset values kept climbing but the moment appreciation falls below the cost of capital or worse actually declines the leverage effect goes into reverse leading to massive losses asset values couldnt keep climbing forever investors in everything from real estate to precious metals and other commodities to art and collectibles had been enjoying annualized rates of return over real estate was the first to go into reverse and thats where the first tremors started but now the effects are coursing throughout the financial system as investors are re evaluating risk in everything from private equity buyouts to emerging market debt despite all the attention given to last weeks stock market meltdown stocks were one of the last asset classes to experience the lift from all that cheap liquidity and thus in my view are among the least overvalued indeed in a world where almost everything was highly overvalued large cap growth stocks such as microsoft and intel both of which i own and have recommended were reasonably priced even with last weeks turmoil most market averages remain solidly in positive territory for the year small cap stocks which have led the decline were flat some technicians have pointed out that bull markets typically end in selling climaxes big gains on high volume accompanied by soaring investor optimism not sudden declines but in the long term occasional corrections like the one now under way are healthy inevitable and set the stage for future gains as investors we cant predict the future but we can be prepared if youve followed my advice in this column youve already taken some profits and have cash at your disposal you dont need to sell into a falling market and are positioned to take advantage of it but many readers have asked if its too late to sell its not but barely its very late in the game if you havent raised any cash in this aging bull market and feel you need to you should move swiftly the more timely question is whether its time to buy the answer not yet the common sense approach is to buy lower sell higher and stocks are now indisputably lower than they were just a week ago i buy at intervals of declines in the nasdaq composite which peaked at on july a decline would take it to which is my new buying target even though were not there yet you should begin to map out a buying strategy at this rate it may not be long before its time to implement it with other asset classes correcting even more drastically it may soon be time to consider buying strategies that go beyond stocks but its still early given how overvalued many assets had become and how long the rally continued i expect them to fall much further before real bargains begin to appear it could easily take another year or two for example before junk bonds bottom out and real estate is anybodys guess lets look on the bright side for now you can say goodbye to the &# a square foot manhattan condos the &# million midlevel wall street bonuses the &# billion private equity moguls the wall street bashes with live appearances by aging rock stars and the &# million andy warhol car crash paintings wont that be a relief james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
