securities derived from home mortgages the dow jones industrial average which had been up more than points closed down points or from a day earlier at a swing of nearly points or more than u s treasury bonds rallied as investors sought the stability of government backed bonds the nervousness was fed by rumors of troubles at hedge funds that are invested heavily in mortgage securities bear stearns its reputation already dented after two of its hedge funds that bet heavily on securities connected to risky home loans blew up in june has prevented investors from taking their money from another fund that put about &# million into mortgage investments in recent weeks as the housing market continued to weaken and trading firms began to price many mortgage investments at discounted levels bear executives realized their asset backed securities fund was facing a rough july said people familiar with their thinking unlike bears other two funds these people said the asset backed fund borrowed no capital and had practically no exposure to subprime mortgages as home loans extended to people with weak credit are known but a combination of markdowns on a broad range of mortgages and a series of refund requests could force the fund out of business eventually according to one person familiar with the situation a spokesman for the firm disputes that however "there are no plans to shut down the fund " said russell sherman a bear spokesman "we believe the fund portfolio is well positioned to wait out the market uncertainty and we believe by suspending redemptions we can ensure the best long term results for our investors we dont believe its prudent or in the interest of our investors to sell assets in this current market environment " traders said yesterdays stock market selloff was ignited by a warning from american home mortgage that pressure to repay its creditors may cause it to liquidate its assets its shares subsequently plunged to &# several wall street firms have loaned money to american home the th largest u s home mortgage lender in this years first half according to inside mortgage finance a trade publication the melville n y company said turbulent

to cash in case the credit environment worsens the insurance sector was also singed as two large mortgage insurers saw their share prices drop sharply after announcing that their stakes in a firm that invests in subprime mortgages had been "materially impaired " what spooked investors in mgic investment corp and radian group inc was the firms holdings in credit based asset servicing and

watchers say that as niche funds heavily exposed to u s credit markets assess their value at the end of july more may report significant falls in value the director of macquarie fortress investments peter lucas said the average price of assets in the portfolios had fallen by in june and may have fallen a further to in july so the funds face possible margin calls from their lenders if they arent able to sell enough assets to reduce leverage so far though broader market fallout from the growing subprime crisis has been limited even as the two giant bear hedge funds blew up this summer for instance the stock market reached new heights but the hope that subprime troubles will remain contained is being tested although corporate balance sheets are largely in good shape for example corporate bonds have been hit hard over the past month pushing yields sharply higher notes itg economist robert barbera one reason the securities backed by corporate debt and subprime mortgages have similar structures leading many investors to question whether the design rather than the underlying assets is the real problem this suspicion has driven up the yields corporate issuers must pay investors which in turn has hurt stocks by making it more expensive for companies to finance share buybacks and for private equity players to finance buyouts this crisis of confidence is at the root of both american homes and bears current woes in american homes case banks including ubs ag bear stearns and j p morgan chase &amp co said they wouldnt extend the company any more funds some lenders have demanded the return of money already lent as for the latest bear hedge fund to run into trouble investors began demanding their money back even though the fund wasnt heavily exposed to subprime mortgages bears fund has roughly &# million of cash at the moment and stands to take in tens of millions of dollars in coming months according to someone familiar with its performance but it doesnt have enough cash to meet investors current redemption requests say other people close to the matter and an estimated july loss to the fund of or more convinced bear executives that those requests should be frozen investor and lender skittishness can feed on itself the funds being hit by investors redemption demands or their banks margin calls requests for additional cash or collateral can be forced to sell their holdings at reduced prices further lowering the market value of these assets that in turn hurts other investors who hold similar assets it is too soon to determine whether such a cycle is setting in in fact some investors are circling in search of bargains in bond and loan investments a sign of underlying demand that could help stabilize these markets still even relatively high quality mortgage assets are being marked down one investor received an email from credit suisse securities a unit of credit suisse group that was acting as a dealer rather than as a principal
