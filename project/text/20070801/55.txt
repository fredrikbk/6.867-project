how bill walsh changed the game of football if there were a mount rushmore for football coaches the four heads would be likenesses of george halas paul brown vince lombardi and bill walsh mr walsh who died of leukemia last monday at age is the one whose record would need the most justification to future generations of football fans after all of the four mr walsh had the fewest career victories counting postseason games to go with defeats and one tie and he won the fewest number of championships three halas won six in his seasons brown had seven in years four with the old all america football conference and three in the nfl and lombardi had five in seasons how then to explain the greatness of bill walsh first mr walsh was a superb college coach exactly how good well never know because he chose to coach twice at stanford a school far too academically oriented to compete with national football powerhouses yet in five seasons he established a respectable record recruiting just before he left to go to the san francisco ers a promising young quarterback named john elway second with the ers whom he coached from to mr walsh reigned during the most competitive era in nfl history a time when you had to win three postseason games to get a championship ring and then there was the astonishing level of success he had in that era inheriting one of the worst franchises in the league he finished just in raised that record to the following season and by his third year had the ers at before coaching them to their first super bowl victory after the first two losing seasons in which mr walsh rebuilt the entire ers franchise from the front office to the field his teams won an eye popping out of games over eight seasons for a won lost percentage of just under no pro football coach in his own time and few ever had mr walshs ability to perceive hidden greatness nothing illustrates this better than his two most celebrated players quarterback joe montana and receiver jerry rice by consensus the greatest pass catch combination in nfl history most nfl teams regarded mr montanas arm as substandard and some thought he lacked the toughness of a starting nfl passer he wound up as a third round pick the nd overall player selected in the draft mr rice seemed like even more of a long shot though mr walsh drafted him for the niners in the first round of the draft mr rice was from tiny mississippi valley state a division aa school and some scouts thought he was too slow to play in the nfl he holds league records for most passes caught and most touchdowns scored so successful were mr walsh and ers owner eddie debartolo jr in the spotting development and stockpiling of talent that other nfl owners combined to put a clamp on them the salary cap restrictions implemented by the nfls power structure brought an end to a time when any team could have as mr walsh did a joe montana leading the offense and a steve young waiting on the bench to sub for him no other team has ever had two such superlative passers on its roster at one time it was as an innovator and as an influence though that mr walsh outstripped all other coaches he changed the way the game was played his name will be forever associated with the term "west coast offense " which has come to mean many things to many people but in essence meant to mr walsh a system where the quarterback took a quick drop into the pocket usually just three steps and hit a receiver with a relatively short high percentage pass while the man was in full stride thus making the most of the extraordinary athletic ability of players such as mr rice and john taylor more than those of any other coach mr walshs teams were capable of striking any receiver from any point on the field in virtually any game situation this is an oversimplification of mr walshs philosophy but throughout his career he never deviated from it and it changed football from the pro ranks all the way down to college and even high school under mr walsh the primacy of the pass over the run as an offensive weapon was established once and for all michael lewiss recent best seller "blind side " traces the development of a talented high school offensive left tackle who became one of the most valuable commodities for college recruiters precisely because of tactics introduced by mr walsh in the mid s his football genius wasnt confined to offense either the defensive domination of his championship teams mirrored that of the offense it was as a teacher though that mr walsh had his greatest and most lasting influence on football unlike lombardi who left worshippers but no disciples mr walsh spawned an entire generation of acolytes his defensive coordinator george seifert won two super bowls with san francisco his offensive coordinator mike holmgren won one with green bay mr seiferts pupil mike shanahan schooled in mr walshs methods won two more with denver mr walshs influence on football today is so pervasive that nearly years after his final game the super bowl has practically become an annual showcase for his adherents this past february indianapolis coach tony dungy a former player under mr walsh squared off against the chicago bears lovie smith who trained as an assistant to dennis green once a walsh receivers coach that messrs dungy and smith were the first african american coaches to reach the super bowl highlights perhaps mr walshs greatest legacy in he helped create the minority coaching fellowship program "i can tell you this " says mr dungy "his life was about much more than just xs and os "
