politics &amp economics strapped fda turns to states amid food safety scares agency asks for help with inspections for several months amid food scares ranging from tainted pet food to canned chili with botulism the food and drug administrations cash strapped food program has been struggling to demonstrate that it can police the nations food supply now it is taking steps to rely more heavily on the states for help yesterday the fda announced new voluntary standards that it said would lead to uniform high quality state food safety programs margaret glavin associate commissioner for regulatory affairs called the shift a significant step toward "integrating our food safety system " the move amounted to an acknowledgment increasingly discussed within the fda in recent months that federal and state officials need to combine forces to combat food safety problems in an internal fda document dated april that was reviewed by the wall street journal robert brackett director of the agencys food safety center said that because of limited resources the agency must "rely more on state regulatory agencies and other food safety partners to ensure basic public health protections are continued " the new standards which the agency said have been under development for a decade will apply to state agencies that regulate facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food under the fdas jurisdiction they will initially be tested in new york oregon and missouri the agencys move comes as states are becoming increasingly aggressive in trying to bolster food safety for example new york working with the fda has in recent years developed the most sophisticated food safety program in the country focusing both on domestic foods and imports such as mexican candies and asian seafood it also has been working with states such as texas to implement similar programs meanwhile california is stepping up scrutiny of fresh produce under a new voluntary agreement with produce handlers and nearly two dozen state legislatures this year have debated or passed legislation related to food safety according to the national conference of state legislatures traditionally state and local governments inspect retail outlets such as grocery stores and restaurants as well as the supply chain from farms to warehouses states and the fda both have authority over food processing facilities the fda has largely handled imports even as it has been increasingly swamped by the globalization of the food trade but with the fda inspecting less than of imports states are stepping in joseph corby director of division of food safety and inspection at the new york state department of agriculture and markets in albany says that the new york fda collaboration provides benefits to both if fda inspectors find tainted food at the border new york inspectors will be on the lookout throughout the state for suspect items that might have slipped through likewise if state inspectors find contaminated food in stores theyll notify the fda which can block similar items from entering the country and if the fda wants products seized immediately mr corby says the state can do it for them faster currently the state has more than food safety inspectors including six who have been trained by the fda to monitor imports the inspectors including three chinese speakers russian speakers and spanish speakers helped trigger product recalls last year of them involving imports in all the state seized million pounds of products and destroyed million of them that included chinese infant formula turkish strawberry syrup russian fluid milk gum balls from egypt and dried bats from africa the partnership between new york and the fda was born out of necessity mr corby figures about one third of food imports in the u s enter through the new york region with a diverse immigrant population many of the states food establishments are filled with foods from developing countries but the fdas new york district like the rest of the agency has suffered from funding shortfalls in a presentation in june a top fda official said the number of fda staffers regularly performing inspections of imports fell to last year from in one of mr corbys inspectors last year helped crack an import violation case that led to the first arrest under a requirement part of the bioterrorism act that requires importers to notify the fda in advance of what they are bringing into the country the inspector clarence davis said he was on his routine visits in champlain n y when he heard from the fda that an importer had attempted to cross the canadian border after the fda office closed at night he got the importers invoice tracked down the stores in new york that were to receive the products and found out that the stores knew nothing about that importer he reported that to the fda and a federal investigation followed and the importer pleaded guilty in february to import violations mr corby is well known among asian and russian trade groups among others sungsoo kim president of the korean american small business service center of new york says mr corby helped him set up a food safety
