earmarks as usual its almost too stereotypical to be true even as the fbi and irs raided the home of alaska senator ted stevens this week as part of a corruption investigation congress is quietly moving to dismantle serious earmark reform if the members are wondering why their approval ratings have gone subterranean this is it not that theyve had time for soul searching amid all their self congratulation over yesterdays house passage of its ethics and lobbying bill republicans and democrats alike are bragging that theyve now banned such occasions of sin as having lunch with a lobbyist or traveling on a corporate jet only congressfolk could take pride in claiming they can be corrupted by a free lunch these ethics "reforms" do less to limit the members than they do to limit the ability of voters to influence their elected representatives as for members restraining themselves they once promised more transparency and limits for the pork barrel projects known as "earmarks " these secret spending handouts have proliferated in recent years and in alone cost taxpayers some &# billion worse they are a kind of gateway drug used to buy votes for even greater spending as the last unlamented republican congress showed all too well earmarks are also major opportunities for corruption the current investigation into mr stevens the long time head of the senate appropriations committee centers on whether he may have directed millions in earmarks to benefit family friends and business partners he says he has nothing to hide voters loathe this way of doing business and democrats did well last year campaigning to end the earmark status quo the public embarrassment also allowed republican senators jim demint and tom coburn to shame majority leader harry reid into agreeing to meaningful reform in january yet when the final reform emerged from congressional backrooms last week any serious reform had vanished mr reid and house speaker nancy pelosi proceeded to bring the bill to the floor in a fast track procedure that has avoided most public scrutiny and limited the ability of reformers to offer amendments to restore the cuts what remains is a sham of a reform a prohibition on allowing members to trade earmarks for votes gone a restriction on allowing members and their staff from promoting earmarks from which they or their families would receive a direct financial benefit all but gone the original reform required earmarks to be listed on the internet and searchable hours before consideration of legislation the new bill says this is only required if it is "technically feasible " heres betting congress finds other urgent uses for its tech staff during appropriations season our favorite switcheroo under the previous senate reform the senate parliamentarian would have determined whether a bill complied with earmark disclosure rules under mr reids new version the current majority leader that is mr reid himself will decide if a bill is in compliance when was the last time a majority party leader declared one of his own bills out of order all of this would seem to be a political opportunity for republicans to educate voters about this democratic about face and regain some of their credibility on spending instead house republicans behaved like a docile minority begging for a few spending favors of their own many were afraid to oppose a bill that includes the word "ethics " in the senate messrs demint and coburn are at least considering further blocking moves but we hear the rest of the gop is split about whether to support the reformers minority parties dont become majorities again by helping democrats pass legislation and then hoping to catch a few crumbs of credit meanwhile democrats are proving that its spending as usual on capitol hill earmarks are political currency that the leadership will still be able to trade for votes and members will use for incumbent protection their ethics reform will even allow members to accept all the free lunches they want from lobbyists so long as those meals are classified as "campaign" events look for many more such midday fund raisers
