technology portals math whizzes at conference prove just how exciting the tate conjecture can be one is tempted to feel sorry for mathematicians in contrast to say physicists mathematicians dont have their own nobel prize they rarely get hired by hedge funds they dont have grand toys like particle accelerators to play with and their work is usually so recondite that not even their families understand it but save your pity as this crowd has a blast doing what it does how else can you explain or so renowned mathematicians spending all of last week sitting happily in barely comfortable chairs inside a joyless conference room working to on a dense math problem without stopping so much as to check their blackberrys the scene was in palo alto calif at a workshop sponsored by the american institute of mathematics the institute is funded by in large part by john fry the owner of a chain of computer and electronics stores mr fry is a math buff but also something of a thomas pynchon figure in that he declines all requests for interviews among its activities the institute sponsors weeklong workshops on important math problems that are designed to allow for more give and take than occurs at traditional academic conferences the topic of last weeks workshop was the tate conjecture put forward in the s by john tate a famed american mathematician who now years old was in attendance front and center his conjecture is closely connected with the hodge conjecture one of the seven well publicized math problems for which the clay mathematics institute founded by another rich american businessman is offering a &# million prize apiece to solve there is enough of a link between tate and hodge that dinakar ramakrishnan of caltech who along with uscs wayne raskind planned the conference joked that the person solving tate should get &# mathematicians are slightly sensitive about their reputation as loners but not only were the ones in attendance last week well socialized they also told some good jokes at their own expense for example how can you spot the extroverted mathematician hes the one staring at the other persons shoes and while their shop talk had a tendency to begin with phrases like "fix a set s such that " they also worried as much as anyone else about prosaic matters like what gifts to take home afterward for the kids so what exactly is the tate conjecture unfortunately even for a layperson who keeps up with math who recognizes names like fermat riemann and poincare math at this level is all but impossible to grasp the author of a book on the clay prizes suggested that confused lay readers just skip the chapter on hodge one explanation of it is to say that mathematicians often find it useful to study the solution to a complicated equation by transforming it into a shape the tate conjecture provides guidance on how closely that shape corresponds to the numbers in the original solution to someone who knows the field though thats about as useful as explaining baseball by saying it involves a bat and a round object in addition to "what is it " the other question for which mathematicians are braced but which they also usually dont enjoy answering is "whats the practical application " in truth many mathematicians like to work on things simply because they find them interesting having said that the field has a pretty good track record over the centuries for being useful in this vein it is fitting that the institutes current headquarters is in a building that also houses one of mr frys computer stores take a tour of the store with a mathematician like steven g krantz the institutes deputy director and you embark on a history of math through the prism of silicon valley technologies the aisles of cds and dvds for instance lead to the tale of joseph fourier the th century french mathematician whose ideas about modeling the spread of heat would one day lead to digital music and movies over the five days of the conference last week the mathematicians did what people do at most any workshop they listened to presentations broke up into small groups gossiped over drinks before dinner took a group picture and celebrated with a banquet at a local chinese restaurant in the end they didnt prove or disprove the tate conjecture but no one was expecting them to because a solution might not arise for many years despite nearly centuries of trying mathematicians still dont know the truth or falsehood of the twin prime conjecture which holds that there are infinitely many prime numbers that such as and or and are two apart progress though was made v kumar murty of the university of toronto said that as a result of the sessions hed be pursuing a new line of attack on tate it makes use of ideas of the j s milne of michigan who was also in attendance and involves abelian varieties over finite fields in case you want to get started yourself alternately you might simply want to mull another mathematician
