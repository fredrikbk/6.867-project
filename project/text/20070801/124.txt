the government should bail on borrower handout i read with interest and amazement "states aim to stem tide of home foreclosures with funds for refinancing" "the outlook " july the article describes certain states measures to bail some homeowners out of foreclosure while i admit that this may be a noble effort i have trouble grasping the scope of the programs according to the article massachusetts in partnership with fannie mae plans to come up with &# million to save just homeowners from foreclosure unless my math fails me this works out to a cost of &# per homeowner new york isnt far behind with a &# million program designed to save homes at an average rate of &# per home to add insult to injury the article states that these programs will merely assist the owners in refinancing with fixed rate mortgages at more favorable rates i know that real estate in the northeast is particularly expensive but i cant imagine how a refinance even with a generous amount of forgiveness on the existing loan could cost anywhere close to what these states propose to spend unless that is the administration and overhead costs of these programs are chewing up much of the funding as a taxpayer i am also hesitant to support a program that bails out a select few who didnt perform their own due diligence in evaluating the pros and cons of taking out a high risk mortgage granted they may have been led astray by less than honest mortgage brokers or realtors however in the end i believe many of them thought they were taking advantage of the system and now that decision has unfortunate repercussions i hope these states re evaluate their plans for the assistance programs and take a close look at how much we as a society should pay for each bailout i sympathize with homeowners who face foreclosure but if we dont hold individuals responsible for their bad decisions there is no incentive for future borrowers to make any better decisions jeff martin conyers ga
