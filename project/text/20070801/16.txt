of effort that can give any business the edge it needs to beat the competition and spotting trends is just the beginning target uses integrated operations such as in house design to bring those trends to shoppers faster says mr capon using examples from companies such as exxon mobil dell toyota motor loreal and amazon mr capon builds a case that marketing should be the concern of the entire business not just the marketing department he describes an epidemic of global oversupply that gives consumers more options than the businesses that supply them as a result he argues "you must put the customer at the center of your business " the only way to do that is by making marketing the "guiding philosophy" of the business mr capon a professor at columbia business school takes a scientific

findings into five imperatives for a world of oversupply in loreal usa president carol hamilton followed the first one "picking markets that matter" when she saw a young woman at the gym whose hair matched her bright workout gear ms hamilton pushed the organization to come up with hair color products for younger women that celebrated color as a fashion statement instead of as a way to cover gray hair the resulting feria brand of hair colors for women under which loreal launched in helped the company take the top spot in hair color for imperative two dissecting markets mr capon advises

prescription and sale " mr capon ultimately aims to write a guide to help any company become a top marketer he sticks to the five imperatives like commandments making "the marketing mavens" a straightforward read the book ends the same way it begins by urging businesses to make their consumers their "core assets " while mr capon painstakingly supports each of his imperatives with company
