murdochs news corp sealed a &# billion agreement to purchase the publisher of the wall street journal after three months of drama in the controlling family and public debate about journalistic values one of the oldest and best known franchises in the newspaper industry beset in recent years by business pressures now enters a new era as part of a world wide media conglomerate the year old mr murdoch whose properties range from the fox television network to the times of london negotiated hard to win the paper he long coveted he has promised to invest more in dow jones journalism the bancrofts worried about protecting the reputation of the journal the nations second largest newspaper they feared mr murdoch would meddle in the papers editorial affairs and import the brand of sensationalist journalism found in some of his properties such as the new york post some bancrofts sought other buyers but ultimately mr murdochs &# a share bid a premium above dow joness share price when it became public was the only serious offer on the table key family members spurred by dow joness board and advisers decided they had no choice "on the one hand it is quite sad but on the other it was the only reasonable thing to do " said elisabeth goth chelberg a bancroft family member who unsuccessfully tried a decade ago to get the family more involved in management "now i look forward to a better dow jones its going to have more money and a world presence and all of the things that it could have and should have had but didnt " opponents of the deal called it a dark day for journalism leslie hill a family member who opposed the deal resigned as a dow jones director late yesterday afternoon in a letter to the board she conceded the deal was a good one in financial terms but said it failed to outweigh "the loss of an independent global news organization with unmatched credibility and integrity " in an increasingly pinched landscape for newspaper companies the alternative to selling was a future fraught with risk in particular that deep cost cuts would be needed to prop up the stock price and make up for dwindling advertising for every person who argued that the news corp takeover threatens dow joness reputation for quality someone else insisted that mr murdochs deep pockets and strategic know how could turn around its prospects mr murdoch said yesterday in an interview that he might add four pages of news a day to the journal "the money got the familys attention and enforced their consideration of reality " said peter kreisky a media consultant "it focused the minds of the family and the board on how difficult it would be to maintain the newspaper in the long term as an independent entity " as of late yesterday the companys offer received support from bancroft family members holding of dow joness voting power more than half of the familys total voting stake of when added to the of dow joness voting stock held by public shareholders most of which is expected to go in news corp s favor that support gives mr murdoch enough to win a full shareholder vote comfortably the vote is likely to be held later this year news corp s board signed off on the deal at a brief late afternoon meeting after the approval top executives and advisers broke out glasses for a toast they were served an australian shiraz the bancroft family has controlled dow jones since while dow jones accounts for less than half the familys fortune of roughly &# billion the company had long been the bancrofts source of pride and prestige dow jones was also the main glue holding together the family which today consists of nearly three dozen adult members scattered across the globe some deliberated on the offer from vacation destinations around the world including china spain the austrian alps and waters off the coast of corsica their bonds were tested during the debate over the deal cousins and siblings were pitted against one another parents fought their children in the days leading up to the deal the stress was severe just hours before a monday deadline for the family to vote on the transaction william cox jr the only living bancroft who spent his entire career at the company went into a diabetic shock he was briefly admitted to a hospital in massachusetts where he summers on nantucket before returning home according to relatives the final vote tally followed a last minute scramble by dow joness board and the familys advisers to win over holdouts most of the familys shares are held in a series of trusts news corp had won support from shareholders owning only about of voting power by monday afternoon shortly before a deadline for votes set by the familys adviser that crept up to by monday evening and then topped tuesday morning as a collection of small trusts threw their support behind the deal m peter mcpherson dow joness nonexecutive chairman personally called resistant family trustees in boston and denver to remind them of the risks they were taking in opposing the deal according a person who was briefed on the calls the shareholder making a decisive swing was a group of bancroft family trusts overseen by a denver law firm holding of dow joness voting shares the firm holme roberts &amp owen had been holding out for a higher offer from news corp a request repeatedly rejected by mr murdoch the denver trusts pushed other bancroft family trusts to hold out for more money at least for the holders of class b supervoting shares these shares which have times the voting power of class a shares are mostly held by the bancrofts but when some boston based trusts consented to a news corp deal late monday the denver trustees lost much of their bargaining power dow joness board had rejected the request for a higher price for class b shareholders instead what emerged from the talks was a deal under which dow jones agreed to pay the familys legal and banking bills news corp will assume these liabilities when it buys dow jones the familys fees to be paid to firms including merrill lynch morgan stanley and the law firms hemenway &amp barnes and wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz could total at least &# million according to people familiar with the situation that figure doesnt include fees incurred by the dow jones board which had its own advisers the payment serves as a modest sweetener for the bancrofts when spread out over the familys million class b shares the &# million equals an additional &# a share a roughly increase for the family family members would otherwise have had to bear these fees out of their own pockets effectively bringing their take below &# a share james h ottaway whose family controls of dow joness voting power called the fees "outrageous " in a statement the outspoken opponent of a news corp deal said "it is ironic indeed for the bancroft family to have to pay shekels of silver to their investment bankers and shekels of gold to their corporate lawyers for scaring some of them into betraying their year family loyalty to dow jones independence " division of the spoils among the advisers promises to create another fight merrill lynch is expecting to receive an &# million fee according to a person familiar with its plans wachtell liptons hoped for fee is expected to be somewhere near &# million said one family member with a host of other fees for a group of lawyers and bankers advising various bancroft branches christopher bancroft one of the most outspoken family opponents of a deal said yesterday that his fiduciary responsibilities required him to vote against any deal not in the best interests of the family and the company he has called the offer a bad deal for dow jones arguing it undervalues the companys potential "as a trustee i could not roll over " he said mr bancroft a dow jones board member didnt attend last nights board meeting to approve the deal in an effort to sweeten his victory mr murdoch telephoned mr bancroft yesterday according to people familiar with the matter during the call mr bancroft agreed to abstain from voting on the familys biggest trust the so called article trust with voting power in return for written assurance that news corp would pay for all family expenses including personal attorney fees for mr bancroft and other family members but dow joness board later refused to endorse the proposal and it appeared that trust rules wouldnt allow him to abstain mr bancrofts cousin jane cox macelree who also opposed the deal faced a delicate situation because she was a trustee of some trusts whose beneficiaries favored the deal ms macelree ended up resigning from some trusts deferring to her relatives and shielding herself against potential liability while voting the class b shares she owned against the deal some on wall street were surprised that the family wasnt able to squeeze out a higher bid from mr murdoch by the rituals of wall street deal making a buyers first offer is almost never the final price agreed to in a transaction although mr murdochs first offer in this case represented an unusually generous premium mr murdoch was able to hold his ground because he faced no serious rival although some of the nations largest corporations and wealthiest men took a look over the past three months billionaire investor warren buffett and microsoft corp founder bill gates were approached by a family representative to gauge their interest both declined to bid several big companies tried to join together to meet the &# bid including general electric co which at various points attempted to form a group with microsoft iac interactivecorps barry diller and pearson plc owner of the financial times pearson weighed a separate plan under which it would have contributed the financial times to dow jones in exchange for stock according to a person familiar with the situation but none of these arrangements got off the ground nor did efforts by the union that represents some dow joness employees to join forces with a california supermarket magnate get much traction internet entrepreneur brad greenspan tried to put together investors but fell short of making an offer for the whole company even some who had initially declared firm opposition to the bid softened over time on the weekend of july bancroft family member martha robes hosted former dow jones chairman and ceo peter r kann and his family at her house in maine to celebrate mr kanns retirement at the gathering ms robes and her family gave mr kann a handmade green wooden rowboat named "joy" and a puzzle that depicts various aspects of his life including a newspaper a typewriter and a golf cart according to people familiar with the matter mr kann famously crashed a golf cart at a dow jones retreat years ago at the gathering these people say mr kann who had been a long time champion of dow joness independence told attendees he could see the arguments for a deal with mr murdoch some family members saw his comments as permission to vote for the deal these people said other family members exchanged impassioned views by email and phone about missed opportunities and the familys shortcomings one supporter of a deal crawford hill told his relatives in a nearly word email that it was time for "reality check " once definitive merger agreements are signed by the two companies dow jones will set the date for a shareholder vote to approve the deal mr murdochs advisers suggest shareholder approval is a fait accompli with family members contributing about voting power to support the deal news corp must still win over the remaining shareholders who control of dow joness voting power news corp anticipates that about of these shareholders will vote for the deal meaning another in support of the transaction or about approval overall that leaves a slim opportunity for the remaining shareholders to threaten to withhold support with hopes of getting a higher price as happened in recent takeover fights at clear channel communications inc that could be why the company sought a greater margin of support from the family as the process entered its last days news corp will need to get regulatory approval for the deal although mr murdoch has said he doesnt expect that to be an issue assuming the deal is approved closing could take place by the end of the year the deal raises questions about the future of some senior dow jones executives including chief executive richard zannino once dow jones becomes a subsidiary of news corp mr zannino may eventually move on some top executives may be eligible for big severance packages once the sale is completed dow jones implemented change in control provisions for more than top managers in early june a month after the bid was made mr zannino stands to receive some &# million if he loses his job or has his duties cut after a change in control mr murdoch has argued that the wall street journal will be able to take advantage of news corp synergies to gain ground in europe and asia take on national rivals in political coverage seek more consumer advertising and expand efforts in television and online while he has been vilified for years in the media over issues ranging from union busting to sensationalist journalism he has always showed a thick skin secure in his belief that his critics are antibusiness elitists still the drama preceding the sale of dow jones exposed him to unprecedented scrutiny and often harsh criticism now mr murdoch must persuade some factions of dow joness newsrooms and outside critics that he will act responsibly as he weighs changes to the journal and other dow jones publications "the sale of dow jones raises enormous concerns about the state of independent competitive sources of high quality journalism " said gene kimmelman a vice president at consumers union in a statement yesterday in letter to readers journal publisher l gordon crovitz wrote "the same standards of accuracy fairness and authority will apply to this publication regardless of ownership " news corp agreed as part of the deal to invite one bancroft family member onto its board of directors and to create a committee to protect dow joness journalistic independence the committee members are slated to be louis d boccardi retired ceo of the associated press nicholas negroponte co founder of massachusetts institute of technologys media lab jack fuller former president of tribune publishing jennifer blackburn dunn a former congresswoman from washington state and thomas bray the former editorial page editor of the detroit news and a writer for opinionjournal com mr bray will be chairman dennis k berman susan warren and susan pulliam contributed to this article see related
