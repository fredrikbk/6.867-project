those muscle cars on the drag strip are really electric clunker run on batteries trounces latest gassers john waylands close call portland ore on a recent friday night at the portland international raceway john wayland scanned the dragsters looking for an opponent for his geeky looking datsun sedan finally he challenged the owner of a souped up corvette the hottest looking car at the track to a quarter mile race when the starting light flashed the datsun known as white zombie shot silently past the corvette and kept widening the lead as the two cars faded into the distance "oh man right off the starting line he had me " said the corvettes owner robert akers shaking his head electric cars are typically known for their fuel efficiency and environmental bona fides not for their speed and muscle but mr wayland years old is changing that and has become something of a hero to a small group of hot rodders dedicated to humiliating gasoline powered cars the night white zombie beat the corvette it also trounced two other "gassers " as mr wayland calls them a blue bmw and a bright orange pontiac tempest the electric car racers who go by nicknames like "father time" and "electric louis " hope to jump start public interest in electric vehicles "getting electric cars going in the u s has been like shoveling sand into a tsunami " says roderick wilde who sometimes races here in his electric powered mazda white zombie and the other electric cars compete in the most popular drag racing category the one for cars that can be driven on regular streets anybody with a hot car and a safety helmet can drive up and compete in this "street legal" category white zombie can go from a standing start to miles an hour in seconds making it one of the fastest street legal cars in the nation sometimes given white zombies renown as a speed demon other drivers avoid a face off the night he went to the raceway mr akers the year old owner of the corvette had just gotten back from a two year stint in iraq working for a private security contractor he says he knew that the datsun had an electric motor but didnt realize what that meant the boxy looking datsun was driven by tim brehm who is a mechanic for a local forklift distributor mr wayland the cars owner is a mechanic instructor at the same company mr wayland is a former bass player in a rock and roll band who says he barely made it through high school he got interested in electric gear while running a business fixing broken amplifiers and television sets in the s he drove gasoline powered datsuns in illegal drag races on the streets of portland "i had lots of speeding tickets " he says in he found the white datsun sedan in a junkyard and bought it for &# he intended to use it to drive to work but in the early s with general motors corp beginning to tout the electric car mr wayland decided to convert the datsun to electric power today after several modifications white zombie has two powerful motors normally used to operate forklifts and volt storage batteries crammed into the back seat and trunk in daily use most electric cars in the u s are little more than souped up golf carts with fewer batteries and much less power in electrifying the datsun mr wayland had as his goal building a car that could beat most of the big gasoline powered muscle cars around portland "getting beat by a little japanese car back then reflected on your manhood " he says unlike gasoline engines which take a few seconds to build up turning power or torque for the rear wheels electric motors deliver it instantly the sharp jolt of power was a problem for mr wayland in his first few races "i hit it and it was on full power " he says "you just held on " he has since installed a controller a kind of giant dimmer switch that phases in the battery power more gradually at first skeptics abounded one day mr wayland found policemen measuring a long skid mark the zombie had made the previous evening before a drag race starts drivers often do a "burnout " spinning their tires furiously on the asphalt to make their treads sticky so they have a better grip on the road the policemen had heard rumors of a fast electric car but dismissed them "there is no electric car that could lay down a strip like that " he heard one declare the disbelief began to disappear in the mid to late s after portland made drag racing legal on a cordoned off downtown street and later at the race track and white zombie prevailed over and over around the country other electric cars started beating gasoline powered favorites too in a few tracks began to ban the electric cars calling them unsafe because they went so fast and employed unfamiliar technology in response mr wayland and others formed the national electric drag racing association which now has about members and drew up safety rules for electric dragsters those regulations satisfied the national hot rod association the worlds largest promoter of drag races which a few years later invited the electric drag racers to take part in its competitions now the electric cars routinely participate in drag races in california maryland and other states still even with tough safety rules the cars can pose special hazards when installing an array of batteries in a car mr wayland lays a rubber blanket on top of it and connects one battery to the next one at a time to avoid short circuits but in march feeling elated after installing batteries in preparation for a race he whipped off the blanket before he was finished he leaned down to connect the last battery to the array and dropped the brass connecting rod which bounced from battery to battery creating a trail of sparks and flashes a superheated cloud of gas called a plasma formed and flickered over the batteries as the heat generated by volts melted the brass and fused the batteries together "i could feel the skin burning on my face " recalls mr wayland who wasnt seriously injured a colleague threw a wet towel over the blaze the towel was vaporized fire extinguishers had no effect finally a fireman wearing a hazardous materials suit disconnected the batteries and the cloud disappeared "the zombie looked like a roasted marshmallow " mr wayland says the car was quickly repaired and mr wayland has since been known as "plasma boy " the accident fueled mr waylands mystique which has spread far beyond the drag racing set last year a washington state police department the clark county sheriffs office invited him to show off white zombie in a fast driving course for young officers mr wayland did a massive burnout leaving a squad car with lights blaring and siren screaming far behind "somebody please arrest me " mr wayland recalls saying "im having way too much fun "
