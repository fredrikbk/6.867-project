states study carbon trading london european officials are urging air pollution authorities in several u s states to avoid the problems that have plagued europes system for trading carbon emissions credits since it was set up years ago the u s doesnt plan to introduce a nationwide emissions trading system but northeastern states are trying to set up their own systems starting in california also aims to set up a program though it hasnt set a date officials in those states are now looking to europes experience in carbon trading as they sketch out how their own plans will work but the european emissions trading system or ets hasnt gotten off to a great start that systems first phase which began in january and will end in april has proven largely ineffective leaving companies with almost no incentive to cut their emissions trading emissions credits is one of the main ways countries that signed up to the kyoto protocol in provide an economic incentive to cut carbon emissions which are believed to be the main factor behind global warming under the "cap and trade" system used by the european union regulators cap emissions from companies such as manufacturers and power producers which buy and sell credits to meet these commitments a company that has overshot its limit can buy a carbon credit from one that has emitted less than its cap the deficiencies of the european system have been part of increasing trans atlantic discussion as u s policy makers explore the idea in march a u s senate committee met with eu officials as well as representatives from electricite de france sa and royal dutch shell plcs shell oil last year california gov arnold schwarzenegger signed an agreement with the former british prime minister tony blair to share information on emissions trading on june a group of scientists policy makers and emissions traders from europe and the u s published recommendations for designing a greenhouse gas cap and trade system for californias government the group called the market advisory committee said that "the bedrock foundation of a successful trading program is a rigorous system for collecting accurate data " peter zapfel policy coordinator for emissions trading at the european commission and a member of the mac said in an interview that the "biggest lesson we learned since we launched the eu ets is that you need the caps to be based on very solid data we didnt have verified emissions data when we started " europe learned that lesson in april when the first verified emissions data were released those figures showed actual emissions in were far lower than the caps set by individual governments and the european commission as a result carbon prices fell about in three days and have remained extremely low the european ets suffered a massive dent to its reputation critics including european energy minister andris piebalgs deemed the trading system or at least its first phase a failure because the price was too low to drive investment in cleaner technologies the collapse was due to a lack of verified historical data on which to base the caps the eu had used countries and companies own unverified and often incomplete estimates of how much co they were producing because no national systems had been set up to monitor emissions before trading in the eu program started the u s states connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island vermont new york new jersey delaware and maryland are taking part in the regional greenhouse gas initiative a linked cap and emissions trading program mr schwarzenegger has said he would like an emissions trading system to be set up to help his state comply with a state law the law says california must cut its emissions back to levels by about a cut compared with current projected emissions for the states involved are accumulating emissions data in advance to ensure they dont make the same mistake as the eu companies that will have to use the system are happy that they are doing so "we believe a credible reporting system of greenhouse gas emissions is the first step in developing government policy and corporate programs that will change behaviors spark innovation and deliver reductions of greenhouse gas emissions " said bob malone chairman and president of bp plcs bp america in the u s recording emissions data is already further forward than it was in the eu in when carbon trading started there in may u s states launched the climate registry a nonprofit organization that aims to create a common reporting system for all u s states the aim is to create "an accurate complete consistent transparent and verified set of data supported by a robust accounting and verification infrastructure " the climate registry says the registry incorporates earlier initiatives to record emissions the california climate action registry was set up in while most of the u s states involved in the regional greenhouse gas initiative began recording emissions data in under both registries companies measure their own emissions which are then verified by independent contractors this is much the same system as the eu uses today u s officials also will be closely watching how europe resolves the next set of questions its system will pose for the second phase of its system which will begin next year the european commission is using the verified emissions data it accumulated for and to set much tougher caps for each country those new caps have proved controversial after complaints by industry and power producers countries like poland the czech republic hungary and slovakia have launched legal action against the commissions rulings complaining that the strict limits will hurt their economic growth
