the daily fix glavine bonds and rodriguez miss out in milestone hunt online edition three players were chasing baseball milestones last night the new york mets tom glavine was after his th win the san francisco giants barry bonds was sitting on home runs and the new york yankees alex rodriguez had homers and so today the fix celebrates well nothing mr glavine left with a lead which he then watched the mets bullpen blow the milwaukee brewers won in innings bonds struck out walked twice and was safe on an error in a giants win over the los angeles dodgers who held a steroid awareness clinic hours before the game yes really the yankees hit eight home runs in beating the chicago white sox but none of them were struck by a rod first up the new york posts mike vaccaro reports on mr glavines vigil "he watched the eighth inning in the clubhouse in the same way hes watched every game from which hes been removed with a lead nervously anxiously with one eye on the tv and one eye on the floor tom glavine has done this drill enough times youd think hed be used to it by now but you never really get used to it " in the daily news anthony mccarron asks if mr glavine will be the last pitcher to win games the pitcher next in line for the milestone is the arizona diamondbacks randy johnson but hes and just had season ending back surgery on to bonds and a report from the los angeles timess bill plaschke on "one of the most misery laden baseball games ive seen this season " "what should be a march is a trudge " he writes "what should be a celebration feels like a wake there is no guest of honor only an enemy of the people " sticking with the times t j simers tells what happened when he asked jeff kent to take a drug test on the heels of his average in july and then asked bonds if mr kent should be drug tested if youre curious how that all went and cmon youre curious mr simers reports that mr kent "poured out a bottle of water and then offered to fill it on the spot but i explained i was concerned about hgh and that would require a blood test how about i fill the bottle and then spit blood in it kent said and ive heard about roid rage but how would you ever tell with kent " if theres anyone left alive who thinks its fun to be an athlete dealing with the new york media check out the daily newss filip bondy on a rod not hitting a home run and being in an for funk "this may be yet another unfortunate indicator that a rod is still not a man for a moment the cameras flashed the star fizzled suddenly again there are these nagging doubts about rodriguezs ability to rise to the special occasion " speaking of milestones please check out our five fix favorites from july marking the debut of a new monthly feature from the fix baseballs nonwaiver trading deadline arrived with a flurry of last day deals and more to be made now that so many gms are steeped in the art of waiver wire brinkmanship the atlanta braves added the texas rangers slugging first baseman mark teixeira and relievers ron mahay and octavio dotel the boston red sox fortified an already good bullpen by acquiring the rangers eric gagne the yankees shipped burnt out reliever scott proctor to the dodgers for utilityman wilson betemit clearing the way for fireballing prospect joba chamberlain the giants sent matt morris to the pittsburgh pirates and the st louis cardinals picked up pitcher joel piniero staying put at least for now were names such as adam dunn jermaine dye and chad cordero in boston the gagne deal came on the heels of the celtics monster deal for kevin garnett a one two punch thats left the city crowing in the globe dan shaughnessy calls the roll of great days "christmas day graduation day wedding day the day you got your first good job the day you moved into your dream house the day your first child was born and then theres july the day boston sports fans were rewarded with a stunning shower of gifts after weeks of speculation and hours of rumor and negotiation the red sox became world series favorites and the celtics made reservations for the nba finals all within a few hours " in the herald tony massarotti marvels at bostons ascension as a destination for athletes "welcome to town mr kevin garnett say hello to tom brady randy moss bill belichick and richard seymour presumably youve already met ray allen and paul pierce over there are david ortiz and manny ramirez just behind josh beckett the guy acting like the mayor is none other than curt schilling as for the rest of sports america we hate to break the news to you youre now playing for second place " in atlanta furman bisher understands why the braves made a deal for mr teixeira but he still mourns the departure of a much celebrated catching prospect "for all these seasons in the farm system jarrod saltalamacchia had been nurtured and primed for his place on the home team " he writes "hottest catching prospect in the minors so ive read it happened earlier than expected this season and not in a way fair to his future there was no room at catcher and first base was not his natural position but he came he answered the call at both positions and you expected to see that alphabetical spread across the back of a braves uniform for time to come " what bothers mr bisher is "the many times the braves have forfeited a bright future for the immediacy it disturbs old crocks who have a feeling that living for today at the expense of forfeiting the future forfeiting golden prospects incubated in the farm system with loving care for an immediate fix at some position with the notion that theres another one of those pennants to be mounted over the left field bleachers causes serious dyspepsia " meanwhile the new york suns tim marchman wants an end to the trading deadline a rule he argues has no practical purpose along the way theres a discourse on regulations and markets and entertaining broadsides fired at yankee icons challenger the bald eagle and irish tenor ronan tynan and former mets gms steve phillips good fun tomorrow the washington nationals will commemorate the centennial of walter johnsons debut with the old senators in the washington post barry svrluga writes that baseballs return to d c has rekindled interest in the original big train "when baseball left washington part of johnsons legacy left too " he writes "at yankee stadium babe ruths memory is kept alive in monument park ted williamss no will never come down from the facade on the upper deck in right field at fenway park even places where major league baseball arrived within the last half century minnesota and san diego and seattle have public displays honoring past heroes washingtons history is murkier one hundred years ago tomorrow walter johnson one of the greatest pitchers ever to step to the mound threw the first of his major league games all in the uniform of the washington senators but when the senators departed the city not once but twice in the s and s johnsons legacy had no place to thrive " mr svrluga revisits ty cobbs memory of his first encounter with johnson "i watched him take that easy windup and then something went past me that made me flinch i hardly saw the pitch but i heard it the thing just hissed with danger " and its marvelous to find out johnsons daughter year old carolyn thomas is a passionate fan of the nats thats the kind of mildly spooky quietly satisfying coda of which baseball history is made tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us
