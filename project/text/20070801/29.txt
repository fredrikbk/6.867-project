deal will test a media titans instincts rupert murdochs long sought purchase of dow jones could change business journalism despite being a force in the world of british and australian newspapers for decades news corp chairman rupert murdoch hasnt been able to establish himself as a major newspaper player in the u s but news corp s agreement to purchase dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal for &# billion will extend mr murdochs reach far beyond his lone u s paper the tabloid new york post and is likely to send ripples through business journalism and the broader media world mr murdoch has promised to beef up the journals ad sales effort and to lift its circulation making the paper a more potent rival to business magazines smaller business dailies like the financial times and investors business daily and some general interest papers in the u s such as the new york times the biggest impact however could be in online and television where mr murdoch has said he sees the greatest opportunity the market for online financial news is currently fragmented among numerous players that could change with a news corp owned dow jones the companies "could clearly lead the world wide financial news gathering market " says larry kramer a media consultant who founded the consumer finance web site marketwatch com and sold it to dow jones in january these are just the broad strokes the fine details of what news corp will do with dow jones whose properties include dow jones newswires barrons and the factiva electronic news database arent clear mr murdoch has indicated a willingness to invest more money in dow joness journalism but he hasnt revealed how much he hasnt given any indication what he would do with certain major assets such as dow jones newswires mr murdoch said yesterday in an interview that he wants to develop the newswires "aggressively " a person close to news corp said the only dow jones asset that news corp might consider selling are the remaining ottaway community newspapers that lack of detail partly reflects mr murdochs style unlike typical big companies news corp isnt known for crafting and pursuing detailed long term business strategies instead mr murdoch follows his instincts grabbing opportunities when they arise and sometimes giving them up just as quickly over the years he built news corp from a newspaper concern into a multimedia conglomerate encompassing film television satellite and the internet but not without his share of missteps he overpaid for tv guide magazine he spent years chasing satellite tv operator directv winning control in shortly before growth began to slow sharply last year he agreed to sell his directv stake to liberty media corp the big price he is paying for dow jones above its market price immediately before his offer was disclosed heightens the deals risks the newspaper industry has seen advertising drop as marketers shift dollars to the web and other competing media financial publications including both the journal and business magazines have been particularly hard hit after the steep slide in advertising by technology companies and wall street firms mr murdoch said in a june interview that the journal has "got to get some more advertising " noting that the papers profit is "very small " to achieve that he said the paper needed "really strong leadership " the journals ad sales force has been run by five different people in the past eight years most recently the journal installed michael f rooney a former espn executive to succeed judy barry a well regarded executive who resigned earlier this year mr murdoch noted yesterday that mr rooney has a "good reputation " ms barry predicted that "increased marketing support for ad sales" under mr murdoch could help "turn things back around" after some recent declines assuming the papers editorial quality is maintained in an interview she warned that "if the journal slips editorially more money wont make a difference in the journals battle for market share " the journal already leads the competition for national brand advertising ahead of business magazines such as forbes time warner inc s fortune and mcgraw hill cos businessweek a more aggressive journal could pose an even greater threat the magazines representatives declined to comment just as vulnerable could be the new york times published by new york times co and pearson plcs financial times in a may letter to dow joness controlling shareholders the bancroft family mr murdoch said he would want dow jones properties to "reach a broader domestic audience by expanding the content base " he emphasized yesterday he "would not want to step back from any of the business coverage" but he would "like to add more general news " repeating comments about plans to expand the journals washington bureau he said that to accomplish his goal there "could be another four pages a day" for news coverage a person with knowledge of his plans said mr murdoch believes more general news and political coverage would make the journal a stronger rival to the new york times which has a bigger share of consumer advertising a new york times spokeswoman said "the wall street journal has been a good competitor and we expect that it will continue to be " still edward atorino a managing director at wall street firm benchmark co noted that dow jones has already taken steps to broaden its ad sales selling ad space on the journals front page luring luxury goods advertisers and launching a saturday edition aimed at consumers "theres only so many dollars around and clearly the journal has gained some " mr atorino said mr murdoch has promised to invest more in dow jones operations in asia and europe he noted in the letter to the bancrofts that given news corp s big presence in europe "anything less than a leading market share for the journal would be a disappointment " that language suggests he plans to take on the financial times the dominant english language financial newspaper in the u k and europe and a rival of the journal in asia pearson the fts owner in june abandoned plans to counter bid for dow jones in partnership with general electric a spokesman for the ft said "the ft and the wall street journal have been worthy competitors for many years and thats going to continue the quality of the fts journalism and its unique global reach have allowed it to post sustained growth in readership and advertising revenues in print and online and well continue to invest in that successful strategy " mr murdochs biggest focus though is likely to be the web he said in june that he would invest in dow joness digital operation which includes marketwatch as well as the journals subscription only web site wsj com news corp could use these sites along with dow jones newswires which distributes business news to media outlets and wall street to develop a financial news portal online financial news is a crowded field but no one site is dominant while million people visited at least one financial site in june the biggest site yahoo drew just million according to nielsen netratings most sites cater to niches like the high end professionals who go to bloomberg com few cut across segments of the financial news readership says mr kramer a former president of cbs digital media a merged news corp and dow jones would at least on paper be able to go after several segments according to industry executives the journal could also tap social networking technology developed by news corp s myspace to create an online community for business professionals to make a portal work news corp may have to convert wsj com to a free site mr murdoch said yesterday he hadnt made up his mind about the wisdom of such a move in june mr murdoch noted that a study he commissioned concluded that "youd have times as many visitors and lets say five times as much advertising" with a free site the increased ad dollars were offset by loss of subscription revenue making the move a wash he added emily steel contributed to this article
