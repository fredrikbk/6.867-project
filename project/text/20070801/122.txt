the daily fix remembering bill walsh ers fierce mastermind online edition bill walsh whose san francisco ers teams won three championships died of leukemia monday at age it was as an offensive innovator that mr walsh made his name his precise short strike attack led by joe montana and steve young both acquired for less than a first round draft pick revolutionized the game and rebuilt the franchise a mere focus on his play calling cerebral side however undersells the man ray ratto writes in the san francisco chronicle "he did like to cast the image of the grander thinker the great conceptual artist the whistled humanitarian even the wry comedian " mr ratto writes "but he was very much a coach with a coachs eye for skills both ascendant and waning for personalities dominant and compliant for the separate pieces and the greater whole for strategies and tactics for grace and brutishness all the things that separate football from a bar fight he built disassembled and rebuilt with cold remorseless precision and his ruthlessness did not always sit well with those pointed toward the door " that ruthlessness was necessary bryan burwell writes in the st louis post dispatch "for his west coast offense to run as fluidly as a swiss timepiece things needed to be executed flawlessly " mr burwell writes "footwork was essential timing was everything and repetition was king and walsh always the great teacher demanded perfection he would spend hours on end behind closed doors detailing his coaching hieroglyphs scribbling xs and os all over the place in one imaginative scheme after another yet for walsh practice fields were the great laboratories that allowed his xs and os to come alive " mr walshs success stemmed from his playcalling from his practices and from his player management "he traded for young then used him as a foil for joe montana " clark judge writes on sportsline "if montana was struggling walsh didnt hesitate to call on the promising young which walsh knew would infuriate joe but the idea wasnt to placate montana it was to win games and if walsh could push montana with young he would " such success can go to a mans head "he and i bonded based on our shared belief of an unassailable tenet bill walsh was a genius " michael silver writes "half jokingly " on si com that genius could come out as weirdness san francisco chronicle columnist scott ostler recalls and he means "weird" in the best possible way "one minute hes vince lombardi fire and brimstone and bad words " mr ostler writes "next minute hes prancing through the locker room wearing football shoes and black tights with a wide receiver towel tucked in the front lampooning the ultra tidy jerry rice to warn his players about the dangers of night life before a road trip to los angeles walsh introduced them to a pimp a prostitute and a drug dealer played in full costume by assistant coaches bob mckittrick sam wyche and ray rhodes " speaking of costumes espn coms ivan maisel treasures the memory of the day he lent mr walsh his blazer normally sportswriters get the last word about their subjects but mr walsh left sports illustrateds peter king with his own words about his philosophy in the trappings of a foreword for a book by mr king mr walsh began "football is detail work its teaching people in baseball may disagree but i think football is the real thinking persons game and i think thats what youll see in this book coaches and players know that today but thats not how it used to be id like to think that my coaching successes have had some effect in changing the image " its not official as of this fix but several reports place kevin garnett on a plane to boston to join the celtics by trading their franchise player the minnesota timberwolves will get al jefferson theo ratliff notable for his expiring contract gerald green sebastian telfair ryan gomes and two first round picks hallelujah says espn coms resident celtics fan bill simmons he heartily thanks kevin mchale former celtics legend and current t wolves gm for helping out his former team by allowing mr garnett to join ray allen and paul pierce in boston "pierce allen and garnett happen to be wired the exact same way three ultracompetitive guys nearing the end of their primes who would sacrifice anything to play on a winner " mr simmons writes "all of them were stuck in miserable situations last season combined record all of them are good guys all of them understand that you only have so many chances to contend for all three guys it will be their best team ever regardless of whos playing with them allen hasnt played with a top player his entire career neither has pierce and garnett hasnt played with one elite scorer much less two " boston globe columnist jackie macmullan is equally ecstatic "suddenly pro basketball matters again in boston " ms macmullan writes "suddenly the networks will sit up rub the sleep out of their eyes and start looking for places to plug the celtics into their national schedule and just like that you should consider this team one of the favorites to win the eastern conference " minneapolis star tribune columnist patrick reusse counts himself "in that percent of twin citians who look at the trade as outlined in media reports as the right move for our sick nba franchise " but si coms steve aschburner thinks minnesota got hosed "the pieces coming back to minnesota range from promising to unproven to suspect with a little redundancy thrown in " any nba deal these days is an exercise in math as much as in hoops thanks to salary cap considerations mr garnetts contract which includes a bonus if hes traded makes things more complicated espn coms marc stein breaks down the numbers in yesterdays other big sports
