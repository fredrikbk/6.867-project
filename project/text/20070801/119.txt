tax report irs ignites backlash after proposing new rules for deducting trust fees a high stakes battle is heating up over whether investment management and advisory fees paid by trusts or estates are fully deductible for income tax purposes just last week the internal revenue service proposed regulations saying these costs typically cant be deducted in full the issue is attracting widespread attention among lawyers and accountants because federal appeals courts have interpreted the law differently and because the u s supreme court recently agreed to review the matter the basic question are these fees and certain other types of expenses fully deductible or are they limited by the " floor" on miscellaneous itemized deductions if that limit applies that means they would be deductible only to the extent that the total of these and other miscellaneous deductions exceed of the trusts or estates adjusted gross income "this is very important both for those who create trusts and those who are beneficiaries " says peter rubin professor of constitutional law at the georgetown university law center in washington who represents the trust in the case that will be heard by the supreme court "this is bad for trust beneficiaries bad as a matter of social policy and contrary to law " if these proposed regulations are issued as is and if the supreme court rules in favor of the irs running a trust could become pricier that is because fees that some people may have fully deducted in the past such as some investment advisory charges will be subject to the limit "it could make the administration of an estate or trust a substantially more expensive proposition " says robert willens tax and accounting analyst at lehman brothers in new york there may also be increased paperwork when preparing trust tax returns because some trustee fees would have to be broken down into those that are fully deductible and those that arent he says a public hearing on the proposed regulations is scheduled for nov at irs headquarters in washington the irs regulation wont go into effect until final rules are issued trusts come in a wide variety of complex shapes and flavors but in its simplest form a trust typically involves an agreement to transfer your assets to someone else a trustee who looks after those assets for your beneficiaries families set up trusts for a wide variety of reasons such as to save estate taxes provide for future generations or incapacitated family members pass on a family home or business protect money from creditors or support charities typically families name family members trusted advisers or trust companies to serve as trustees a trustees duties include investing and monitoring trust funds ensuring that tax forms and other paperwork are filed and making distributions to beneficiaries many trustees hire professionals to provide investment management and advisory services in recent years trusts have grown more popular as the ranks of the rich have grown and as financial services companies and lawyers have grown more aggressive in marketing them the case the supreme court has agreed to review involves a trust set up in under the will of henry a rudkin who with his wife founded food company pepperidge farm according to a court petition by lawyers on behalf of the trust the trust originally was funded with proceeds from the sale of pepperidge farm to campbell soup co at the start of the trust had assets valued at nearly &# million that year the trustees hired an investment advisory firm to give investment management advice to the trust the firms fees came to &# the trustees deducted the full amount of the fees in calculating the trusts taxable income but the irs rejected the full deduction and said the trust owed &# in taxes a federal appeals court sided with the irs under current tax law certain costs may be deducted in full if theyre paid or incurred in connection with the administration of an estate or trust and wouldnt have been if the property werent held in the trust or estate but "the language is ambiguous " says carol harrington a lawyer at mcdermott will &amp emery in chicago "when smart judges come to different conclusions its pretty clear the language is unclear " under the proposed regulations the irs essentially breaks down typical costs into those it considers to be unique to an estate or trust and those that arent costs the irs considers unique and thus fully deductible include fiduciary accounting trust income or estate tax returns and communicating with beneficiaries expenses the irs doesnt consider to be unique and thus subject to the floor include standard investment advice as well as custody or management of property many trust companies "bundle" all of their costs into one fee without breaking down the charge into component parts under the irs regulations if an estate or trust pays a single bundled fee it must figure out how much of the fee would be fully deductible and how much wouldnt be currently wilmington trust corp considers its standard trustee fee which includes investment management to be fully deductible says thomas p mitchell senior fiduciary director in the firms new york office the firm charges roughly or less of trust assets for standard trustee services mr mitchell adds that the firm is monitoring the irs regulations and court decisions closely but until final regulations are released and the supreme court rules the firm isnt planning on "unbundling" its fees into component parts if that were to happen managing a trust could get a lot more expensive and difficult says mr mitchell musical chairs the irs gets a new acting chief linda stiff deputy commissioner for operations support will take over as acting
