making the best of &# a barrel oil investors are flocking to slew of offerings in hot energy markets as oil prices hit new highs investors are finding new opportunities and new risks in the energy sector money managers say individual investors hoping to tap into the energy gains have been moving beyond traditional energy plays like buying shares of big oil producers to pour money into more exotic instruments among these new investment products specializing in energy partnerships that are designed to generate a steady stream of income and a slew of funds focusing on solar power wind turbines and other alternative energy sources popular commodities funds that invest heavily in oil futures contracts also are likely to get a lift following a recent significant shift in the futures market which is expected to boost the funds returns rising oil prices raise concerns about an economic slowdown and investors "want to have money in the one place that is going to benefit from higher energy prices " says edward guinness an analyst for the guinness atkinson global energy fund which holds shares of energy companies yesterday the price of oil rose &# to &# a barrel a record close though still far short of the inflation adjusted record close of more than &# hit in but the new products are also risky since many energy related investments have posted big returns in recent years new investors may be buying in at inflated prices and not all energy investments are rising natural gas prices have fallen in recent months energy investments of course wont necessarily track commodity prices some of the new offerings can also be influenced by unrelated factors like interest rates and that can mean different risks and rewards for investors energy investments also tend to be volatile thats especially true of some of the clean energy funds which are full of tiny companies with uncertain prospects despite the risks investors this year have poured some &# billion into energy mutual and exchange traded funds which now hold about &# billion according to fund tracker amg data services thats accelerated recently and in late july the number of mutual funds attracting inflows was the highest in a year amg says its tough to predict how long oil prices can stay aloft last summer prices were close to todays levels but then tumbled in part because of a mild hurricane season even so a number of analysts see a sustained period of higher prices ahead goldman sachs group inc predicts oil could climb as high as &# a barrel by the end of the year while cibc world markets is forecasting &# oil later next year as supply struggles to keep up with demand energy heavy funds that use futures contracts to gain exposure to oil have given investors a wild ride in recent years but now they may be poised for better returns commodity prices are just one factor influencing the returns of these funds including exchange traded products like u s oil fund lp which charges fees of of assets and the broader ishares s&amp p gsci commodity indexed trust which charges for much of the past few years oil futures markets have been in "contango " a peculiar condition in which longer dated contracts are pricier than those of closer months a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a product at a certain price on a particular date that forced the funds to continually sell lower price contracts and buy higher price contracts crimping returns even as oil prices soared the u s oil fund for example fell about in the year through july but in recent weeks oil futures prices have flipped and longer dated contracts are now generally cheaper than earlier months contracts that gives many funds an extra performance boost thats independent of any movement in the actual price of oil "last year commodity futures investors faced huge headwinds and those headwinds have abated " says matthew hougan editor of indexuniverse com thanks to the recent pricing shift these investors should now start seeing returns that more closely resemble commodity prices he says some new energy investments are based on publicly traded energy partnerships that generate a steady stream of income but for the most part dont directly profit from higher oil prices these master limited partnerships such as kinder morgan energy partners lp and enterprise products partners lp are often in the business of storing or transporting natural resources and a big selling point is high yields often around or but as income oriented investments mlps can suffer when interest rates rise investors should also expect mlps recent strong returns to moderate experts say while the alerian mlp select index rose more than in the year through june gabriel hammond managing partner at alerian capital management says "are you going to be up next year no " since they tend to be in relatively stable businesses like oil pipelines mlps are typically not closely tied to oil prices and can be less volatile than many other energy investments by contrast a number of new mlps have launched including breitburn energy partners lp that are engaged in energy exploration and production and are expected to be more closely tied to volatile commodity prices firms offering new mlp investments include bear stearns cos which recently launched the bearlinx alerian mlp select index an exchange traded note that tracks an index of mlps and citigroup inc which in may began offering to retail and high net worth investors structured products tied to its own mlp index such products can come with hefty fees the citigroup product charges an upfront fee while bear stearns charges an annual which is well above the average fee for an etf the upside investors in these products dont have to deal with the cumbersome k partnership tax form that direct mlp investors receive funds that aim to profit from growing demand for solar panels wind turbines and other clean or alternative energy sources are among the most popular and most volatile of the new breed of energy plays though alternative energy investments can benefit from sustained higher oil prices theyre not closely linked to short term commodity price movements experts say if oil is up one week and down the next thats "not a good reason to trade in and out of clean energy " says rob wilder manager of the wilderhill clean energy index the benchmark tracked by the powershares wilderhill clean energy etf some financial advisers say investors arent being rewarded for the risks theyre taking in alternative energy brian kazanchy chairman of the investment committee at wealth management firm regentatlantic capital recently examined the performance of the powershares wilderhill clean energy etf from its launch in march through june of this year he found that it behaved much like the small cap russell growth index and while the etf had slightly better returns it also had much higher risk fees vary widely the guinness atkinson alternative energy fund launched last year charges expenses of compared with for the average natural resources fund according to morningstar inc the powershares wilderhill clean energy etf however charges just alternative energy stocks "have not been good performers " given the level of risk mr kazanchy says investors should "avoid alternative energy investments at this point " see
