secondhand fat a j leibling a vastly overweight journalist of the first half of the last century used to say perhaps in defense of his own avoirdupois that in his youth a diplomat who weighed fewer than pounds was considered untrustworthy shakespeare recall made cassius "lean and hungry " implying perhaps that the want of food turned his mind to violent machinations the painter renoir liked his women zaftig or plumply curvaceous were the women of his paintings alive today half of them such is the mania for slenderness might now be practicing bulimics fashions in heft like those in hems and heels and hairdos change over time when i was a kid a section of clothes in department stores was set aside for "boys husky " in the mens department there was a rack for those known as "portly " which meant they carried around an "alderman " or fairly extensive front footage "heavyset" was another word then much in use heavyset was not necessarily a bad thing to be it suggested substantiality to be husky portly heavyset implied no moral judgment it was the way one happened to be shaped but no longer is weightiness acceptable only in the national football league is the pound interior lineman valued only on the national basketball association team is a "widebody" such as charles barkley or shaquille oneal two notably full figured young men made welcome everywhere else fat is not distinctly where its at serious heft is just now right up there with smoking among the deadly sins the attack on the two evils has not been altogether dissimilar in both instances the modus operandi has been to publicize then demonize make being overweight like smoking seem a moral choice or rather an immoral one not just bad for you but bad for everyone around you i once wrote jokingly about the baleful effects of secondary cholesterol the joke was that just as it is not healthy to be around smokers so is it unhealthy to be around people eating red meat eggs and ice cream lest their intake of such high cholesterol food badly affect your own health a new study published in the new england journal of medicine and done at harvard medical school those twin towers of false authority claims that not only do fat people do great harm to themselves but through the influence of social network can harm friends especially close friends by making it easier for them to overeat not only food it turns out but the wrong friends can make you fat i have been using the words "overweight" and "heavy" and "fat " but obese the approved official word is so much more dampening to the spirit such an ugly word obese it sounds does it not so close to "oh beast " definitions of obesity vary in some quarters one is obese if one is overweight by of ones ideal body weight in others it is defined as "above normal body weigh usually defined as more than above whats considered healthy for people of a certain age height and bone structure " and then to get into the scientifically opaque according to the national institutes of health "a person is considered obese if he or she has a body mass index bmi of kg m or greater " you taking notes on this fatso the gravamen of the harvard study holds that if you hang around the heavy soon heavy indeed will be the added bulk hanging about you in the form of double and triple chins pot bellies love handles ample cabooses thunder thighs thick calves chubby fingers good god its enough to make one tape a photograph of joan didion in a body stocking in ones locker down at the gym the harvard study a work of medical sociology is based on the famous framingham mass federal study of heart disease which has been tracking some people over the year period between like much sociology what the study has to report is obvious if lots of ones friends are fat it naturally makes it more likely that one will pick up their eating habits in such company putting on an extra or pounds isnt going to result in social censure like much sociology too the harvard study is also preposterous it apparently allows for environment lots of junk food out there and genetics some people can eat seattle sutton meals with the tread mill turned all the way up without loss of a gram but its single new finding that fat friends make it easier for their friends in turn to become fat dominates and is the only reason for the studys temporary prominence in one of his poems wallace stevens speaks of the "lunatics of one idea " and this particular idea fat friends make you fat sounds like a nice instance of stevenss fine phrase experience suggests that before long the new england journal will publish another article setting the harvard study on its duff a stanford study say or one from penn state that discovers the extraordinarily high rate per capita of dairy queens in framingham mass and its suburbs thus wiping out the harvard study quicker than harvey weinstein might wipe out a box of godiva chocolates but apparently the cruel prospect of breaking with already obese friends is not what the harvard researchers have in mind one of them dr nicholas a christakis goes out of his way in a new york times report of the study to say so what then as the boys at the think tanks like to say are the implications here for social policy none jump to mind or even limp off the couch without the aid of any studies and no statistics whatsoever i should have thought that much obesity is a social class phenomenon politically incorrect as it is to suggest this many of the poor or lower middle classes seem overweight especially in urban settings where junk food is readily available relatively cheap and requires no work to prepare there also seems to be much obesity among those living in rural areas where the whiplash of fashion does not crack the rest of the nation we so called educated classes striving to be starved to perfection thin terrified of eating any food that hinders our ability to live just beyond forever eats hesitantly anxiously but at least so far as can be known we eat relatively healthily pass the arugula mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" eminent lives
