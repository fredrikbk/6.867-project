how targeting ads at web user habits is shaping industry questions for bill gossman company revenue science title president and ceo aols announcement last week that it would acquire behavioral targeting ad firm tacoda made its competitor revenue science the leading independent player in the increasingly popular segment of the online ad market behaviorally targeted ads are those placed by marketers based on analysis of consumers online activities marketers and their ad agencies figure out which consumers are most likely to be interested in their product and then they place ads on whatever sites those consumers are visiting while the idea isnt new until recently advertisers couldnt easily buy space on enough web sites to make targeting truly effective but now firms such as tacoda and revenue science have put together networks of thousands of diverse sites that allow for insertion of behaviorally targeted ads tacoda works with a network of sites while revenue science has lined up sites that will take its ads revenue science also provides technology to web sites such as time warners aol com walt disneys espn com pearsons financial times and gannett so that their sales forces can sell behaviorally targeted ads spending on behaviorally targeted ads is expected to soar in coming years as the technology underlying the technique is streamlined further bill gossman revenue science president and ceo talks below about the deal and how behavioral targeting is shaping up in the online ad industry the wall street journal big news in the behavioral targeting world last week with aols announcement to acquire tacoda what does that deal mean for you mr gossman i had an inkling that tacoda was going to cease to be an independent company i woke up that morning and i had one notional competitor tacoda and i had a very happy very large portal customer aol com when i went to bed that night i had a very happy very large portal customer and no longer did i have that notional competitor so i thought on balance it was a pretty good thing wsj if aol already worked with you why acquire tacoda mr gossman i think that aols view if i had to imagine was we have really really strong technology from revenue science that works great it works in scale and we want to keep that motoring along to power our national sales force they wanted to add to their network strength with tacdoas very network centric sales team and add that to the mix that they have with advertising com aols advertising network wsj as the remaining prominent independent behavioral targeting firm in the field how often are you approached about your interest in being acquired mr gossman it is safe to say that there are a lot of active discussions going on with everybody in the online advertising space i wouldnt comment on anything specific wsj who are the conversations with ad holding companies technology companies mr gossman as the shift goes from traditional broadcast media to digital media and the fragmentation that that entails what that really means is that there are a lot of players in the ecosystem from isps to portals to technology service providers to ad agencies they are all looking at it and thinking my business model is going to be disrupted vastly and how do i protect that so i think the discussions are pretty broad ranging wsj where do you think your company would best fit mr gossman aol along with yahoo and google and microsoft capture what is it about of all online ad dollars if you think about the media business there are still a lot of players out there that play in that space from tribune dow jones reuters group disney viacom news corp s fox there is a perfect moment in time for there to be a very strong independent player that enables those companies to capture more ad dollars and compete with the big four combines i think that is a logical outcome for us now as the last independent player if you are large media company xyz do you want to throw your lot in entirely with google entirely with microsoft entirely with yahoo entirely with aol or do you want to have an independent party that is providing that kind of service for a lot of companies we are not in the business of having traffic of our own and creating audiences and selling audiences using our own content wsj yahoo recently announced new technology that lets marketers create customized ads based on the behaviors demographics or geography of specific audiences will we start seeing this across the web mr gossman absolutely behavioral targeting is kind of a pseudonym for a basic shift in how media is bought it has been bought by channel or by location since the dawn of media digital technology and media and targeting techniques allow you to focus on audiences as opposed to placements that gives you the ability to customize campaigns against people who engage with certain topics i think yahoo did a very smart thing there are a couple of start up companies that are starting to focus on that exact problem wsj whenever people talk about behavioral targeting questions about privacy arise will these concerns come under the microscope as more spending is directed toward behavioral targeting mr gossman i dont think privacy concerns will ever go away in general because they dont in traditional industry how many times do you hear about a bank vice president having their computer stolen or a temp clerk at a hospital stealing patient records for the purposes of taking their identity but i think there are some good business practices that have emerged that will enable the growth of this business wsj marketers have said for a decade that targeting on the web would revolutionize advertising are we there yet mr gossman there were a lot of things with the internet years ago that were visionary and are starting to come true now in a big way only right about now with the high quality broadband that high quality experience and the application of behavioral targeting can you provide enough quality and scale or mass and class or reach and relevance to take that traditional branding media dollars and put it online that is the tornado we are in right now and thats why there is such a focus on behavioral targeting
