fcc backs spectrum open access some auctioned airwaves to allow multiple devices win for wireless upstarts washington the federal communications commission paved the way for a battle between current mobile phone companies and potential newcomers such as google inc by approving rules for an auction of lucrative spectrum licenses companies desiring to bid now have about six months to line up financing and prepare their strategy for the auction to take place early in and expected to raise about &# billion for the treasury the fcc is requiring the winner of about one third of the spectrum being sold to let consumers buy any cellphone or other wireless device and use it on the broadband network that is eventually built cellular companies now sell phones and service as a package limiting the types of devices customers can use the successful bidders also will be required to allow access of any type of application such as email or video services the commission hopes that consumers would get easier access to the internet possibly at lower cost than todays cellular carriers offer but the agency rejected a bolder proposal by high tech companies and consumer groups to require a license holder to sell transmission capacity on its network on a wholesale basis the decision is a partial victory for high tech companies such as google rival search engine yahoo inc chip maker intel corp and ebay inc s internet phone service skype all of which had lobbied the fcc to use the auction to increase competition in the wireless broadband market christopher libertelli skypes director of regulatory affairs called it an "excellent first step" and said it would help make it easier for consumers to buy any wireless device they like and still use them when they change wireless carriers the spectrum is widely considered to be the best ever to be auctioned for commercial wireless services because it can penetrate buildings and travel over wide areas most of it comes from television broadcasters as they convert to spectrum thrifty digital transmission verizon wireless owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc declined to comment jim cicconi who runs at&amp t inc s washington office said the fcc struck a "reasonable balance" between backers of open access and incumbent wireless operators he applauded the agency for "adopting this approach rather than stacking the deck in googles favor " still none of the potential bidders said last night whether they would definitely take part in the auction in a blog posting rick whitt googles washington based telecommunications counsel commended fcc chairman kevin martin for going some way toward embracing the open access concept he said the company would closely study the detailed rules over the next couple of weeks before deciding whether to participate the high tech companies had wanted the fcc to mandate that the winner of of the megahertz of spectrum being sold would have to offer transmission capacity on a wholesale basis that stance was supported by the commissions two democrats michael copps and jonathan adelstein mr martins fellow republican commissioners were more skeptical deborah taylor tate said she was lukewarm at best robert mcdowell the fccs newest member said he was opposed to the concept "in an effort to favor a specific business plan the majority of commissioners has fashioned a highly tailored garment that may fit no one " mr mcdowell said about googles lobbying efforts consumer and public interest groups bemoaned the decision against requiring wholesale service but the public safety community was elated some megahertz of the airwaves will be granted to a single wireless company that would be obligated to form a partnership with the public safety community to offer the countrys fire police and emergency services access to wireless broadband service that company that successfully bids for the megahertz nationwide license could then sell any excess capacity on a commercial basis to recoup its investment verizon wireless might be interested in this spectrum as well as frontline wireless a group of silicon valley entrepreneurs and prominent washington figures including former fcc chairmen reed hundt and mark fowler frontline had initiated the idea of a public private partnership to use this slice of the airwaves licenses for the other half of the spectrum will cover scores of metropolitan areas and rural parts of the country these are likely to be bought by smaller local and rural providers seeking to expand their services it is also possible that second tier companies such as alltel corp and metropcs communications inc may seek to buy some of this spectrum to increase their territory mr mcdowell expressed concern that the biggest wireless carriers such as verizon and at&amp t would forgo bidding on the large chunk of spectrum because of the open access conditions and instead would bid for these smaller licenses driving up their costs and shutting out smaller rural companies amol sharma contributed to this article
