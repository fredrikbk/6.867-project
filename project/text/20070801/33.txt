drilling deal underscores trend the planned merger of the two biggest offshore drillers of oil and gas shines a &# billion spotlight on the massive back orders other companies in the sector have been generating transocean inc and globalsantafe corp said last week that they would form a single company under the transocean name in a merger of equals shareholders will be paid a total of &# billion through a recapitalization that will reduce the size of their current stakes in the companies the cash for the payment will come from a bridge loan from goldman sachs group inc and lehman brothers holdings inc bridge loans temporary financing extended by wall street banks to facilitate deals have recently fallen out of favor with some investors but analysts say the company can easily afford to take on the debt with its huge backlog of advance orders at a time of unprecedented growth in the oil services industry raising the possibility that rival rig operators might also be poised to do something with their own mountains of back orders with "easy oil" on land increasingly tapped out or in the grip of national oil companies international oil companies and some national companies are scrambling to find the next big fields offshore to do it they have hired practically all of the worlds available rigs capable of drilling in water more than feet deep at rapidly escalating prices with new offshore provinces opening up everywhere from india to brazil producers are booking deepwater rigs years in advance in the combined transocean advance orders total &# billion making it a fairly simple proposition to "monetize" the backlog by borrowing &# billion to return to shareholders said roger read an analyst with natexis bleichroeder inc in houston backlogs are also approaching &# billion at noble corp and diamond offshore drilling inc the next two largest drillers by market capitalization both noble and diamond are favored by analysts who see potential to convert those backlogs or cash accumulated in the past few years of heady profits into growth mr read gives the edge to noble as best poised to turn cash into increased size as a majority of diamond shares are owned by loews corp a family owned holding company that has been less aggressive about expansion "clearly noble is a company that wants to build you have to think of them as acquisitive " mr read said "but its not out of the realm of possibility that they could be acquired as well " noble officials have repeatedly come out against buying or selling to a rival but have left open the possibility of buying part of a competitors assets for noble transoceans method of giving back to shareholders lacks appeal however "as we have said in the past a leveraged recapitalization is not necessarily the best way for noble to add value " said spokesman john breed "our superior execution and margins are things we are doing today that we believe add that kind of value for our long term shareholders " industry observers agree that the drilling boom should extend at least through in shallower water and even longer for deepwater rigs some rigs are being booked into the next decade offering increasing evidence that the good times will last well beyond transocean noble and other drillers are putting much of their profits back into their fleets either by upgrading assets to perform in more challenging environments or by building new rigs the latter approach has become so popular that transocean and globalsantafe merged in part to stay competitive in areas where they were losing ground "another driver for the deal is the potential loss of deepwater market share by both companies to the approximately floating rig newbuilds slated to be delivered over the next few years " jefferies &amp co analyst judson bailey wrote in a research note moodys investors service said after the deal was announced it is reviewing both companies credit ratings for possible downgrade but it doesnt expect either to lose its investment grade status "given the scale diversification quality of the combined rig fleet and the current fundamentals of the offshore drilling markets " transocean operator of the largest fleet of deepwater rigs by a wide margin was falling behind in the market for shallow water rigs known as jackups globalsantafe an international jackup powerhouse owns a relatively small deepwater fleet noble is building six rigs including jackups and deepwater while diamond is building two jackups pride international inc is one notable new entrant into the premium offshore rig market as it has taken steps to upgrade its deepwater fleet the company recently announced that it will build or buy two new drillships the type of rig capable of drilling in the deepest water from a korean construction yard for delivery in "theyre getting there " mr read said "pride has a potential for committing a significant backlog that could then be monetized " not everyone sees bigger as necessarily better in a conference call with analysts last week diamond offshore ceo larry dickerson said that everyone from atwood oceanics inc with rigs to the new transocean with has recently found success a merger therefore might not be mandatory to compete he said "certainly in this market theres such demand on the floating side for equipment that a small competitor does very well " mr dickerson said "everyone else does well i think fewer participants weve seen that in the past leads to a more orderly bidding process but ultimately the market does rule "
