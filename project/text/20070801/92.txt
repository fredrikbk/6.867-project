playtex is expected to keep energizer going and going energizer holdings inc is betting on a new acquisition to recharge growth the battery flashlight and razor makers decision to buy tampon sunscreen and diaper genie company playtex products inc could bode well for energizers business the deal has yet to close but once complete it would allow energizer to diversify it also would leave energizer with less exposure to the battery industry which has been hit by high commodity costs and price wars "its a good acquisition for energizer they have been looking to broaden their offering for some time " said morningstar inc analyst lauren desanto she said energizer paid a considerable premium for playtex but the deal has the potential to produce meaningful revenue and cost benefits energizer agreed to pay &# a share for playtex a premium to the stocks closing price july two days before the deal was announced including debt the deal then had a value of about &# billion some analysts said playtex and energizer might complement each other well playtex gets most of its sales domestically and energizers international footprint would give playtex a presence in markets abroad "its shades of what happened when gillette sold to p&amp g " a g edwards analyst jason gere said if gillette hadnt been acquired by procter &amp gamble co in it would have had to build its own infrastructure in some emerging markets mr gere said although playtex has a large number of offerings its portfolio isnt unwieldy most of its offerings fall within a few distinct categories like feminine care and baby care which would make it easier for energizer to manage its new acquisition integrating such a diverse set of products comes with its set of challenges energizer best known for its battery powered bunny mascot has a strong track record on that count the company bought razor maker schick wilkinson sword in and was able to successfully join that company with its battery business there are potential hurdles for one playtex has been on its own acquisition spree recently the company bought tiki hut holding the owner of the hawaiian tropic sun care brand in april for &# million also playtex shareholders have yet to approve the deal and mr gere believes some holders might be reluctant to sign off on it some stakeholders might believe the company might be worth more especially if it was broken up and sold in parts mr gere said still most analysts arent expecting a higher bid at this stage and say that energizer likely will be able to complete the deal at the current price "i think it the shareholder vote will be close but my opinion is that the deal will go through " mr gere said an energizer representative couldnt be reached to comment a playtex spokeswoman pointed out the deal had the unanimous support of her companys board the playtex shareholder vote is likely to take place in the next two months or so the spokeswoman said a deal once complete should add to energizers earnings in fiscal that eventually could help the stock mr gere said he and most other analysts have a hold rating on the energizer shares which were at &# in late afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange for the moment until there is more clarity on the deal mr gere said the stock merits a hold rating because the companys revenue and earnings growth trends without the benefits of the playtex buy are likely to decelerate in fiscal energizer had about of its &# billion in total sales from the battery business the battery industry in general has been facing a number of head winds higher costs for commodities such as zinc are crimping profits and tough competition especially cheaper private label or store branded products has made it harder for battery makers to raise prices "its a commodity like category in some ways " ms desanto said "there are routinely price wars in the segment " energizer has managed to keep its head above water but total profits from its battery business rose less than in fiscal to &# million energizer is probably the most innovative company in the battery sector ms desanto said the company sells a wide variety of batteries including rechargeable ones specialty batteries for film cameras and special hearing aid batteries energizer is a close no in the alkaline battery market in the u s after procter &amp gambles duracell when energizer reported its latest earnings results the company said battery material costs continue to be above historical levels playtex likely will give energizer a buffer against the vagaries of the battery business its portfolio includes a slew of products including wet ones hand wipes banana boat sun care and the diaper genie diaper disposal system as well as namesake tampons bottles and gloves that are among the best performing brands in their respective categories playtex had sales of &# million and earnings of &# million although the two companies have a diverse set of products most sell in the same retail and grocery stores ms desanto pointed out energizer is unlikely to divest itself of any of playtexs brands anytime soon at a conference call after the acquisition was announced
