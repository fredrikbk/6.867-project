the morning brief is it bad enough for the fed online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here a remorseless run of bad financial news has cemented investors expectations for another interest rate cut next month by the federal reserve and yet the minutes of the last fed meeting suggest policy makers felt the cut they made then was already insurance against further economic weakening first the latest bad news and it was big freddie mac one of the two giant government chartered providers of funds for the mortgage market posted a &# billion loss for the third quarter and said losses from defaulting mortgages would probably top &# billion since freddie and larger sister institution fannie mae are charged with stabilizing the availability of loans to potential homeowners freddies pessimism was the latest evidence of how deeply the ailing housing and credit markets are troubling the economy as the washington post notes in an example of what freddies fragility means for the rest of the industry countrywide financial which has survived the mortgage meltdown so far thanks to a capital infusion from bank of america will now have an even tougher time making new loans the los angeles times points out countrywide said in the summer that it would cut back on riskier subprime loans in favor of the safer mortgages it could arrange and then sell to freddie and fannie but freddie said yesterday it had to sell mortgages to deal with its financial problems freddie and fannie have also figured prominently in washington debates about how to address the mortgage crisis and freddies losses mean they will "have less power to prop up the housing market than some politicians hoped " the wall street journal adds financial institutions lack of demand for mortgages means less money available for home loans which could translate into higher interest rates even as concern continues to grow about the millions of homeowners now or soon to be facing mortgage payments they cant afford u s treasury secretary henry paulson tells the journal his outlook on the problem has evolved as he learned more about the situation and that he has reversed his resistance to taking a group approach to the problem the paper says mr paulson is now "pressing the mortgage service industry to help broad swaths of borrowers qualify for better loans instead of dealing with mortgage problems on a case by case basis " on another rescue front partly initiated by mr paulson it now looks like the superfund led by citigroup bank of america and j p morgan chase aimed at propping up the pervasive market for securitized bundles of mortgages has tapped asset manager blackrock to be its overseer the financial times reports that the choice of blackrock to oversee the &# billion fund "is seen as an important vote of confidence in the plan which met with initial skepticism from some banks and investors " the new york times adds that a custodian for the fund might soon be named and citing people with knowledge of the matter says a leading contender is bank of new york mellon and now to the question of whether the fed will soon again lower the cost of borrowed money as the journal reports the latest and newly rejiggered economic forecasts from the fed show expectations for sluggish growth next year and worries the plight of the u s economy could worsen that only sharpened the markets appetite for another quarter point rate cut reinforcing "the impression that despite the feds officially neutral stance it is in fact worried more about growth than inflation " the journal says indeed the fed expressed neutrality on oct but in the fast evolving economic environment of recent months the u s central bank has changed its stance over shorter intervals still members of the federal open market committee were already bracing for more trouble "with aggregate demand showing somewhat greater than expected strength in the third quarter and little evidence of significant spillovers from the housing sector to other components of spending participants viewed the downside risks to growth as somewhat smaller than at the time of the september meeting but those risks were still seen as significant " the fomc minutes say capital spending still seemed to be growing at a solid pace and the housing markets effects on consumers seemed limited moreover some upside risks to inflation remained to the point that some members noted that rate cuts could be reversed if needed and "financial market functioning was judged to have improved somewhat since the previous fomc meeting" even as "the situation in a number of markets remained strained and credit market conditions were thought likely to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters " thus while fomc members viewed the markets as fragile and worried about "an adverse shock" like a drop in credit quality or "unusually large and unanticipated losses" like freddies many considered the cut they were making "a close call " "moreover " the minutes say most members already "saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity " so ahead of their next meeting on dec the question is what it would take to make them change their minds this just in corruption probe hones in on chirac the lawyer of former president jacques chirac
