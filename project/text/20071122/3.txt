financing do you owe the dreaded self employment tax online edition if youre self employed dont forget one person you have to answer to uncle sam when net earnings from self employment top &# a year you have to file schedule se with your form and you may owe the dreaded self employment tax too if so that will be on top of any income taxes owed to the feds and your friendly state tax collector rest assured that i feel your pain because i have to pay the se tax myself heres what you need to know about this nasty element of the tax law se tax basics the purpose of the se tax is to collect social security and medicare taxes from self employed folks now if youre an employee the first &# of your wages for are hit with the social security tax at a rate of all of your wages &lt mdash&gt no matter how high &lt mdash&gt face the medicare tax at a rate of half of these taxes are withheld from your paychecks while the other half get paid by your employer since you never actually see the half paid by your employer you may be blissfully unaware of how high the social security and medicare taxes really are in contrast self employed individuals cannot help but notice &lt mdash&gt because they have to pay both halves by writing checks to the government as part of their quarterly estimated tax payments the bottom line is that for a self employed person owes se tax at a whopping rate on the first &# of se income of that rate is for the social security tax and is for the medicare tax if your se income exceeds the &# social security tax cutoff point the extra income will be hit with a se tax rate to cover the medicare tax unfortunately the se tax is only going to get worse if you have a profitable and growing business why because the social security tax cutoff point is raised each year for inflation therefore your se tax bill is likely to increase every year because more of your se income will be taxed at the maximum rate even worse the inflation rate used for the social security tax cutoff point is generally higher than the overall consumer price index cpi inflation rate that you commonly hear about for the social security tax cutoff point will increase from the current &# to &# which represents a bump calculating the se tax you must fill out schedule se to calculate how much se tax you owe heres the drill take your bottom line net business income from schedule c if youre a sole proprietor or schedule e if your self employed business is treated as a partnership for tax purposes or schedule f if youre a farmer multiply that bottom line number by the factor of dont ask the reason for this step you dont want to know the result is your se income as mentioned earlier the first &# of se income gets taxed at while any remainder gets taxed at heres an example say this years schedule c for your sole proprietorship business shows net business income of &# your se income is &# &# x &# the first &# gets taxed at the maximum rate the remaining &# gets taxed at so your se tax bill adds up to &# &# x + &# x &# now lets say you have the same &# of schedule c income in your se income is the same &# but this time the first &# gets taxed at the maximum rate while the remaining &# gets taxed at so your se tax bill will be &# &# x + &# x &# the &# increase over is due to the higher social security tax cutoff point for say your spouse is also self employed in a separate business and earns &# of net schedule c income from her venture she must separately calculate her se tax liability on her own schedule se and pay the maximum rate up to the aforementioned social security tax cutoff point &# for &# for so her se tax bills will be exactly the same as yours this is true even if you two file a joint form sadly the tax law doesnt allow you to combine your se incomes and make a unitary se tax calculation &lt mdash&gt which would save you tons of money because you and your spouse would only have to pass through the social security tax cutoff point once instead of twice now for a little good news enough gloom and doom there are a few rays of sunshine even in this generally dreadful se tax picture heres a sampling if you have a job and have social security tax taken out of your salary you get credit for that on your schedule se for example say you have a &# salary and earn &# of se income from a side business in you only have to pay the maximum se tax rate on the first &# of the se income because you get credit for already paying social security tax on the &# of salary however you must still pay the se tax rate on the entire &# of se income to cover the medicare tax this all gets taken care of automatically if you fill out schedule se properly if you and your spouse are the co owners of an unincorporated business in one of the nine community property states which include california and texas the irs generally allows you to treat one spouse as the sole owner for tax purposes the irs doesnt appear to care which one that person then fills out one schedule se to calculate the entire se tax hit from the husband wife venture this means you only have to go through the social security tax cutoff point once which can greatly reduce your se tax bill unfortunately the instructions to schedule se make it anything but clear that this special loophole exists but it does according to irs revenue procedure if you think you qualify you may want to hire a tax pro to get involved with your return last but not least you generally dont have to pay se tax on profits from selling business assets that are not considered inventory for example say you sell a small office building that has been used for years to house your unincorporated business you dont have to put the gain on schedule se so you dont owe any se tax instead you can generally treat the entire gain as a low taxed long term capital gain bill bischoff a certified public accountant with more than years of experience has authored books and training courses for tax professionals and frequently writes about consumer and small business tax matters
