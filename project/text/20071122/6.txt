the expat life long distance democracy takes missionary zeal online edition last week about american citizens gathered in the lobby of an upscale beijing apartment building munching chili dogs and brownies and sipping diet coke beer and wine the group which included investment bankers lawyers and analysts crowded around a speakerphone to listen to a speech by michelle obama the wife of democratic presidential candidate barack obama another or people were listening in from shanghai tokyo nagoya singapore hong kong and jakarta the call was the work of americans in china for obama a group started last year to raise money for and awareness about the candidate the organizers also hope to advise the candidate about china issues last june at a similar event sen obama addressed groups in beijing and shanghai over the phone accenting his own experience growing up abroad and answering questions no other major campaign seems to boast a similarly well organized grassroots group in china however candidates including mitt romney hillary clinton and rudy guiliani have made significant fundraising and outreach overtures to americans living in london hong kong and elsewhere democrats abroad and republicans abroad each have chapters around the world dedicated to helping american expats remain politically engaged both groups have active chapters in hong kong but not in mainland china where they fear antagonizing the chinese government though there doesnt seem to be any law prohibiting their presence and my own sense is that it wouldnt cause a ripple interested american citizens here can and do join the hong kong chapters i have always been a bit of a political junkie and i still track the ups and downs of washington through online news resources i have voted in every election since i turned including off years and off off years where only things like school boards and town councils were on the ballot because i moved a lot and always wanted to have a local vote in my first years of eligibility i registered and cast ballots in pennsylvania michigan twice california florida new york and new jersey when i moved to china it never occurred to me that it would be more than a blip in my voting record but when i finally tried to swing into action before last years midterm congressional elections i realized that my new jersey registration had been canceled because i had had my mail forwarded to my parents house in pittsburgh for the first time in over years i was no longer a registered voter rectifying that proved more difficult than i anticipated americans living abroad have had the right to vote by casting an absentee ballot in the congressional district where they last resided since when congress passed the overseas citizens voting rights act i had the vague idea that i could now vote electronically but in fact no expat can do so china can present some unique problems for the last two weeks i have not been able to log onto the government site www fvap gov because it is banned behind the great firewall of china i dont know why nor will i ever find out it is equally likely to reappear at any moment or remain locked down indefinitely luckily voters can also register at the web sites for democrats or republicans abroad or the non partisan www overseasvotefoundation org an essential resource but even though i registered and downloaded a new jersey registration at the latter the other day i still have to mail it back to essex county n j and wait hopefully for an absentee ballot to arrive the same way so i can again use snail mail to cast my ballot i urge any american living outside the country to get an early start checking his her registration and receiving an absentee ballot because it can take a while its no surprise that some expats have taken a missionary zeal to helping others cast a ballot "i see helping americans living abroad register and vote as a part of the long tradition of fighting for the process and right to vote " says carolyn sauvage mar chair of democrats abroad india "your chances of meeting all the rules and deadlines as john q public are at best so were trying to improve the odds " democrats who dont manage to update their registration or simply prefer to vote as an international community member can also cast a ballot in the democrats abroad global primary to be held on their site from feb to feb the victorious candidate will receive the votes from the democrats abroad delegates who will be at the party convention next august republicans abroad are not running a similar election nor will they have delegates at the convention recent elections have emphasized the value of each vote ms sauvage mar says there is anecdotal evidence that overseas ballots helped turn the virginia senate race between george allen and jim webb where less than votes helped shift the body to democratic from republican control the gore bush election was also a reminder of the power of a single vote a fact often sited by politically active expats a feeling that the bush administration has damaged americas international standing has prompted many democrats living abroad to look for ways to assist their party "i never did that much here politically until after president bush was elected and i became very concerned about the state of our country " says anne stevenson yang who has lived in beijing for years and is active with the obama group "it felt like my country changed while i was away almost as if your parents moved house while you were away at college and didnt tell you " similarly animosity towards bill clinton spurred some expat republicans to get involved including christopher fussner an american in singapore who has lived outside the u s for years and is now global chairman of republicans abroad "i never even voted the first or years i was abroad " says mr fussner "then i became really disgusted with president clintons policies and said whoa i better figure out a way to do something " some people who live abroad feel that the experience actually fuels their desire to be involved and changes their perspective on politics "people getting politically involved overseas seem a bit more genuine and dedicated to what theyre doing than many back in the states " says alan seigrist vice chair for republican abroads hong kong chapter "i find the same thing in democrats abroad and the mere fact that we are all friends and colleagues shows that it can be a friendlier political environment here until election day that is " living abroad offers a different perspective on america and its place in the world many feel that by living and working with people from many nationalities they have gained a keener appreciation of the challenges and opportunities presented by an increasingly globalized society "i actually think we see the future coming a little bit more than most americans are able to " says mike dardzinski an american who has lived in beijing for four and a half years and was one of the founders of americans in china for obama "living in most places in america you just dont deal with people from all over the world every day like we do here and thats the future " write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published below
