business world yes logo tara gum is partly soluble in water and it increases the gelling properties of agar come again those mystifying words are to be found in a british government handout itself based on the world health organizations useful "food additive series " describing an ingredient in breyers "all natural" ice cream residents of advanced societies consume a lot of such chemicals and we seem perfectly happy about it what makes us sure when we rip open a package of doritos the global food industry wont poison us do we owe our thanks mainly to the u s food and drug administration and similar agencies that suggestion would hardly reassure anyone who held up the number of fda inspectors against the number of food products flowing into america from the four corners of the world its also an answer that china now worried about the acceptability of its vast extruded abundance would be wise to take with a pinch of salt substitute china is just one or two fresh controversies away from a full blown crisis of confidence thanks to recent scandals over tainted pet food and toothpaste exports beijing is keen to be seen outfitting government inspectors with superman capes on tuesday a court ordered the execution of chinas former chief food and drug regulator for accepting bribes such steps may have pr value but china had better quickly upgrade its understanding of the real source of consumer safety in a mass consumption society an accounting mystery known as intangible capital intangible capital doesnt appear on company balance sheets but it accounts for one third to one half the stock market value of the fortune i e whats left after subtracting buildings machines resource rights and other elements of tangible capital one particularly important form of intangible capital is "brand equity " three federal reserve economists estimated that by the late s some &# billion of all corporate spending was devoted to brand building thats about of gdp spent trying to win the attention and trust of consumers an investment that can quickly be squandered if a product fails to perform as expected we couldnt run a modern economy without this massive investment in communicating product attributes and imagery however much the antiglobalization crowd likes imagining a "no logo" world in which advertising and brands are rejected by consumers you wouldnt be able to crack a pack of twinkies or quaff a diet beverage with any confidence that you wouldnt soon be writhing down at the local emergency ward take the pet food industry nearly a hundred brands from alpo to eukanuba put out by dozens of companies have been recalled thanks to the chinese melamine scandal involving an illegal additive designed falsely to suggest a high protein content yet the actual food itself comes from a rather smaller handful of manufacturers such as menu foods del monte and purina the pet food market in short sustains more brands than true varieties of pet food consisting of numerous marketers who are mainly rebranders of commodity pet food and whose chief stock in trade is their reputation with customers built up through advertising and repeat purchases these consumer relationships are now in flux at great cost to companies and their investors for a typical consumer product of customers account for of sales in the pet food business nearly half goes to households with incomes greater than &# i e shoppers especially willing and able to spend money pleasing their furry friends pet food makers today are paying a price for failing a test they set for themselves in their advertising which in recent years has been all about insinuating brand names into the emotional bonds between man and fido purina has vowed to begin expensive testing of all ingredients bain capital the lbo group that owned pet food maker nutro is beating a retreat selling out this month to mars inc yep the giant candy maker mars last year snapped up doane pet care from the ontario teachers pension plan which had bought the company just nine months earlier expect more such consolidation into the hands of stronger players capable of overhauling industry practices and imposing rigorous quality control here pet food follows a trail blazed by sneakers clothing and other import dependent and image dependent industries wal mart for one spends billions regulating the behavior of its overseas suppliers fearing otherwise their environmental and labor outrages might sully wal marts brand equity you would have to weed through the media to find it but many in china understand the problem and complain loudly that bad actors are killing business for manufacturers whove worked diligently to win the trust of overseas customers goldcredit international the wuxi based maker of dr kool toothpaste last week posted a "legal declaration" pleading with the media not to associate it with tainted tubes of "mr cool" turning up in latin america containing diethylene glycol an ingredient in anti freeze which was apparently used by some manufacturers as a substitute for pharmaceutical grade glycerin china was destined one day to suffer blowback from its shortsighted attitude toward intellectual property especially its disregard of trademarks such protection is vital to public safety investments in "reputation" and quality arent worth much and wont take place if they can be freely expropriated by knock off artists but the assurance of quality that a brand conveys is effective only when a consumer can assume that contrary information if any exists would reach his ears thats why a free press is vital too china is busy brushing up plans to appease global critics with an upgraded fda of its own thats fine but it also needs to set loose its domestic press on its teeming unpoliced small manufacturing industries thats the true path to creating a mass consumption economy thats safe for the mass consumers
