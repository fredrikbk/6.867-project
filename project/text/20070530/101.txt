sec is allowed access to delaware high court recent changes to delawares constitution allow the securities and exchange commission to pose questions directly to the state supreme court about murky aspects of state law the action announced by the delaware high court on may is expected to shed much needed light on when the sec staffers should support companies efforts to reject proposals on the grounds that they conflict with delaware state law "the change will allow for greater certainty at the sec level which is important because it will enable the sec when confronted with a debated question of delaware law to seek an authoritative answer rather than guessing " said e norman veasey former chief justice of the delaware supreme court and a senior partner at law firm weil gotshal &amp manges half of all publicly traded companies are incorporated in delaware before definitively rejecting a proposal from the proxy materials corporations generally seek guidance from the sec that theyre acting in accordance with agency rules by requesting a "no action" letter from the secs staff under sec rules proposals may be rejected on the grounds that they violate rules of the state this can place the agency in the awkward position of having to interpret states laws in delaware for example there are open questions about when companies can reject binding proposals that seek to change companies bylaws it is generally accepted that shareholders can vote on a proposal that demands a change in the bylaws so long as the change doesnt conflict with the boards responsibility to manage the business and affairs of the company but deciding when this might occur can be a matter of interpretation and one arguably best suited for the state courts not the sec officials from the sec werent available to comment but the agencys general counsel brian g cartwright said in a press release issued by the delaware supreme court that he is "delighted" by the change there was some debate last year for example over a proposal that sought to require ca inc s board to receive approval from all of the companys directors before adopting a poison pill plan the proposal also required a unanimous vote by the board to extend the plan beyond a year ca initially rejected the proposal on the grounds that it violated state law and interfered with the boards ability to manage the affairs of the company supporters of the proposal argued that it was crafted in such a way that it only gave shareholders the right to govern the voting requirements surrounding the approval of a poison pill while retaining the boards power over the actual plan cas rejection led to an immediate court challenge by the drafter of the resolution harvard professor and shareholder rights activist lucian bebchuk the case was filed by law firm grant &amp eisenhofer before the secs staff had a chance to weigh in in the end the delaware judge on the case refused to rule on the legality of cas decision to reject the proposal saying the issue wasnt "ripe" for a decision the proposal was ultimately added to the companys proxy materials but it didnt receive a majority of shareholders support vice chancellor of the delaware court of chancery leo e strine said the constitutional change could make it harder for the courts to withhold judgment until shareholders approve a proposal "i dont want to prejudge it but it becomes more difficult i think for a judge on the delaware court of chancery asked by an issuer or a proponent to render a declaratory judgment to say its not ripe " he said the change may prompt more shareholders to submit binding proposals to test their powers said claudia allen chairwoman of the corporate governance practice with law firm neal gerber &amp eisenberg llp in chicago "in an era of increased shareholder activism i think were more likely to see more of these " she said judith burns contributed to this article
