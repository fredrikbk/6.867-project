is it too late to buy stocks not if you have time and guts the higher stocks climb the worse some investors feel these of course are the folks sitting on the sidelines wishing they had jumped into the market months ago is it too late for these investors to get in or will shares keep rising in the months ahead this may not be a totally stupid question but its likely to get you a stupid answer growing nervous to be sure theres a fistful of reasons to fret about the markets direction the current bull market is more than four years old with the standard &amp poors index of large company stocks up since the october market low we have also seen some wild share price swings this year notably the point dive by the dow jones industrial average on feb to make matters worse some longstanding market trends appear to be breaking down during the current decade small company shares have regularly beaten large stocks value stocks have outpaced growth companies and real estate investment trusts have trounced just about everything but in all that has changed the s&amp p is beating the russell index of small stocks and many growth indexes are outpacing value indexes what about reits after heady gains earlier this year they have fallen back and are now treading water in seeking value still at first blush shares appear reasonably valued the s&amp p is at times trailing month reported earnings thats higher than the historical average of about times earnings but not greatly so moreover earnings are expected to climb almost over the next months adding to stocks allure "the s&amp p isnt a screaming buy " allows ken gregory president of litman gregory asset management in orinda calif "but theres no valuation red flag " indeed if you ignore dividends the s&amp p is still below its march bull market peak feeling bullish heres the problem investors tend to look at the s&amp p because theres good valuation data available and then assume its a reasonable guide to the rest of the market but it isnt other market segments including small u s stocks reits developed foreign markets and emerging markets have fared far better in recent years so bargains in these areas are harder to come by "there certainly isnt any other area that looks more attractive than the s&amp p and some look significantly less attractive " mr gregory argues weighing risk put it all together and i think theres ample cause for caution but i am not suggesting you avoid stocks and i am not predicting a market decline the reality is nobody knows what will happen to share prices over the next months so its foolish to base your investment decisions on such forecasts instead todays uncertainty is a reminder to focus on something you really can control which is the amount of risk you take you probably shouldnt put large amounts of new money into stocks unless you have at least seven or eight years to invest that might seem like a long time but remember you ought to begin easing out of stocks once youre within five years of your goal this is particularly important if you are investing for say a kids college education or a house down payment where you will use the money fairly quickly those approaching retirement on the other hand have more flexibility because they might spend down their savings over years in addition to the time horizon give some thought to how much risk you can truly tolerate if you arent bothered by the idea of investing a slug of money and then seeing the market plunge jump right in but most folks arent that brave so theyll want to take it slowly "if youre worried about investing a large sum all at once invest half right away and invest the other half over the next six months " suggests alan skrainka chief market strategist at edward jones "that way you spread the risk a little "
