politics &amp economics bill to expand r&amp d tax break divides supporters simpler formula hurts some firms promoting risk congress is considering a major increase in the multibillion dollar tax break for corporate research but a proposal to change how the credit is calculated is prompting an unusual split among its beneficiaries the boost would follow congresss expansion in december of the "research &amp experimentation" tax credit which gives companies a credit on their tax bills for part of their research and development spending that version increased the annual subsidy to an estimated &# billion from &# billion chiefly by adding a new formula for calculating the credit now separate senate and house bills would expand the program further an effort favored by many companies in industries such as technology defense and auto making hewlett packard co and microsoft corp are among those lobbying for expansion the credit is one of the biggest corporate tax breaks offered by the u s government backers say it fosters innovation and helps u s companies compete with overseas firms that receive similar subsidies critics contend that it subsidizes research that companies would perform anyway and that the government hasnt adequately evaluated how well the credit promotes riskier but potentially less profitable research most of the benefits of the r&amp d tax break flow to a small number of large corporations roughly companies received of the &# billion tax benefit in internal revenue service data show in total more than companies got some benefit from the credit in according to the irs but one of the bills introduced by sen max baucus d mont chairman of the senates tax writing finance committee has created a stir among a group of companies that benefit from the credit while the bill proposes to make more generous one of the two main formulas used to calculate the tax credit it would eliminate the other main method that would be bad news to several big companies that could get a greater benefit with the old formula including nortel networks corp electronic data systems corp and panasonic corp of north america say people familiar with the companies thinking they are lobbying to get mr baucus to keep the old formula while supporting his proposal to make the other formula more generous the formula that the baucus bill proposes to drop dates back to the early days of the research tax credit under it companies calculate their qualified domestic research spending over the previous four years as a percentage of their total u s gross receipts and then compare that to the percentage they spent during the mid s they then are able to get a tax credit for a portion of the spread between those two percentages companies receive a credit only if their research has risen as a percentage of their gross receipts compared with that ratio in the mid s but after letting the credit lapse last year congress put an alternate formula in the sweetened version it passed in december under that option companies compare the most recent years qualified domestic research spending to half of the average of the prior three years twelve percent of the difference counts as a tax credit against the companys u s corporate income tax bill mr baucuss proposal would increase that percentage to from and eliminate the old formula that could expand the tax break to as much as &# billion annually according to estimates by two lobbyists advocating an expansion of the program no official cost estimates have been released an aide to mr baucus said the current tax credit is complex and difficult for the irs to oversee and administer his proposal is aimed at streamlining simplifying and enhancing the tax credit the aide said the proposal has sparked disagreement among companies that usually are aligned on lobbying for the credit some that use the old formula are likely to move to the new one eventually but worry they will lose out in the short term the r&amp d credit coalition which says it has more than participating companies backs mr baucuss proposal so long as companies using the old method have no benefit reduction said monica mcguire the coalitions executive secretary and senior policy director of taxation for the national association of manufacturers other companies such as daimlerchrysler ag and texas instruments inc would support mr baucuss proposed bill but only if the newer formula is expanded to the full he proposes say people familiar with the companies thinking hewlett packard one of the biggest users of the credit supports the baucus bill regardless of whether the traditional credit gets dropped "in our view having only the simplified credit would really provide a good incentive across the economy for most companies for which r&amp d is a significant important expense " said dan kostenbauder h ps vice president for transaction taxes he asserts that a majority of companies that use the credit would benefit if mr baucuss bill became law a house version of the bill introduced this month by rep sander m levin a michigan democrat expands the newer formula to and keeps the old formula that bill has co sponsors including about half from the houses tax writing ways and means committee suggesting it will head to the floor with strong support lawmakers from both parties have said they want to make the research credit permanent both of the current bills propose it though they acknowledge that would be expensive new pay as you go budget rules which require tax breaks to be offset with spending reductions or tax increases elsewhere are likely to constrain the ability of lawmakers to make sweeping changes this year "i think this year is going to be a difficult year because of the budget situation and the pay go rules " said karen myers the vice president for government relations at software maker ca inc which supports an expansion of the program however the credit is popular since its creation in congress has extended the credit times the congressional budget office projected it would cost &# billion over the year span starting in to make permanent the credits current version the current years u s budget totals &# trillion corrections &amp amplifications daimlerchrysler ag would support a less generous expansion of the research and experimentation tax credit than the one proposed in a bill introduced by sen max baucus a politics &amp economics article yesterday incorrectly said the company would only support the legislation as currently proposed wsj may
