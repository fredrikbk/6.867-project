common sense options strategy is forgiving when its wrong but profitable smartmoney it isnt easy selling into a bull market even though thats often whats required to sell higher and buy lower if it were easy more people would do it and bull markets wouldnt run as far or as long or provide as many opportunities to profit but there is a way to have your cake and eat it which is to say take some profits and continue to ride the bull you can sell some out of the money covered calls this is an options strategy ive addressed before and one i often use to raise cash when the market reaches one of my selling thresholds as it did this spring ive employed the tactic when i thought the market was overvalued and likely to fall when that happens the value of the calls i sold drops and eventually they expire worthless with the stock trading below the strike price ive always been rather proud that over the years ive been selling covered calls every one has expired worthless until now this humbling experience has come at the hands of bmc software the houston information technology management concern a stock id long admired and bought years ago after the tech meltdown its been a solid performer gaining roughly in the past year alone indeed the stock has done so well that it showed up on a screen of overvalued stocks i ran last fall so when the dow jones industrial average crossed in october and investors seemed unduly euphoric over that i sold bmc calls back then bmc was trading at &# i sold calls with a strike price of &# expiring in may i recognize now that this was an unusual approach for me the duration of the option seven months was longer than usual and the strike price was much closer to the stock price i usually aim for something further out of the money of course i know why i did this i got a lot more money for the calls call values go up the longer the option period and the lower the strike price looking back now the call premiums or the amount an investor is willing to wager that the stock will rise werent all that high still i got close to &# a call which meant i was locking in a roughly further gain in the event bmc shares were trading above &# may in implementing this strategy i assumed that the market overall wasnt likely to rally much further over the ensuing seven months and that bmc in particular was overvalued in both respects i was wrong as everyone knows the market has continued to surge regularly hitting new highs and bmcs earnings last year were better than expected making its high peg ratio look much more reasonable if only i had waited just a few weeks by nov bmc had shot above the strike price to &# in february it hit &# the value of those bmc calls i sold was glaring at me every time i looked at my account calls youve sold are carried as a debit on your statement i recall their trading well above &# which represented more than a loss or forgone profit on the position i could have sold them for so much more but who has perfect timing that turned out to be the worst of it bmc came down to earth in the february pullback even though the shares never again traded below &# they never regained their peak they closed may at &# less than a dollar above the strike price i delivered the shares for &# with the call proceeds i earned a total of nearly &# a share or a modest profit over simply holding the shares and selling them may at the market price so i still came out ahead even though i was wrong about both the direction of the market and bmc id say thats a pretty forgiving strategy moreover all the other calls i sold last fall have now expired worthless except for one which doesnt expire until july so as the stock market keeps rising ive sold more calls as these expired most recently network appliance again cymer again and goldman sachs group i could still miss out on some big gains but the higher the market gets the more attractive i find this call strategy james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
