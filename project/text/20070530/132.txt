youve insulted the bbc and our missing reporter bret stephenss suggestion in "a reporters fate" global view may that the bbc enjoyed an advantage in terms of access and protection from the palestinian authority because we failed to challenge those in power is offensive and professionally very damaging moreover its an insult to a man who is currently unable to defend himself the idea that bbc correspondent alan johnston was posted somewhere no one else was prepared to go is just wrong when alan began his assignment in gaza three years ago a number of western journalists were working there as you know the situation changed in the time alan was there clearly i and my colleagues have asked ourselves many questions in the weeks since march i think its most unfair for mr stephens to suggest that the bbcs "failures of prudence and judgment put its reporters life in jeopardy " the irony of course is that mr stephenss column appeared the day after michael winterbottoms film about daniel pearls abduction and execution received its premiere in cannes no one knows better the complexity of such cases as daniels and alans than those at the wall street journal so its even more disappointing that this piece appeared in the wall street journal the bbc is no more responsible for the kidnap of alan johnston than was the wsj for the execution of daniel pearl mr stephens is entitled to his view however there is an alternative perspective jon williams bbc world editor london
