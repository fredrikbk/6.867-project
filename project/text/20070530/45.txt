fiscally fit avoiding the impulse terri swears off discount superclubs after another expensive shopping trip online edition the year you turn is the year repeatedly failed new years resolutions quit smoking quit drinking eat better exercise more actually show some promise of being fulfilled last weekend however as i sat and chatted with my fortysomething friends at a memorial day barbeque i discovered there was another bad habit id sworn off without a new years resolution shopping at discount superclubs what struck me was how similar all of our experiences were wed been drawn in by the deep discounts and the fun of the unknown until the superclub excursion became a routine wed weave our carts through the football field sized warehouse slowly piling up family and bulk sized necessities such as paper towels and detergent as well as impulse purchases such as dvds or champion sweatshirts inevitably wed walk out of the store spending far more than we would have if wed stuck to the traditional grocery store a superclub visit "is a &# trip no matter what youre shopping for " my friend darleen said and most of my friends at the party nodded in agreement a decade ago gerry and i started going to our superclub once a month and inevitably wed buy things we wanted but really didnt need i started weaning myself from the discount superstore about five years ago out of sheer exhaustion hours of wandering aisles becomes far less enthralling when youve got to keep an toddler entertained by the time our son gerald was three years old the superstore experience had become a chore so i let our membership lapse but my father in law gerald the most frugal person ive ever met swears by his superclub membership hes not plagued with our bad habits when he shops at the superclub hes never tempted to make impulse purchases he makes a beeline for the grocery section and buys meats seafood and bread in bulk then separates them into individual sized portions when he gets home and freezes them he stores restaurant sized containers of condiments sauces and spices away in his pantry my father in law says the family sized portions arent just a good buy they save him gas because they last so long that he doesnt have to take as many trips to buy groceries during my father in laws last visit to the warehouse store the outdoor dining sets caught his eye he knew we were shopping for a dining set for our backyard deck and thought the sets looked like a bargain so he called my husband gerry and invited us to come shopping with him to see the sets hoping to save us some money so we went though i knew what was coming whether i liked the sets or not we werent going to leave the store without buying something and that something would probably be expensive we entered the store and were greeted by a bank of flat screen tvs and home theater systems that gerry finds irresistible i reminded my husband that we were looking for dining sets and only dining sets in order to get to the dining sets we had to pass the home improvement aisles walking by products that gerry eyed with the same look gerald had when we visited the m&amp m candy store in times square i was about two aisles away from the dining sets before i realized gerry was no longer walking with us he had stopped to look at a &# gas powered pressure washer "a great price " he said hed been wanting to buy a pressure washer to use on our boat for years at the beginning and end of every boating season we have to drive two towns away to use the one at a car boat wash an inconvenience gerry wanted to do away with as he looked over the machine i tried to get him back to focusing on the dining set by suggesting it would be a better idea to shop around online to make sure it was a good price "we could always come back " i said his father was more insistent "youre not actually thinking of buying that thing " reluctantly gerry pulled himself away from the machine and we headed for the tables before we entered the store gerry had decided to leave the table decision up to me so he looked over the sets for a moment and agreed with whatever i had to say about them as my father in law offered his opinions i heard my son chirp "where ya goin dad " gerry had begun to slowly make his way back to the home improvement aisle i sighed instead of a dining set wed be going home with a pressure washer after hauling the machine onto a shopping cart gerry asked "you want to walk around some more " "no " gerrys dad and i said at the same time at the memorial day barbeque i told my friends about the pressure washer purchase and they shared their own superclub misadventures i said it would probably be the last time wed shop in a warehouse store but my friend donna argued that theres big savings to be had by shopping at a superclub if you shop smartly donna saves on the membership itself by splitting the &# membership fee with her sister who lives nearby and usually shops at the same store i was impressed by some of her shopping tips like my father in law she buys in bulk and then freezes portions large enough for her family of five ironically one of the few impulse purchases shed made was the standalone freezer she uses to store her food purchases donna said the key to avoiding impulse purchases is to shop alone with a list she likes to buy meat and other perishable items first she said it gives her more incentive to stick to the list and get out of the store as quickly as possible donna says she sticks to the grocery aisles and only ventures to "the dark side" the center of the store where pricey nonessential items might tempt her if theres a product she needs and she knows shell probably pay more for it in a discount department store a recent example "beach towels and cotton socks for the boys " another trick she uses and ive adopted to avoid impulse buying she never enters the store hungry "too tempting " she says in fact she said shes stopped tasting the foods offered at the stores "sampling stations" because she realized thats where a lot of her impulse purchases were made donna goes to the superstore about once a month she says and the savings has cut her grocery bills by about &# a month she says most of the money saved comes from the rapidly increasing price of beef such savings are definitely worth the effort but our shopping habits are nowhere near as disciplined as donnas routine like gerry ive had my share of warehouse store splurges including a set of &# photo albums that have been sitting in our bookcase sans pictures since i bought them on an overly optimistic whim after gerald was born superclubs are perfectly designed for impulsive shoppers like gerry and me so to save money each month well be staying out of them are discount superclub memberships worth the price what tips do you have to get the most out of warehouse superstores write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a
