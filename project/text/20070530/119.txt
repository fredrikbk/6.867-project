well to treatment in the intensive care unit but after she was moved to an intermediate care unit she began to exhibit unusual symptoms such as furiously sucking on a washcloth and crying for every

that she receive no further medication she died two days before she was scheduled to go home "the day josie died it hit me so hard it was like being struck by lightning " ms king recalls "for months

king foundation has been sponsoring a pilot program called condition help its a hot line families can call to summon a "rapid response" team of specialists inside the hospital if they feel that a patient is in danger and isnt receiving the necessary attention beth kuzminsky a nurse and associate at upmcs center of quality improvement and innovation says at first the program was unsettling to doctors and nurses who worried that it would scare patients and would reflect badly on them if a family used the call line but staffers were convinced that the system wouldnt be abused by patients since july a condition h has been called times she notes and the data suggest that of the incidents would have led to potentially harmful patient situations if condition h hadnt been called the program will be expanded in january to all of upmcs acute care hospitals ms king advises families to record important medical information while in the hospital including when and by whom medical procedures were performed and the names of the doctors and nurses on duty each day her foundation has created a "care journal" with space for jotting down the information ms king says she is in talks with upmc johns hopkins and duke university medical center about providing the journals to patients and families ms king says it is equally important to help medical staff who have been involved in errors or adverse events because there is often no formal help with the emotional fallout of being involved in patient harm and nurses and doctors may be told to keep quiet and avoid contact with the patient or family in case of a lawsuit one of her foundations programs "care for the caregivers " includes a course to teach intensive care nurses how to write about stressful situations at work to help sort out their emotions "it isnt just the family and patient who suffer when there is a medical error " says ms king "its also devastating to the caregiver and there is not much of a support
