china confronts crisis over food safety a death sentence meted out to the former head of chinas food and drug watchdog together with the announced formation of a national food recall system suggests beijing intends to send a stern message amid a series of contaminations that has drawn international attention the beijing no intermediate peoples court yesterday sentenced zheng xiaoyu for receiving bribes of cash and gifts worth at least &# from eight pharmaceutical companies during his tenure at the helm of the state food and drug administration according to a report from the state run xinhua news agency the court justified the death sentence by citing the "huge amount of bribes involved and the great damage inflicted on the country and the public by zhengs dereliction of duty " according to the xinhua report the report didnt name the companies meanwhile china announced it is setting up a food recall system nearly five years after it adopted a law indicating the need for such a mechanism an official with the sfda chinas main food safety agency confirmed the drafting of a regulation that will be released by the end of the year despite the drama surrounding mr zhengs sentence the planned recall system may prove more significant for chinas first serious attempt to fix recurring food safety problems death sentences for chinese officials convicted of corruption arent uncommon for example in late wang huaizhong who as vice provincial governor of anhui had held roughly the same rank as mr zheng received a capital sentence for taking bribes totaling million yuan &# he was executed a few months later an official at the court confirmed mr zhengs sentence a recent written request to the court to attend the hearing had gone unanswered it wasnt clear whether mr zheng years old would appeal a person who answered the phone at beijing new era law firm said that zhang qing a lawyer at the firm representing mr zheng wouldnt accept interview requests under chinese law a death sentence imposed by an intermediate court is automatically reviewed by a higher court and ultimately must be approved by the state supreme court china is struggling to contain a snowballing crisis of confidence in the safety of its food and drugs both at home and abroad global concern began growing in late march when the u s food and drug administration said it had identified a small manufacturer in jiangsu province as the source of wheat flour contaminated with melamine a chemical used in plastics and fire retardants that is unfit for use in food the fda later said a second chinese company was also a source of tainted ingredients the contaminated wheat flour used to make pet food in the u s has been blamed for the deaths of a number of cats and dogs leading to a massive pet food recall more recently concern over chinese imports has spread beyond pet food last week the fda ordered that imports of toothpaste from china be stopped at the u s border until they are tested and proved to be safe this followed reports that health officials had found diethylene glycol a potentially dangerous chemical used in products such as antifreeze in chinese toothpaste in panama the dominican republic and australia the safety of chinas drugs has also been an issue in the spring of more than people fell ill after injections of a gallbladder medicine made by qiqihar no pharmaceutical co five people died "those directly responsible for the incident and those who fail to fulfill their supervisory duties will be punished " chinese premier wen jiabao said last may according to xinhua "the pharmaceutical market is in disorder " a government investigation determined that qiqihar had used diethylene glycol the same chemical recently found in the toothpaste to cut costs in producing the drug the deaths drew a national outcry and the company was shut down "the chinese government has always seriously regarded consumer products especially with regard to the safety of food and medicines and we treat the protection of our citizens lives and safety as an important responsibility " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said at a regular briefing yesterday "we are willing to work with the international community to safeguard the quality and reputation of chinas consumer products " the food recall regulation will lay out specific recall procedures though it remains to be seen how effective it will be in preventing food crises many agencies are involved in chinas food safety supervision including the ministry of health and the state administration for industry and commerce the draft regulation applies only to food production that is the responsibility of the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine which is in charge of making sure food made in or brought into china meets safety standards and which is the agency now drafting the food recall regulation food sold at stalls and restaurants is overseen by other ministries that dont have clear laws on how to recall or address unsafe food chen xitong an official with the news division of the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine declined to be interviewed about the regulation separately government officials linked to one of chinas worst cases of lead poisoning have been punished and the chairman of a lead smelter that flouted safety regulations will
