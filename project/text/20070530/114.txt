the polices reinvestigation vancouver the members of the police stewart copeland andy summers and gordon sumner better known as sting were already young veterans of the british music scene when they first performed together on may wise middle aged veterans now they played no new material during mondays th anniversary reunion concert here a minute show that officially kicked off their lengthy tour instead they enriched their music by stripping away much of the familiar bombast and pop trappings to expose the songs raw structures and rebuild them in unexpected ways four months of rehearsals began with the men running through a repertoire culled from five albums to gauge how their evolution as musicians had changed their approach to the material mr copeland said when we spoke by phone a few days before opening night sting he noted has been playing these songs for decades though often with arrangements that differed from the bands recordings "so we originally had to come back to the police versions " mr copeland said then he added "weve been reworking those songs into a new pocket " using a musicians term for a groove musicianship is at the core of the trios relationship and the polices enduring legacy when they first formed the band sting had been playing jazz fusion mr copeland progressive rock and mr summers was a seasoned sideman their refined skills put them at odds with the energetic but musically undemanding punk scene in the u k but they also gave them a way to make interesting commercially minded music that drew on reggae rhythms and a jazz like sensibility at their peak the police were a band you could sing along to or you could ignore their melodies completely and still find the music fascinating and they sold some million albums world wide after the band splintered in sting became a pop music superstar in his own right bringing jazz and world music inflections to his increasingly urbane songs mr copeland composed orchestral works and film and tv scores and he drummed with the legendary jazz fusion bassist stanley clarke and later oysterhead a rock trio featuring primus bassist les claypool and phish guitarist trey anastasio mr summers wrote film and tv scores and he recorded a string of intriguing albums including a thelonious monk tribute "the stature of the original police made it possible for us to work with the best of the best of the best " mr copeland said for mr copeland the appeal of a reunion is blending what he called stings "raw animal power" with mr summerss sophisticated approach to guitar as for his role as the bands engine he said "im driving us back into rock thats the art form where we can distill ideas " their evolution as musicians was apparent early in the vancouver set as the trio went to work on a frill free monochrome stage on which mr copelands expanded drum kit was bracketed by a wall of amplifiers their third number "spirits in the material world " hinted at the nights possibilities mr summers relaxed the staccato chording he featured on the original and left the responsibility for the midsection up for grabs throughout the song while mr copeland played deft figures on the cymbals or slammed the snare his band mates alternated roles exploring the middle and holding down the bottom approximating the familiar riffs on the disk but going elsewhere when the opportunity arose but as the show progressed filling the midsection no longer seemed an objective in "walking on the moon " sting and mr copeland created a tense platform for mr summers but rather than soloing he joined the rhythm section keeping the tension alive until sting resumed the verse similarly at times only mr copelands cymbals relieved the rumble at the bottom of "every little thing she does " mr summerss punchy playing on "de do do do de da da da" gave way to an alluring bass pattern by sting that the band wisely extended on vocals sting often held back crooning where in the past hed shouted and muting his energy to pull the audience into the mystery of the new arrangements in strong voice throughout the evening sting kept the verse and chorus at the same level during "dont stand so close " and his measured reading of "invisible sun" gave it an ominous tone his staid approach to "king of pain" changed its focus and liberated it making the song far more affecting stings melodies are so strong that thorough deconstruction doesnt alienate the songs from their pop roots on a muted "walking in your footsteps" that drifted far from its original structure mr summers finally anchored it in rock with a snarling solo "wrapped around your finger" was built on mr copelands melodic playing on chimes bells and kettle drums in both cases the audience sang along as if little had changed which isnt to say the band set out to distance itself completely from its classic sound the opening number "message in a bottle " as well as "roxanne" and "cant stand losing you " were faithfully rendered nor did everything work exceptionally well several songs seemed to wane as if the trio couldnt find a foothold reminding the audience that it was opening night and that no amount of rehearsal will reveal what will work on stage when risk is at play but when the group chose to add delicate textures or create suspense off a single chord it showed how well something new suits something familiar and how experience and a sense of adventure can drive musicians forward mr fusilli writes about rock and pop for the journal
