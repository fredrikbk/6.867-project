vietnam aims for image as a luxury destination china beach vietnam paul chong was searching for paradise on a beach in vietnam mr chong the head of business development at singapores banyan tree hotels &amp resorts came here on a weeklong mission last august to scout sites for a luxury resort he had journeyed by car and plane up the coast from ho chi minh city before arriving at a tiny fishing village near the central city of da nang in a remote cove reachable only by rowboat he and three colleagues explored a two mile stretch of beachfront "we fell so much in love with the site that we didnt leave until it was pitch black " mr chong recalls in march banyan tree won a license to begin building the laguna vietnam a &# million complex of hotels villas and spas the complex is the latest in a small but growing number of exclusive resorts planned or already open in vietnam a country many americans still associate more with farmers huts and a war that ended decades ago than with a luxurious vacation investors from the u s canada singapore and dubai are among those developing posh getaways here many of these new resorts are sprouting along the central coast on or near china beach miles of white sand where u s troops body surfed and swigged warm beer on r n r breaks during the vietnam war with its powdery beaches mountains rare wildlife french inspired cuisine and world class cultural sites vietnam could be the next top drawer destination in asia on a par with phuket thailand or the indonesian resort island of bali some international tourism industry officials say "its so diverse in one destination you can do so much " says john koldowski of the pacific asia travel association a regional travel industry trade group a number of the worlds hoteliers seem to agree for example china beach is home to the five star furama resort da nang where guests have included european royalty and asian heads of state among its diversions scuba diving cooking classes and slot machines "i think it matches any resort anyplace in the world " says furama guest fred williams a globe trotting security consultant from davie fla mr williams who says he was twice wounded in vietnam as a u s marine was making his first trip back to china beach vietnamese call it my khe or non nuoc since a days respite after the tet offensive "i remember playing volleyball and eating steak and baked beans on that very spot over by that stand of pine trees years ago " he says wagging a finger southward from his poolside lounge chair then there is the nearby nam hai resort &amp villas which set a new standard for resort opulence in central vietnam when london listed investment fund indochina capital opened it in december the nam hai is managed by global hotel management ltd whose founder adrian zecha has made his name operating luxury hotels from malaysia to miami each of the nam hais residential villas has a butler a private pool and an ocean view prices for the seven units still available start at &# million daily room rates for the resorts hotel villas begin at &# four seasons hotels &amp resorts of toronto is completing a full size model of one of the rental villas it plans to manage on secluded cham island a minute boat ride from da nang beginning in dubais kingdom hotel investments plans a room &# million luxury resort called the raffles da nang to open in foreigners ability to own of a project and to lease property for years were important factors in kingdoms decision to invest here says the companys chief executive officer sarmad zok the resorts are catering to a swelling tide of foreigners numbering million last year two thirds more than in according to the vietnam national administration of tourism americans were the third largest nationality among last years visitors after chinese and south koreans the pacific asia travel association forecasts a robust average annual growth rate in foreign arrivals through but while vietnam remains popular with backpackers it is now attracting a more affluent class of traveler it had the second fastest gdp growth rate in asia in only chinas was faster according to thomson financial people are coming to vietnam to do business and returning to take vacations in addition to the natural and cultural attractions vietnam has a deserved reputation for safety and political stability there are some inconveniences for the traveler getting a visa to vietnam takes time and international flights particularly to da nang are limited and some environmentalists worry that uncontrolled beachfront development could degrade vietnams environment resorts need lots of water for showers and laundry and to sprinkle on lawns and golf greens if they pump too much fresh water from natural aquifers seawater can seep in and damage surrounding croplands overdevelopment of vietnams idyllic beaches poses an additional risk discouraging the very guests that a luxury resort is trying to attract banyan tree was already thinking of building boutique hotels in the former imperial capital hue miles north of da nang when it decided that vietnam was "ripe" for upscale tourism and warranted a larger investment says mr chong the head of business development now banyan tree is drawing up a master plan for what it believes will be vietnams first big integrated luxury resort mr chong crawled over boulders and waded though mud to find the right site a beach called lang co between hue and da nang the acre property will include a golf course and more than hotel rooms and villas banyan tree is watching closely to see how business fares at the nearby &# million nam hai resort &amp villas the centerpiece of the nam hai is a reflecting pool and three swimming pools that cascade gently toward an yard beachfront the resorts hotel villas boast sinks with a cracked eggshell lacquerware finish and fully loaded ipods frenchman hugues lamotte a london fund manager bought a three bedroom villa here with his wife in when the nam hai had just broken ground he wanted to be close to hong kong bali was too far and thailand too hot "a lot of our friends who do not know vietnam think we are very courageous they think of vietnam as being totally undeveloped " he says gazing at the vast empty beach beneath his seawall the villa "has exceeded my best expectations " he says he even bought a neighboring villa as an investment and persuaded three of his friends to do the same a remote location like china beach doesnt make a developers life easy building the nam hai proved a challenge in part because local craftsmen had limited experience performing up to the required standards indochina capital chief executive officer peter ryder says electricians occasionally installed sockets upside down finding enough staff who could speak english was also a problem the nam hai continues to run english classes for people from nearby communities to ensure it has a pool of potential employees with a minimal competence in the language still the hurdles to building a luxury resort in vietnam havent deterred indochina capital from planning additional projects one is a villa compound on con dao island a protected marine reserve notorious for the "tiger cage" prisons that the former south vietnamese government once operated there the cages are no longer used to hold people but some have been preserved as historical artifacts elsewhere in the south near the city of nha trang the evason hideaway &amp spa at ana mandara pampers guests but in a rustic robinson crusoe like setting where they are encouraged to go barefoot some developers meanwhile are trying to lessen their environmental impact by recycling bathwater to spray on grass and using renewable construction materials among other efforts and local vietnamese officials say they are controlling the proliferation of hotels on china beach da nang for example has a comprehensive plan for sharing its seafront between resort projects and public beaches says le tran nguyen han the citys head of environmental management but anneke schenk a guest relations manager at the furama resort questions whether any such plan can withstand pressure from developers and authorities eager to cash in on vietnams beachfront bonanza she fears for the distinctive scenery of puttering fishing boats and vietnamese doing tai chi exercises on the sand "now is the best time to visit china beach " she says "in five years itll be just like any beach in thailand "
