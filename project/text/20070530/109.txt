the daily fix five unhappy baseball families inhabit horrendous nl central online edition and you thought the nl central was bad last year last year this six team division was won by a club that was just five games over but the fourth place record last year would be good for second place this year five of the six teams are at least five games under all hope isnt yet lost last years underwhelming division champ the st louis cardinals did win the world series amazing though that seems the way the cards are playing now but a combined record against the rest of baseball doesnt portend much postseason success as leo tolstoy might have said if he were a cubs fan "happy teams are all alike every unhappy team is unhappy in its own way " in that spirit the fix offers a hometown look at the unhappy nl central five who are looking up at the milwaukee brewers in the standings the pittsburgh pirates are five games under and in the midst of straight losing seasons yet club chairman bob nutting bristled at pittsburgh post gazette columnist bob smiziks recent question about his commitment to winning mr smizik was unimpressed with the response "its easy to talk about a commitment to winning everyone wants to win losing stinks but actually reinforcing the desire to win with concrete action such as spending money and making tough decisions well thats another matter " the chicago cubs seemingly demonstrated commitment to victory by hiring high priced players and manager lou piniella who says a turnaround is still possible despite the "horrid play" cited in the headline of rick morrisseys latest chicago tribune column "they own the worst record in baseball in one run games " mr morrissey writes "somebody explain what that means bad luck nerves in close games the curse of alfonso sorianos &# million contract fallen arches right now the cubs are borderline inexplicable and until you know exactly whats wrong its hard to fix it until then you go with the empirical evidence which is that god is a sucker for a year old slapstick routine " at barely a week ago the houston astros have lost nine straight to fall a game and a half behind the cubbies in his th year as an astro craig biggio is muddling along with the rest of his woebegone club hits shy of for his career but batting just with two stolen bases "no one wants to see this thing get ugly " richard justice writes in the houston chronicle "of all the players this franchise has had no one has represented it better than biggio " until recently a perennial contended alongside the astros the defending champion cardinals are foundering perhaps bryan burwell has been reading the same out of town columnists cited in this fix because hes not panicking "i keep reminding myself how quickly it could all turn around even as i see yadi molina limp into the dugout or scott rolen and david eckstein being scratched from the lineup or scott spiezio crashing awkwardly on the warning track dirt or another grand slam sail over the fence off the wrong bats or another pitcher with another questionable resume walk to the mound " mr burwell writes in the st louis post dispatch "i keep telling myself that its just too early to give up on this bad team because they are surrounded by so many other incurably flawed teams in their own division " theres no cure for the reds flaws except maybe laughter the cincinnati enquirers paul daugherty has started laughing at the hometown nine "think of it as an act of self preservation " mr daugherty writes adding "from now until the reds begin playing consistently well which probably is never its strictly one liners and rim shots from me is better to laugh than to cry no " did tolstoy say that on the other side of the baseball universe the boston red sox and new york mets are each at least games better than anyone else in their respective leagues and riding five and four game winning streaks respectively "could life be any better " dan shaughnessy writes in the boston globe "we suddenly have a san diego weather mass over our region the tunnels are open again and you can get where you are going in no time the patriots have a chance to go and it feels like we all might win the lottery next thing you know some dietician will discover that hot fudge sundaes cause you to lose weight youll be able to drink water from the charles all college tuition will be free and the celtics will experience good luck " the mets beat the san francisco giants last night in delectable fashion coming from behind in the th on a walk two balks and a titanic home run against that former bane of mets fans digestive tracts armando benitez the new york posts mike vaccaro writes that the comeback helped overshadow at least for a day the new york medias focus on barry bonds and his visit to the big apple home runs shy of the career record but steve politi writes in the newark star ledger that mets fans barry booing might be a tad hypocritical since their own team will tonight activate guillermo mota a player whos tested positive for steroids "mota who unlike bonds actually flunked a drug test and served a game suspension will likely slip into his role as a middle reliever with little fanfare " mr politi writes "even on the road hell probably go unnoticed come on who boos a setup guy but should he somehow become a dominant pitcher in the world series you can bet the anger will surface we have selective outrage when it comes to performance enhancing drugs " speaking of bondss pursuit of no mark kram reports in the philadelphia daily news on the fate of the ball hank aaron hit for his th career home run and on the potential value of bondss record breaking ball lebron james unfairly excoriated for passing on a potential last second shot in a game loss against the detroit pistons might now be experiencing that familiar sports media whiplash after leading the cleveland cavaliers back to tie the eastern conference finals series at but after the cavs victory over the pistons last night cleveland plain dealer columnist bill livingston reminds readers that "he has no super powers just a narrow focus he has sometimes lacked on his way to global icon status a work ethic reflected in his new long pregame workouts and a sense his time is coming the way gossip runs through a small town in a hurry " in the detroit free press michael rosenberg wonders why pistons forward chris webber has morphed into "the least visible of the starting players remaining in these playoffs " mr rosenberg adds "the pistons are now staring at two ugly scenarios one is that tim duncan chews up webber in the finals the other is that duncan chews up zydrunas ilgauskas " mr ilgauskas of course plays for the suddenly dangerous cavs sticking with the nba controversy surrounds two western conference teams that exited the playoffs in the first round kobe bryant has ripped into the los angeles lakers for supposedly reneging on a promise to rebuild around him after trading shaquille oneal in while team owner jerry buss has remained silent perhaps distracted by a drunk driving charge "the family is being attacked by its adopted son a player they have coddled and protected through one of the biggest sports scandals in this citys history " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "yet so far the family does nothing " the league did nothing in response to a comment by dallas mavericks owner mark cuban that could be construed as tampering with another teams player under contract the nba investigated but decided not to take action demonstrating common sense that was missing from the nbas letter of the law series turning punishment of two phoenix suns players "david hardcore stern went soft " randy galloway writes in the fort worth star telegram "and also hypocritical if you go back to the ruling against the suns but this time he took all the circumstances into account and allowed cuban to walk for good reason "
