business labor leader buyout kings speak same language if you believe private equity is the source of evil in todays economy you can find support on a new web site behindthebuyouts org in one convenient place theres a trove of facts half facts and arguments designed to trash the buyout kings did you know for instance that carlyle groups david rubenstein has a compound in nantucket mass "large enough to accommodate overnight guests" a carlyle spokesman calls that "grossly overstated " or that the bain capital buyout of kb toys resulted in a "crushing debt load" that cost employees their jobs buyouts generate "immense wealth" for private equity partners the site concludes but "harsh consequences" for workers but heres something the web site doesnt tell you andy stern president of the services employees international union which built the web site has in recent months been meeting quietly and cordially with the leaders of the largest buyout firms including mr rubenstein blackstone groups stephen schwarzman and david bonderman of tpg formerly texas pacific group moreover mr stern told me in an interview that he much prefers working with the buyout kings than with their public company counterparts "ive been incredibly impressed " he said sharing his impressions of the men "compared to most of my meetings with company ceos these men are much more businesslike and have much more understanding of what we are trying to accomplish im not saying we agree but they are much more calculating than they are ideological " mr stern may be the most perceptive peripatetic and puzzling labor leader in the world today his union is million members strong and unlike most of the nations unions it is still growing he broke ranks with the afl cio in in part because he felt organized labor had lost its way his effort to blaze a new trail appears to be modeled less on labor leaders of the past than on a civil rights leader jesse jackson their common tactic attack first then engage with a hand out for the ultimate payoff for some on the receiving end this feels like a shakedown though none of the private equity leaders i spoke with will say so on the record but mr stern is unapologetic indeed he blames business for encouraging labor to behave badly "theyve trained us wrongly " he says "we tend to get ignored or caricatured and sent to the human resources department when we call the ceo says will someone take care of these guys not until we do something they find unfair will they talk to us " "its like your children " he adds "if they behave and get no reaction then theyll cry " mr stern says he is trying to find a new way for labor to engage with business "we get it we understand " he says "all this global competition means america needs a new economic plan we have a th century model of employment relationships in a global economy " but those who have met with him say mr stern mainly wants one thing more members mr sterns interest in private equity got a jump start last summer when hca the hospital company that also happens to be one of the largest employers of seiu members agreed to go private it was further piqued this year when blackstone bought out equity office properties trust a top employer of seiu represented janitorial services mr stern found he had leverage with the buyout firms in part because so much of their funding comes from union dominated public pension funds that makes the firms more open to union arguments than most public companies he also discovered what may prove to be the buyout businesss achilles heel the tax treatment of "carried interest " the top executives of buyout firms make their exorbitant paydays by keeping as much as of the profits of their funds which are then paid out to them and taxed at the low capital gains rate of rather than the top personal income tax rate of the senate finance committee is looking into the tax issue and mr stern with his close ties to democratic politicians could prove critical in the debate therein may lie the makings of a deal mr stern has suggested the buyout firms could help his cause by for instance adopting standards that would encourage the use of unionized janitorial services in buildings he hasnt said what he wants in return but one possibility he eases up on his criticism of their favorable tax treatment mr stern and the buyout chiefs i talked with say they have made no such deal but both sides expect their talks to continue and ultimately making deals is what the buyout business is all about
