hired killer stalks the wild pigs plaguing nebraska biologist sam wilson sets traps and shoots critters threatening the corn crop genoa neb when sam wilson trudged through a nebraska cornfield last week he spotted the telltale sign down by the creek bed the torn up soil looked like someone had unleashed a giant rototiller on the soft ground wild pigs were on the loose here in genoa a tiny farming town in the eastern part of the state foraging through the countryside in search of earthworms grubs roots or anything else they could find until the cornfields come to life again "these pigs are very very smart " says mr wilson the nongame mammal and furbearer program manager for the nebraska game and parks commission armed with high tech gadgets and a high powered hunting rifle he has been asked by the state to eradicate the pigs because they are known to destroy corn crops and could spread disease to nebraskas hog farms the states many other hunters can only wish they were doing the shooting the pigs make a desirable target because they are so crafty and because they are rare here but the state legislature in banned hunting them hoping to prevent hunters from importing the wild pigs some hunters are upset protesting the situation online and otherwise "if i see one while turkey hunting i am going to put bacon in the freezer " writes a hunter whose screen name is bullelkklr on the states game and parks internet forum "those little guys are spooky " known for their wiliness wild boar were brought to the u s by europeans in the s to be hunted some of them mated with domestic pigs that got away from farmers the offspring black tusked and weighing hundreds of pounds are hunted for sport on ranches in texas alabama georgia and other states where the pigs have proliferated in texas alone the growing feral pig population is currently estimated by state officials at million in that state wild pigs have been spotted on golf courses and in backyards texas encourages hunters ads say that "meat from feral hogs is extremely tasty and much leaner than pen raised pork " since about pigs have turned up in several parts of nebraska most were killed by state game officials mr wilson isnt sure how a handful of pigs ended up in his turf the wild hairy pigs are harder to hunt than traditional nebraska game including deer and pheasant once threatened they become nocturnal and have a keen sense of smell a sow recently spotted mr wilson in his treetop perch from yards away "she snorted cleared her nose took a deep breath and let out another deep rumble that called her piglets to her and they all ran away " said mr wilson who knew that if he shot and missed the sow she would never show up in the same spot again the pigs are difficult to trap even for the year old mr wilson whose first job out of college at the university of nebraska lincoln was hunting wild pigs that had invaded santa catalina island southwest of los angeles there the animals digging was destroying rare plants and eroding hillsides after a year and a half spent hunting pigs with the help of helicopters and packs of dogs mr wilson whose bachelors degree is in wildlife biology felt he had become a wild pig expert mr wilson returned to his home state in in recent months he has killed more than pigs he first catches them in foot high traps using remote controls he designed with toy car parts he strips the remote units off the cars and stuffs the parts into an old ammunition box that he uses as a trigger so he can sit dozens of yards away and push a button for the traps door to drop for bait he often uses french toast spaghetti and other leftovers from the university of nebraska cafeteria mr wilson has learned from experience that he cant be hasty wild pigs are suspicious when they see traps and often avoid the area entirely when they spot them "ive dealt with smart pigs before " mr wilson says the first time he set out to investigate a wild pig sighting in nebraska he was caught off guard by one of the beasts he stumbled onto pig tracks and followed them right to a sleeping hog he had left his rifle behind and could do nothing but watch the animal run away snorting "its a monstrous sound " he says some of nebraskas hunters say theyre missing out on the fun betty swanson who operates swansons hunting acres a controlled shooting operation for game birds in northeast nebraska says she has disappointed a number of hunters who inquire whether wild pigs are legal to hunt mr wilson thinks that as many as five pigs are still roaming the genoa area armed with night vision goggles and a rifle hes determined to gun them down before they have a chance to breed on a recent reconnaissance mission in the woods near beaver creek in genoa mr wilson a sandy haired hard squinting man in carhartt jeans and a t shirt navigated a muddy cornfield and a thicket of poison ivy to find fresh evidence he spotted coyote and deer tracks and then in a clearing noticed a large patch of chewed up soil a sign of wild pig rooting he leaned down and touched the dirt "this is something one pig did in a half hour " mr wilson said shaking his head his hunter sense kicked in and mr wilson weaved through the tall grass with his head down looking for more clues he zigzagged to the edge of a creek but all he found were raccoon prints "the pigs probably stopped here just for a drink " he said sighing "its very frustrating its like this ongoing game of tag " mr wilson wants to put a stop to the pigs before they disappear in tall rows of summer corn hes considering using hunting dogs "im interested in a healthy ecosystem " mr wilson says "pigs they dont fit "
