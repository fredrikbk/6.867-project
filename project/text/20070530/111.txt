the legal visa crunch the senate immigration bill continues to take lumps from all political sides with some criticisms more deserving than others the vote last week to halve the size of a guest worker program for low skilled workers is a big step in the wrong direction skimping on visas will only lead to more illicit border crossings but the bills handling of high skilled immigration is even more troubling the proposed changes are worse than current law ostensibly the goal here is to move immigration policy away from a system based on family connections and toward one based on skills the senate measure calls for a "merit" system that awards points to would be immigrants based on their education and work experience but employers who recruit foreign professionals and arent too keen on uncle sam taking over those duties are balking at the proposal on grounds that it will introduce all sorts of inefficiencies to their hiring u s businesses arent looking for skilled workers in general theyre looking for people with specific skills and in the high tech industry especially where the demand for new products and services is constantly changing employers need the flexibility to fill critical positions as quickly as possible the last thing hewlett packard or texas instruments need is uncertainty about whether the workers they want to hire will pass some bureaucratic point test if the senate wants the u s to keep attracting the worlds best and brightest this bill is an odd way of showing it last month the supply of h b temporary visas for foreign professionals not only ran out in one day but did so six months before the october start of the fiscal year its the fourth straight year that companies have exhausted the supply before the start of the year which is a clear market signal that the cap should be raised if not removed the senate bill would increase the supply of h bs by to and put in place a market based escalator that couldnt exceed thats an improvement but it will still leave too many firms in the lurch the bureau of labor statistics projects growth of about jobs per year in computer and math science occupations between and worse the visa increase is combined with other provisions that seem designed to make employing foreign professionals both costly and cumbersome larger companies can probably live with the proposed increase in the fee for each h b visa hire and renewal to &# from &# but companies would also be forced to prove for the year surrounding the hiring of a foreigner six months before and six months after that a u s worker has not been displaced this requirement is so burdensome that under current law its used to punish companies that have been caught violating program rules the senate bill would needlessly apply it to everyone "the h b program is already costly and all things being equal theres already a heavy incentive to hire americans " says robert hoffman oracles vice president of government and public affairs "but there comes a point where the program is so costly that we have to decide if its better to move this work offshore and thats something that cant be in our overall national interests " its obvious that the immigration bill was written with the fate of million illegal aliens foremost in mind but we hope congress is mindful that foreign professionals also fill important niches in the u s labor market that help keep american companies competitive and jobs stateside immigration policies should acknowledge that the u s is not producing enough home grown computer scientists mathematicians and engineers to fill our labor needs last year u s universities awarded more than half of their masters degrees and of their ph d s in electrical engineering to foreign nationals its foolhardy to educate these individuals and then effectively expel them so that they can put their human capital to work for u s competitors theres no shortage of countries that would be thrilled to benefit from a u s brain drain the best way to keep that from happening is by raising the quotas for employment based visas and green cards to realistic levels consistent with market demand and by allowing u s firms to make their own decisions about which workers are best suited to fill their labor needs
