technology will be critical for agencies in digital world questions for david moore company real media title chairman and ceo tech heavyweights microsoft google and yahoo are rapidly deepening their foothold in the online ad world and all three companies have announced major acquisitions of web advertising companies in recent weeks but the ad industry is making some moves of its own ad holding giant wpp groups purchase earlier this month of online advertising company real media for &# million marked madison avenues first major foray into the technology side of the web ad business the ad industrys digital shopping spree has until now mostly targeted small companies that offer creative services for advertisers in the online world new york based real media offers search marketing services a network of web sites where advertisers can place their ads and the technology to distribute the ads "i think with the pieces moving around on the chess board at the rate they are what we have with real media is a real alternative which will be attractive to not only agencies but our clients as well " said martin sorrell wpps chief executive officer during a conference call announcing the acquisition in david moore chairman and ceo of real media co founded online ad company petry interactive which became real media in he has almost years in the ad business a career that began with him selling ads for the then budding cable business he talks here about the changing world of online advertising the wall street journal the wpp deal marked the first time that a major ad holding company decided to enter the technology focused side of the digital marketing business why now mr moore today its the internet but you have mobile phones you have more video than ever before youve got iptv digital television delivered through the internet not too far down the road youve got navigation systems it is all going to be digital traditionally agencies didnt want anything to do with technology they really didnt look at that as their core competency now they have realized that technology is going to be a critical ad system that they need to have to really compete effectively moving forward wsj why does an ad agency need its own tech company mr moore one of the reasons you are seeing consolidation and an interest in technology is because when you have your technology on a web site that gives you better insight into the audience and offers a gateway for the advertiser to put the right ad in front of the right person at the right time which is really what the web is about you can really tell what you get for your money without a technology gateway you dont have that type of insight that perhaps your competitor does as a result you just wont be able to target and get the results that are going to be important to the advertiser wsj what still needs to be streamlined in the digital ad process to make the buying selling and creating of ads online more efficient mr moore in the business of buying and selling advertising on the web there is a lot of manual labor it is much easier to buy a page in a magazine or a commercial on tv than it is to buy on the web today you can put a banner you can put a video you can put a hyperlink you can sponsor something there are just so many more ways to advertise using the web as opposed to tv which is a second or second commercial or print which is one ad so we need to do an even better job today than we have in the past of making it easier to buy wsj with all the consolidation in the market some concerns have been raised about possible conflicts of interest how will an advertiser know they are getting the best deal when an ad agency is both buying and selling the ads mr moore the most important thing that a company can do for its clients is to make sure that they get a good return on their advertising investment there is no question that there could be an appearance of some conflict i think that is one of the reasons wpp wants to run real media as a separate company as a result i will look at wpps other agencies as very important clients if i cant get in there and offer them a product that is as strong or better than some of the other products that they are buying then i dont deserve to get bought wsj will you solicit work from ad agencies outside wpp group mr moore it is something that well definitely watch closely and do everything we can so that the products we provide not only to wpp but to the other advertising companies are compelling and serve the best interest of their clients wsj real media has a global footprint with offices throughout the u s europe asia and australia why is that necessary in the digital ad world doesnt the web make the world flat mr moore most advertisers tend to be organized on a geographic basis they have an individual in each market who is ultimately in charge for the profit and loss statement of that particular product people are needed to customize or tailor the campaign to that product in that particular market when a web site comes to us in the u s they say wed like you to help us sell that inventory by the way who is selling the inventory that is accessed by u k users who is selling it in france or in sydney australia so we have offices with sales forces in those marketplaces and we take the users that access the u s web sites from the u k and we sell them the u k advertising so the global footprint becomes a very important competitive advantage for us and of course look at all the advertising agencies particularly wpp they have an extensive global network for each of the advertising agencies it is much larger than ours and it will allow us to expand in a prudent fashion over time and to put our network and our technology into a lot more markets than we are in today
