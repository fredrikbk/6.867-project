just what we dont need smaller detergent bottles i am disappointed by the short sightedness motivating giant corporations to waste resources and clog landfills in order to meet pressure from bullying monopolists that want laundry detergent in smaller containers so they can fit more units on store shelves and delivery trucks "selling detergent bottles big shrink " marketing &amp media may im not sure who really wins this shell game i would prefer these titans of industry get together and rethink consumer disposable distribution for the st century im dismayed that in our "advanced" capitalist society no corporations are taking bold steps to reduce the strain of consumerism and the tons of packaging that most people toss in the garbage i believe many consumers would reward their corporate "greenness" with loyalty especially if prices were lowered enough to offset the inconvenience factor some of us have higher levels of tolerance for inconvenience and our social conscience allows us to sacrifice our time for the greater good i have concluded that capitalism and environmentalism are simply and hopelessly opposing forces consumption increase is the goal of capitalism consumption decrease is the goal of environmentalism how can we bridge that divide making smaller packaging is a step in the wrong direction kathleen a walsh sacramento calif see related letter "letters to the editor classic market forces and your soap bottle" wsj june
