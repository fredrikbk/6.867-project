cantor to trim ties to espeed bgc partners deal combines units into new public firm about face for lutnick cantor fitzgerald lp the new york bond trading firm lost hundreds of employees in the sept terrorist attacks after several years of rebuilding it is now taking its biggest step to change its corporate structure it announced late yesterday a deal valued at &# billion that would distance cantor from espeed inc a publicly owned electronic trading house it controls and bgc partners cantors privately held brokerage unit where individuals work the phones to put together complicated bond trades the move would result in the creation of a new publicly traded company uniting espeed and bgc the added independence and other changes may help address criticism by some vocal espeed shareholders who say the current ownership structure is full of potential conflicts of interests and too complicated the transaction also represents an about face of sorts for howard lutnick the wall street veteran who is chairman of cantor and espeed earlier this year mr lutnick had been pushing to sell shares of bgc in an initial public offering of stock and had gone as far as to notify securities regulators of his intentions but criticism from investors in espeed may have forced mr lutnick to adopt a new approach one main investor concern revenue sharing and joint services agreements between the three companies may enrich cantor at the expense of the other two the privately held cantor for instance collects about of espeeds transaction revenue in u s treasury trading as part of a longstanding agreement between the firms for cantor the deal represents "a total separation" from the businesses of bgc and espeed mr lutnick said in an interview the new company will be called bgc partners inc and will be formed after espeed issues almost million shares to acquire bgc the new company expected to debut by early next year would be worth about &# billion and continue to trade publicly on the nasdaq stock market as espeed does now about of the company would be owned by bgc and cantor with bgc also producing the bulk of the firms profit and revenue cantor will keep voting control over the company an issue that has been a sore point with some espeed shareholders still the new company will sever the permanent revenue sharing agreements that existed with cantor instead cantor will provide some services to the new company under an agreement that will last three years and then will be renewable every six months the year old mr lutnick has weathered controversy in the s he clashed with the wife of cantors founder b gerald cantor after mr cantor grew ill and mr lutnick strengthened his hold on power at the firm several years ago a pricing plan at espeed upset many wall street traders who in turn sent more business to the firms competitors more widely mr lutnick is known as the man who rebuilt cantor after the firm lost hundreds of employees on initially he was criticized by some victims families for cutting off paychecks to the lost cantor employees only days after the attacks but later cantor gave more than &# million of its profit to the families as part of a long term pledge this year mr lutnick has tangled with a different kind of problem a group of activist shareholders who wanted big changes at espeed emboldened by the companys lagging stock price shareholders led by hedge fund manager robert l chapman jr called for espeed to sell itself to the highest bidder mr chapman was particularly leery of a complex dual share class structure that gives cantor about of the voting power at espeed despite a minority ownership position mr lutnick says that cantors voting power in the new bgc partners wont change materially from the level at espeed but he adds that the service agreement changes will allow cantor to look at the business independently like any shareholder would the "companies were interwoven" before he said "this completely cleans it up " that was an issue in april when an espeed competitor known as tullett prebon plc offered to buy espeed at a healthy premium of &# a share cantor vetoed it in part because a tullett purchase would require that espeed sever its close relationship with cantor the latest moves are designed to allow the combined company to participate more easily in the exchange industrys merger boom it also may help espeed focus on its operations since the company went public in electronic trading has grown more popular but the company has had trouble keeping pace with rivals it remains to be seen whether the moves appease activist investors yesterday mr chapman described the deal as "financial sleight of hand " in a recent regulatory filing mr chapman said that espeed should be sold in a "full scale auction" rather than combining with bgc mr lutnicks proposal values espeed shares at &# lower than tulletts earlier &# bid espeed shares were up four cents yesterday to &# in p m composite trading on the nasdaq mr lutnick said yesterday that tulletts proposal was "impossible to pursue" because it ignored cantors role mr chapman responded aggressively to espeeds decision to snub the tullett offer the activist investor often pressures managements of underperforming companies to make changes or works to replace them in an effort to increase the companys share price "howard lutnicks three kingdom reign over cantor fitzgerald espeed and bgc partners appears so infested with potential conflicts of interest and incestuous intercompany transactions that a completely new set of corporate governors may be required " he wrote recently complaining that mr lutnick hadnt returned his calls for straight business days despite chapman capital llcs controlling of espeeds class a shares chapman capital recently reduced its stake "shareholder activism comes with the territory " says mr lutnick "were going to do well "
