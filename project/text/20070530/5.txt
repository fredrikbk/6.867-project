anheuser gives web channel another try disappointing response for bud tv prompts shifts in sites strategy despite earlier suggestions that it might scrap its struggling online entertainment channel anheuser busch has decided instead to revamp the web site to make it edgier just three months ago the st louis brewer made a big splash in advertising circles with the launch of bud tv the network which includes minutes of original programming was aimed at getting the attention of beer drinking young men who are spending more of their time on the web but traffic to the site has plummeted amid complaints from viewers that the content such as "what girls want " where three beautiful women give a geeky guy a makeover so that hes more dateable lacked luster the tepid interest in the site has been a blow for the brewer which has a reputation as being one of the savviest consumer advertisers in the brick and mortar world with ad hits such louie the lizard and the "whassup " commercials the companys stumbles over bud tv speak to the difficulty that non web based businesses even some of the biggest companies in the world have in driving traffic to their web sites the changes to bud tv will include a variety of new features such as a social networking component and shorter videos about one minute each rather than the longer programs usually about six minutes that now dominate the site even the much hyped "the joe buck show " which shows the sports commentator interviewing celebrities in new york city cabs will likely come to an end soon the brewer say it has about shows in the can and is considering other short form formats for mr buck to do while during the sites rollout anheuser busch touted its slickly produced original content bud tv will also now begin pulling videos and content from other sites its aim is to become an aggregator of cool information for beer drinkers one idea the brewer is toying with a "joke of the day " anheuser busch is also hoping to have bud tv content appear on other sites such as youtube and yahoo as a way to drive traffic "you have to syndicate your videos across multiple sites " says joe laszlo a senior analyst at jupiter research "its key if you want to grow an audience over time " the new offerings will be "a little more edgy " says tony ponturo vice president global media and sports marketing at anheuser busch which makes budweiser michelob and bud light among other brands that push is already apparent a small clip promoting bud tv which began appearing for the first time on the site this week shows a company where employees frequently use foul language and are forced to put a quarter in a jar as punishment the catch the jar collection will be used to buy a case of bud light mr ponturos plan is a major reversal from comments last week by august busch iv anheuser buschs chief executive who said the site would "fade" during the "back half of this year " those remarks during a call with investors came after traffic to the site sank in march to from the month earlier according to data from tracking service comscore traffic to the site in april was so low it didnt meet the threshold for measurability according to data from comscore thats a far cry from the three million to five million unique monthly visitors the company estimated it would eventually attract to the site the company also said that the age verification system on bud tv used to make sure that everyone on the site is of drinking age was a turnoff to web surfers bud tvs fate has been watched on madison avenue mainly because it marks one of the most aggressive efforts by a nonentertainment company to create entertainment as a way to subtly promote products the brewer has already put about &# million into the site almost a third of its annual web advertising budget for the past few weeks anheuser busch has been doing internal focus groups calling on its employees between the ages of and to help brainstorm about ways to enliven the site "its clear to us that the consumer wants more interaction more conversion and more of a social community " says mr ponturo advertisers are increasingly finding that generating traffic to their own web sites or home grown online channels is huge challenge and many remain highly dependent on the major web portals and popular online destinations procter &amp gamble for example realized that it needed to work with a portal when it recently launched capessa a social networking site for women to discuss subjects such as parenting pregnancy and weight loss knowing it would be difficult to generate traffic to a standalone site the consumer products titan created the site on the health section of yahoo anheuser busch says it will ramp up its marketing efforts around bud tv including a big push to get bloggers to talk about the programs the site offers still it remains determined not to run traditional tv or print ads to promote the site
