green gone wild in vegas gosh i learned an important lesson " said nevada governor jim gibbons last fall "never to offer a helping hand to anybody ever again " his quip referred to a state program offering tax breaks if businesses built environmentally friendly buildings a program that has since triggered a major fiscal crisis the real lesson here is that politicians ought to think before rushing ahead with a "green" agenda in the nevada legislature unanimously approved a measure that cut property taxes up to for years and lowered sales taxes for building supplies to for energy efficient construction in order to qualify businesses must comply with something called the leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards which require recycled materials features that reduce water and electricity usage and so on original estimates put state abatement costs at just &# though no one can say how that figure was conjured the incentives distorted the market however and many more commercial developers applied than were anticipated now nevada is out &# million over the next years for the few projects already approved or in the pipeline according to state estimates most of this tax subsidy will go to casinos in las vegas as well as mgms &# billion city center which will receive &# million meanwhile property and sales taxes mostly go to county governments for schools and roads and the state which has no income tax is required to make up for any revenue losses from its general fund so late last week the nevada legislature already facing budget shortfalls worked out a retroactive compromise and essentially asked for a mulligan several other states provide subsidies for "sustainable" building but usually these are small programs and while were all for reducing the tax burden nevada already has one of the better business climates in the country it seems not to have occurred to anyone that businesses have no reason to waste energy or other resources and thus bump up their overheads in this case the silver state merely passed out corporate welfare in service of an environmental fad the leed standards are administered by a private nonprofit called the u s green building council founded in they have become the de facto national benchmarks for "sustainable" architecture and a fashionable green emblem but as two environmentalists auden schendler and randy udall write in a study of leed the process is "costly slow brutal confusing and unwieldy a death march for applicants administered by a soviet style bureaucracy that makes green building more difficult than it needs to be " the nevada casinos are already fighting leed over indoor smoking and other matters under the terms of the compromise the tax code will be amended to eliminate the sales tax break for future projects and retroactively reduce the property tax break for all green building to a maximum of not counting the portion that goes to schools the bill might cut the states tab by half and awaits governor gibbonss signature but he vetoed a similar measure a few weeks ago worried about lawsuits from companies that budgeted their projects in light of the abatements and claiming its bad policy to create an uncertain business climate with everything green the rage some politicians want federal subsidies for building rules along the lines of leed and we might get them considering the fiasco in nevada maybe the market is a better promoter of energy efficiency
