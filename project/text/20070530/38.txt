delicate operation how people reshaped massachusetts health care the connector board makes tough choices for sweeping new law boston when massachusetts passed a pioneering law ensuring health coverage for virtually all its citizens it punted many critical details to an eclectic group of people over the past year the group known as the connector board had to wrestle with the tough questions that have stymied efforts at national health care reform how much in premiums can low income people afford what about middle class families should plans be required to include prescription drug coverage finding a consensus fell to a motley panel drawn from business labor academia and state government on the liberal end was celia wcislo a year old organizer with the service employees international union who half jokingly refers to insurers as "sleazeballs and bloodsuckers " her frequent adversary was jonathan gruber a year old massachusetts institute of technology economist who had helped then gov mitt romney develop the plan a democrat dr gruber was surprised to find himself on the conservative wing of the board the connector board offered in microcosm a look at the collision of interests business labor medical professionals and needy patients that has derailed decades of efforts to reform the u s health care system when it comes to health care reform everyones second choice after their own plan has been the status quo in massachusetts board members did something unusual finding ways to compromise on some of their most cherished positions and reach common ground as a result massachusetts is poised to become the first state to achieve near universal coverage registration for the new insurance plans began may unlike washington the connector compromised successfully because it was expected to stepping in after a long struggle by state lawmakers to create a plan supported by all major parties says joseph antos a health policy expert at the conservative american enterprise institute "they have a responsibility they have to produce " reaction from the business community is mixed many large employers say theyre comfortable with the compromises but representatives of smaller businesses argue the connectors standards for coverage are too strict and say it should offer more choices of health plans in some ways massachusetts is an exceptional case it is a liberal wealthy state with just of its population uninsured compared with nationwide and the plan could fail skeptics say it isnt tough enough on curbing costs and could ultimately be unraveled by an escalating price tag no one knows whether the laws combination of carrots and sticks will persuade the uninsured to actually buy coverage from the start connector board members knew that success wasnt guaranteed in the early s the universal coverage plan spearheaded by gov michael dukakis collapsed after he left office amid intense opposition from business interests in april a new plan emerged after months of wrangling between then gov romney now running for president and the democratic legislature a blend of liberal and conservative elements the law provides subsidized coverage for low income residents but offers the coverage through private insurance companies and while there are some requirements for employers the law puts the greater onus on individuals to secure coverage people who fail to have state approved insurance by the end of face penalties that for some will soon top &# a year rather than hammer out the details itself the legislature left many of the toughest issues to a powerful new authority the commonwealth health insurance connector which was also charged with taking bids from health insurance companies and then selling those plans to people throughout the state the massachusetts law also stipulated that the connector board be made up of representatives from labor business and consumers it quickly became clear that the board a mix of appointees and administration members would be under intense scrutiny when it held its first public meeting in june the staff set up chairs but some people showed up the first battle erupted almost immediately state and federal officials had allotted &# million to subsidize premiums for low income people how much should this population be expected to chip in dr gruber backed by the romney administration still in power at the time proposed premiums of &# to &# a month depending on income if the premiums were pushed any lower he argued that funding for the program might be jeopardized ms wcislo who had to interrupt her college studies for years because of the cost fought back what if a husband and wife had to pay &# each and extra for their children she felt she had to speak out "you have to be stupid enough or insane enough to argue back " she says nevertheless to show board unity ms wcislo wound up voting with dr gruber though she vowed to resume fighting for lower premiums later her decision to fight hard but ultimately compromise something rarely seen in washington health reform wars set the pattern for other board members in the following months this march the boards unity was severely tested once again the connectors staff had recommended that state approved plans offer prescription drug coverage and exclude plans with caps on lifetime benefits it also wanted the new rules to kick in quickly a problem for businesses that were already using plans that wouldnt meet the new standards the boards more liberal members quickly endorsed the staffs position one was charles joffe halpern head of a nonprofit that helps low income people obtain insurance he had suffered a benign brain tumor four years ago and said that without drug coverage his medications would have cost him more than &# a year but richard lord head of an employers trade group was irate mandating such comprehensive plans would force many employers that already provided insurance to upgrade to more expensive policies on march mr lord gathered some lobbyists and industry representatives including the chamber of commerce health plan officials and retailers they denounced the proposal in a tense meeting "we decided we needed to go public " mr lord says on march the day the board was slated to vote on the issue businesses concerns turned up in an article published on the front page of the boston globe operating behind the scenes was the boards executive director year old jon kingsdale a former top executive at tufts health plan a health insurer mr kingsdale struggled to come up with a compromise as he called board members to test various proposals the board ultimately went along with his suggestion to require slimmed down drug coverage but delay implementation of the new requirements in a meeting ms wcislo dropped her opposition to the lifetime caps after receiving an email on her blackberry from another board member he asked if she realized that her own union insurance had a lifetime cap she hadnt on march the morning of the vote mr lord was still planning to cast his ballot against the compromise but changed his mind on the way to the meeting "i had gotten what i needed " he says adding that a unanimous vote "sent a strong message that were all trying to work this out together " over the months ms wcislo and dr gruber grew closer after discovering that they lived a few blocks away from each other in suburban boston they even got together for a half dozen lunches at a local thai restaurant "he comes into meetings with all these numbers studies and numbers numbers and studies " she says "at the end youre not sure what youre talking about anymore " but both say dr gruber taught the union leader something about economics and ms wcislo taught the economist something about politics in april the board set upon making its final major policy decision and once again it was divided at issue was how many residents could afford the premiums the connector had negotiated with private insurance companies the cheapest plan was &# a month for those in their late s could most residents afford that the answer was critical because those deemed too poor to pay wouldnt be penalized for failing to purchase insurance dr gruber who calls himself the "grinch " took a tough line arguing that most people could afford the premium and saying it was important that almost everyone be required to have insurance "i dared to say the poor people can afford to pay for health insurance " he says board member lou malzone manager of a union health plan disagreed "in massachusetts you have to make &# or &# a year just to survive " he said liberal activists seized on the issue launching a public campaign the greater boston interfaith organization an activist group of churches and synagogues argued that half the states population for instance a family of three making as much as &# a year couldnt afford the insurance meanwhile affordable health care today a coalition of liberal groups that lobbies on health care issues began running radio ads "no one should have to pay so much for health care that they cant afford lifes basic necessities " the announcer said on a sunday four days before the april board vote mr joffe halpern was an "anxious wreck " he says trying to decide how to vote staunchly progressive and a longtime advocate for the uninsured mr joffe halpern worried that he might be compromising too much but if he opposed the plan a splintered connector board could lose momentum and the plan could fall apart another deal orchestrated by mr kingsdale was in the works his industry experience taught him the importance of attracting healthy people who might otherwise skip insurance into state sponsored plans so the cost of covering the sick would be balanced out by the healthy who cost less mr kingsdale felt strongly that the mandate should apply to as many people as possible so he suggested increasing premium subsidies by &# million for those eligible for state aid to make it more affordable for them that wasnt enough to placate ms wcislo so mr kingsdale played another card he got the governor to agree to suspend &# million a year in insurance premiums for children already enrolled in the states version of the childrens health insurance program easing the burden on their low income parents that helped resolve ms wcislos earlier concern on the cost of premiums for low income families "it seemed like a great way to keep the coalition together and do right by the people " gov deval patrick says the night before the april meeting mr joffe halpern began his three hour drive to boston stopping for dinner at a pizza hut there he got a call saying people on both sides had agreed to the deal tears filled mr joffe halperns eyes as he realized that the state plan might actually work "thank you at last " he thought the next morning dr gruber walked into the meeting feeling some "buyers remorse " like mr joffe halpern a couple days earlier dr gruber wondered whether he had gone too far in accepting a compromise still everyone voted for the deal the board members would agree that the compromises were fair to all interests involved "people fought hard for a middle ground " ms wcislo told her colleagues the final package increased subsidies and concluded that of the states uninsured residents could afford the insurance requirement the remaining roughly people wont be penalized for not purchasing insurance still if everyone deemed by the connector to be able to afford insurance buys in of residents will have insurance who gets what the massachusetts health reform aids people in different ways expansion of medicaid more of the poor are eligible for the states medicaid program masshealth new aid for
