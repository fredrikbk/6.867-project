business bookshelf drowning in red ink typo by david silverman soft skull pages &# recall the borscht belt definition of "chutzpah" a boy murders his parents and then begs the judge for mercy on the grounds that he is an orphan in "typo " a memoir david silverman attempts his own version of the story he borrows his addled fathers last dollar and then when the money is gone blames the old man for not teaching him to be more thrifty his story is amusing appalling infuriating and wonderfully written "typo" is not supposed to be about audacity or angst it is supposed to be the chronicle of a hopeful if callow young man who sought to become rich in by buying up a broken down american typesetting firm under siege from low wage india at age mr silverman goaded by "dan " a rugged mentor with some experience in the typesetting business and a flask of maalox in his pocket grabs his fathers life savings and plonks down the whole &# on clarinda typesetting co a dusty dinosaur in clarinda iowa soon david and dan leaving their jobs in new york city are headed to iowa to run the place they fit in about as well as eva gabor in the hooterville of "green acres " in fact mr silvermans woeful business acumen would not have earned him a job at sam druckers general store much less the corner office at a place like clarinda typesetting he admits that he did not belong in the executive suite not that clarinda has one his office sounds more like the dumpster behind an army surplus store "my entire career had been as a computer geek sitting behind a screen not as anyones boss " mr silverman confesses "my previous last three job titles had been chief scientist as in head of all scientists which sounded great except there were no other scientists " so how did he blow his alcoholic fathers last dollar earned during a hard career at ibm mr silverman spreads the blame everywhere not neglecting to mention his fathers naive view of business "i believed my father so completely that i was trapped in my own downward path " but he does his blame mongering in colorful memorable words that will win the readers admiration even as they irritate his moral sense mr silverman is disgusted with the sleepy eyed employees of clarinda who do not jump with glee when their clueless unqualified savior arrives from new york why would they in the past few years they have watched five owners and seven presidents move in unpack muck up and pack up again we hear about the tech expert who is "afraid" of microsoft excel then there is the salesperson who "sounded so sweet on the phone but in person was pinch faced as if an encyclopedia sized binder clip was fastened to the back of her head " mr silverman drives around in a rented ford taurus and sleeps at a nearby celebrity inn hardly signs of a firm commitment to the company one of the lessons that "typo" inadvertently teaches new owners should buy not rent of course the celebrity inn has its attractions including a "game room " the city boy expects it to be decorated with video consoles and a pool table but this is rural iowa the game room is equipped with a hose and wood slat floors so that hunting visitors can rinse off their elk carcass or some other varmint mitt romney and other presidential hopefuls might take note mr silverman must also confront the "green acres" logic that prevails at clarinda typesetting for example the worker who crashes into a parked car because she is not wearing her glasses fearing that she would be late for work she figured that it was better to be half blind and on time than to waste precious minutes looking around for her spectacles half blind at a typesetting shop the personnel problem unfolds in a more personal way when mr silverman discovers that dan is not the dependable partner he was hoping for dans marriage is on the rocks and so is his maalox that flask of stomach medicine turns out to be whiskey one night dan shows up drunk at mr silvermans door asking where he can buy viagra finally mr silverman has to fire him in the meantime business gets worse as more and more publishers outsource their typesetting to india not that business was ever close to good two years after taking control of clarinda mr silverman figures out that the companys profit margin even at the time of purchase was negative in short mr silverman was losing money every time a worker moseyed onto the premises "bar the doors " you want to shout but its too late mr silverman somehow neglects to blame the bubble induced headlines of the late s that dismissed silly ideas like profitability no wonder the clarinda employee feared excel the larger theme of "typo" is the ordeal of what could be called "commodity hell " the place where executives find themselves when they cannot convince customers that their widgets or services are better than those of their ever burgeoning competitors all they can say is "yep we got em too " mr silverman plunged into commodity hell when he bought clarinda typesetting but what was his plan he writes about his hopes of boosting efficiency but he never bothered to ferret out labor costs and revenues per hour his account of his hellish descent is certainly entertaining and at times self deprecating but he clearly deserved every flick of fire he felt along the way mr buchholz is the author of the just released "new ideas from dead ceos" and a novel "the castro gene "
