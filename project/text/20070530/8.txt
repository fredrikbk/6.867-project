abn bid sweet and sour latest offer from rbs is still above barclayss but price may be cut in takeover fights offer prices usually go up royal bank of scotland group plcs follow up bid for dutch bank abn amro holding nv is heading in the other direction however and that raises questions for abns shareholders rbs chief executive fred goodwin and his bidding consortium said their offer yesterday of euros &# per abn share may end up lower by euro a share the reason the consortium may need that money some billion euros &# billion to cover legal costs because abns side deal with bank of america corp involving chicago based lasalle bank has made the bidding a tangled mess rbs the leader of the european bank consortium seeking to buy and divide abn is casting the blame for the situation and for the potentially discounted price at abns chief rijkman groenink as the bankers wag their fingers at one another it is clear abns shareholders are being forced to choose between an offer from the consortium that is potentially lower than they could have gotten a month ago and one that is lower still the offer is rbss second run at abn in april the rbs led group offered billion euros or euros a share but abn rebuffed that approach rbs came back yesterday with a bid of billion euros &# billion that has been adjusted down for an abn stock dividend paid to shareholders and that could drop to billion euros because of the potential legal costs also for abn shareholders to consider though the rbs consortiums bid is lower than its previous offer it is higher than abns agreement to sell itself to britains barclays plc whose stock offer values abn at billion euros &# billion the consortiums offer is cash higher than the outlined in its initial bid proposal last month cash typically trumps stock a spokesman for abn said the bank is studying the consortiums offer but declined to comment further yesterday mr goodwin and rbs chairman tom mckillop began wooing abn investors for the proposed bid by rbs dutch belgian bank fortis nv and spains banco santander central hispano sa mr goodwin has a number of tasks ahead including winning dutch regulatory approval and completing financing rbss efforts to reach a resolution with bank of america are at a stalemate according to people familiar with the matter but mr goodwin said he hoped to reach an agreement abn at the center of the largest ever bank bidding contest has seen its shares increase since march when barclays entered talks to buy year old abn in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange abns american depositary receipts fell cents or to &# reflecting investor uncertainty about the outcome of the three month old contest abns struggles to unite its far flung operations in europe asia the u s and latin america helped put the bank in play in london rbss shares fell five pence or to pence &# while barclayss stock rose pence or to pence abn is trading at about times per share earnings expectations compared with rbss times projections and barclayss abns u s business remains a sticking point the problem is the decision by mr groenink to sell lasalle to bank of america for &# billion in a side transaction when he struck the barclays deal last month after a dutch shareholders group won a court ordered shareholder vote on the sale bank of america sued abn in the u s to enforce its contract to buy lasalle it is that lawsuit and the threat of billions of dollars in damages that led the rbs consortium to write a discount into its bid the rbs consortiums offer values abn at a premium to abns price friday and higher than abns price before march when barclays announced it was in talks to buy abn but the offer could be cut by euro valuing abn at euros a share because the consortium is holding that amount in reserve to cover the costs of what it might take to settle or pay damages in the bank of america lasalle case rbs came up with the reserve to protect against losses that could stem from a breach of contract dispute according to people familiar with the situation in addition rbs wanted to protect its own shareholders and give abn and bank of america an incentive to reach a resolution some questions for abn shareholders do they push for the consortiums offer which provides more cash and a higher bid but remains one that is likely conditional on rbs being able to work through the lasalle situation or do they go with barclayss offer which has the approval of abn management and supervisory boards and whose stock might have the potential to ultimately outpace the consortiums cash offer the consortium bidders "are better owners of the abn portfolio " said alex potter a bank analyst at london brokerage collins stewart mr potter doesnt own the stocks of the banks involved collins stewarts disclosure statement said the firm may own or more of the securities discussed in mr potters report on rbss new offer and the firm may participate in a public offering of stock of the banks named in the report the dutch supreme court is expected to rule by early july on whether to enforce the stockholder vote on the lasalle sale edward taylor and
