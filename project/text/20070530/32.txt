could this be solid state makes rare tech comeback technology terms that have been used and then discarded usually dont get a second go at things "solid state" is an exception several decades back the phrase became synonymous with "modern " as solid state television sets and radios dispensed with bulky hot and unreliable vacuum tubes in favor of transistors very space age now "solid state" is making a comeback this time in the world of computer storage the term is being resurrected to describe "disk" drives that dispense with spinning disks and instead store information on flash memory flash has been around for ages its a computer chip like the one used for your computers internal memory but it doesnt forget everything when you turn the power off flash has long been used to make those thumb size usb drives popular for transferring data between home and office its also inside apples ipod nano music players whats new in flash is that it is just now becoming cheap enough that flash chips can be used as the innards of solid state drives to replace traditional disk drives which provide long term storage on your computer this new breed of solid state drives have the same housings and connections as hard disk drives just unplug your disk drive and plug in a solid state replacement your computer wont know the difference except the solid state drive will be lighter quieter more energy efficient and absent moving parts more reliable it will also be faster though how much so depends on the application if you were booting windows off a solid state drive it would load twice as quickly as from a disk drive but other chores are speedier still by six or eight times these include snagging small bits of information from different files a common occurrence in big data bases a traditional disk drive takes time to spin around and position itself so that the needed data are underneath the drive "head" that does the reading and writing there is no such delay with flash because its all nonmoving solid state electronics earlier this month dell announced that it would offer solid state drives from sandisk as an option on some of its laptop computers moving us closer to a computer with no moving parts at all the fan that cools the microprocessor is slowly being designed away the gigabyte drives arent cheap they will run &# or enough to buy gigabytes of storage on a traditional hard disk drive but solid state prices always on a decline are now falling faster than ever one company in the solid state business was buying bulk quantities of flash for &# a gigabyte six months ago the figure is now down to &# a gigabyte and keeps heading south jeff janukowicz who follows solid state storage for idc says its not yet clear how many laptop road warriors will be willing to pay the surcharge for solid state drives in higher end devices there isnt much debate over whether solid state drives will take off quickly the advantages of rapid data retrieval and low power consumption are too compelling concurrent computer a duluth ga company that makes servers used for the video on demand market that can cost millions of dollars has just begun to ship products with solid state drives supplied by stec inc of santa ana calif concurrents new machines contain both solid state and traditional drives though bob chism its cto guesses that their products will be using only solid state drives in just another few years indeed many in the solid state industry talk in triumphalist terms about the ascent of solid state storage "i cant imagine in there being a motor in a storage product " says al dei maggi vp of marketing at adtron another leading solid state drive maker not everyone is as certain many people predict that hard disk drives have a secure medium term future ahead of them largely because of the growing importance of multimedia files especially video which take up huge amounts of room and which will always be able to be stored more cheaply on hard disk drives indeed the two will likely coexist my own plan as soon as i can afford it is to have a or so gigabyte solid state drive in my home desktop computer loading my operating system and major applications faster than a hard disk drive ever could but there will also be a megacapacity disk drive or three for my data text files music photos and the rest for consumers the news with solid state only gets better a number of companies are pursuing new approaches to flash that are even speedier than todays technology and as the solid state market booms more manufacturers are jumping into the business last week intel announced a flash partnership other big suppliers include samsung and toshiba price wars seem inevitable one reason for the current interest in flash by manufacturers is the rapid acceptance of the device in consumer products such as the ipod they have helped create the demand now drawing new suppliers into the market so the next time you see someone listening to music on a nano thank them for helping hasten the day when computers are faster and more reliable and you thought they were only ruining their hearing email me at lee gomes
