a democrat crosses the line and urges us to fight on in iraq kudos to bob kerrey for his impressive commentary "the lefts iraq muddle" editorial page may hitherto i as a conservative have viewed mr kerrey as a member of the flagrantly liberal democrat community now i realize i was wrong obviously mr kerrey has the vision and principles to cross political lines in defending if not the bush administrations tactics its strategy yes i totally agree with mr kerrey as to the probable mishandling of the war iraq should never have been seen as a unitary state waiting to be "liberated " in fact iraq should never have been to take three disparate provinces of the ottoman empire and unite them as did woodrow wilson and the other parties to the paris peace conferences in was certainly misguided if not criminal although i hate to admit it i find myself agreeing with sen joe bidens proposal to create an iraqi federation of three or more states in iraq as the only way to solve the problem i believe the administration should have seen this from the very beginning at any rate as a clear restatement of the conditions that led us to enter the iraqi maelstrom to begin with mr kerreys article is without peer my only concern is for the assaults he is bound to endure from the left wing of the democratic party as a response to his estimable and courageous analysis of the bush administrations actions in taking us into iraq and keeping us there today and into the future john valenti baldwin n y bob kerrey wants it both ways on the one hand he offers post war japan and germany as examples of how democracy can be imposed by force but he also recalls jim webbs assertion that you "do not have to occupy a country in order to fight the terrorists who are inside it " the allies were able to install democratic governments in germany and japan because they used overwhelming force to completely destroy the capacity of those countries to wage war then they used a massive occupation to smother lingering insurgencies and lay the groundwork for democratic institutions if mr kerrey seeks the same result in iraq then let him call for a similar effort lets resume the draft and send in the troops gen shinseki said we needed all along if hes not willing to support that kind of effort then he cannot criticize the left for demanding that we rescue our troops who die daily in an undermanned surge that shows no sign yet of succeeding charles smolover wynnewood pa bob kerrey does an excellent job of supporting and summarizing the justifications of going to iraq and staying until the job is finished he also brings his own fellow democrats a majority of whom in the senate voted for the war along with congressional democrats to task for not understanding that iraq has become the central battleground of the war on terror with our soldiers there killing terrorists everyday to help protect america and the world but mr kerrey cant stop there he has to stoop low by calling the bush administration incompetent this despite mr bush being the most steadfast leader in the fight that mr kerrey says we must continue am i missing something here mr kerrey calls for "a bipartisan strategy to deal with the long term threat of terrorism " yet cant get through one third of his essay without becoming himself rhetorically partisan it seems that even when some democrats are right they try hard to get it wrong christopher p lucia vancouver wash mr kerrey in his commentary forgets our failure to impose democracy in vietnam moreover his argument is based on the false assumption that we were obligated to liberate kuwait had we not made that terrible strategic blunder thereby enraging radical muslims by our presence in saudi arabia the attack might never have occurred for thousands of years sun tzu has taught the value of "taking whole " that the wisest generals win wars without fighting and destruction the bush administration is mournfully short of that mark david bronson holden manhattan beach calif
