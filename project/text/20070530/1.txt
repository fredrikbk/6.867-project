a cultural conversation with esa pekka salonen the conductor and composer ponders his next stage in life los angeles esa pekka salonen the music director of the los angeles philharmonic has been called boyish for so long its almost a shock to realize that at he really is middle aged yet as he sits in his uncluttered office inside the walt disney concert hall one observes that his apple cheeks are giving way to jowls and that a paunch has expanded his once trim waistline in most important respects he remains a vigorous figure his feisty angular gesticulations on the podium and general elfin zip have inspired the philharmonic through seasons and his own music is increasingly finding an audience beyond los angeles and his native finland both the duration of his tenure and a desire to spend more time composing figured in his recent decision to resign from the philharmonic at the end of the season when he will be the longest serving music director in the ensembles year history "i didnt time it for my th birthday " mr salonen says of his impending departure his speech inimitably clipped "but to make any major change in ones life becomes more difficult as you get older and i felt that i would have to do this when i still can start something new by the time im done ill have been here for years and theres some beauty to leaving when my relationship with the orchestra is still going well we have no major tensions or problems or disagreements of course its daily life in an artistic institution so there are good days bad days and normal days but theres been nothing we havent been able to sort out and i dont want to jeopardize that by hanging on too long " mr salonen is universally credited with raising the philharmonics playing to new heights and boldly expanding its repertory in the process reversing the ensembles basic protocol from backward looking to forward facing he was also a prime mover in the building of disney hall the landmark frank gehry edifice that stands as an undulating rebuke to outdated notions of los angeless cultural backwardness that point has also been made by the regular visits mr salonen and the philharmonic pay to new york where their taut committed musicianship earns critical kudos almost as a matter of course just a few weeks ago they performed four concerts at avery fisher hall including "the tristan project " a semi staged production of wagners opera "tristan und isolde" designed by the video artist bill viola and directed by peter sellars but the first of these concerts on april may have excited some music lovers even more it featured the new york premiere of mr salonens "helix " composed in though not a major work this rollicking nine minute overture points toward mr salonens future as did his well received piano concerto which had its premiere in january with him conducting the new york philharmonic and yefim bronfman as soloist mr salonen has written music for as long as hes conducted it but not until the mid s when he wrote "l a variations " did his scores attract the kind of attention that makes a composing career viable subsequent works for orchestra secured mr salonens reputation including "foreign bodies" "insomnia" and "wing on wing" a sonic celebration of mr gehry that uses the architects taped voice several of these pieces were written as showcases for the philharmonic and mr salonen credits the ensemble with a share in his success the gratitude flows both ways for without his work as an orchestra builder the players could never have performed music the composer himself calls "terribly hard to play " yet juggling the two roles has proved trying even for this protean musician in the conductor took a yearlong sabbatical to write an opera based on peter hoegs novel "the women and the ape " but when he returned to the podium there was no opera and there still isnt "it became obvious to me that writing an opera and at the same time being the music director of a major orchestra are not mutually compatible " mr salonen says "i realized the opera has to wait until my conducting situation changes i have a few commissions that im intending to honor a big chorus and orchestra piece for chicago in and i promised to write a piece for christoph von dohnanyi and the ndr orchestra when they move into their new concert hall in hamburg in but after that im going to bite the bullet and start seriously on the opera if one wants to be a composer it would be sad to leave this life without having written one and the later i do it the more difficult it will be so i think its about time " mr salonens influences as a composer are many but debussy ravel and stravinsky are "always on my mind " he says he also credits sibelius but less so of the moderns he cites witold lutoslawski and gyorgy ligeti and he "really admires" some of messiaens music the list is capped by a surprise "maybe it sounds a little ponderous or grand " mr salonen says "but i would mention beethoven in this context he was able to create a musical form that absolutely sucks the listener in and doesnt let you go until the drama is over hes playing with expectations teasing the listener promising things but not fulfilling that promise and then leading the listener astray finally he invites the listener to the very place he wants him to be " beethoven it turns out looms large for mr salonen who says hes listening with new avidity to the composers late string quartets last season he had great success with an extended series called "beethoven unbound " which paired the composers nine symphonies with modern works as well as with one another the experience caused him to re evaluate some of his ideas about performing beethoven he had been heavily influenced by conductors like nikolaus harnoncourt and roger norrington who performed beethoven with reduced forces and used period instruments their success in the s and s proved intimidating he suggests creating a situation in which divergent views lost currency "all of a sudden there was almost a fashionable way to play beethoven " mr salonen recalls "and if you didnt play it this way then you were intellectually and artistically bankrupt i was caught in the middle of this discourse like many other people in my generation trying to figure out a way stylistically what is what is there truth or are these values relative "finally i came to the conclusion that just as a bruno walter or otto klemperer performance of a beethoven symphony can sound strange to us now the way harnoncourt and these people conduct beethoven will sound equally strange in years our point of view keeps changing and i kind of mentally arrived at a postmodern beethoven we have had the reformation and now the field is open again " this epiphany had practical implications borne out in "beethoven unbound" by taut engaged readings that were vast improvements over the conductors earlier reflections "my approach changed quite radically " says mr salonen "i gave up staring myself blind at the metronome numbers i think way too much attention has been paid to these details which may not be the most essential aspects of his music after all and composers themselves change their ideas about their works i think there are three different recordings of hindemith conducting mathis der maler and each one is different so which is the truth none because music is living material " much has been made of the similarities between mr salonen and his successor at the philharmonic gustavo dudamel a year old venezuelan now earning the sort of reviews that jumpstarted mr salonens international career nearly years ago indeed both conductors made their american debuts leading the philharmonic mr salonen in and mr dudamel in and both had the enthusiastic backing of ernest fleischmann eminence grise of the philharmonic and its managing director during the first half of mr salonens tenure but though mr dudamels arrival was announced alongside mr salonens departure mr salonen denies playing kingmaker joking that he is not kim il sung nor is the philharmonic north korea "i didnt exactly pick him " he says "the orchestra reacted incredibly positively to gustavo it was clear to us all that this guy is a fantastic choice and i was very pleased that this was something i could wholeheartedly support it would have been awkward for me to see as my successor someone i didnt think highly of i was involved in his very first time conducting outside venezuela at the bamberg competition in and ernest was there too its almost wagnerian like the threads of fate that the norns weave in goetterdammerung it felt very organic and somehow natural " mr mermelstein writes about the arts for various print and online publications
