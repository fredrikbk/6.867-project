business day sign up for the e mail here nigerian authorities have filed criminal charges and a civil lawsuit accusing pfizer of illegally testing unapproved drugs on children during a meningitis epidemic and doing so without their parents permission officials from kano nigerias largest state charged the pharmaceutical giant with counts of criminal conspiracy and voluntarily causing grievous harm in the deaths of children who received the drug and seek more than &# billion in damages and restitution from pfizer in the civil suit the washington post reports pfizer denies all the charges its researchers are accused of selecting children and infants from a makeshift epidemic camp and giving an untested antibiotic called trovan to about half the post says the other half were given "a dangerously low dose of a comparison drug made by hoffmann la roche " and "nigerian officials say pfizers actions resulted in the deaths of an unspecified number of children and left others deaf paralyzed blind or brain damaged " the post adds according to the lawsuit the researchers didnt obtain consent from the childrens families parents were banned from the ward where their kids were being treated and the researchers "knew trovan to be an experimental drug with life threatening side effects that was unfit for human use " the post reports u s authorities have never approved trovan for use in children and restricted use by adults after it was associated with reports of death and liver damage the company left no medical records in nigeria but the post cites internal pfizer records showing that five children treated with the experimental antibiotic died and that six children taking the comparison drug died though the documents gave no indication their deaths were caused by the drugs the lawsuit says that resulting suspicion about drugs in kano led parents there to refuse polio immunizations for their kids last year but it should be noted that the polio outbreak that began four years ago in nigeria has in part been blamed by opposition to immunization among some muslim leaders in the countrys north who said the vaccines could contaminate patients with aids aliyu umar kano attorney general until earlier this month tells the post he filed the charges with the backing of federal authorities and that it took years to do so because officials only learned details in recent years through a series of the posts own investigative reports pfizer said in a statement that it did nothing wrong and that children with meningitis already have a high fatality rate "it is indeed regrettable that more than a decade after the meningitis epidemic in kano the nigerian government has taken legal action against pfizer and others for an effort that provided significant benefit to some of nigerias youngest citizens " the statement said "pfizer continues to emphasize in the strongest terms that the trovan clinical study was conducted with the full knowledge of the nigerian government and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with the companys abiding commitment to patient safety " the paper notes that the nigerian charges amount to a rare or possibly unprecedented "instance in which the developing worlds anger at multinational drug companies has boiled over into criminal charges " it is also the latest public relations blow for pfizer resulting from the clinical trial and could turn into the latest image fiasco for the industry as a whole justices back employers on discrimination deadline the supreme court voted against a former manager at a goodyear tire and rubber plant who alleged sexual discrimination saying that under federal equal rights laws her complaint was filed far too late the decision was a clear victory for employers who following the ruling "cant be sued for years old discrimination even if such actions continue to harm an employee in the form of lower pay than he or she otherwise would be entitled to " as the wall street journal notes writing for the majority justice samuel alito who succeeded sandra day oconnor said that title vii of the civil rights act of included tight deadlines that require complaints to be filed within days after discrimination has occurred not days after the alleged victims last paycheck was issued as plaintiff lilly ledbetter had argued in this case ms ledbetter claimed she was paid to less than male counterparts legal times explains "the eeoc charging period is triggered when a discrete unlawful practice takes place " justice alito wrote "a new violation does not occur and a new charging period does not commence upon the occurrence of subsequent non discriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination " in a blistering dissent read from the bench justice ruth bader ginsburg accused the majority of failing to understand the problems addressed by title vii "the court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination " she wrote explaining that early in a womans employment at a company she may not even be aware of the salaries of others and "understandably may be anxious to avoid" causing problems justice ginsburg said womens salaries can also fall behind those of men meaning the gap only becomes apparent after years employment law experts tell the new york times the ruling could have ramifications beyond sexual discrimination and affect cases involving race and ethnicity as well administration ups ante over testing of cows persevering in a fight that has flabbergasted food safety advocates the bush administration said it will appeal a federal court ruling that would allow meatpackers to test their animals for mad cow disease since an outbreak of the disease was discovered in a washington state cow in december and through the discoveries of a second case in texas in and a third last year in alabama the administration has opposed any effort to put in place widespread testing the agriculture department which tests fewer than of slaughtered cows for mad cow disease bovine variant of the crippling human brain disease creutzfeldt jacob says widespread testing could produce false positives which could decimate domestic and overseas sales of u s cattle the giant meat packing companies oppose it as well fearing that tested meat would be marketed as such and thus be more competitive than their own untested offerings a federal judge ruled in march that usda doesnt have the authority to prevent a meatpacker from using the same tests the government relies on and that ruling was set to take effect tomorrow yesterday as the associated press reports the usda said it would appeal the ruling effectively delaying the testing until the
