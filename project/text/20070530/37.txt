debt bomb inside the subprime mortgage debacle day of reckoning subprime aftermath losing the family home mortgages bolstered detroits middle class until money ran out first in a series detroit for decades the block of west outer drive in detroit has been a model of middle class home ownership part of an urban enclave of well kept colonial residences and manicured lawns but on a recent spring day locals saw something disturbing dandelions growing wild on several properties "when i see dandelions i worry " says sylvia hollifield an instructor at michigan state university who has lived on the block for more than years ms hollifields concern is well founded her neighbors are losing interest in their lawns because theyre losing their homes a result of the recent boom in "subprime" mortgage lending over the past several years seven of the households on the block have taken out subprime loans typically aimed at folks with poor or patchy credit some used the money to buy their houses but most already owned their homes and used the proceeds to pay off credit cards do renovations and maintain an appearance of middle class fortitude amid a declining local economy three now face eviction because they couldnt meet rising monthly payments two more are showing signs of distress "this has stripped us of our whole pride " says april williams years old who has until august to pay off her mortgage or vacate the two story colonial at where she and her husband have lived for years "theres going to be no people left in detroit if they keep doing this to them " the fate of people on west outer drive offers a glimpse of a drama that is playing out in middle to lower income often minority dominated communities across the country in addition to putting families into homes subprime mortgages and the brokers who peddle them are helping to take families out of homes in which theyve lived for years eroding the benefits that proponents on wall street and in congress have long touted the borrowers difficulties raise questions about how the extension of easy credit to large swaths of the u s population will ultimately affect people and the broader economy questions that have gained in urgency as a sharp rise in defaults has policy makers wondering what if anything they can or should do much of the focus in the subprime debacle has been on the demise of bubble markets in balmy locales such as california and florida but the subprime market has also channeled a surprising amount of money into some of americas poorer and more troubled local economies in alone according to an analysis of data from first american loanperformance subprime investors from all over the world injected more than a billion dollars into zip codes in detroit where home values were falling unemployment was rising and the foreclosure rate was already the nations highest fourteen zip codes in memphis tenn attracted an estimated &# million seventeen zip codes in newark n j pulled in about &# billion in all of those zip codes subprime mortgages comprised more than half of all home loans made the figures show the extent to which the new world of mortgage finance has made the american dream of homeownership accessible to folks in previously underserved communities by some estimates subprime lending has accounted for as much as half of the past decades rise in the u s homeownership rate to from but as the experience of west outer drive illustrates the flood of cash has also encouraged people to get into financially precarious positions often precisely at the time when they were least able to afford it in doing so it may have temporarily alleviated but ultimately worsened some of the nations most acute economic problems "the market was feeding an addict at its neediest point " says diane swonk who spent years analyzing consumer credit in the midwest and now serves as chief economist at chicago based financial services firm mesirow financial "individuals will resist reductions in their standard of living with everything in their power including mortgaging their futures " if events unfold as some predict subprime lending could end up eliminating more homeowners than it created one study by the center for responsible lending a nonprofit that focuses on abusive lending practices forecasts that the subprime boom will result in a total of million foreclosures nationwide most of them on homes people owned before taking out the loans that outweighs even the most optimistic estimates of the number of homeowners created which dont exceed two million to understand how the legacy of subprime lending looks on the ground take a ride around the west outer drive area with carlton mcburrows who grew up in the neighborhood and now works as a community organizer for acorn an advocacy group that provides financial counseling to lower income families on one recent spring day he counted four empty houses with big red refuse bins outside a sign that banks having taken possession of the homes were tossing out all the belongings and debris left behind by the previous inhabitants "this is a phenomenon that ive never seen before and ive lived here all my life " he says "i think this is just the beginning " as opposed to other parts of urban detroit which tend to be plagued by burned out homes the area around the block of west outer drive has remained a place where people try hard to keep up appearances originally largely jewish the neighborhood became a bastion of home ownership for upwardly mobile blacks beginning in the late s though the areas fortunes have slipped somewhat as people have moved out to the suburbs it has boasted such famous residents as aretha franklin marvin gaye and berry gordy the founder of the motown record label "it was like when you made it to outer drive youd made it " says deborah herron a former administrative assistant who lived in the area for years back in its heyday the idea that west outer drive could suffer from a glut of credit would have seemed far fetched many blacks moving into the neighborhood had to either depend on federal mortgage programs or buy their homes outright thats because banks actively avoided lending to them a practice known as "redlining" a reference to maps that designated certain neighborhoods as unduly risky various attempts to get the money to flow such as the community reinvestment act of which pushed banks to do more lending in the communities where they operated had only a limited effect but beginning in the mid s the evolution of subprime mortgage lending from a local niche business to a global market drastically rearranged lenders incentives instead of putting their own money at risk subprime lenders began reselling loans in bulk and at a profit to wall street banks the bankers in turn transformed a large chunk of the loans into highly rated securities which attracted investors from all over the world by paying a better return than other securities with the same rating the investors cared much more about the broader qualities of the securities things like the average credit score and overall geographic distribution than exactly where and to whom the loans were being made "you have no time to look really deeply at every single borrower " says michael thiemann chief investment officer at collineo asset management gmbh a dortmund germany based firm that invests on behalf of european banks and insurance companies "youre looking at statistical distributions " suddenly mortgage lenders saw places like west outer drive as attractive targets for new business because so many families either owned their homes outright or owed much less on their mortgages than their homes were worth lenders seeking to tap that equity bombarded the area with radio television direct mail advertisements and armies of agents and brokers often peddling loans that veiled high interest rates and fat fees behind low introductory payments unscrupulous players had little reason to worry about whether or not people could afford the loans the more contracts they could sign the more money they stood to make "the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction " says dan immergluck a professor of urban planning at georgia institute of technology who has written a book on redlining "we have too much credit and too much of the wrong type of credit " minority dominated communities attracted more than their fair share of subprime loans which carry higher interest rates than traditional mortgages a study by the center for responsible lending found that african americans were between and more likely to get higher rate loans than white borrowers with the same credit quality subprime mortgages accounted for more than half of all loans made from though in the zip code which includes the block of west outer drive according to estimates from first american loanperformance over that period the total volume of subprime lending in the zip code amounted to more than half a billion dollars mostly in the form of adjustable rate mortgages the payments on which are fixed for an initial period then rise and fall with short term interest rates "a lot of people were steered into subprime loans because of the area they were in even though they could have qualified for something better " says john bettis president of broker urban mortgage in detroit he says a brokers commission on a &# subprime loan could easily reach &# while the commission on a similar prime loan typically wouldnt exceed &# the boom in subprime lending paved the way to home ownership for many people over the past three years three people on the block have used subprime loans to buy homes in at least two of those cases though the experience has not gone well raymond dixon a year old with his own business installing security systems borrowed &# from fremont investment &amp loan in to buy a first home for himself his wife and six children across the street from ms hollifield at west outer drive after all the papers had been signed he says he realized that he had paid more than &# to the broker and other go betweens "they took us for a ride " he says bishop charles ellis senior pastor of the greater grace temple in detroit says he has heard many similar complaints from people in the area who either because they were new to the process or had good experiences in the past had put too much trust in subprime mortgage brokers still he believes many bear responsibility for their predicaments "if you have a contract in front of you you have to read that contract " he says mr dixon defaulted on the loan after the monthly payment jumped to more than &# from &# a rise he says put too much strain on his income from his security business the foreclosure process began in late november and mr dixon says he expects an eviction notice this week a spokesman for fremont said the company which is in the process of exiting the residential

she decorated with her sons baseball and basketball trophies "ill get an apartment " she says "im not going to buy another place " an equifirst spokeswoman said the company doesnt comment on specific customers for many who already owned their homes offers of easy credit came at a time when a severe economic downturn had left them in need of money to maintain middle class lifestyles since the year
