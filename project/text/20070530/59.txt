invested capital after a little more than three years how najafi run by year old iranian american jahm najafi in phoenix pulled off such a return underscores the golden age of todays private equity market it also demonstrates the outsize profit potential both of companies scooped up from the corporate dustbin and of smaller transactions that have largely been out of the headlines as multibillion dollar deals by the likes of cerberus capital management lp and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co grab the spotlight still such private equity returns are likely to become rare amid the continuing flood of cash into private equity that has pushed up deal prices and premiums and the surging stock market that has heated up company valuations moreover the steady economy has helped to reduce the number of turnaround plays "to buy companies cheap now is now harder and there are more deals being done at much higher multiples " said mario giannini chief executive of hamilton lane an institutional money manager in bala cynwyd pa with &# billion under management "a lot of things have to go right with smaller private equity deals now to make a strong return " for najafi good timing certainly helped

growing companies and sold "theres a lot of potential upside in smaller companies because there are multiple ways to grow these businesses " said ted virtue chief executive of private equity firm midocean partners llp in new york "the bread and butter of buyouts are these midmarket deals " the midmarket buyout ranging from &# million to &# million is one of the most active slices of private equity with such transactions in the u s last year compared with the deals done in the &# billion to &# billion range in the same period according to dealogic still najafis return of around times is unusual other private equity investors said they typically aim to generate a return of as much as triple their original cash investment on any particular deal "theres no other deal weve done thats returned times our capital " said mr najafi chief executive of his namesake firm mr najafis firm started in as a subsidiary of phoenix real estate company pivotal group inc which is run by mr najafis older brother francis who is part owner of the phoenix suns national basketball association team at the time the younger mr najafi largely invested capital that he and his family reaped from real

competitors in the market nearly of the companys revenue at the time was from domain name registrations said network solutions chief executive champ mitchell who began overseeing the unit in mr mitchell said the division was "poorly structured and had terrible customer service i was brought in to catch a falling knife " bob korzeniewski a verisign executive vice president acknowledged that mr mitchell was brought in to stabilize network solutions he said the mountain view calif company decided to sell network solutions in because providing domain names didnt fit with verisigns underlying internet infrastructure business verisign sold of the company to mr najafi and his firm keeping the remaining stake network solutions eventually bought back that slice in early for more than &# million plus an additional amount to repay some debt meanwhile network solutions began widening its product offerings since january network solutions has added services and products the new offerings are fueling network solutions growth today of its revenue comes from domain name registrations down from the nearly of last year messrs najafi and mitchell considered taking network solutions public at the same time the company started getting attention from bigger private equity firms "people realized we were doing well and we received an unsolicited offer" from a private equity buyer mr najafi said after holding an auction conducted by morgan stanley general atlantic a buyout firm in greenwich conn with &# billion under management walked away as the winning buyer in february
