the evening wrap mac v pc d online edition for many who grew up during the s there were two kinds of people in the world beatles fans and rolling stones fans decades later another cultural schism has helped mold a generation the gulf between mac and pc users macintosh maker apple has been having a bit of sport with the divide in recent ads with actor justin long playing the laid back shaggy topped mac to author john hodgmans stuffy all business microsoft powered pc whatever the merits of the spots implications that pcs offer all work and no play and that macs are free wheeling virus free funboxes they handily demonstrate a divide that has helped define silicon valley for the better part of the last years pcs still outsell macs by a vast margin most businesses have stuck with microsoft powered machines since they are generally much less expensive than macs and many consumers have defaulted to computers they first got comfortable with in the office but after a run of sour fortunes apple began to snatch back some of the computer market when it began selling the lower cost imac and then really regained its stride with the debut of the ipod which defined and now dominates the digital music market to the enduring envy of many of its computer foes its with all the history trailing behind them that the two men driving the companies microsofts bill gates and apples steve jobs will sit together tonight for a rare face to face at the wall street journals d all things digital conference in california microsoft has been eager to slice into some of apples success in the consumer electronics realm and before tonights big pow wow microsoft chief executive steve ballmer told the conference that the software giant is planning to roll out a fresh line of music players that he promised would be "more exciting" than its current offerings that is the zune microsoft sold one million zunes since the music players launch nine months ago by way of comparison it took apple months to sell its first million ipods of course that was in a marketplace that apples player pioneered when the first ipods landed on the shelves people who wanted to listen to music on the go were carrying around bulky portable cd players or even a cassette player the zune emerged into an ipod dominated world and one where music fans have a large disincentive to embrace new technology due to the copyright protection software that restricts how and whether listeners can transfer their digital music files between devices thus while zune was slowly making a dent apple sold nearly million ipods in the last quarter alone microsoft isnt quite prosecuting an all out war on apple mr ballmer said that microsoft has no plans to create a cellphone saying that the company is content to focus on expanding its market share in mobile operating systems apple is of course poised to make a splashy entrance into the handset market later this year with its iphone touchscreen smartphone and the device is expected to present a formidable competitor to devices such as research in motions blackberry and palms treo but in microsofts case mr ballmer said "i dont actually think it would make sense for us to make a cellphone " to be sure microsoft had made some similar noises about launching an ipod rival and then along came zune but apple may not even be the biggest threat on microsofts radar mr ballmer seemed to be considerably more exercised over google waving his arms about excitedly and promising in booming tones that "were committed oh boy were committed" to shake off microsofts
