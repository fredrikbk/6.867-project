new thinking on eye infections and contacts scientists focus on epa move to cut use of chlorine in public water supplies recent outbreaks of serious eye infections among contact lens users may be tied to a reduced use of chlorine to decontaminate public water supplies in response to a federal environmental mandate according to a team of chicago doctors who discovered the latest eye problems last friday advanced medical optics inc a california company recalled its complete moistureplus a contact lens cleaning solution after an investigation sparked by the chicago team found the solution was used by almost of people suffering from a rare outbreak of infections by a microbe known as acanthamoeba but the doctors charlotte joslin and elmer tu arent saying the cleaning solutions themselves were tainted during manufacture instead in a research paper last august and another soon to be published in a peer reviewed ophthalmology journal they link amoeba infections and last years outbreak of fungal infections to a decision by the u s environmental protection agency which took effect between and in an effort to reduce chemical contamination the epa restricted the levels of byproducts of chlorine and other chemicals used to clean drinking water drs joslin and tu whose study was federally funded theorize that lowering the amount of cleaning chemicals may have increased the number of amoebas in the water that in turn could lead to more infections when contact lens users shower or swim in pools or hot tubs while wearing lenses that can trap amoebas the food and drug administration doesnt require contact lens solutions to kill amoebas and they have never done so very successfully earlier this year an ohio state university team published research on how amoebas survived in three different cleaning solutions from bausch &amp lomb inc advanced medical and alcon inc after six hours of soaking almost all of the strains of acanthamoeba continued to grow in all three products but advanced medicals product did the worst allowing more than of the strains to grow that may explain why the companys product was tied to almost of the amoeba infections despite having about of the u s market in a statement the company emphasized that none of the products killed all strains of amoebas and called for "good contact lens handling practices" and discussions among industry and regulators since the last acanthamoeba outbreak in the mid s which was tied to the use of homemade cleaning solutions amoebal and fungal infections have been very rare thus many eye doctors say the recent outbreaks must have other explanations "something has definitely changed " dr joslin says "why are we having a second outbreak of an extremely extremely rare eye infection " the epa disputes dr joslins theory saying that filtration of water supplies not chlorine should remove amoebas and that poor hygiene practices are at fault "i am flummoxed as to how a rule addressing decontamination byproducts would address acanthamoeba " said eric burneson chief of the target and analysis branch of the epas water division the american journal of ophthalmology which accepted dr joslins paper yesterday plans to rush it into publication on the internet some time next week but it will be difficult to test the theory other doctors say because of a different epa move in the agency decided not to measure or regulate acanthamoebas in public water supplies although the amoebas were listed as a candidate for regulation the epa decided against regulating or monitoring them in its decision the epa said that amoeba infections were a personal hygiene matter and that contact lens users shouldnt use tap water to clean their lenses or shower while wearing contact lenses govinda visvesvara a scientist at the federal centers for disease control and prevention criticized the epas decision not to monitor amoebas in the water supply "i dont know why the epa didnt want to put that in " said mr visvesvara who studies the amoeba and helped investigate the recent outbreak "i think they should " even with the recent outbreak amoeba infections are still very rare doctors say the government investigation has found only cases of amoeba infection since the beginning of there are more than million contact lens wearers in the u s but the acanthamoeba infections which cause excruciating pain and blindness appear to have coincided with an outbreak of a different eye infection caused by a fungus called fusarium both infections are almost exclusively found in contact lens users the cdc linked about of the fungus infections to a contact lens solution made by bausch &amp lomb which pulled the product from the market "theres been a significant increase in microbial corneal infections said reza dana who directs the corneal service at the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary at the infirmary amoeba and fungal infections have tripled in the last five years dr dana said the outbreaks may have spurred more consumer demand for daily disposable lenses that dont require solutions for cleaning and storage single use lens sales are up in the first three months of compared with the year earlier period according to the contact lens institute the industry group in the u s only of soft contact lens users wear daily disposables mainly due to their higher cost of perhaps a dollar a day "if a wearer or potential wearer says i want to minimize any risk and i want to simplify my life i would consider steering them toward the daily lenses " said thomas steinemann associate professor of ophthalmology at case western reserve university in cleveland patients need to discard the lenses every day he added some doctors have already begun recommending daily disposables for children and teens who often spend many summer hours in swimming pools tracing the source some scientists speculate that regulatory moves may be contributing to an increase in eye infections the epa reduced chlorination byproduct levels in the water supply which took effect between and the epa decided in not to monitor or regulate acanthamoebas in public water supplies
