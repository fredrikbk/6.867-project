politics &amp economics mexicos calderon takes on kingpins president mobilizes military to stem rising drug violence an appeal for u s assistance mexico city president felipe calderon escalated mexicos bloody clash with narcotics gangs this month by dispatching troops to the gulf coast state of veracruz they got a grisly greeting a severed human head at the barracks with a note scoffing at the presidents efforts mr calderon is taking on heavily armed drug gangs on a scale that is unprecedented in mexico since taking office dec he has ordered soldiers and federal police to states where drug lords hold sway this year he has extradited to the u s at least drug kingpins who were running their gangs from mexican jails in mexico extradited a major drug lord to the u s for the first time the success or failure of mr calderons assault on drug crime has important implications for the u s mexico is by far the biggest u s supplier of cocaine most of it originating in colombia and a major supplier of marijuana heroin and methamphetamines mr calderons government has begun talks for increased aid from the u s to ramp up its drug fight mexican government officials said he also is pressing the u s to stanch the flow of arms smuggled from the u s into mexico u s officials said the administration applauds what mr calderon has been doing and hopes to assist him so far discussions between the two sides remain preliminary "nothing is being proposed yet from either side " said a state department official "there is a real desire to help but we have not yet put any request forward to get money from congress " the u s and mexico have a long history of cooperation on drug investigations though u s financial assistance is relatively small owing in part to mexicos reluctance to accept outside aid on law enforcement matters possible areas of increased u s aid could include technological support in monitoring mexican airspace as well as money mr calderons bold strokes have boosted his popularity in mexico after he eked out a narrow victory at the polls but he may be betting his presidency on an issue that has long proved intractable his predecessors shied away from confronting drug gangs out of fear it could thrust the government into a fight reminiscent of colombia in recent decades when politicians were routinely gunned down and car bombings terrorized ordinary citizens against the backdrop of a drug fueled guerrilla war mexico has a long way to go before it resembles colombias bloody past but there are reasons why some here are making the comparison this year more than people have died from drug related violence putting the country on a path to exceed last years unprecedented toll of dead colombia averaged combat related deaths a year from according to a recent university of london study "the difference with colombia is that here we are trying to catch it at an earlier stage " said mexican public security minister genaro garcia mr calderon may not have had much choice drug violence that once seemed out of the way in rural mexico spilled into cities over the past several years as the government of vicente fox failed to curb violence between drug gangs monterrey a hub for business and one of the countrys richest cities is now the scene of regular assassinations of police officials the police chief of the posh monterrey suburb of san nicolas was slain this month acapulco the pacific coast playground of the mexico city elite is becoming known more for severed heads than for coconut rum drinks mexicans were stunned last year when a gang dumped five severed heads on the stage at a nightclub in the state of michoacan as a warning to a rival gang gangs send videos of police or rival traffickers being tortured to newspapers police in acapulco have been terrorized by the sight of the bleeding heads of officers impaled on stakes outside police stations the prospect of fighting mexicos drug organizations which employ paramilitary fighters with sophisticated weapons has provoked unnerving questions among senior officials and policy analysts does the mexican state have the equipment manpower and nerve to displace narcotics gangs what happens if the government loses "in play are liberty the rule of law justice the state itself " political analyst federico reyes heroles wrote recently in the reforma newspaper "its that simple and dramatic " mr calderons stance has attracted doubters opposition lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the president to return the military to its barracks the nations human rights commission an autonomous government body has criticized the use of the military as risking civil rights abuses a small town mayor on the front lines of the drug fight in guerrero state has called on mr calderon to cut a deal with traffickers as the best way to quell violence one explanation for the violence is that it is an unintended result of law enforcements strategy of targeting drug lords mexicans are learning that the death or jailing of a kingpin begets more violence as lesser barons battle for the spoils another explanation is drug gangs are fighting over lucrative mexican markets for retail drug sales that didnt exist a few years ago mexican authorities have estimated that drug use has risen in the past years mr calderon is relying heavily on the military an alliance he sealed shortly after taking office by granting a near pay raise to servicemen mr calderon needs the military because many local police forces are perceived to be corrupt senior government officials said the army is the only organized force in mexico equipped to deal with the outbreaks of violence and the loss of state control in many towns and cities but attempts to rely on the army in the past have backfired a general tapped as mexicos antidrug czar in the s was later convicted of being on the payroll of a cartel and critics of mr calderons approach said dispersing the military in drug zones could lead to corruption in the ranks while the military may be able to match the firepower of drug gangs it hasnt proved capable of the detective work needed to dismantle the organizations soldiers this month fired grenades into a house in michoacan where suspected gang leaders were hiding killing everyone instead of arresting them mr calderon has announced the creation of a new military division that will support federal police work as well as an overhaul of the federal police which has been undermined by links with organized crime but attempts to create an elite drug fighting corps have failed in the past when security forces came under the suspicion of corruption to learn more mr calderon and his top security officials plan to fly to italy saturday to meet officials with experience battling the mafia neil king jr in washington contributed to this article front lines this months highlights in mexicos escalating battle with drug gangs troops to veracruz may ambush kills
