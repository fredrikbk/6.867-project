giant swiss collider may reveal secrets about origins of mass the life of a physicist is marked by "attacks of hopelessness depression and discouragement " nobel laureate leon lederman wrote in since that was a lot closer to the golden era of particle physics than is you can imagine the angst of those who toil in the field today the last really cool and surprising discovery in particle physics which probes the most fundamental aspects of matter space and time and the forces that sculpt the cosmos came in help is on the way this year the large hadron collider a nearly &# billion accelerator at the cern physics lab near geneva will be switched on when it is it may produce new kinds of matter that nature has hidden from human eyes extra dimensions of space concealed within the mundane three like a secret compartment in a suitcase and a mysterious field that gives matter mass the collider will send protons the positive charged particles in atomic nuclei racing around a tunnel kilometers in circumference at nearly the speed of light one beam will travel clockwise and one counterclockwise until protons smash head on million of them per second the impact will have an energy of trillion electron volts thats roughly the energy of motion of flying mosquitoes but the lhc will cram it into a space one trillionth the size of a mosquito the resulting fireball will rival one that last existed physicists calculate just after the big bang that created the universe out of that energy may come miniature black holes and even evidence that quarks and electrons previously believed to be fundamental actually are made of smaller entities says physicist lee smolin of the perimeter institute waterloo canada the lhcs fireball could also act as a doorway into a looking glass world as einstein showed energy and mass are interconvertible e mc the energy produced by colliding protons can therefore crystallize into particles like water vapor condensing into morning dew it just so happens that trillion ev is probably enough to play subatomic matchmaker that is it might create a partner for every known particle the superpartners such as squarks for quarks have never been seen but many theorists believe they exist with the same electric charge but probably greater masses than their partners the discovery of a hidden particle zoo would be both humbling what else is nature concealing and illuminating one superpartner for instance might be the long sought "dark matter" that lurks throughout the universe emitting no light it shoves around stars and galaxies and scientists have no idea what the heck it is if the lhc creates superpartners the results will be spun as fiercely as a political campaign debate string theory which asserts that the basic constituents of matter are tiny vibrating strings that exist in or dimensions requires supersymmetry thus stringsters may hail signs of superpartners as their long sought vindication but rival theories posit superpartners too so if the lhc finds them it wouldnt uniquely support string theory "supersymmetry is a vital part of string theory so if the lhc doesnt find it that would argue strongly against string theory " says physicist lawrence krauss of case western reserve university cleveland "if it is observed you can say that string theory has not been disproved but not that it has been validated " the lhc might prove string theorys boldest claim the existence of hidden dimensions if some energy goes missing after the protons collide one explanation would be that the missing energy has fallen into a hidden dimension perhaps the deepest puzzle of the physical world is the origin of mass physicists have measured the masses of electrons protons and the like to many decimal places what they dont know is why particles weigh anything why in other words matter has mass after all massless particles exist photons particles of light have zero mass physicists worse than toddlers when it comes to asking "why " arent content with the answer that mass exists "just because " the source of mass theorists believe is a ghostly field that pervades every nook and cranny of the universe from the space between the stars of orion to that in your kitchen cabinet particles moving through this "higgs field" would be like fruit dragged through chocolate fondue some would gather up more mass think strawberries and some would gather less slippery cantaloupe the former would become massive like neutrons the latter light like electrons if the higgs field exists it would have a particle associated with it which the lhc may cough up how momentous that would be is reflected in dr ledermans name for it "the god particle " any of these discoveries would lift physicists depression so would something unexpected after three decades of the same old same old "the current model has been frustratingly accurate " says prof krauss "its always better to be surprised and thats what we hope for from the lhc " but if neither higgs particles nor superpartners show up says dr smolin "its back to square one because everything we think we know will be wrong " email me at sciencejournal wsj com
