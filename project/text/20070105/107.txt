weekend journal tastings falling in love with a rustic italian brunellos deliver complex earthy charm a first class update brunello di montalcino excites a very special kind of passion in some people they dont just like this special red wine from italys tuscany region they love it and now for the first time we can say that we understand why let us tell you about our own journey some wine writers and wine experts act like they already know everything there is to know about wine and that their opinions were set in stone long ago not only is that ridiculous but think how boring it would be the world of wine is a dynamic place and we like to think were growing and changing all the time too put that together and you have a journey of discovery that makes wine to us endlessly fascinating we didnt drink much brunello di montalcino in our early wine years thats no surprise its a pretty new kind of wine as these things go and back in the s there werent many producers and they didnt make much wine brunello is made from the sangiovese grape just like that other famous wine of tuscany chianti but different climate different winemaking practices including plenty of time in the barrel and different soil make for very different wines the first brunello on which we have notes was a tenuta col dorcia which we opened in late "good " we wrote then "very dry very earthy not elegant brawny you can almost taste the earth " the first brunello we had that we really loved was a campogiovanni that we drank in "delicious " we wrote "incredible nose of pure chocolate gorgeous red gold color old on front of mouth dry huge austere drying long finish a truly special wine that is both chocolatey and austere at the same time " alas that was the only brunello we ever had that we rated that highly and considering the high price for brunello its a fairly small production wine with only about producers and a total of cases a year but a great many world wide admirers so its pretty dear brunello wasnt among our go to wines in we conducted our first large tasting of brunello and once again we came away skeptical there were some good wines but most of those were quite expensive and the overall quality wasnt consistent enough to merit excitement now the wines from said to be a great year are arriving in stores so we decided to try again we bought a large sample from several states we set our price limit at &# which left out quite a few but still allowed us plenty of opportunity to taste a broad sampling in the first flight we tasted a wine about which we wrote "earthy tight and filled with minerals bittersweet chocolate rough and brawny makes you feel alive like its really close to the earth rustic primitive lustiness sun baked minerality lots of power but harnessed with razor sharp acidity and underlying earth " this was podere salicutti "piaggione " which costs about &# and sure as heck turned our heads the good news is that the entire tasting was exciting these were overall unique wines bone dry filled with lemony acidity no nonsense fruit and lusty earth they were so lean they were almost sharp but the good ones had so much harnessed ripe fruit that they seemed to vibrate the wines which are designed to age for many years are still so young and tannic that they changed with each sip several wines in one bottle so many wines these days are berry like these were not instead they were restrained earthy and very serious disciplined wines the ones that failed simply didnt have enough of that tight fruit which left them harsh thin or dull and to be sure we tasted quite a few that did fail but there were enough truly exciting wines that we would be willing to kiss some frogs even at these prices to have such a fine experience the vintage was the one that changed our view of brunello when the s arrive will we change our minds again perhaps but for now who cares the s are on shelves buy one decant it for an hour and sip slowly with a giant veal chop or sausage and peppers and if you can buy some more and lay them down for a decade or so theyre worth the wait update a couple of years ago we conducted "the first class taste off " in which we compared the wines available on two cross country flights john flew continental and dottie flew american continental won by a sip recently john took a first class flight from new york to los angeles on american returned on united and compared the wine selections in fact there was no comparison uniteds were far more thoughtfully chosen from the schramsberg blanc de blancs in the waiting lounge to a william fevre premier cru chablis one of our long time favorites and a st supery cabernet sauvignon on the plane united is clearly putting some special thought into this and deserves a pat on the back but the high point of the little tasting came aboard the american flight when john asked for a half glass of both white wines a simple chardonnay and an even simpler american pinot grigio the quizzical flight attendant asked "together in the same glass " look for our wine notes column in the pursuits section of the weekend journal every saturday we answer questions from readers if you have
