vergangenheitsbewaltigung update berlin the history of german humor the worlds shortest book according to popular prejudice is about to open a new chapter for decades germans steered clear of nazi jokes hitler parodies were strictly off limits so were pranks involving uniforms swastika flags and toothbrush moustaches abroad most germans ducked when the locals confronted them with references to "hogans heroes" or dont mention the war "fawlty towers" sketches but now some of the people whose ancestors brought hitler to power would like to be in on the joke hoping to do what british and american comedians have done for decades in recent years thereve been numerous efforts to add a dose of slapstick to what germans call vergangenheitsbewaltigung or coping with the past laughing about the nazis is a must argues walter moers a cartoonist whose most recent video clip has hitler sitting in the bathtub along with a group of rubber ducks telling him to surrender the clip is a big hit on youtube the hitler in the bathtub motive also features in "my fuhrer the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " a comedy that comes out here next week promotional material says that "for decades hitler has been no laughing matter in germany mein fuhrer will change that " the movie is certain to trigger intense debates on whether its ok for germans to joke about the third reich more interesting though is the related question why they would want to do so in the first place one answer is simple blame the humor industry a branch of business that still isnt as big as mechanical engineering over here but catching up comedy used to be a limited affair in postwar germany a dull combination of staged joke telling and political satire then in the s and s liberalization of the media brought comic relief looking for niches that public television hadnt covered broadcasters such as rtl and sat swamped households with sketch shows stand up routines and late night television a new generation of comedians vied for ratings rambunctious irreverent and politically incorrect the cream of the crop took their cues from britain and the u s talkshow host harald schmidt for one established himself as germanys david letterman cultivating an image as the nations greatest cynic mr schmidt poked fun at a diverse cast of characters from his bosses at sat to obese children to the pope but lately he has lost some of his edge which may explain why he decided to tackle the ultimate taboo on a recent night mr schmidt put on a military coat a cap and a stick on moustache rolling his "rs" adolf style he growled "i must warn young people emphatically against joining right wing parties and i know what im talking about " his fans loved it mr schmidts freewheeling humor speaks to a generation that came of age during the s left leaning critics dubbed them the spassgesellschaft or fun society an apolitical consumer culture that puts hedonism first having witnessed neither the nazi era nor its political repercussions in subsequent decades todays young germans feel quite removed from the genocidal past for better or for worse they are more easygoing than their parents even so nazi jokes are still considered risque in most settings the holocaust thankfully is no laughing matter at all the resurgence of right wing extremists serves as a reminder that nazism cannot be consigned to history books and primetime television little wonder then that the german made nazi comedy is a project that both tempts and intimidates people in the business on the one hand heres a genuine taboo certain to attract attention on the other some of that attention could prove detrimental like objections from holocaust survivors or cheers from far right wingers as a result theres a lot of wavering and wiggling a la "humor is the best weapon against right wing extremism isnt it " and it doesnt always translate into great comedy some years back public television commissioned a farce about joseph goebbels and a fictitious jewish look alike named geduldig the producers spent years fiddling with the script maybe they worked a little too hard when "goebbels and geduldig" finally aired in no one enjoyed it much the critics said it wasnt funny and ulrich muhe the actor who played both characters conceded that the product reflected "how far we can go in germany right now maybe in five years time we can do a full fledged nazi comedy " slightly ahead of his schedule "mein fuhrer" casts mr muhe as the jewish acting coach grunbaum released from the concentration camp to prep a worn out hitler for a final gung ho speech the movie doesnt pull punches hitler mounts eva braun but alas fails to perform goebbels asks grunbaum whether he enjoyed his stay at theresienstadt "our most beautiful camp " a hairdresser mistakenly shaves off half of the famous moustache making the fuhrer livid enough to lose his voice predictably grunbaum fills in and hijacks the speech critics will likely point out that mr schneiders hitler comes across as far too human a psychotic dunce rather than an evil mastermind but does "mein fuhrer" actually work will the germans laugh their heads off when they see their erstwhile leader doing push ups in a silly track suit after shooting was completed mr levy said he still wasnt sure whether "weve really made a comedy well only know when the movie is shown to the people " mr richter is a writer in berlin
