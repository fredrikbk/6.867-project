issues of power prestige doom law firm merger dewey orrick call off plans amid management disputes partners bolted with business new york law firm dewey ballantine llp is best known for its deals practice but this time it wasnt able to pull off a deal of its own merger plans between dewey and another major firm orrick herrington &amp sutcliffe llp founded in san francisco fell apart yesterday amid concerns over money power and prestige at least dewey partners had left in recent months some taking business with them the merger had been heralded as one of the biggest in years and notable given deweys stature and lucrative wall street practice "no one issue led to our decision but in the end we will not be doing the merger " said ralph baxter jr orrick chairman who had aggressively pursued the deal in recent years many law firms have merged to add practice depth quickly and to enter new national and international markets firms are particularly keen on adding lawyers in new york the worlds most lucrative legal market thanks to a steady supply of corporate deal work if the tie up had gone forward other new york firms might have felt pressure to join the merger frenzy that has long gripped firms based in others parts of the country the failure of this merger may make it harder for firms outside new york to find partners there "new york firms tend to think that mergers will only dilute their brands " says peter zeughauser a law firm consultant who wasnt involved in this deal "the dewey orrick situation will provide them with more evidence that they have a right to be skeptical " the failed talks come at a cost for both sides but particularly for dewey with about lawyers and nearly years of history dewey boasts ties to banks with major presences on wall street including credit suisse group and ubs ag recent clients include walt disney co in its &# billion acquisition of pixar animation studios as well as hca inc which was acquired by private equity firms for &# billion in one of the largest ever leveraged buyouts but deweys star had fallen of late making it receptive to a merger overture from orrick while about twice deweys size at about lawyers and with greater global reach orrick is seen by some at dewey as having a less prestigious practice a key factor in the legal business that a merger dewey felt compelled to make has failed raises questions about how robust it can remain as an independent entity said chuck fanning head of partner placement at major lindsey &amp africa llc a national recruiting firm "partners may wonder why should i join now " he says retention may also prove to be an issue morton pierce deweys chairman and a deal maker himself as head of the firms mergers and acquisitions group said "uncertainty is never good for people they like to know where they stand we now no longer have uncertainty we know we are going forward as a stand alone institution " he added that dewey just completed its best year ever increasing its average profit per partner to &# million from &# million and that it remains strong despite the defection of partners since the merger was in discussion the first big setback came when news of the merger talks leaked in september as the firms leadership wrangled over questions of management authority and partners contributions of capital lawyers bolted from dewey taking business that made the deal attractive to orrick in the first place ultimately sapping orricks enthusiasm for a tie up at least partners left dewey including two of its top mergers and acquisitions lawyers and leaders of its bankruptcy and energy practices in october the executive committees of dewey and orrick announced that they had approved the main terms of the merger that would have created one of the largest firms in the country they announced a new name dewey orrick llp and a logo that incorporated a green letter "o" that had been used by orrick messrs baxter and pierce traveled to europe to visit the firms respective offices and hold q&amp a sessions for lawyers but the deal proved to face obstacles both in management conflicts and cultural differences questions over power and money became stumbling blocks dewey and orrick had agreed at the outset that mr baxter would serve as the presiding partner of the combined firm later the two sides differed over whether mr baxter would have sole authority over such key matters as the hiring and firing of office and practice group leaders at one point mr baxter proposed an person management committee comprised of six orrick lawyers and five dewey lawyers a term that the dewey side objected to initially according to two people familiar with the deal mr baxter believed that orrick was financially stronger than dewey and thus should be entitled to greater management authority according to a person familiar with the talks the firms also had difficulty squaring their respective balance sheets and figuring out how the partners at each firm would contribute an equal amount of capital one key sticking point was deweys generous unfunded retirement plan which amounts to about a &# million obligation according to two people familiar with the plan as dewey partners headed for the exits in recent weeks orrick requested that the remaining dewey lawyers shoulder more of the burden for the plan a source of irritation to dewey lawyers according to two people familiar with the deal while declining to discuss the specific reasons the merger failed mr pierce said part of the difficulty was that dewey never had engaged in merger talks before some of his partners he said wrestled with the basic question "is merger the right way to go " the veteran deals lawyer said it is easier to merge manufacturing companies where it is only senior executives negotiating with other senior executives "at service providers like law firms every partner is an owner so it is much more complicated to get buy in on a transaction " as for orrick the failed talks represent a blow to mr baxter who courted dewey on and off for six years with an eye toward landing the firms deals practice and a stronger foothold in new york failed talks are not new for orrick conversations between orrick and the new york firm formerly known as donovan leisure newton &amp irvine broke down in the late s though dozens of donovan leisure lawyers ultimately joined orrick more recently talks broke off between orrick and cooley godward llp of palo alto calif which later merged with a new york firm and with a washington d c firm formerly known as swidler berlin shereff friedman llp that has since merged with another firm orrick has lost few if any partners in response to the merger news but given orricks merger talk track record firms now may be leery of dancing with the firm said mr zeughauser for mr baxter he said "it would have been a huge feather in his cap " ashby jones contributed to this article
