economy &amp politics pelosi sets aggressive pace action on ethics budget rules puts pressure on senate washington as the new democratic controlled congress convened house speaker nancy pelosi moved quickly to tighten her chambers ethics and budget rules putting pressure on the senate to do the same a vote reaffirmed her decision to strike early on the ethics front rather than risk the kind of delays that undermined former speaker dennis hasterts bid to tighten lobbying rules a year ago the aggressive approach establishes what will be an important dynamic between the house and senate in the opening weeks on issues from raising the minimum wage to curbing oil subsidies democrats know they cant make law without the senate but they will use the house to lay down markers on initiatives they see appealing to independents and republican moderates the ethics question is especially time sensitive given the damage republicans suffered in november for appearing too close to lobbyists and the low public standing congress continues to suffer by using the rules process to make immediate changes ms pelosi has assured that her party can show progress in the house whatever happens in the senate as a matter of practical politics any diminishment of the business lobby which did so much to help the republican house majority could make it easier for her to advance her agenda that challenges oil and drug companies among others statutory changes to require better disclosure of lobbying and fund raising activities still lie ahead and they will require negotiation with the senate but the house ethics rules changes adopted last night take effect immediately in many cases and draw a brighter line between lobbyists and lawmakers meals gifts and travel facilitated by lobbyists are largely banned and house members are barred from travel on corporate jets a favorite perk offered by business lobbyists labor unions with fewer planes to offer have long resented this practice because company executives can accompany lawmakers on such flights and thereby gain valuable access speaking of the immediate ban on meals rep louise slaughter d n y the new chair of the house rules committee joked later "we warned the republicans not to go out to dinner " a further round of votes will come today on democratic proposals to tighten antideficit rules and require greater disclosure of narrow legislative amendments designed to benefit special interests and generate campaign funds from lobbyists the sheer number of these so called earmarks exploded under republican rule the house democratic package goes beyond past republican proposals by demanding greater transparency for spending provisions as well as for tariff exemptions and "rifle shot" tax breaks which benefit or fewer beneficiaries under the tax code the new rules would broaden the definition of a spending earmark to include funds for contracts awarded by federal agencies while the restrictions would again apply only to the house the language would bind house negotiators in future talks on even those earmarks generated by the senate there are sure to be tensions when the senate turns to these subjects next week the new senate majority leader harry reid d nev is a frequent user of corporate jets while the chairman of the senate appropriations committee sen robert byrd d w va is famous for his pork barrel appetite senate democrats appear reluctant to be as bold as their house counterparts by trying to change rules unilaterally instead the plan is to move with a hybrid package of rules and legislative changes this strategy is driven ostensibly by democratic fears of a filibuster requiring a two thirds majority to overcome in the case of a rules change critics counter that the filibuster threat is exaggerated given the popular support for some of the rule changes last nights house action in which only one republican voted in opposition could add to the pressure on senators to move fast republicans had the same house senate tensions which often paralyzed the party in its final years in the majority flush with victory democrats are nowhere near such a divide even yesterday house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis and mr byrd announced plans to better align their committees in hopes of approving budget bills on time and preventing disruptions of government operations the state department budget now will be considered in both chambers as part of the foreign aid bill the treasury department and major regulators such as the securities and exchange commission will be dealt with in their own bill as ms pelosi is the first woman speaker her opening day marked both a transition in power and a historic moment for the house women have broken "the marble ceiling " she said and in turning over the gavel republican leader john boehner of ohio said "whether youre a republican a democrat or an independent this is a cause for celebration " "this is the peoples house " mr boehner also said his voice emotional "and most of the people dont care which party controls it what they want is a government that is limited honest accountable and responsive to their needs the moment a majority forgets this lesson it begins writing itself a ticket to minority status " clipping wings under the house democrats proposed ethics package representatives may no longer receive below market rates for travel on corporate aircraft house members with the highest reimbursement tabs for such travel representative reimbursements roy blunt r ohio &# don young r
