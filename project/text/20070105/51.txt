bolstering his military might without hussein many of those gaps will be permanent sparing the former dictators life could have helped scientists discover how exceptional mr hussein was whether there

its own foreign policy so it is relying more and more on allies he cites a litany of hot spots where he believes the u s is outsourcing its responsibilities israel calls the shots when it comes to fighting hezbollah guerillas in lebanon nato has taken over much of the anti taliban fight in afghanistan and ethiopia is fighting islamist troops in somalia while u s soldiers sit next door in djibouti what mr beinart dubs a foreign policy by proxy reminiscent of richard nixons approach toward vietnam and the soviet union isnt working he says some nato allies are refusing to fight in often treacherous southern afghanistan chinas pressure on north korea to drop its nuclear program hasnt yielded results israels rocket attacks on lebanon undermined the crown jewel of president bushs middle east policy the pro democracy lebanese government mr beinart sees all these difficulties as the hidden costs of the iraq war while the strategy is perhaps unavoidable in the short term in the long run

optimists and pessimists has been heating up in recent years but nature correspondent alexandra witze says it still isnt clear that either side has a lock on the truth what divides the two camps isnt whether usable supplies will dry up eventually but when those who predict oil production has peaked or is about to are suspicious about the reserves figures given by individual oil companies and countries princeton university geologist kenneth deffeyes says global output hit its peak in and markets and consumers will feel the effects in about five years but optimists say that as oil prices rise producers will use the money to extract crude from trickier places using this analysis cambridge energy research associates says production wont peak until eventually though what crude remains will be to hard to get "we will still have oil in million years " explains david hughes a geologist "it just wont be recoverable at an energy profit " nature jan we want to hear from you please send
