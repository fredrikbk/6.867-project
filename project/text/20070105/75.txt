sara lee jostles for a breakfast seat sara lee corp hopes its nascent comeback might get a boost from a hearty breakfast the downers grove ill companys jimmy dean brand has long sold one of the most popular breakfast sausages in the u s now as the battle to serve breakfast to american consumers has heated up jimmy dean has introduced two new products breakfast skillets and breakfast bowls that place sara lee more squarely than ever at the breakfast table the products also offer tangible evidence of how the company is striving to rebound under chief executive brenda barnes who has refocused sara lee largely on food and sold other businesses including clothing maker hanes mcdonalds corp burger king holdings inc starbucks corp and other restaurants generated some &# billion from expanded breakfast offerings in the months that ended in august according to market research firm npd group inc their success has prompted a vigorous response from packaged food companies like sara lee and general mills inc to sustain the &# billion market for frozen breakfast food at sara lee jimmy dean executives took particular notice when mcdonalds in introduced the mcgriddle the pancake and sausage sandwich gobbled by thousands each day michael wellner director of marketing for new products at sara lees food and beverages division began scouting restaurants for breakfast ideas that could easily be adapted for the home the goal was to develop a "speed scratch" breakfast something that could be made in tandem with fresh ingredients for a family of four in just minutes mr wellner says he couldnt push the creativity needle too far while americans may devour tapas and sushi for lunch and dinner their breakfast habits are change resistant the first result was skillets a pouch of diced potatoes ham and onions to be dumped in a pan with fresh eggs and cheese jimmy dean executives settled on skillet in part because similar meals are increasingly popular on american restaurants menus the executives also thought the dish would appeal to consumers who arent regular cooks in tests consumers told jimmy dean executives that they prefer the speed scratch approach because they could prepare the breakfast quickly while embellishing it with their own cheeses and eggs "it gave them a sense of freshness that they did it themselves " mr wellner says the company added red and green peppers for coloring and their "appetite appeal " he says jimmy dean next set its sights on a new target young men in september it introduced breakfast bowls which offer full entrees including two with eggs that can be heated in a microwave in less than three minutes in developing breakfast bowls mr wellner stuck with hearty basics like ham sausage potatoes and pancakes he tested nearly a dozen flavors of eggs and omitted any eggs that were too rubbery or soft "is the texture just about right in terms of chewiness " mr wellner recalls asking during tests he eschewed less popular flavors like feta cheese that didnt appeal to at least of consumers he had sara lees sensory experts make sure the smell of entrees cooking in a microwave mimicked the smell of those cooked on a stove sara lee packaging engineers tested rectangular square and circular bowls concluding that consumers preferred thick circular plastic bowls with handles so they could pull the dish out of the microwave without burning their fingers part of these two products appeal lies in some consumers demand for traditional breakfast sara lee executives say "they want a big breakfast they can have sausage eggs potatoes all cut up and they can have it in minutes " says jim ruehlmann vice president of the jimmy dean brand when mcdonalds and burger king intensified their breakfast promotions mr ruehlmann adds "what theyre really doing is elevating the consumer need for a real hot breakfast that happens to be something jimmy dean does extremely well " jimmy dean is now among the top four players in the &# million "frozen other breakfast food" subcategory which includes products such as toaster strudels and french toast sticks but not waffles or bagels according to market research firm information resources inc skillets sold &# million in the year ended oct according to iri breakfast bowls sold about &# million in its first two months those are tiny pieces of sara lees net sales of &# billion for its fiscal first quarter ended sept but executives say they show how the company is following ms barness mandate of turning a company once known mainly for its cheesecakes into a trendsetter "we want to own breakfast " mr ruehlmann says the new offerings have won over consumers like elizabeth julian a year old culinary student standing in the frozen food aisle of a downtown chicago supermarket ms julian scanned the packages of griddle cakes and eggs and bacon strudel she regularly switches between the pancakes and sausage breakfast bowls and aunt jemimas french toast with sausage made by pinnacle foods corp "i dont have time to cook homemade meals in the morning " she says "i just heat this up in the microwave and im done " in recent months sara lee has heavily promoted breakfast bowls with quirky television commercials developed by omnicom group inc s tbwa chiat day ads appeared on such shows as good morning america and the today show as well on the weather channel and cnn one ad shows two something men one dressed as the sun another as a cloud talking in a kitchen about what to eat for breakfast the cloud says he only eats cereal "why wouldnt you want to try something new " asks
