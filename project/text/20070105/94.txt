vws hour workweek goes kaputt in wolfsburg wolfsburg germany time moves slowly in the town hitler built to churn out his "peoples car " the giant volkswagen ag factory here still bears the shrapnel scars from world war ii bombs and still makes small cars but now it takes the company twice as many hours as its competitors to build them roughly hours for one compact at the same time volkswagen workers like ronald wachendorf a year old mechanic have enjoyed the shortest work week in the global auto industry hours pulling down a full weeks pay while working a day less than the hour norm at general motors corp and even less than the hour standard at other german car makers the extra time off from work has given mr wachendorf ample time for simple pleasures taking his year old daughter to soccer practice playing chess with her after school reading books about his diverse interests philosophy henry ford and the development of the german railroad but now mr wachendorf is having to adjust to a more hectic schedule at least by volkswagen standards in september mr wachendorfs union agreed to extend working hours at the companys german plants by more than four hours a week to hours after the auto maker threatened to shift production outside the country volkswagen wont pay the workers extra to compensate for their longer schedule on an hourly basis the workers wages will fall more than "we all knew something like this would come " says mr wachendorf "the general mood among my colleagues is not good " the change under way at volkswagen reflects a broader trend in europes largest economy with unemployment running around companies have more leverage to demand sacrifices of workers increasingly businesses are pressuring employees to work longer for the same amount of money and threatening to shift production abroad in a country that is home to the worlds best paid auto workers volkswagen goes even further paying &# an hour compared with the national average of &# and the u s standard of &# because of its reluctance to cut jobs volkswagen employs thousands of workers to make seat covers exhaust systems and steering gears work most auto makers outsource with low cost asian rivals making inroads in europe volkswagen is having to implement painful cost cuts over the next three years the company is trying to shed up to jobs mostly in germany and mostly assembling cars by offering large severance packages to encourage workers to leave despite that the companys shift to longer hours remains hard to swallow "it is a pity for family life " says sandra north a mother of two whose boyfriend works for volkswagen she works in one of the companys cafeterias ms north says short work schedules allow more time for family activities such as taking the children for pony rides at a stable near their home yet ms north says she also understands why her employer can no longer afford to be so generous "if you look at other companies around they have always worked much more to hours " she says volkswagen isnt like most companies its second biggest shareholder is its home state of lower saxony which has an interest in protecting jobs more than half the seats on the companys board belong to german politicians and labor representatives in keeping with a german law that requires big corporations to give workers a voice in governance within germany few towns depend as much on volkswagen as wolfsburg a community of surrounded by farmland the red brick volkswagen complex here covers an area the size of monaco and accounts for more than half the towns jobs local streets carry the names of former volkswagen executives yet sympathy for volkswagen workers runs only so deep at the tunnelschanke a popular vw watering hole decorated with little plastic vw beetles bartender carmen stumpf shrugs as she listens to workers grouse about their new schedule "they dont see their situation in relation to others " says ms stumpf wolfsburgs mayor rolf schnellecke agrees "it was not a very just situation" that volkswagen employees "worked four days a week and still wound up getting more money" than "normal people" in the town mr schnellecke says volkswagens short work week began in rather than cut surplus jobs during an economic downturn the company shaved its work week by roughly which if it didnt trim wages and benefits at least cut down on the cost of building cars no one wanted to buy the change wasnt easy for some ms norths boyfriend thomas jung a year old vw factory worker says he initially hung out in bars and played videogames "i preferred going to work one feels superfluous when one is needed less " he says gradually though he began going to a gym three or four times a week and took vacations in spain portugal or the dominican republic "at least once a year for two weeks " after he and ms north began living together he assumed other duties buying groceries for the weekend picking up her children from school on his day off making them lunch and helping them with their homework "i really enjoy spending time and playing with the children " mr jung says the good times stopped rolling in after disappointing sales of the companys flagship golf model dropped the wolfsburg plant into the red last june the head of the companys core vw brand addressed thousands of wolfsburg factory workers the company he said could no longer afford to pay them such high wages for such short schedules after months of negotiations volkswagens german labor representatives agreed to extend working hours to a week but not without extracting a promise from volkswagen management to continue building the golf in wolfsburg the deal means thousands of vw workers are again having to adjust their schedules mr jung is cutting back his gym visits and ms north has hired a baby sitter for an extra day since mr jung cant pick up the children from school on fridays now but the most dramatic ripple effects are outside germany to boost wolfsburgs productivity volkswagen plans to shift some golf production there from a factory near brussels a move that has outraged belgiums government and which is expected to result in numerous job losses there a volkswagen spokesman says the company "is aware of its responsibility for" the workers in brussels and "will develop a socially responsible settlement " the auto maker has proposed building a new audi model at the brussels plant a step that could significantly mitigate the number of job losses there mr wachendorf the mechanic puts matters more bluntly "thats part of the contract that vw managers supply more golfs for us " he says "its their problem where they get the cars from " nice werk volkswagen workers in germany make &# an hour higher than other auto industry employees
