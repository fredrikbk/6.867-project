four pollyannas of the apocalypse in response to "a world free of nuclear weapons" by george p shultz william j perry henry a kissinger and sam nunn editorial page jan i am not a statesman like the four authors yet i am compelled to express my shock at their pollyanish ness and downright naivete actually the only surprise to me is george p shultz he worked for and with ronald reagan as secretary of state and he should understand the necessity of "peace through strength" at least as much as he understands the word "kumbaya " a key flaw in the argument for nuclear disarmament is that the islamic fascist terrorists cannot be deterred by force or threat of force the authors suffer from the conventional wisdom that these terrorists and their leaders seek glory in death in actuality only a relative few seek such martyrdom and none of the "leadership" of al qaeda etc has eagerly embraced death just as there were "kamikazes" from japan the whole nation was not comprised of suicidal maniacs and the leadership of japan was not suicidal either in addition the essy is an example of bipartisan weakness in the face of terrorists who openly seek nuclear weapons capability and are likely to have it now or at the very least have very soon as nuclear weapons technology has become and is becoming more commoditized the ability of the united states and other nations of "goodwill" to keep the nuclear genie in the bottle has evaporated the nuclear genie is out of the bottle and she will never go back in now is not the time to argue that responsible nations give up their weapons in the face of terrorists gaining nuclear capability through people like a q khan russia north korea or whomever maintaining and enhancing our own nuclear capability while accelerating our capabilities to defend against such weaponry should be our goal since eliminating these horrible weapons is never going to happen unless or until they are made obsolete by the next step in weaponry the article by these statesmen argues for more "agreements" to eliminate nuclear weapons it is exactly the wrong message to terrorists at the worst possible time the message to terrorists should be "continue your aggression and your death and the death of your movement is assured " john l sorg mccordsville ind
