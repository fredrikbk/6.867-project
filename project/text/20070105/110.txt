weekend journal the hollywood report golden globes curse awards boost movies but winning tv shows often see ratings slide the films that win big at this months golden globe awards can expect to get both a bump at the box office and front runner status in the race for hollywoods real marketing gold the oscars the top winning tv programs can expect well not much the television industry will spend millions this year to woo the tiny pool of golden globe voters and trumpet any wins with on air promotions print ads and mentions on entertainment web sites the goal of the networks is to create a splash that strokes the egos of actors and producers adds cachet to their brand and most important bolsters the audience for the winning shows but an unscientific look at the past years of tv winners at the golden globes in the best drama best comedy and best actor and actress categories indicates the award almost never delivers a lasting ratings pop in fact many tv shows decline in ratings after winning last years best drama winner "lost " is down so far this season and in the case of actor and actress categories the group that bestows the globes the hollywood foreign press association a somewhat eccentric group of about writers mostly free lancers seems to be out of synch with tv audiences exhibit a is geena davis the "commander in chief" star took home the best actress drama award last year even as viewers were fleeing her woman as president show in swarms abc fled three months later canceling the series jason bateman won for "arrested development" in and fox dumped the show the following season while sela ward won for "once and again" in she was luckier abc kept her drama for a year before canceling it best comedy and best drama awards dont seem to deliver much commercial juice either "desperate housewives " the winner for best comedy the past two years has been in a ratings decline albeit a small one "the west wing" didnt get much of a bump out of its win for best drama while the sitcoms "cybill" and "third rock from the sun" both rode their s comedy wins to ratings oblivion "winning doesnt mean a damn thing when it comes to ratings " says fred silverman a former top executive at each of the big three networks the hollywood foreign press association says ratings jumps arent its goal with the golden globes "were not overly concerned with rewarding commercial success or creating it " says jenny cooney carrillo co chair of the organizations tv committee of course winning a trophy isnt always an omen of trouble over the years the golden globes seem to have helped a few series "ally mcbeal" struggled until its win in ratings for the drama rose for the episode that aired the night after the ceremony tiny cable shows also can benefit just from being mentioned on the awards show which is viewed by about million people though that audience is down from about million in the late s its still large especially compared with some of the shows up for an award hbos polygamist series "big love " up for the best drama award this year attracts an average audience of seven million viewers per episode yet its noteworthy that the globes have a spotty track record when it comes to boosting tv shows given the reputation they have for juicing movie ticket sales why the different outcome its due mainly to timing because the awards are presented just as academy members are casting their oscar ballots the globes are thought to influence voting statistics seem to support the theory over the past two decades the golden globes best picture drama has accurately predicted the oscar winner of the time in contrast the tv industrys version of the oscars the emmy awards dont follow for another eight months by that time the globe winners have faded from hollywoods short memory mr silverman says the globes once were regarded by many in the industry as a joke the small number of voters often from obscure publications and the groups willingness to accept extravagant gifts from studios and stars punctured the legitimacy of the awards but the year old ceremony has boosted its influence since nbc started airing it in and the group cracked down on freebies ms cooney carrillo says the tv awards her group of foreign journalists hand out may appear off kilter to u s viewers because the voters are influenced by how shows play overseas she notes that winning programs such as "desperate housewives" and "lost" became immediate foreign hits the journalist voters can also be a bit star struck says tom oneil editor of gold derby an awards blog recently acquired by tribune co "the voters pay no attention to ratings but instead try to reward superstars that are known to their readers back in cairo and buenos aires " he says "that helps explain a geena davis " still tv executives say the globes have a major impact on the business even if its not immediately noticeable on ratings or the bottom line premium cable channels hbo and showtime in particular see the awards as critical to their marketing efforts the awards can help sell dvds of shows and signal a commitment to quality thats important to hollywoods creative community says richard licata an executive vice president at showtime and awards strategist he points to mary louise parkers win for best actress comedy last year for her role as a drug dealing mom on showtimes obscure "weeds " the win "may not have been a guarantee of more viewers " mr licata says "but it instantly made the show important in the eyes of the industry " so what shows are the front runners this year ballots arent due until next week but one program with buzz is "ugly betty " the abc series about an unattractive but smart assistant at a fashion magazine is translated from a colombian soap opera that has been a big hit around the world "ugly betty" also dovetails with the quirky tastes of globe voters and fits another characteristic of winners the shows ratings while still strong have dropped about since its debut in october gold rush heres a look at five tv shows with multiple nominations for the golden globe awards nbc will broadcast the ceremony jan show network # of nominations greys anatomy abc race to watch best drama comments nominees "lost" and "" have won in this category before so most globe watchers see this as a race between the highly rated "greys anatomy" and "heroes " nbcs quirky and fast rising series about ordinary people with special powers show network # of nominations weeds showtime race to watch supporting actress actor comments globe voters helped put this comedy on the map last year when they gave mary louise parker cover image the best actress trophy for her portrayal of a drug dealing mom voters may want to gloat by giving the show another prize insiders say but competition is likely too stiff in the bigger categories show network # of nominations desperate housewives abc race to watch best actress comments the best actress trophy is likely to go to america ferarra for her plucky and pudgy assistant in "ugly betty " a win in this category by one of the two "desperate housewives" nominated would be an upset and help end industry sniping that the quality of the series has diminished show network # of nominations elizabeth i hbo race to watch best actress miniseries comments helen mirren has a good chance of winning but hbo doesnt rely on trophies for its awards buzz it trumps the globes by holding a must attend party for hollywoods elite a few days before the ceremony at the fabled chateau marmont hotel show network # of nominations prime suspect pbs race to watch best miniseries comments the final installment of pbss acclaimed crime series is the favorite here but globe voters may turn up
