boss talk how jim skinner flipped mcdonalds big chains ceo focused on getting better not bigger we have to provide choices four years ago jim skinner huddled with a handful of other mcdonalds corp executives to tackle a big problem the company by most measures was doing terribly mr skinner had just been named vice chairman and was part of a new management team charged with helping reverse the companys sliding profit three days later the group emerged with a new strategy named plan to win instead of continuing to build lots of restaurants the company would focus on improving existing locations the goals faster friendlier service tastier food more appealing ambience better value and sharper marketing sticking to that strategy has helped usher in one of the most successful streaks in mcdonalds year history and guided it through some tough times mr skinner moved up to the chief executive spot in after ceo jim cantalupo died and his successor as ceo charlie bell relinquished his post to fight what proved a losing battle against cancer mcdonalds has endured a deluge of negative publicity thanks to movies like "super size me" and books like "fast food nation" that criticize the quality of its food and blame it for the nations obesity epidemic despite that mcdonalds stock has climbed about since mr skinner took over two years ago and same store sales and profit have risen steadily today million customers walk through mcdonalds doors each day four million more per day than years ago mr skinners first job at mcdonalds was as a crew person at a davenport iowa location when he was years old he spent almost a decade in the u s navy then returned to mcdonalds as a restaurant manager trainee in illinois he never graduated from college after eating a hamburger and french fries at the companys oak brook ill headquarters recently year old mr skinner touched on topics ranging from trans fat to spotting and grooming executive talent excerpts wsj why is it so important to you to be better and not bigger mr skinner because we proved that we were getting bigger but not better and we have to be better your experience today at mcdonalds has to be a better experience than it was yesterday people have limited time today they dont want to get up and go "gee i dont know do i think i can go to mcdonalds " wsj youve credited the plan to win with turning around the company how did you come up with it mr skinner basically we sat in this room and talked about how the growth story is problematic we had contributed &# billion or &# billion to capital expenditures and building new stores over four years and yet we didnt have any corresponding incremental operating income growth so we decided to focus on our existing restaurants those of us that were hard core restaurant people which i was at the time were saying "look weve got to do a better job of delivering what we called quality service and cleanliness on a daily basis in our restaurants " and value because value propositions very important wsj youve made it a priority to put a big emphasis on health and nutrition both in the menu and in the marketing is that message compatible with burgers and french fries and milkshakes mr skinner what i put an emphasis on is what we call balanced active lifestyles when you look at the kinds of choices weve provided weve done more work here than probably any other restaurant company in trying to be part of the solution we are not going to solve the worlds obesity problem but what we can do is be productive and be part of the solution we are not prescribing what people should eat i dont say to you "get up in the morning and if you dont eat apple slices youre going to have a problem " we have to provide choices so that you say "i can go there because theres a choice that makes me feel good " but we have to remember who we are we were a hamburger company thats the way we started wsj why has it been so difficult for you to take the trans fats out of food when other companies have done it mr skinner first you always have to remember the scale were big it takes awhile to be able to implement and execute any change at mcdonalds no we want to do it the right way we dont want to have a knee jerk reaction this is what happened in the united states division decided they had the problem solved and made an announcement and yet our testing from our customers indicated the taste wasnt right it wasnt ready and so we couldnt execute and i think to our benefit we didnt pull the trigger on something that wasnt going to give us the best opportunity to give our customers the best tasting french fry as well as the benefits of a reduced trans fat oil wsj is it the french fry thats the biggest problem mr skinner we have reduced trans fat in the other products but to get to zero there are all those considerations what kind of oil is it how much oil is there our suppliers have to be on board if you change one oil to get to zero trans fat and you end up with higher saturated fats or an oil thats not compatible and you dont get the right tasting french fry then thats a problem wsj do you anticipate youll have a total u s oil changeover by the time the new york city trans fat ban goes into effect in july or might you have to use a different oil in that market to comply mr skinner we will be using the oil in that market that we expect to use throughout the system wsj youve become more vocal against the critics that blame the company for obesity why have you decided to take a sharp stance against them mr skinner i dont know that ive taken a sharp stance against the critics we love the passion of people who want us to serve food that we feel has those characteristics that everybody wants when theyre eating but most of the time what they say is not factual relative to the quality of our food the very high standards we have around our food safety yet since were the lead dog were the ones that people point to i just dont think its fair wsj do you see mcdonalds ever selling organic food mr skinner its possible we look at everything if we had the kind of demand for organic food that is perceived to be healthier well be all over it we are customer driven we measure everything we test everything we are talking to our customers every day in those restaurants that are buying those french fries and measuring not only the impact of how they feel about the taste but the intent to purchase those french fries again wsj has starbucks changed the restaurant environment mr skinner i think that they certainly have brought to peoples attention the great opportunity for coffee but if you really look at the impact on the restaurant business i dont know i could say theyve had an impact wsj are they a company that you watch very closely mr skinner we watch all companies very closely starbucks is a company that were watching because we could argue that its a very successful company theyve done a lot of great things but theyve done a lot of the things that we did took a great concept and replicated it wsj you took over the helm of a company that had lost two ceos in succession very suddenly what was that like mr skinner it was very very emotional for me because not only did we lose two great leaders but i lost two great friends it was also traumatic for the organization so the need for stability in the organization was very important the board deserves credit because the road map was managed by them wsj how has the company managed to stay on track given the unexpected loss of management mr skinner one of my goals has been to do a better job of selecting the high potential people who can accelerate our momentum wsj how do you do that mr skinner some of its structural and some of it is by gut we created a leadership institute in the last months which really houses the spirit of everything were trying to get done around development of our people we assess our talent twice a year i ask all my senior people to do hours of personal development annually including myself i ask all the senior people to have two ready now candidates to succeed them every time i meet with them we talk about what are you doing to develop them we might even have a debate about the two they picked wsj whats the biggest remaining challenge mcdonalds faces mr skinner i worry about complacency were not satisfied we have a lot of work to do wsj how often do you eat at mcdonalds mr skinner almost every day wsj i know that you like the quarter pounder mr skinner quarter pounder plain no cheese no condiments just the bun and the meat  tips from jim skinner for managing a turnaround  focus on people leadership development and succession planning face the facts listen to your customers because they will tell you what really matters have a plan of action stick with it align your team around it and focus on execution have the discipline to pursue continuous improvement be passionate and committed to your business all the way in or all the way out
