ipod envy microsofts xbox whiz drives strategic shift bach pushes hardware tied to online services cellphone battle looms robbie bach is the microsoft corp executive who challenged bill gatess dogma by pushing the software company into making videogame machines now hes putting his stamp on microsoft far beyond its game business for decades microsofts business strategy centered around making its software a universal platform for other companies products everything from cellphones to big server computers could run windows microsoft would leave the risky business of making hardware to others mr bach years old bucked that model to make the xbox the videogame machine has all the traits microsoft used to shun its manufactured by the company its function is narrow and it doesnt use windows it was also a success and helped mr bach win a promotion as one of microsofts three co presidents in charge of pushing the company deeper into consumer electronics and managing its relationship with hollywood mr bachs latest creature is zune a digital music player that competes with apple computer inc s ipod over the past year he has also taken responsibility for cellphone software and the person group that creates the software behind media center pcs the company is pitching these machines which are manufactured by pc makers as hubs that manage music video and other home entertainment the industry will get a glimpse of mr bachs new prominence at the consumer electronics show an annual las vegas event that kicks off this weekend he is expected to join mr gates on stage as the microsoft chairman delivers a keynote address on the companys plans in consumer electronics there mr bach is set to lay out a strategy of "connected entertainment" discussed in a three page memo he sent last month to mr gates and chief executive steve ballmer the memo called for more integration with other microsoft units and outside partners such as hollywood studios mr bach will likely demonstrate some of the early work in las vegas including a service for renting movies online via the xbox mr gates praises mr bachs group as "a source of a lot of thinking" about how microsoft should plan products "theres definitely a lot of best practices a number of which came out of xbox " says mr gates who is gradually stepping away from his role at microsoft to focus on philanthropy challenges are rife many others including cable tv phone and media companies are trying to capture the market for online video and other new media also because of the cost of manufacturing the xbox mr bachs division continues to lose money and as mr bach tries to work more closely with other parts of the microsoft empire he risks departing from the simplicity that lies behind products such as zune and xbox "its a big idea " he says of connected entertainment "big ideas are tough to bring to fruition " he also says one of his goals is "to redevelop and reform our culture" at the person entertainment and devices division he has brought in senior managers from sony pictures entertainment and sega corp as well as promoting internally "we have in our division a lot of what i call old school microsoft folks " he says years ago mr gates started directing microsofts moves into the consumer market typically microsoft followed the approach that was so successful in personal computers build the basic operating system software and license it to hardware makers the strategy left the risk of manufacturing to others microsoft also encouraged other companies to build software that worked on top of its operating system in pcs the result was a virtuous cycle of new software pushing new pc sales which in turn encouraged more new software to be developed the pc turned into a great general purpose tool running spreadsheets games and everything in between microsoft whose software runs on most pcs was the biggest beneficiary as software became a big component of consumer electronics such as cellphones and tv sets microsoft originally assumed its model would continue to apply it would make the software at the heart of the machine and other companies would do the rest including supplying the services that tie the package together but apples ipod proved otherwise apple not only makes the hardware and software but also runs the online service itunes through which consumers can buy new songs to play on their ipods the runaway success of the ipod vindicated apple chief executive steve jobss philosophy of "making the whole widget " apple had enjoyed less success in the s when the macintosh computer with both hardware and software made by apple lost the dominant market share to pcs running microsoft windows an year veteran of microsoft mr bach was originally steeped in the pc world he came to the company with an mba from stanford and made his name early as one of the marketing specialists who combined microsofts word processor spreadsheet and other programs into its office product helping spread the now ubiquitous software suite in when microsoft decided to get into videogames messrs ballmer and gates tapped mr bach to lead the effort at first his team tried the usual tack asking computer makers to build a game machine running microsoft software but the approach foundered because the economics of game machines are different from computers machine makers such as sony corp sell the hardware at a loss expecting to make it up on licensing fees from software makers mr bachs team persuaded top management that microsoft had to follow the same model building its own console through contract manufacturers the xbox required billions of dollars in investment but over time mr bach established the machine as a viable competitor to sonys playstation still mr bach and his team continued to face the microsoft urge to broaden the xbox into a pc like platform for multiple uses while designing the second generation xbox the xbox his team experimented with a machine that ran windows in late mr bach on the plane back from a golf trip to mexico drafted a paper listing six priorities for the xbox the first was to get exclusive games for the machine according to a copy reviewed by the wall street journal the last was to incorporate other microsoft units into xbox plans mr bachs team worked to knock down proposals that could have diverted the machines focus j allard a key architect of the xbox killed an idea to have it double as a set top box for cable television subscribers "the genius in consumer products that really work is deciding what not to do " said mr allard in a interview as microsoft wrapped up work on the xbox in it went on sale at the end of that year the companys attention turned to digital music players the ipod introduced in was a perfect example of what microsofts old culture resisted a narrow use device that couldnt do email connect to a wireless network or handle a range of other tasks it simply downloaded and played music by apple seized a commanding market share in digital music players and microsoft was struggling in the area the company had followed its traditional approach with its windows group licensing music player software to a multitude of companies these companies fielded dozens of music players none of which worked well with an equally broad array of online music services at a retreat in march microsoft executives reviewed apples music strategy and heard mr bach and his team explain their similar apple like approach for the xbox within weeks mr ballmer assigned mr bach to devise a new strategy for music as well soon mr allard and bryan lee another bach lieutenant wrote a six page paper calling for microsoft to build an "end to end" music player code named argo mr gates asked mr bachs team to explore whether microsoft could design an easy to use device like the ipod but still license the design to multiple makers "can you have your cake and eat it too " mr bach says of the exchange "technically it turns out its hard " the team reached a compromise follow both models last nov microsoft introduced the zune the device built with toshiba corp has its own online music store zune marketplace to distinguish it from the ipod microsoft included a fm tuner and created a way to trade songs wirelessly with other zune users the device has been an underwhelming seller but backed by microsoft investment it remains a threat to chip away at the ipods dominance "this is a project thats going to be here for a long time " mr bach says the company plans to continue updating the zunes style and features he says meanwhile microsoft continues to supply software to makers of ipod competitors mr bachs power keeps growing in the past year he has absorbed the group that makes games for pcs and taken charge of the hollywood relationship making the rounds of top studio executives to ensure they see microsoft as a good partner for video distribution he also took over the group responsible for the media center pc software that microsoft licenses to pc makers that group was previously part of the windows division and windows executives resisted the move according to people familiar with the situation mr ballmer made the ruling that the group would move says a person involved in the decision now with all of microsofts key entertainment groups reporting to him mr bach says his mission is to devise ways for them to work together without creating an unwieldy mix of technologies examples might include easier ways to use an xbox or future zune player to watch online videos or a mobile phone to access wirelessly music stored on a pc say microsoft insiders at a five hour annual strategy meeting on dec mr gates pushed mr bachs team to speed up its connected entertainment plans mr bachs lieutenants say "they want us to move as quickly as we possibly can " mr bach says "apple has a lot of market share we need to move quickly our share in the cellphone space is improving and growing but we need to move quicker there even in videogames theres still plenty of unfinished business there " the new push requires a better relationship with content makers for years studios and record labels were suspicious of microsofts intentions because they feared microsoft would use its software to control how their content was distributed in one sign of progress cbs corp viacom inc s mtv networks and paramount studios and time warner inc s warner brothers said in november they will provide movies and television shows for rent over xbox live an online service microsofts rivals are courting the same companies apple is working on a device called itv for using a tv to access movies and other digital content stored on a pc the battle could soon move to cellphones at its macworld show in san francisco next week apple is expected to unveil a consumer oriented cellphone that merges the ipod with phone service apple is expected to build the phone and software itself following its tried and true model for the mac and ipod some industry executives expect it may even resell wireless service tied to the phone that could force mr bach to rethink plans at his cellular unit which currently supplies mobile phone software to a host of phone makers but doesnt make its own device in a recent interview mr gates expressed confidence in microsofts current strategy saying that its the best way to have a "broad impact" on the phone business still "it will be interesting to see what they do in phones " he said of apple big gamer robbie bach is the executive behind microsofts new portable media player zune and its xbox videogame systems year launched and total units sold xbox million through sept xbox million through dec zune launched nov
