weekend journal taste de gustibus reviving judaism consultant speak goes religious a few weeks ago hillary clinton got started on a new "listening tour " her first one during the senate campaign was aimed at soliciting the ideas of new york voters on what legislative issues were important to them this one is aimed at hearing the thoughts of democratic strategists on the subject of her presidential run but the idea behind the tours remained the same find out what the people want and if possible give it to them in politics such an approach has an irrefutable democratic logic but is it well suited to religion arnold eisen the chancellor elect of the jewish theological seminary has spent the past few months on a "listening tour" of his own holding town hall meetings around the country to figure out how to reinvigorate conservative judaism mr eisen is looking to find out what jews want and if possible give it to them trying to make judaism more popular is not a new idea jewish leaders have worried for decades that high rates of intermarriage and assimilation are causing the jewish population to diminish dramatically and they are right between and the american jewish population declined to million from million with jewish women getting married later in life and having fewer children this trend is likely only to accelerate but the most recent response to this crisis has been less than inspiring the jewish week recently published " seriously cool ideas to remake new yorks jewish community " these included creating a jewish culinary institute building a kibbutz in the big apple providing high quality jewish toddler care hosting a hipper israeli independence day parade and baking better kosher pizza perhaps these ideas were meant to be a little tongue in cheek but other ideas are not and probably should be take a new project called synaplex sponsored by the star foundation synaplex is according to its web site "designed to provide people with new reasons to make the synagogue the place to be on shabbat " about synagogues are already "enabling people to celebrate shabbat the way they want to " what does that mean instead of attending a traditional service rabbi hayim herring stars executive director tells me some people would do "medi torah" or "torah and yoga " others might attend a lecture or go to a musical service followed by a "latte cart " and still others might prefer to attend a friday night wine and cheese reception rabbi herring says that some of the participating synagogues double or triple their attendance on the day of a "synaplex" shabbat but its not clear whether such one day surges result in long term membership gains religious groups that have grown the fastest in recent years including orthodox judaism are the ones that demand the most of their adherents not the ones that offer religion and refreshments cafeteria style rabbi herring acknowledges this trend when i mention it to him but he is not sure that it applies to the people he is trying to serve he believes that "one failure of some of the jewish movements is bludgeoning people with the notion of mitzvah commandments as opposed to taking people where they are and being patient enough to not impose their own vision of spirituality " as it happens the samuel bronfman foundation whose mission is "to inspire a renaissance of jewish life " gives money to the synaplex project adam bronfman the foundations managing director tells me that "each individual accesses meaning differently " he himself was "born a jew and decided to live a jewish life " he says and he wants "others to access that if thats what they choose " this way of thinking is making its way onto college campuses too where jewish leaders hope to persuade students to remain jews and not drift into the surrounding secular culture wayne firestone the president of hillel the foundation for campus jewish life says that the "millennials " the members of todays college generation have "many different options" on campus their identity is "similar to a windows operating system " with many programs running at once the jewish "program " in other words has lots of competition after extensive surveys hillel has concluded that many unaffiliated jews in mr firestones words "dont feel welcome" by the jewish offerings on campus i was surprised by this claim having always thought that college was probably the easiest place to practice judaism at big universities particularly services of all types are easily accessible kosher food is not hard to come by religious celebrations abound but if the surveys are correct some jewish students are still feeling left out the problem according to mr bronfman whose foundation also gives to hillel can be thought of in terms of ice cream "some people want rocky road and some people want vanilla and some want strawberry but hillel was only able to provide one aspect one flavor " so hillel is expanding hoping to double the number of students involved in campus jewish life it is offering community service trips with torah studies hosting its activities in non hillel buildings even reaching out to american jews studying abroad there is nothing wrong with these ideas or anything else in hillels "five year strategic plan " and they may result in greater numbers of students taking jewish ideas and culture seriously indeed the other outreach efforts however tacky or trivial may also strengthen jewish life in america still there is something strange about all this consultant speak listening tours marketing gambits and strategic plans may be an inescapable part of modern life even in the realm of religion but in the end for a particular faith to thrive god cant just be for dessert
