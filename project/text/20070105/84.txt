the daily fix after years with steelers cowher heads to bleachers bill cowher whose pittsburgh steelers won the super bowl last february is expected to resign today after years of coaching in pittsburgh for the rooney family a clan unique in todays nfl for their loyalty to head coaches but also somewhat stingy mr cowher won games and two afc titles and went to the playoffs times winning at least one game in each of the last eight trips but the steelers failed to reach the postseason this year and after the season it appears the year old native of a pittsburgh native has coached his last game in a black and gold jacket "it was a perfect match and those dont come around often either in life or in sports " msnbcs mike celizic writes of the steelers and mr cowher "and no matter what chaos was taking place elsewhere in the league you could always look to pittsburgh the rooneys and cowher and feel that there was one place where everything was right where time stood still where you could always be certain about who would be running the team next year it was like a great college coach at the professional level what joe paterno was to penn state cowher was to pittsburgh " in a column last february after the super bowl victory sports illustrated writer and long time cowher fan mike silver provided some foreshadowing for todays news mr cowher was enjoying watching his three daughters play basketball and calming down his wife kaye who tends to berate refs and shout instructions from the bleachers as her husband does from the sidelines thats something hell get to do a lot more of if he really does take the oft proverbial time off to spend time with his family mr silver also shared a comment mr cowher made before the afc championship game "to me the most important thing is to be good every year to field a team that remains competitive and keeps taking its shots if you told me i could win a super bowl but then the team would go into a sharp decline i wouldnt take that bargain going after it year after year thats what its all about " that scenario is whats happened to steelers mr silver in a column today lists that as one of eight reasons why the coach is stepping away "this team will have to revamp to compete for another title like tampa bay in the steelers were so drained after years of trying to reach the top they didnt have another run in them " another reason he offers is money the rooneys loyalty is great before a coach has proven himself but their stinginess stings once he has thats a theme picked up by pittsburgh tribune review columnist john harris "the only way cowher would return for a th season was if the rooneys prevented him from leaving town until offering him a new and improved contract " he writes "you dont allow the man you say you want to be your coach to get away unless youre already thinking about him in the past tense the steelers were finalizing interviews for cowhers replacement before cowher returned for todays p m news conference " and whom might mr cowher replace if a month or two of family time suffices instead of a year art shell if san jose mercury news columnist mark purdy has his way mr shell was canned by oakland raiders owner al davis after a season mr purdy realizes thats a fantastical scenario "cowher would demand too much power davis will relinquish none davis is the teams proprietor he has that right but when customers are asked to continually consume the proprietors lousy product year after year sooner or later they will become ex customers and if there are enough ex customers the raiders will almost certainly be gone from oakland after their mcafee coliseum lease expires in thats why this coaching hire is so crucial the teams homeland status is at stake " if mr davis doesnt change his ways there are a few stumbling blocks for the next raiders coach ray ratto writes in the san francisco chronicle "the only things standing between the raider next coach and glory are compensation control and independence and of course no ambitious aggressive careerist coach would want any of that right " though its not yet official the new york yankees have returned randy johnson to the arizona diamondbacks for reliever luis vizcaino and three prospects that marks the end of a failed plan formulated two offseasons ago to return the bronx bombers to the world series in the last two years the yankees have won just three games in two first round defeats with the big unit contributing none of those wins "two years ago they went for the big name and two hot young free agents " carl pavano and jaret wright dan graziano writes in the newark star ledger "this year gm brian cashman is thinking about sure bets and beefing up the farm system it may not result in a world series title though it may but long term its a much better way to build a winner " the move opens the door for a return to the yankees by roger clemens the oft retiring and unretiring future hall of famer whom new york daily news columnist mike lupica calls "the nick saban of baseball pitchers " australia has swept england in all five ashes cricket matches two years after england won the series in dramatic fashion the sweep wasnt as close as the score indicates "age had not wearied the australians " peter roebuck writes in the sydney morning herald indeed it rekindled their desire "champions hate to leave the stage on a sour note moreover australia had several astonishing cricketers at their disposal including a legendary spinner a pinpoint paceman and a dashing gloveman none was accustomed to losing not to anyone let alone england everyone knew that the side was bound to break up soon but there was enough time left for one last memorable campaign and so the great men set a trap that only their opponents did not spot " the great men together formed a superteam simon barnes writes in the times of london "they set out to destroy their opponents and in doing so have reached an almost absurd degree of superiority over a damn good cricket team " mr barnes writes "they have demonstrated beyond all refutation that a damn good team is one thing a superteam quite another " a superteam can gather its unbeatable aura at any level of play for any duration of time mr barnes himself once played on a superteam at a pickup soccer game in on lamma island just beyond hong kong "you took turns " mr barnes recalls "once on you stayed out there until you conceded a goal it worked because even the best teams got tired in degrees and per cent humidity but one long afternoon gwailoong my team could not be budged we scored goal after goal and team after team trooped off we saved goals and team after team gnashed their teeth in frustration after a couple of hours the top players on the island formed an ad hoc team simply to restore order and kick us off the pitch " yet even this collection of supermen couldnt dislodge the superteam found a good column from the world of sports dont
