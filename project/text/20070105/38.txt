for at&amp t ad sales success is no cinch start up barriers loom even as telecom titan touts its three screens having emerged as the biggest telecom player in terms of both revenue and subscribers by buying bellsouth at&amp t is now setting its sights on becoming a major force in ad sales but to succeed at&amp t needs to overcome daunting challenges that run from intensifying competition in the ad world to its lack of experience in media the company said earlier this week days after completing the &# billion purchase of bellsouth that it wants to make advertising a key revenue stream generating several billion dollars a year in the next five years taking a more aggressive approach than rival verizon communications at&amp t plans to start selling ads on its fledgling television service and its internet service early this year cellphone ads will come later at&amp t says it has an edge over other media companies because of its ability to offer advertisers space on "three screens" computers tvs and mobile phones still it faces plenty of hurdles for one thing its tv service which serves only a few thousand customers in the markets in which its currently available doesnt yet have the critical mass that advertisers look for in contrast at&amp ts cellphone service has million customers and the company serves million high speed internet subscribers at&amp t executives say they dont expect ad sales to gain momentum until next year at the earliest more important at&amp t will have to learn a new culture its no easy task for phone companies used to operating in a highly regulated environment to jump into the media world attempts by phone companies in the early s to offer tv services went nowhere at&amp t executives acknowledge the learning curve "we have never aired an ad or trafficked an ad or measured an ads effectiveness all the things you have to do to be in the ad business and we are building that capability as we speak " says scott helbing at&amp ts executive vice president of entertainment services trafficking is the process of scheduling an ad to run mr helbing noted however that one arm of at&amp t has some ad experience its yellow pages directories business which boasts an ad sales force of the company is mulling how to tap the expertise of this group one possibility is to try and sell tv ads to existing yellow pages advertisers said karl spangenberg at&amp ts vice president for integrated advertising and commerce a year advertising veteran who joined at&amp t last april after a stint as president of advertising for an in hotel video service mr spangenberg plans to build a separate ad sales team for the new tv broadband cellphone effort the company expects to have people hired by years end still media buyers so far are taking a "show me" attitude "selling advertising requires a deep infrastructure feet on the street back office i think they arent quite there yet " says david cohen u s director of digital communications at universal mccann a media buying firm owned by interpublic group indeed comcast the largest cable operator in terms of subscribers which already sells local tv ad time on its cable systems and ad space on its internet service has a strong ad sales force the presence of comcast and other big cable operators in the ad sales market underlines the competitive challenge facing at&amp t "it took how long for cable to become effective at local ad sales " asks tom wolzien an independent media consultant "it remains to be seen whether at&amp t can do very quickly what it has taken the other guys a long time to build " adds steve calder executive media director at mediahub a media services unit of interpublics mullen agency it isnt just cable operators that at&amp t is going up against the telecom titan is entering a very crowded field one that is undergoing intense change as marketers scale back spending on traditional media and put more emphasis on new media growth of spending on tv advertising has slowed dramatically in recent years raising questions about at&amp ts ability to generate significant revenue from that area "those pots of dollars are under duress " mr spangenberg says he thinks at&amp t will have a competitive advantage with its ability to package tv ads with spots on the web and mobile devices and he also expects at&amp t to win ad dollars by making use of new interactive ad techniques such as short four minute films that audiences can choose to see with a click of their remote control while web advertising is expected to grow steadily during the next few years prospects for mobile advertising are also uncertain advertisers are worried about whether consumers will accept the idea of getting ads on their cellphones in a recent report forrester research found that of u s consumers "are annoyed by the idea of mobile marketing " a cellphone "is the ultimate intimate personal device " says universal mccanns mr cohen so its not clear consumers will welcome intrusive ads there may be opportunities for advertisers who can provide something that is fun to watch or who have something to sell says at&amp ts mr helbing "my own personal feeling is that consumers are going to want access to entertainment in more bite sized formats with the ability to conduct commerce to buy something really quickly " he says one marketer has already chosen to test at&amp ts waters j p morgan chases chase card services division has entered into an ad partnership with at&amp t that will let chase experiment with different ideas says manning field
