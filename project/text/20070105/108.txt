weekend journal television house of dreams an unapologetic optimism suffuses the new series "lincoln heights " abc monday p m though the show is set in a rundown and episodically violent southern california precinct eddie sutton is a cop and family man who has decided to move his wife jenn and their three teenagers out of a cramped suburban apartment into a spacious but decrepit former crack house taking advantage of a police department housing initiative part of a community policing model he brings his wary family back to the tough neighborhood where he grew up he paints the old lincoln heights to his children in nostalgic hues that conjure up the s rather than the more chronologically accurate s and s sweeping floors at age first kiss at a church potluck and learning to box eddie longs to revive the wholesomeness that has been supplanted by drugs guns and gangs the opening sequences of a drug raid and youths working their cell phones or wheeling menacingly on child size bicycles tell us that we are in the more sinister present and that the suttons idealism will come into conflict with a nihilistic street culture we wonder too whether eddies childhood memories might be a too sunny construct that hides darker truths "we all have to put up with crap so you can work out the trauma of your rotten childhood " is his wifes tart and homespun psychoanalysis after the familys new house is burglarized the script offers two reasons for eddies move back to his roots he wants to make a difference by injecting his own exemplary way of life into the bad milieu he once strove to escape but more prosaically he wants to give his kids their own bathroom and his wife a master bedroom real estate will form the contours of his middle class aspirations and the fixer upper with bedrooms for all is proof of upward mobility the transformation of the boarded up crack house into something from martha stewart reminds us that there are few corners of urban america left that cannot become material for someones upgrade fantasy with a little help from home improvement for dummies and the magic of tv the place is made airy and tasteful within a mere four months anyone who has presided over a real renovation will want the name of the suttons contractor we catch glimpses of charming pre war style fixtures in the kitchen a form of expensive authenticity that would probably be out of reach for even the most heavily mortgaged cop nurse couple the marriage upon which the suttons american dream is being built is also enviable collaborative and supportive the children two girls and a boy are beautiful and accomplished and despite some verite sibling bickering staggeringly well behaved the suttons are so decent sexy and smart that one feels far more invested in protecting this gifted nuclear family and their real estate from the awful neighborhood outside than in the remedial social work that needs attending to on the street the neighbors dont inspire confidence "folks around here see the po lice as more dangerous than the ebola virus " sutton is warned right off another local tells him "you could be george washington martin luther bush but here youre in my yard " tribal shunning slowly thaws on the block but random violence persists one teenage daughter meets a dishy boy in art class at school her younger sister finally gets some time off the bench at a team basketball game allegiances are formed a confrontation in a bodega leads eddie to fire his weapon killing a young man a local preacher demagogue wants eddie hung out to dry for this "black on black" transgression hostility toward the squeaky clean newcomers waxes and wanes which moves the plot along effectively the suttons are perhaps a little too saintly to be believed but an understated script and subtle acting by russell hornsby as eddie and nicki micheaux as jenn keep "lincoln heights" from becoming "seventh heaven" in a poor zip code fitting in can be as difficult for the very overweight teen as for any cultural outsider "to be fat like me " a lifetime original movie monday p m gets at the issue of teenage obesity through an excessively elaborate plot and weighty moral lecture ali an attractive popular athlete turns investigative reporter and with the help of prosthetics and makeup transforms herself into an obese newcomer hidden on her body is the camera that will record the reactions of fellow students ali hopes her eanest expose will win prize money that will help pay her way through college the film starring kaley cuoco as ali gets some things right her relationship with her mother played by caroline rhea host of "the biggest loser" is convincingly passive aggressive ali is a self righteous teenager who takes her tolerant mother for granted and lectures her incessantly about her diet there is a disconcerting orwellian note in this nutritional policing of parents by children and it will probably ring true to some baby boomers whose red meat and sugar habits horrify their nutritionally enlightened kids but the realism falls apart in the school scenes obesity is increasingly common among the young but you wouldnt know that from a skulk through this fictional high school where almost all of the girls are buff and stylish the physical diversity that would exist in a real high school is nowhere evident here the didacticism is crude popular girls with the exception of the morphing ali are insensitive or ditzy fat girls are complex and thoughtful to judge from the one overweight girl ali befriends alis chubby younger brother is also clever and lovable there are no dull witted fat people in the world envisioned in this scenario the teenagers reactions to the momentarily obese ali is utterly unconvincing she and the other overweight are not merely ignored but gawked at and openly insulted as "extra wide loads" and "whales " anyone whos been in a real high school lately knows that this sort of thing wouldnt be acceptable to the vast majority of year olds more likely the kids hurling the epithets would be shunned for their public and deeply uncool failure to honor diversity an obese teenager might indeed be excluded even despised but the cruelty where it existed would tend to be be far more subtle than overt name calling in this as in many of lifetimes victim centered tales there is little tolerance for nuance
