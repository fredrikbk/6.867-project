tax as you go congressional democrats are dashing out of the gates to establish their fiscal conservative credentials and as early as today house speaker nancy pelosi will push through so called "pay as you go" budget rules for congress keep an eye on your wallet "paygo " as washington insiders call it sounds like a fiscally prudent budget practice if government spends more on program a it has to spend less money on program b and thus budget deficits will be restrained were all for that but when republicans proposed exactly that budget rule in recent years house democrats voted it down ms pelosi has something different in mind under her paygo plan new entitlement programs and all new tax cuts would have to be offset by either cutbacks in other entitlement programs or tax increases this version of paygo is a budget trapdoor designed not to control expenditures but to make it easier to raise taxes while blocking future tax cuts supporters of paygo claim it will help restrain entitlement spending it wont paygo doesnt apply to current entitlements that will grow automatically over the next several decades ms pelosis version of paygo applies only to new entitlements or changes in law that expand current programs and on present trajectory medicare medicaid social security food stamps and the like are scheduled to increase federal spending to almost of gdp by up from today paygo wont stop a dime of that increase this may explain why one of the leading supporters of paygo is the center on budget and policy priorities a liberal outfit that favors far more social spending paygo enthusiasts also claim that when these rules were in effect in the s the budget deficit disappeared and by the budget recorded a &# billion surplus sorry the budget improvement in the late s was a result of three events wholly unrelated to paygo the initial spending restraint under the republican congress in and as part of their pledge to balance the budget a huge reduction in military spending totaling nearly of gdp over the decade and rapid economic growth which always causes a bounce in revenues paygo didnt expire until but by the late s politicians in both parties were already re stoking the domestic spending fires what paygo does restrain are tax cuts by requiring that any tax cut be offset dollar for dollar with some entitlement reduction congressional budgeteers always overestimate the revenue losses from tax cuts which under paygo would require onerous budget cuts to "pay for" the tax cuts as a political matter those spending cuts will never happen first on the chopping block therefore would be the investment tax cuts of that are set to expire in last year democrat david obey of wisconsin the new appropriations committee chairman and a prodigious spender gave this strategy away when he urged paygo rules so he could enact new social spending and pay for it by canceling the bush tax cuts for those who make more than &# million never mind that in the wake of those capital gains and dividend tax rate cuts federal revenues climbed by a record &# billion over the past two fiscal years incidentally thanks to the current economic expansion and the surge in tax revenues the budget deficit has fallen by &# billion in just two years without paygo given all of this its especially puzzling that even some conservatives seem tempted by paygos fiscal illusions our friends at the heritage foundation have of late become obsessed with future entitlement forecasts and have advised ms pelosi to enact paygo rules to stop it but heritage notably did not insist that tax increases be excluded from any paygo rule had such logic prevailed in or its possible that neither the reagan nor bush tax cuts would ever have become law as a political matter paygo is about returning republicans to their historical minority role as tax collectors for the welfare state thats not to say that new budget rules arent highly desirable the line item veto a new grace commission to identify and eliminate the billions of dollars of waste and failed programs and an automatic spending sequester if the budget rises above agreed baselines would all help to restore spending discipline but it is precisely because these rules would restrain spending that they are not on the democratic agenda paygo by contrast gives the appearance of spending discipline while making it all but impossible to let taxpayers keep more of their money it should really be called "spend and tax as you go " see related letter "letters to the editor we support a paygo policy that enforces real spending discipline" wsj jan
