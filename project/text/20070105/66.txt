mr bush let chips fall where they may george bushs call to newly elected congress for his brand of bipartisanship is nothing more than a call for "surrender" to his brand of leadership or "they will have chosen stalemate" "what the congress can do for america " editorial page jan the only important message of the recent election he cites is to substantially cut the earmarks passed each year most everything else for him is to be dictated by his "common sense principles" by which he "will approach governing with the new congress " to that i say let the show begin and let the chips fall where they may dami rambhia glastonbury conn it is odd that george bush would return to conservative principles at this point in his presidency having used no veto to kill any legislation that added more layers of government or spending pork or otherwise to an already obese patient known as the federal government his calls for working with the new leadership of congress sound more like "i really do believe the fox can watch the hen house " too little too late david baldner lubbock texas i appreciate the bipartisan tone of president bushs advice for congress in that same spirit of transparency and collegiality i encourage him to be honest about the dismal federal budget deficit particularly the accrual deficit numbers that his own treasury department issues include a good faith estimate of iraq war costs in the annual budget and open his famously secretive administration to meaningful oversight by congress and the american people the th congress can work with the president and we will on our end of pennsylvania avenue we are making important changes that will make government function better i hope that president bush will as well jim cooper d tenn washington
