weekend journal the home front the overnight wine collector facing empty cellars homeowners try buying bottles by the foot planning a custom home in los angeles county alan bursteen plotted a spread with a nine hole putting green a screening room and a glassed in cellar big enough for bottles of wine when he moved his family there this spring just one thing was missing the wine the year old television producer has done the occasional winery tour and charity tasting but he calls his wine knowledge limited so he hired a consultant who charged &# to put together a bottle collection ranging from antinori italy ornellaia eight bottles to zinfandel california one turley wine cellars hayne vineyard "a wine cellar looks better filled up " mr bursteen says "its kind of like having a ferrari parked in the middle of your dining room " some wine smitten homeowners are skipping the collecting and going straight for the collection with many expensive new houses and condominiums including dedicated space for wine owners are often finding themselves a few cases short of a cellar many of course will fill them the old fashioned way accumulating a case here or there over the years but in one emerging solution others are seeking instant cellars paying consultants to add hundreds or even thousands of bottles within in a month or two or asking wine stores to fill overnight orders for a decades worth of wine fast track cellars are rooted in part in the real estate business developers are offering storage racks or rooms hoping buyers will equate wine with the good life at la vita a

sherry lehmann four years ago a client fresh from a remodeling job asked for help filling his new wine room "i put together a proposal for cases of wine anticipating him to say ill take this or that " says company chairman michael aaron "instead he says i got the list it looks good just send it " the &# tab remains the retailers largest instant collection sale mr aaron says but now the company says it fills about three turnkey cellar orders each month michael lorber a year old principal of a real estate agency likes to buy wines gradually for the bottle cellar in his new york apartment but he took the express track for his new one bedroom pied a terre in boston where he plans to entertain friends and business associates in a wine bar area off his open kitchen "considering im only there two days a week i cant keep on top of it " says mr lorber he spent a couple hours with a personal shopper at gordons fine wines &amp liquors a chain in the boston suburbs spending &# for bottles including caymus from california bollinger champagne montrachet from burgundy and some sweet french chateau dyquem "i completely stocked up " he says instant stashes have their detractors wine experts say the collections tend to be less diverse than those gathered over time because buyers are limited by whats in stores or at auctions thanks to a recent collecting boom the most desirable bottles have become pricier at retailers and auctions while many bottles in stores now either wont improve markedly with age or wont be ready to drink for years simon lambert a senior sales manager at the chicago wine company a retailer that holds a monthly auction says overnight buyers are practically guaranteed a sub par mix "at a one stop shop " he says "its virtually impossible to get a good well balanced collection " long time oenophiles also dont relish extra competition for already pricey bottles particularly from collectors who might not know their domaine de la romanee conti from a beaujolais nouveau its also some say an example of people buying the trappings of wealth "its not that these people want to be considered rich they want to be considered connoisseurs " says sharon zukin a sociologist at city university of new york who studies consumer culture "its similar to buying books by the foot " not all the new owners are depleting global stocks of chateau latour two months ago kurt manley and his wife sara issued a challenge to wine store co owner kristen kowalski their new house has a cellar with a vaulted ceiling and th century french monastery floor tiles and they had a week to fill it with bottles in time to host a fund raiser for minnesota gov tim pawlenty "he was really complimentary " says mr manley a real estate developer in eagan minn the manleys new collection averaging &# a bottle includes about half white and sparkling wine now instead of going to the grocery store for bottles to drink with dinner the manleys pick a cakebread sauvignon blanc or torbreck woodcutters shiraz from the right side of the cellar where ms kowalski put the everyday wines mr manley says he hasnt touched the "collectibles" at the far left "we have some " he says "i dont really know what kind they are " to serve customers with modest wine knowledge wallys began offering cellar guides on spreadsheets and organizing shelves with color coded labels says chairman steve wallace the company even promises to help customers match wines to their guests stature "well organize it so that the east wall is for cheap wines for the b guest list " mr wallace says "the a guest list wines will be elsewhere " jeff smith author of "the best cellar" and owner of carte du vin a wine organizing company in beverly hills calif says that rather than analyze his potential clients tasting preferences he tries to figure out their collecting style he outlines collector types including "bargain hunters " "bankers" who hope to sell the wine for a profit later and "point men " whose focus on ratings leads them to churn their collections to get rid of low scoring bottles mr smith says hell assemble cellars for all types the inventory spreadsheets he includes with each one has price data ratings from robert parker and the wine spectator and when to drink each bottle not all clients heed mr smiths advice mr bursteen and his wife have drunk only a few of the bottles mr smith chose for them despite the consultants email reminders "for a good time go to column row m " mr smith wrote recently nudging them toward a joseph phelps insignia instead mr bursteen says he lets dinner party guests pick their own bottles "i dont pay much attention until afterwards " he says "then i go look it up in the chart " other turnkey collectors may find their pricey new wine hard to swallow ralph eads who has been collecting wine since and has a bottle cellar recently visited a friend who he figures spent well over &# for bottles mostly and bordeaux for his new tasting room the houston oil &amp gas executive was impressed but as the two friends and their wives shared an mouton rothschild mr eads noticed that his friend seemed uncomfortable drinking wine that had cost him hundreds of dollars mr eads says he thinks little of opening a or chateau latour that could fetch &# and &# respectively in part because he bought the bottles decades ago "it only cost me about &# a bottle " charmaine weeks has her own shelf stocking strategy the year old real estate agent and her husband have about bottles but they recently bought a home at roubion which has a bottle cellar to bridge the gap shes already started saving empty bottles that shell use to fill the upper rows of the floor to ceiling cellar shell also ask her friends to pitch in "our plan is to immediately host a cork it party and have everyone bring a bottle " she says still ms weeks sees no incongruity in buying a cellar shell struggle to fill "its mainly the look of it what word can i use " she says "its just so
