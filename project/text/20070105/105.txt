weekend journal taste houses of worship meeting in st louis st louis at the age of heather nichols has taught songs to kids in thailand and has been to africa twice to assist surgeons she has led a missionary trip to inner city philadelphia and is about to do another and she closed out her year here in st louis with more than of her closest friends in christ for five days the ordinarily sluggish streets of downtown st louis were teeming with fresh faced evangelicals clutching custom printed bibles emblazoned with the motto "live a life worthy of the calling" of these were donated by the international bible society at printing costs between &# and &# the convention called urbana has been going on triennially for the past years but this year it finally outgrew the venue at the university of illinois for which it is named so the organizers at intervarsity christian fellowship moved the operation to the st louis convention center to accommodate its expanding girth and urbana director jim tebbe hopes that st louis as a result will become known not only as the gateway to the west but also the "gateway to world missions " with more than mission agencies relief and development organizations and schools present in a sort of shopping mall for the faithful the gateway was wide open some had hooks to attract their recruits there was baklava at the middle eastern mission star of david keychains for those who might sign up to convert jews in the holy land and squishy yellow smiley face balls from the summer missions kiosk cliff johnson of peoria ill has been coming to these conferences with his wife carol since they were in college but at he is no longer seeking posts overseas the couple believe however that god has "commanded each of his followers to have the mission of representing him wherever we are whether that be to our next door neighbor or overseas to a foreign culture or our inner city ghetto " narrowing down these choices is part of the reason that so many students shelled out upward of &# to be here students could choose a "major" from categories of seminars that were available including urban development and campus ministries but a big focus of the program this year was the aids epidemic and the ways that christians can respond to it "the urbana leadership recognized that urbana had not adequately addressed aids in past conventions and could not afford to leave it unaddressed any longer " noted gordon govier intervarsitys media coordinator urbana now "recognizes what many christian leaders have been saying for several years now the aids pandemic is shaping the future of our world and is challenging christians to examine what their faith says about how they should respond " one way to do this examination was to wander through worldvisions aids exhibit which was wedged in among the missionary kiosks at the convention a few paces from a lemonade stand the exhibit was a facsimile of an african hut where visitors could take an mp player guided tour of a year in the life of a young african affected by the aids virus you would hear in gut wrenching detail how a young boys family slowly perished around him before he learned of his own infection as an accented voice guided you past a wooden cross painted with the word "father" under pictures of the funeral the end of the tour was a quiet chapel with a cross shaped window whose walls were covered with the faces of the infected rick warren pastor and best selling author of "the purpose driven life " told an urbana news conference that the christian strategy should seek to stop the epidemic rather than simply slow it down "the church has far more locations than the united nations speaks in far more languages than the united nations " and it is thus the church he argues that is in a unique position to offer treatment at a seminar called "sex sexuality and aids " stella kasiriye who directs world relief in malawi noted that the moral component of combating the aids virus can be tricky for christians to negotiate she reminded those assembled that rape and the grinding poverty that forces women into sexual slavery challenge christians to look beyond the desire to "keep the marriage bed holy " the young people gathered here at urbana are trying to figure out how best to put the ideas of their faith to use in the world blake yates who graduated from baylor university in is thinking of going on a long term mission trip to haiti he points to the gospel of matthew where jesus tells his disciples that what they did to the least of his people they had done also to him "the obvious application is if theres folks out there dying and in pain we need to be able to see jesus in them " ms gilsinan is a writer in st louis
