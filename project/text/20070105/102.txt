weekend journal review film cartoon bunnies dont lend life to miss potter tentative biography fails to get its subject happily falls flat when a london publisher takes a first squint at the heroines exquisite drawings in "miss potter " he remarks with bland detachment "bunnies in jackets with brass buttons however do you imagine such things " those bunnies of course populated such still beloved childrens books as "the tale of peter rabbit " and made beatrix potter a literary lioness of the early th century as well as an author whose works to this day have never been out of print yet this attractive superficial stab at biography with renee zellweger in the title role is more concerned with a lonely womans quest for acceptance and love than with an authors worldly achievements beatrix herself seems terribly slow to understand that her books have made her wealthy which raises the question of just how close she may have been to her beloved bunnies or how detached from her own reality the movie which was directed by chris noonan from a script by richard maltby jr means to raise that question with engaging animations of potters drawings whether they catch her attention quietly or jump off the page these cheerful little products of her fertile imagination are her only intimate friends both in her solitary childhood and her years as a thirty something spinster who still lives at home with her haughty prosperous parents yet the device isnt sustained its as if the filmmakers arent sure if their subject is genuinely screwy or simply eccentric they skirt darker intimations by concentrating on the conventional aspects of her spinster desperation a state thats relieved only when love comes into her life in the person of norman warne ewan mcgregor the junior member of her publishing house desperation and neurosis are never easy to play but miss zellweger seems consistently uncomfortable here and she finds little looseness or spontaneity within beatrixs rigidity emily watson on the other hand is brisk and witty as normans sister millie warne millie even brings welcome verve to a game of whist the film is attractive in a masterpiece theatre way and was photographed handsomely by andrew dunn indeed the last part of beatrix potters life she died in lends itself to handsome photography for she became a great conservationist acquiring huge tracts of land in the lake district and leaving them to britains fledgling national trust those bunnies bought protection for many more bunnies happily never after frieda the wicked stepmother voiced by sigourney weaver in an animated aberration called "happily never after" does her worst to do away with happy endings in general and the particular happy ending that reunites cinderella with her prince charming never was an apostrophe so misplaced never was the prospect of good cheer so perversely defeated one problem is the saturday morning slanginess that infects the production from start to finish referring to the films title the narrator a young dishwasher named rick says "yeah the names kinda corny but we had to call it something " theres a reference to "the mother of all battles" by one of seven unnamed dwarfs cinderella who is voiced very pleasantly by sarah michelle gellar is called ella for short but also mistakenly mozarella and salmonella and frieda a sexy dominatrix striding around on towering wedgies declares "if im gonna shake things up around here i need some bad guys its time to party " a more subversive enemy is the films self reflective and eventually abstracted structure the action such as it is begins when frieda steals a magic staff from a sorcerer voiced ever so briefly by george carlin and finds herself with the power to tilt the balance of good and evil in fairy tale land over which she presides like a malign producer watching dailies and making changes in mid production soon the saga of cinderella comes to feel like an interactive tv show within a theatrical feature and everything happens at one glibly ironic remove from real feelings talk about defining enchantment down dvd tip long before beatrix potter became the reigning queen of childrens fantasy another englishwoman mary shelley wrote the gothic fantasy masterpiece "frankenstein or the modern prometheus " then mary shelley became a character played by elsa lanchester in the prologue of another masterpiece of its kind "the bride of frankenstein" then a scene in the film the frankenstein monsters encounter with a blind hermit became the stuff of send up in mel brookss "young frankenstein" and then "and thens" being the connective tissue of storytelling the man who directed "the bride of frankenstein " james whale became the subject of "gods and monsters" which won a screenplay oscar for its writer director bill condon who then enough not quite yet went on to write "chicago" and write and direct "dreamgirls "
