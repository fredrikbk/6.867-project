mirrors or exceeds the tasks that often overwhelm adult children caring for an elderly parent the ranks of young caregivers are large and expected to grow given advances in medicine and technology people with conditions such as lou gehrigs disease multiple sclerosis lupus cancer and heart disease are living longer with portable machines that help them breathe swallow and communicate paralyzed parents can remain at home longer a study found as many as million to million children in the u s ages through provide care for a chronically ill or disabled family member based on a two part survey that included random sampling of households and follow up interviews with children and other family members policy makers and family advocates say they had been unaware that so many children were providing such care previous studies only polled caregivers or older "it is the norm to think of children requiring care not providing it " explained authors of the study the study funded by the u s administration on aging and conducted by the national alliance for caregiving and the united hospital fund foundation found nearly of child caregivers helped with a task such as bathing dressing or feeding a fourth of the children had no one helping them with the tasks and about half said the caregiving took a significant amount of their time boys were almost as likely to provide care as girls more than were under about of the children came from households earning less than &# while motivated by love and devotion these children often have little choice many live in single parent homes with only the infirm parent in two parent households the healthy parent may be working few can afford paid home care help which generally costs from about &# to &# a day skilled nursing care costs much more most private health insurance policies dont cover in home care unless they are specific and expensive long term care policies medicare the federal insurance program for the elderly and those under the age of with certain disabilities will pay for hospitalization and some in home care when considered medically necessary such as when a person has open wounds is recently released from a

routinely feed their father by releasing a liquid supplement into his feeding tube with a syringe amanda changes his tracheotomy tubes a delicate and often messy process typically handled by a respiratory therapist which the family cant afford without children helping to provide care some of these parents would likely end up in an institution such as a nursing home institutional care is generally more expensive but it is usually covered by medicaid placing so much responsibility on young people can end up being costly "if a family breaks apart because the burden becomes too much for a child youre talking about two institutional placements the parent in a nursing home and the child in the foster care system " says nancy law of the national multiple sclerosis society the society which offers some respite care to families and scholarships to children whose parents have ms is launching a pilot program to help child caregivers a handful of states offer vouchers or tax credits for respite home care to provide a break for caregivers the lifespan respite care act passed last month authorizes the department of health and human services to award a limited number of grants to selected states to make temporary help available friends and relatives often offer assistance as well many children become more responsible and compassionate caring for a parent but it can take a toll "worry is a big thing for these kids " says connie siskowski head of the american association of caregiving youth in boca raton fla which offers support services to local families like new parents they check on a mother or father in the middle of the night interest in school or sports may fade they wonder what will happen when they turn and want to go to college or leave home and whether their parent will be able to cobble together care from neighbors or other relatives marissa fleming of beaver falls pa will occasionally get mad at her mother who is single and has ms with ms one day a person can walk and the next day they cant these on and off symptoms which baffle doctors are even harder to fathom for a child "it feels like she doesnt want to help not that she isnt able i feel like shes mom and she should be doing things " says marissa an only child along with giving her mother injections and helping get her showered and dressed marissa buys groceries cooks and washes clothes in the summer she worked two jobs going straight from subway to ritas italian ice "sometimes i say stuff to my mom and it usually starts an argument then i feel bad " marissa says going out with friends leaves her torn she wants a break from tending to her mother but "i worry about her " her mother maria tries to keep requests to a minimum waiting to ask for water until she needs something else "i try to think of three things i need so i dont have to ask her separately " says ms fleming some parents try to find ways to make their disease less of a burden especially for young children in minneapolis adina goldstein a divorced mother with ms suggests to her year old son danny that they have a picnic on her bed when she cant get up having a son or daughter provide what is at times intimate or serious care adds another disconcerting dimension but parents may have few options with no family in the cleveland area sue nerlinger a year old single mother relies on her twin year old boys to cook help her into bed and make repairs on the fixer upper she bought about two years before she was diagnosed with ms her son charles began mixing medicine and giving his mother shots after watching a video provided by the pharmaceutical company her other son tom has stayed home from school when she has fallen after her diagnosis ms nerlinger vowed she would never subject her sons to helping her get into the bathtub that lasted until this summer when she lost the use of her left side and couldnt walk or stand on her own reluctantly she asked for their assistance but kept her robe on until they left the bathroom tom returned repeatedly to the door shouting "mom are you ok " "i hoped i would never have to face that with the boys " she says jordan wilhelm the ohio high schooler who lifts his dad out of bed each day never knew his father when he was healthy neither did his two older sisters at first the children saw their fathers illness almost as a novelty no other dads had a collection of canes including one with a sword hidden in the shaft and another with a cars shifter knob welded on top by elementary school when their father could no longer walk and had to get an electric scooter all three children would hop on it beeping the horn and taking turns steering on sundays the entire family would ride to st joseph catholic church mr wilhelm on his scooter the children weaving their bikes alongside mrs wilhelm following on her own bicycle they went on limited family vacations driving minutes to a hotel in nearby defiance ohio where the children swam in the pool while the children were still in grade school mr wilhelm was getting worse a mechanic he could no longer work at paul &amp dans radiator shop which he owned with his brother aware of his knowledge about cars and his growing limitations friends offered him jobs working in a store that sold nascar items and later at advance auto parts where he could ride down the aisles to help customers locate parts and answer the phone mrs wilhelm took a job at a factory which provided health insurance the insurance helped pay for treatment including injections and steroids but none offered lasting improvement when a friend suggested an alternative therapy that would require the familys involvement the children volunteered the man who raised bees just outside of town sent them a book called "health and the honeybee" describing how bee venom was used to treat diseases three times a week the children then ranging from to went with their father to the farm the girls took live bees impaled on pins and stuck them into their fathers legs so the bees would sting him and release venom jordans job was to remove the stinger with a razor it was frightening but "i did it because i thought it would make dad better " says valerie now almost immediately mr wilhelm who had been slurring words began speaking clearly which the bee farmer and family attributed to medicinal powers in the venom the family rejoiced but after several months mr wilhelms legs began swelling and his doctor said the venom was poisoning him eventually he had to quit working and trade the scooter for a wheelchair any lingering novelty was gone they added a ramp to the garage of their single story brick ranch house when mr wilhelm could no longer lift his leg to get into the tub the family replaced it with an open shower with metal handgrips the physical decline was depressing but his emotional change due either to his condition or medication disturbed the children too especially as they got older and more self conscious mr wilhelm would weep during movies or in church when he heard an inspirational verse not knowing what to do his youngest daughter marilyn would pat him on the back saying "its ok its ok " while privately wishing he would be tougher or that she could disappear "it was kind of embarrassing " says marilyn now "as a kid you dont see anyone elses dad doing that " in mr wilhelms hands began shaking so much he couldnt hold a fork or spoon the treatment of last resort chemotherapy didnt help as he declined his children became reluctant to leave him alone in school when ambulances sounded a siren valerie said a prayer that it wasnt for her father jordan started turning down invitations to sleep over at friends homes "it was more helpful for me to be at home " he says relatives provided some assistance mrs wilhelm has a mother and brother nearby and mr wilhelm has three brothers and two sisters in the area but day to day tasks fell to the immediate family the children would argue over whose turn it was to feed their dad or empty the urine bag and then feel guilty about it "if we continued to keep score " says marilyn "father would not get fed or go to the bathroom " by then mrs wilhelm had taken a job as a teachers aide so she could come home on her lunch hour and feed paul it provided insurance but starting pay was only &# an hour although she is now an office manager earning &# an hour she works thursday nights and saturdays at a dentists office to help pay bills knowing the demands on his children mr wilhelm tried to inject some humor into the routine he joked his speech slow and labored but clear to them saying they had "earned an extra cookie for the day" by adjusting him in his recliner or getting him his medicine in their town of locals have helped too when mr wilhelm rides his motorized wheelchair to bubba js a restaurant a few blocks away either the owner or one of the waitresses will feed him mrs wilhelms bosss husband collected money from the community and recently bought the family a van with a lift for mr wilhelms wheelchair so jordan doesnt have to carry him in and out of the car in the past year mr wilhelm has lost the use of both arms he cant sit up on his own a weight is strapped to his right hand to still tremors and allow him to operate the remote that moves his recliner with both of her daughters now in college mrs wilhelm says more responsibilities have fallen on her son "i cant do anything with paul without jordan " she says if his father has a doctors appointment jordan takes time off school or work and stays up all night when his father has a stomach virus this summer jordan worked a shift from a m to noon at a local turkey farm cleaning barns and feeding birds so he could be at home in the afternoon "it hits jordan harder because he is on call most of the time " says his sister marilyn last year jordan became depressed and anxious he began having panic attacks lost interest in his friends and couldnt concentrate he says he dropped out of band though he had played trombone since middle school when his father wanted to be moved or wanted water jordan became irritable "everything i did was repetitious and got on my nerves id get up go to school go to work i didnt have any down time id come home and dad would ask a simple question like can i use the bathroom and id get angry and yell at him and it made him mad " says jordan "after i felt bad about it i didnt mean to do it but i got so tired of doing everything " his mother suggested he talk to a therapist that has helped keep his fathers care in perspective jordan says he has already told his mother he will go to college nearby so he can live at home and take care of his dad for the foreseeable future mrs wilhelm hopes to continue working for at least six more years so she will have the required time to receive health insurance after she retires as a boy jordan was often with his father at the radiator shop listening to him explain how cars work fascinated by engines and motors now he takes his father to the workshop behind their house mr wilhelm watches from his wheelchair and gives advice while jordan restores a cherry red chevrolet chevelle on a recent afternoon mr wilhelm sat in his family room and said to his son "jordan bring my pride and joy around " minutes later jordan drove down the driveway pausing to idle the car so his father could admire it from the window
