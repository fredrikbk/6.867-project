in new senate the candy desk gets a kiss off new occupant hails from state with a sweet deficit moose doodles anyone washington with democrats back in control of congress for the first time in years much is changing in the nations capital including a longtime tradition in the u s senate the "candy desk " for a decade until his defeat last year sen rick santorum a pennsylvania republican stocked the desk with donations from home state candy makers including hershey co and just born inc maker of hot tamales and peanut chews with mr santorum gone the desk which is dipped into by many members has been turned over to sen craig thomas a republican from wyoming but his state is better known for bison than bonbons and thats a big problem ethics rules forbid members accepting gifts worth &# or more a year from a single source one exception covers items produced in a senators home state so long as theyre used primarily by people other than the senator or his staff the provision was crafted to allow senators to offer visitors home grown snacks such as florida orange juice or georgia peanuts in wyoming some small outfits sell esoteric sweets such as chocolates designed to look like moose droppings but the state doesnt have any big brand name candy makers who could step into the breach as a result the candy industry lobbying group which coordinates stocking the desk is cutting off the sweets citing wyomings candy deficit and ethics rules "were happy to provide candy if there are association members" in the home state of the senator who sits at the candy desk says susan smith a spokesman for the national confectioners association "it would be difficult for us to do now " good spirit hershey of hershey pa is taking the kiss off in good spirit "we were pleased to be a small part of sweetening up congressional proceedings " says kirk saville a company spokesman as it happens relying on pennsylvania wasnt an option mr santorums successor bob casey is a democrat and the candy desk has by tradition always been located on the republican side of the senate chamber in a heavily trafficked area near the exit to the elevators the states other senator arlen specter a republican already has a choice seat toward the front before mr thomas was tapped to take possession the sweet tooth crowd erroneously speculated that tennessee sen bob corker the only new republican senator would end up with the desk that might have worked out fine since tennessee is home to brachs confections inc which also has operations in texas as well as the standard candy co which makes googoo clusters the senate takes its furniture seriously it is still using the desks built in by a new york cabinetmaker to replace those burned by the british during the war of as new states joined the union and the senate grew new desks of similar design were built at the beginning of each congress desks are reapportioned among republicans and democrats and then senators get their choice based on seniority the candy desk a tradition not a rule dates to according to the senate historical office thats when sen george murphy the former actor and film executive began sharing treats from the back row he left in and those who inherited the desk continued his largess at times senators asked for specific candy others left a few dollars to keep the desk stocked over time the practice became more institutionalized says betty k koed assistant historian in the senate historical office eventually the national confectioners association along with the chocolate manufacturers association began to organize donations because of its location in the back the seat is generally occupied by junior senators but mr santorum made a point of keeping the desk even as he rose in seniority to highlight his states prowess pennsylvania companies sent about pounds of candy to mr santorums office each quarter says robert traynham the ex senators former spokesman thats equivalent to about hersheys kisses a year continuing the tradition mr thomas who came to washington in to take dick cheneys seat in the house and was elected to the senate five years later vows to continue the tradition somehow "the candy desk has been my favorite for a while " he says he admits to regularly dipping into mr santorums stash the senators spokesman cameron hardy says his boss requested the seat because "he likes the idea of sharing with his colleagues " yet mr hardy concedes that mr thomas and his staff initially werent familiar with how the candy desk worked "i dont think anyone realized it was a big undertaking " he says or that candy companies played a role in supplying the goodies one option is to turn to mom and pop shops in wyoming that make or re package sweets with a frontier flair bessie zeller has a family business queen bee gardens in lovell wyo which produces caramel like candies from honey she already sends about pounds of candy worth about &# every couple of months to members of the states congressional delegation she gets some payment for the goodies "i dont think we can afford to donate it all " she says mary ann kuschel of cheyenne sells mostly re packaged candy such as "moose doodles" chocolate covered almonds "shaped just like moose droppings" and "bison balls" round rice krispies treats dipped in chocolate sold in packages of two she says her home based business is ill equipped to make big donations to the u s senate "i dont think so " she says "not for free " senate ethics rules may give mr thomas some wiggle room allowing him to seek contributions from senators whose states are more richly endowed something he says he is contemplating robert kelner who heads the election and political law practice at covington &amp burling llp says a candy company could "in theory" send less than &# worth of candy to each senator over the course of the year and not violate gift limits says mr hardy the senators spokesman "im sure well get through it somehow " see related
