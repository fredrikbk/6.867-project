weekend journal the drivers seat ford has a better idea at last a year ago this weekend ford unveiled a promising new model at the big detroit auto show touted as the sort of bold design that would anchor the companys turnaround after a &# billion loss in north america in the edge bore a strong resemblance to fords popular fusion sedan and boasted a powerful new engine but months passed before the edge went on sale during that time fords problems deepened prompting corporate scion bill ford to step down as chief executive in september his successor former boeing executive alan mulally got a rude introduction to the business when fords third quarter loss reached &# billion the company responded with the unprecedented step of offering nearly all its assets as collateral for as much as &# billion in loans if ever ford needed a hot new product it would be now good thing for ford then that the edge is finally making its way to dealers in volume ford truly believes it has a hit on its hands and while that bit of conjecture may prove to be merely the sort of wishful thinking common at this time of the year the edge is the most promising vehicle to wear the company name in years nominally a "crossover " the edge is a five seat midsize sport utility vehicle based on the structure of a car the fusion rather than a truck before going any further understand that anything being called the c word from the chrysler pacifica to the mazda cx to the subaru b tribeca is still an suv the term crossover comes from marketers eager to disassociate their car based models from the gas guzzling image of traditional suvs that have a separate body and frame like a truck cue image of fords explorer as bombastic as the term is a crossover does tend to have some benefits compared to its heavy duty siblings primarily in fuel economy and handling ford emphasizes the edges car based lineage in its styling eschewing the brands traditionally tough suv look in favor of clean simple lines ornamented by the sort of jeweled headlights and taillights currently in vogue the edge isnt very distinctive once you look beyond its razor blade grille but thats precisely the point as ford wants the vehicle to be a thoroughly mainstream product the edge comes in front wheel and all wheel drive versions both powered by a horsepower liter v mated to a six speed automatic transmission most of the time this pair works well together providing ample power although occasionally the transmission cant seem to decide what gear it wants to be in if thats the price you pay for an automatic with that many gears and no manual shift mode the benefit should come at the gas pump the front drive edge has an epa combined fuel economy rating of miles per gallon the all wheel drive models is by comparison the v powered version of the midsize five passenger explorer rates mpg in both two and four wheel drive configurations while youll certainly see a sizeable improvement in mileage if you move from an explorer to an edge expect real world fuel economy in the latter to be closer to mpg thats not bad for an suv but its certainly not going to set any records for energy conservation but the edge offers other pluses its cabin is quiet quite a few of its plus pounds are likely devoted to sound deadening materials and despite its heft the edge is a pleasure to drive its not a sporting vehicle but the steering is nicely weighted and the suspension is compliant if a bit firmer than the average suv inside the edge is nondescript in a good way in that youll hardly notice the interior is flirting with a few unseemly touches even an untrained eye can spot several different finishes on the plastics and the corporate parts bin switches are run of the mill but theres little inside the edge to draw your close attention no crazy attempts at stylizing the instrument panel or other evidence of designers run wild indeed the one interior option worth mention is a giant two pane sunroof that affords both front and rear passengers a view outside as solid an effort as the edge is the question remains is this the vehicle thats going to turn around ford probably not but its a step in the right direction ford will sell plenty of edges precisely because nothing about the vehicle hasnt been done before and several times over at that its been more than a decade since the first car based suvs were introduced and even ford tried its hand at building something like the edge once already the unlikable and slow selling freestyle debuted in a seven passenger suv that borrowed its styling from the explorer camp speaking of which it seems that the no market for the edge would be customers who have either grown weary of their explorers or just used them up to many consumers there is little practical difference between the two at least in everyday utility so you cant tow your house behind an edge big deal it will haul your kids and groceries just fine this leaves ford in something of a bind it now has three suvs competing for roughly the same buyers with the distinctions between the edge freestyle and explorer finer than many can perceive is it unreasonable to ask how this was allowed to happen what if ford had got it right the first time and introduced the edge instead of the freestyle two years ago would the blue oval still be in peril today lets take it one step further and ask what might have happened if the edge had become the new version of the explorer rather than the model whose sales fell in it has been reported that fords plans call for the explorer to shift to a car based platform in a couple of years what if ford had been ahead of the curve in implementing this strategy now that would have been a bold move owners manual heres how the ford edge compares
