weekend journal the man who shook up vegas a college statistics dropout has built a peerless record of picking winning teams sam walker on dr bob and the casinos efforts to stop him las vegas veteran sports bettors and bookmakers are not prone to fantastic notions they like to think that everything new is just something old in a fashionable suit but this fall the stereotype no longer fit years of studied cynicism gave way to breathless talk las vegas had a mystery on its hands each thursday morning at precisely a m nevada time every major casino sports betting operation in the world from here to costa rica was being simultaneously pounded by thousands of bettors wagering millions of dollars on the same few college football games odder still most of these lock step bets were turning out to be winners costing the casinos a fortune to protect themselves bookmakers broke with protocol and began making unusually large and sudden corrections to their betting lines or "point spreads " at least one offshore casino disabled its web site for maintenance and restored it only after adjusting the odds "the whole thing was unreal and unbelievable " says robert walker the race and sports book director for mgm mirage in las vegas "in years ive never seen anything like it " there were rumors some thought terrorists were involved or hackers or maybe a shadowy international gambling syndicate known as the asian group but as the month wore on the truth began to bubble up through the las vegas whisper pool turns out there was no grand conspiracy the global business of sports betting was being jolted every week by one person an obscure year old statistician from san francisco named dr bob if youve never placed a sports bet in america you are fast becoming a member of the minority since its beginnings at colonial horse tracks in the th century the amount of money americans wager on sports has grown to rival the gross domestic product of new zealand from mondays college football championship game between florida and ohio state through the next calendar year more than million americans will wager an estimated &# billion on sports less than &# billion will be offered legally at nevada casinos where bettors must be present to wager the bulk of it about &# billion according to analysts and law enforcement officials flows through office pools local bookies and offshore online casinos while these forms of gambling are illegal under u s law the authorities rarely prosecute individual bettors if theres one bedrock law of sports gambling its that the people taking bets the bookmakers always win some of this is due to the haplessness of average bettors or "squares " who never fail to make dumb wagers the rest is a matter of design by taking commissions on bets and using oddsmaking tools like point spreads and bet limits the worlds bookies have engineered the system to their favor gamblers wagering against a point spread must win more than half their bets about to make a profit and must be closer to to make a comfortable living this is no small feat experts say there may be fewer than people who can sustain these rates over time most of them belong to professional betting syndicates that hire teams of statisticians wager millions every week and keep their operations secret nearly everybody else is losing money in nevadas casino sports operations or books those rooms at caesars palace or the mirage that are walled by televisions and tote boards earned &# million in revenue a increase from nonetheless even the grandest edifices in las vegas have a habit of toppling nevadas casinos have not been able to match the recent boom in betting at online casinos though their operations are illegal under u s law american bettors dont seem to care in they made an estimated &# billion in online sports wagers bookmakers say the popularity of internet betting combined with the volume of sports information available online has made the betting public larger better informed and less predictable no one knows what this means for the business but recent events have raised a new possibility if the market keeps growing in size and sophistication smart handicappers may discover that it can be just as lucrative to sell their picks as it is to bet them bob stoll answers his door in jeans and an untucked blue button down shirt its a foggy afternoon in san francisco and mr stoll has been up since before daybreak analyzing college basketball games though he goes by dr bob a nickname he earned playing basketball in high school mr stoll is not a doctor the son of an engineer and an insurance company account executive from vallejo calif he majored in statistics at the university of california berkeley but never graduated tall and athletic looking with sandy brown hair he looks more like the actor richard chamberlain than a casino regular he has two cats doesnt smoke drinks bottled water while he works drives a bmw and listens to john mayer the only jewelry he wears is a wedding band his wife rebecca is a writer who attended brown university their apartment in the haight district is expensive without being lavish theres an abstract print over the fireplace and a view of the golden gate bridge from the roof deck though he makes a living handicapping college and pro football and basketball mr stoll rarely visits las vegas hes never placed a bet in one of the citys sports books and hasnt attended an nfl game since he was he does not make a habit of watching sports on tv "your eyes can only fool you " he says put him in a different setting and he might be running a hedge fund developing office towers or monitoring the currency markets but in the last three months mr stoll has emerged to become one of the worlds most influential sports handicappers and when it comes to predicting the outcomes of college football games he is peerless by his records which have been tracked by dozens of bettors and bookmakers the recommendations hes made on college football in the last three seasons have turned out to be winners against the point spread of the time in he finished with wins and losses for a success rate of while runs like this are rare they are not unprecedented in the s a syndicate called the computer group developed predictive models for sports that helped them soak las vegas for about &# million at other times professional or "sharp" groups like the kosher boys or the poker players made off with millions too but what separates mr stoll from these professionals and makes him so frightening to bookmakers is that hes not hoarding his information hes distributing it to the public in fact anyone who wants mr stolls advice can visit his web site drbobsports com and buy a subscription package for anywhere from &# to &# all that pandemonium on thursdays in las vegas was no coincidence thats the day mr stoll sends an email to his subscribers telling them which college football teams to bet on the following weekend this season as his subscriber base jumped the money his clients were wagering on thursdays increased to the point that the casinos could no longer afford to ignore it "the amount of money being pushed through the counters its got to be insane " says mr walker of mgm mirage "if were taking &# bets and other sports books in nevada are taking &# there must be millions being bet offshore " anyone looking for betting advice does not have to wander far the web is thick with ads for sports handicappers or touts who offer guaranteed "locks" and claim to have success rates as high as their survival is a testament to the gullibility of the average bettor "its a very shifty group " says glen walker a veteran sports gambler and line making consultant for a casino in antigua "at least of them misrepresent their records " while mr stoll has been a tout for years he does not follow the standard business model he has no employees he declines to advertise or swap links with other handicapping sites in online essays he says there is no such thing as a lock and advises clients to bet in a disciplined pattern that leaves less than a chance of exhausting their bankrolls at the height of his hot streak in he sent clients a message imploring them not to get carried away "im not going to hit every year " he says more unusual is mr stolls enthusiasm for describing his methods on his web site he discusses the tools he uses to analyze football games a mathematical model that estimates everything from turnovers to the final score a handful of "fundamental indicators" good running teams tend to play better at home for instance and more than "situational angles" he uses to forecast performance patterns that do not show up in the raw stats he makes unapologetic use of terms like variances square roots binomials and standard distributions sports betting he says should be viewed as "an investment rather than a gamble " though he will not say how many subscribers he has how much money he earns or whether he bets his own games mr stoll says he makes his living as a handicapper not a bettor by any measure its fair to say he makes a good living if he has subscribers paying an average of &# each his annual income would be &# million elihu feustel a professional gambler from indiana not only bets mr stolls games he says most of the biggest syndicates in las vegas are subscribers too in two years he says mr stoll has cost bookmakers at least &# million "hes the only winning handicapper i know who makes his living selling his information " he says as his reputation grows mr stoll is learning that notoriety cuts both ways there have been rumors that he doesnt exist that hes really a front for a chinese syndicate or that hes giving out his picks early to some rich bettors not true he says then came the great battle of wits with the bookmakers for years mr stolls routine started on sundays when he would download the college box scores and organize the data hed spend two days working with his models and angles and another one writing a blurb on every upcoming game when his clients received his recommended bets on thursdays they would have hours to bet at their leisure but in mr stoll noticed that a few minutes after he sent his advice the lines on those games would shift slightly the moves were not big enough to cause a stir but they did get the phone ringing one day the principal of a major sports betting syndicate called to offer him a job while the line moves were flattering at first they quickly became a problem by the beginning of the college football season within seconds of the moment he pressed "send" on his thursday picks one online sports book would adjust the odds to make his recommendations less likely to pay off seconds after that every other major casino in the world would fall into line the bookmakers had clearly subscribed he says and were trying to change the lines before his clients could make bets representatives for three of the most influential online casinos declined to comment when a stock analyst moves the market with a recommendation investors who get in early can make money on it regardless of its merits "its just the opposite in my business " mr stoll says when he makes picks its as if brokers and traders collude to drive down the price as his customers started to complain mr stoll fought back rather than bundling his "best bets" into one thursday email he split them into groups of two and staggered them every two minutes when this didnt work he sent them one at a time every three minutes only to discover that clients with slow email servers were getting them too late finally he set up a private web page where he can reveal the picks to everyone at once lately theres a new problem people are posting his picks on free internet forums some days mr stoll says "i want to be anonymous again " if modern sports gambling has a spiritual father its a chicago bookmaker named charles mcneil when mr mcneil quit his job as a securities analyst to devote himself to gambling in the s its conventions were very different bets on a sport like football were based on "straight" odds if army was favored to beat navy for instance the game might be offered at to the problem if the game wasnt expected to be close it was difficult to find anyone willing to bet on the favorite for bookmakers this was bad news when taking bets the only safe strategy is to balance the wagering to make sure your liability is the same no matter what happens in the game by splitting all the bets and factoring in a small commission or "juice " a bookie will always profit mr mcneils solution was to switch the focus from which team would win to something less predictable the final scoring margin or point spread rather than favoring army at to bookmakers would set the spread at a logical number say points if army "covered" the spread or beat navy by more than army bettors would win if army failed to win by or lost navy bettors would collect the system worked impeccably not only did it increase betting it made it much easier for bookmakers to stay balanced if the public bet heavily on one side of a game bookmakers would shift the point spread until smart bettors began making wagers on the other side most of the time the bookmakers and wiseguys would win while the public got clobbered the problem with mr stolls emergence is that he threatens to undermine this equilibrium by sharing his advice with the public hes creating more sharp bettors and by enabling them to bet as one hes made the sports books more vulnerable to bad lines while they make money las vegas sports betting operations are not especially profitable a typical nevada sports book produces about &# in revenue per square foot less than one third of the revenue generated by slot machines or "pit" games like craps and blackjack all told sports books generate only about of the states gaming revenue if they werent such a draw for casino visitors they might have been paved over by now whats not clear is what may happen if their profits continue to shrink at the hands of a talented tout the job of defending the casinos falls to the handicappers at las vegas sports consultants one of several companies the casinos hire to supply betting lines for their sports books the companys chief operating officer ken white learned the handicapping business from his father and worked his way up from taking parlay cards at a sports book to opening his own consultancy he works hours a week and rarely takes a day off inside the black notebooks on his desk he keeps "power ratings" for hundreds of teams ranging from the dallas cowboys to the marist college mens basketball squad they are based on a mix of algorithms and subjective factors that he calls " science and art " he acknowledges that mr stoll and his followers have cost the sports books money lately hes instructed his staff to study mr stolls picks but over the years mr white says hes seen enough touts get hot to know how the story ends the more the point spreads move the less effective his advice becomes and when the bookmakers figure him out his disciples will drift away "he needs to enjoy this while its going on right now " he says bob stolls handicapping career began at berkeley when he entered a &# nfl pool and after doing a few minutes of simple math won &# from then on his statistics classes became excuses to feed football data through campus mainframes after winning of his bets in three years he quit school to become a tout he built his business by publishing a betting guide advertising a number writing columns for gambling publications and appearing on radio shows he also waited tables in as numbers began to fall out of vogue he made a desperate move he equipped his web site to take credit cards over the next six weeks he made &# he says "and that was that " for most of his career mr stoll handicapped teams by looking for situations or "angles" that had a way of predicting future results if a college football team was favored by seven points or more in a minor bowl after losing their last game for instance mr stoll would know that the last teams who met that criteria had covered the point spread only eight times if one of these strong angles applied to a team he would bet accordingly but after a losing season in football in mr stoll decided to add another layer of rigor for nfl games hed built a mathematical model to project how many points each team was likely to score in a coming matchup with three years of data and hundreds of hours of tinkering mr stoll built a math model for college as well as these methods have worked they have done nothing to cut his workload in the months when basketball and football overlap mr stoll works hours a day nearly every day sleeping in bursts of no more than four hours the carpet below his desk chair has been worn bald "i tell him to stand up so he doesnt get blood clots in his legs " his wife says much of his time is spent making tiny adjustments if a team lost yards on a running play he checks the game summary to make sure it wasnt a botched punt he compensates for the strength of every teams opponents it takes him eight hours just to calculate a rating he invented to measure special teams trivial as this seems mr stoll says the extra work makes his predictions better despite his mathematical bent mr stoll does not discount psychology if his records show that military teams tend to play their best in bowl games hell incorporate that into his analysis too "being creative with numbers is more important than being the best at analyzing them " he says all the work culminates on thursdays when mr stoll sends out his college football "best bet" selections there are usually four or five of them all weighted from two stars to five depending on how much his projection differs from the point spread for the recent alamo bowl mr stolls analysis ran words covering everything from the likely number of texas turnovers to the potential impact of iowa defensive back adam shada while the sports books listed texas as a point favorite mr stoll said his math model favored them by only five and his situational angles favored iowa moreover he wrote iowa would likely be more motivated to play in this minor bowl game than texas the defending national champs he told his clients to bet on iowa meaning texas would not cover the point spread the moment he sent this pick to clients last month the bookmakers were waiting within seconds casinos moved the point spread by as many as two points in iowas favor in the end the move wasnt big enough texas won the game by just two points confirming mr stolls prediction no handicapper is immune from rough spells mr stoll has now had two consecutive losing seasons in the nfl and while he was right about iowa his current record in this years bowls is some of his most recent subscribers are already venting on gambling forums "so far all he has done is torch my money " writes one its a story mr stoll says hes heard thousands of times from clients who dont look at the long term even good bets lose of the time he says but some clients dont grasp that "they think im either hot or im cold " if the bookmakers ever put him out of business mr stoll says hed be happy to manage his stock portfolio raise kids coach sports and maybe run for school board one thing he wont do is become a professional gambler "im not flashy by nature " he says "i dont need three houses and a boat i just like to handicap for me its about problem solving " performance peak since bob stoll has recommended bets on college football or about per season here are his results when betting against a point spread in las vegas bettors must win of their wagers to make a profit year win loss tie
