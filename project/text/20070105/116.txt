weekend journal theater magic in miniature new york big budget productions are the garlic in the salad of a drama critics life a coarse exciting flavor of which you can tire all too quickly i like them enormously when theyre done well just as i like dancers who can jump really high but if youre looking for magic youre more likely to find it in a theater small enough to put you within a stones throw of the stage when you sit that close sparks start to fly and suddenly you and the actors start breathing in unison swept up in the collective pursuit of illusion thats why im pleased to direct you to a pair of shows currently being performed in two very small off broadway houses neither is the least bit fancy and both are disarmingly delightful "room service" is a hard charging farce about a fast talking broadway producer with a heart of brass who cant raise enough cash to pay his hotel bill written by john murray and allen boretz it opened on broadway in ran for performances and was sold to hollywood as a vehicle for the marx brothers who filmed it the following year to modest comic effect it wasnt exactly their kind of show the peccadillo theater company an off broadway troupe that specializes in "forgotten american classics " has brought it back to town for the first time since farce is the trickiest of theatrical genres to pull off it requires on the nose timing and cocksure bravado but this production directed with zany aplomb by dan wackerman is funny enough to take your mind off anything short of a death sentence the fun starts with david edwards a human perpetual motion machine with the voice of a sandblaster his hyperactive demeanor is well suited to the role of gordon miller the unscrupulous producer of "godspeed " who never saw a pocket he couldnt pick mr edwards is supported by a stageful of class a clowns who slam the four doors of chris joness hotel room set more or less continuously this is a very loud show "room service" is an american style farce meaning that the characters are out for money not sex except for a familiar seven letter oath uttered frequently and with lip smacking gusto by sterling coyne who plays gregory wagner supervisor of the white way hotel and sucker in chief its the cleanest show ive seen since "the fantasticks " and the funniest since "the drowsy chaperone " it ought to run forever but it closes in three weeks so head for the soho playhouse and forget your post holiday blues however bad they may be as the producers of "high fidelity" learned to their dismay few coups are harder to carry off than turning a popular movie into a successful stage show vincente minnellis "meet me in st louis " among the half dozen best film musicals ever made was adapted for the stage by hugh wheeler and brought to broadway in it closed its doors seven months later not a bad run but not a good one either now the irish repertory theatre has slimmed it down to off broadway proportions and given it a revival so stylish that i cant help but wonder why the original production which i didnt see failed to ring the bell everything about "meet me in st louis" is satisfying starting with tony straigess decor though it doesnt amount to much more than a piano a rocking horse a half dozen straight back chairs and a picture of a trolley car hung on the wall hollywood it isnt but the simple look of the set oozes unpretentious charm so does the person cast especially bonnie fraser whose heart shaped face and candied apple voice make her a plausible stand in for the young judy garland the singing of her colleagues is somewhat unpolished but that just adds to the impression that what youre seeing is not so much a theatrical production as a homemade entertainment the kind of show that an incredibly talented family might put on in its living room even the "orchestra " a three piece potted palm ensemble tucked into a corner of the stage adds to the endearing intimacy ive had a lot to say in this space about charlotte moore the companys artistic director whose productions of "mrs warrens profession" and "endgame" ranked high among my favorite shows of recent seasons how shes managed to cram a musical into the irish reps l shaped auditorium which is roughly the size of a one bedroom apartment is beyond me all i can tell you is that ms moore is one of the directors i admire most a smart creative craftsman who always gets the rabbit out of the hat come to "meet me in st louis" and let her show you a good old time mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com room service peccadillo theater company soho playhouse vandam st &# closes jan meet me in st louis irish repertory theatre w nd st &# &# closes jan
