nardellis severance the washington post few home depot shareholders are mourning the departure of robert nardelli as ceo this week and we arent about to defend his performance but someone needs to rebut the claim which is almost as rampant as the schadenfreude at his fall that mr nardelli is getting a &# million "severance" package as a reward for having failed "seeing red over a golden parachute " declared the washington post in a fairly typical headline house financial services chairman barney frank who wants to turn executive pay into a democratic campaign theme piled on by claiming that "mr nardellis contribution to raising home depots stock value consists of quitting and receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to do so " the truth is that nearly all of that &# million isnt severance at all but was part of mr nardellis original employment contract in other words it was part of the package that the home depot board offered to lure him in the first place keep in mind that when he was hired in mr nardelli had been a star at general electric one of the three executives competing to succeed jack welch as that companys ceo when he lost out to jeff immelt mr nardelli was a hot executive property in a world that isnt exactly full of them at the time too home depot was considered fortunate to get him the retailer had been growing fast and in its shares were near the stratosphere like just about everyone elses at the top of the bubble the board wanted a ceo who could keep les bon temps rolling and so it offered mr nardelli a big chunk of shareholder wealth to take the job and by the way the terms were disclosed in the annual home depot proxy that contract cant be abrogated now simply because the board has concluded it made a mistake of that &# million figure more than &# million is owed to mr nardelli as part of his original job offer that includes &# million in unvested deferred stock awards another &# million in vested deferred shares &# million in retirement benefits and &# million in earned bonuses even a &# million cash payment upon termination was part of his original contract the bulk of what could fairly be called "severance" is &# million in "miscellaneous benefits" that the company plans to disclose in more detail in its k filing with the securities and exchange commission next week but even that was negotiated in return for mr nardelli signing a non compete agreement and a four year pledge not to solicit home depot employees or customers in other words this is a fairly standard termination deal to protect the companys competitive interests we recount all this because it illustrates a reality of corporate compensation too often ignored amid the furor over ceo pay top executive talent is hard to find and boards are willing to pay a premium to get it their hiring decisions dont always work out whose do but theyll pay a lot to reduce that risk this may be unpleasant for reporters and other egalitarians to hear but its a fact of the marketplace public company ceos face the harshest scrutiny because their pay packages are disclosed but some of the largest compensation deals these days are being offered by private equity recruiters we doubt henry kravis or the carlyle group are parting with big chunks of their equity because they dont think their ceo hires are worth it home depots flat share price aside one of mr nardellis flaws was a tin ear for the new politics of ceo pay the afl cio thinks it has found a populist issue and its political allies in congress and at state pension funds are picking up the envy theme as a prelude to mr nardelli embarrassed the home depot board that hired him by letting himself become a target of this campaign compounding the error by trying to avoid questions at last years annual shareholder meeting it also didnt help mr nardelli that one of the home depot directors who hired him is ken langone who also helped to set dick grassos pay at the new york stock exchange this makes the executive "greed" theme music even more fun to play were not sure where this latest populist campaign is headed but the beginning of wisdom would be for the tub thumpers to stop confusing "severance" with hiring pay see related letters "letters to the editor was nardelli really a failure it depends on who you ask" wsj jan
