no consensus on regulating hedge funds officials around globe aim to protect markets but differ on methods hedge funds are coming under increasing scrutiny from global regulators central banks and finance ministries but despite the recent collapse of several prominent funds differences among the watchdogs over any proposals to regulate these ever larger players are likely to generate more talk than action european officials are pushing for more disclosure of hedge fund portfolios or a ratings system like that for corporate debt german officials using their chairmanship of the group of eight leading nations this year are particularly aggressive buyers bewarethe issue a lot of people seem to want to regulate hedge funds but countries cant yet get their moves coordinated the u s philosophy rather than changing hedge fund behavior just make the funds take money only from the wealthy and "sophisticated "on the table the sec has proposed a rule to limit the investors who qualify to invest in hedge funds but u s and british officials are taking a more hands off approach advocating additional study and at least in the u s focusing on making sure hedge funds take money only from the wealthy and sophisticated rather than on changing hedge fund behavior to minimize risks to the global financial system in addition to disagreements among global policy makers hedge funds are basking in a u s appeals court ruling last year that foiled an initial attempt by u s regulators to force hedge fund advisers to register with the securities and exchange commission phillip goldstein the manager who challenged the secs registration rule now wants to go even further he is asking the sec to exempt his fund from a rule that requires funds managing more than &# million to disclose equity positions every quarter he says that amounts to disclosure of his intellectual property if the sec doesnt grant his request mr goldstein has made it clear he will pursue the matter in court hedge funds are lightly regulated pools of capital that wield an estimated &# trillion these funds play a significant role in financial markets and at times in the affairs of the companies in which they invest they dont fit neatly in the traditional baskets of financial regulation which govern banks mutual funds brokerage firms insurance companies and pension funds government officials generally acknowledge the virtues of hedge funds including the liquidity or market activity that they provide and the way they use derivatives and other financial instruments to shoulder financial risks that others want to shed there is a nagging worry among many regulators and central banks that hedge funds may pose a significant risk to the global financial system and could precipitate or exacerbate a monetary crisis they have expressed a desire for a borderless solution "given their explosive growth the instruments they trade and the evolution of our financial marketplace we must continually assess their actions and impact on the market " treasury secretary henry paulson has said the hedge fund industry is braced for intensifying scrutiny which is likely to include congressional hearings in the u s the managed funds association which represents hedge funds in washington recently enlarged its staff and hired lisa mcgreevy a former lobbyist with the financial services roundtable it says its goal is to demystify hedge funds on capitol hill "we are trying to work with the policy makers to help them understand what the asset managers are doing because the big question here is who are they and what are they doing " ms mcgreevy said today hedge funds are mainly regulated indirectly through the rules governing the banks and brokerage houses that they trade with and borrow from in the united kingdom hedge fund managers are required to register with the financial services authority making them subject to random inspections and examinations in the u s more than advisers have revoked their registration citing the appeals court decision registration in the u s is voluntary unless the adviser manages more than u s funds and more than &# million about advisers are registered and the funds are subject to periodic inspections and examinations and must have a compliance officer and code of conduct in place sec enforcement officials have said they expect to bring several enforcement actions against hedge funds in the near term the secs legal setback has further slowed u s attempts at regulation sec chairman christopher cox testified in july that "to the maximum extent possible our actions should be nonintrusive " timothy geithner president of the new york federal reserve has said that it is important to monitor hedge funds but that it isnt desirable to regulate them for now in continental europe skepticism of hedge funds is greater the european central bank which makes monetary policy for the countries that share the euro currency but hasnt any mandate to police markets or investors has called for more transparency and expressed interest in proposals to create an international registry to which hedge funds would report their investment positions continuously hedge funds would pass along current information about for instance what is in their portfolio to independent service providers which would then customize the data for investors and banks hedge funds have balked saying that providing details of their positions could cause them to lose their competitive edge and harm returns germanys central bank the bundesbank working with the german finance ministry suggests hedge funds voluntarily adhere to a code of conduct governing corporate governance and risk management it also wants them to submit to external voluntary ratings of investment strategies and risk management structures much like standard &amp poors and moodys debt ratings the european central bank however in a recent report said rating concerns probably cant keep up with funds fast changing portfolios "credit ratings are not free " it added "which means that they might only be affordable for large funds " edgar meister chairman of the ecbs banking stability committee and a member of the bundesbank board predicts investors would flock to rated funds in a recent speech to a german parliamentary panel though he said ratings wouldnt mitigate "the danger that a deterioration of the financial situation of a hedge fund will be realized too late " in an interview mr meister also said the fact that hedge fund issues will be discussed at this years g meetings is positive even though concrete proposals are unlikely to emerge "success would be to discuss these issues at the highest political levels and perhaps to find common consensus " he said the european commission which has the legal power to seek laws to regulate hedge funds has been less interested than other european governments in cracking down on them an outside report it commissioned last summer found that "the existing light touch regulatory approach has served the industry its investors and the wider market well " and in november charlie mccreevy the european commissioner for internal markets said "there are currently no regulatory gaps which call for eu level intervention to regulate hedge funds above and beyond those measures that are already in place at the national and european level " british regulators take a different stance from others in europe the fsas chairman callum mccarthy speaking at conference in germany last year said that asking hedge funds for transparency on their positions has little practical benefit and could prove destabilizing to markets the u k which is home to of europes hedge fund assets requires hedge fund managers to fill out forms detailing their business plan the capital they hold to cover liabilities and details of managers such as whether they have criminal records yet many u k hedge fund companies are domiciled abroad particularly in the caribbean so arent regulated by london still a fund manager needs to register with the fsa which checks on controls and management culture at least once every three years the fsa also brings the largest hedge fund managers together every quarter to discuss regulatory issues hedge funds need to send in quarterly returns on their funds and basic balance sheet data in the u s lawmakers have turned their attention away from how funds invest toward who is investing in the funds as a way to protect vulnerable investors members of congress have said they are concerned with pension investments in hedge funds and the sec last month proposed a rule that would limit the number of individual investors who qualify to invest in hedge funds by raising the minimum threshold of investment acumen they must meet marcus
