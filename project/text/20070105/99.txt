we are all in it together michael spence in the peoples bank of china counterpart of our federal reserve accumulated &# billion of additional reserves and is well on its way to holding &# trillion of reserves passing japan as the largest holder of reserves in the world the accumulation in was the policy action that caused the value of the yuan to remain stable relative to the dollar casual conversation and commentary lead most americans to think that this accumulation of reserves corresponds to a large trade surplus in china achieved by holding the value of their currency down in fact the chinese trade surplus is not that large it is well under of gdp smaller in percentage terms than the u s trade deficit the accumulation of reserves in china is not primarily a trade surplus issue in chinas trade surplus was &# billion net inbound foreign direct investment was another &# billion and then notwithstanding capital controls there was an additional largely unwanted net capital inflow of &# billion one can think of this as speculative investment not caught by the capital control system the combination of the trade surplus and another &# billion surplus on the private capital account adding up to &# billion would have put strong upward pressure on the value of the currency risking a sudden and steep loss of competitiveness to prevent this china bought foreign and largely dollar denominated assets it is clear from the numbers just cited that three fourths of the reserve accumulation was designed to undo the large net positive inflow on the capital account and not just the trade surplus chinas trade surplus with the u s is running in excess of &# billion much larger than its overall trade surplus why it runs large deficits in commodities and energy and in capital goods imported from other countries particularly in east asia it would not take much another round of increases in energy and commodities to eliminate the trade surplus though not the net inflow on the private capital account exports have been and are an important driver of growth in the chinese economy the concern is that the large surplus on the private capital account will push the exchange rate up and make the export sector less competitive resulting in a slowing of growth the strategy is to gradually let the yuan rise in value monitoring the effect on exports and growth in effect china has modest inflation and a reasonable balance between demand and capacity but is out of external balance the policy is to maintain internal balance while simultaneously moving toward external balance without losing growth this involves letting the exchange rate rise but at a measured pace reducing the excessively high rate of domestic saving and stimulating domestic consumption to take up the slack created by any loss of momentum in exports in short the mix of exports and the now large domestic economy as drivers of growth will shift steadily over time chinese policy makers understand that holding the exchange rate down and preventing this shifting mix runs the risk of locking the economy into a labor intensive export mode for too long letting the currency rise will put the right kind of pressure on the economy to evolve as incomes rise as is usual in healthy policy environments there is a lively internal debate about what the right speed is it is worth noting that many other countries are accumulating reserves not at chinas level but still significant which means they are to some extent holding the values of their currencies down unlike china most of them do not have the large capital inflows with which to contend there are two motives for this reserve accumulation which has become pronounced since the late s one is to put the countries in a position to exercise some control over the exchange rate and hence their competitive positions in global markets exports and growth the other is a kind of self insurance admittedly expensive against having to borrow in periods of volatility or crisis and weakness this appears to be one of the lessons learned bitterly in the currency crises of the late s the u s position on china is politically driven and is partly right and partly incoherent the part that is right and well understood in china is that holding the yuan down removes pressure for the economy to evolve and keep up with development another point on which there is at least some agreement among professionals in finance economics and policy inside and outside of china is that there is much to be done to increase the capacity transparency and efficiency of the financial services sectors in china a necessary preliminary to safely opening up the capital account by removing capital controls one of the puzzling features of chinas years of high growth has to do with how it was accomplished without more capacity and allocative efficiency in the financial sector its performance runs counter to conventional doctrine in economics and to the advice that is often given to developing countries about reform priorities as chinas capital markets mature and capital controls are reduced the authorities will allow domestic savings to be channeled into foreign investment a step which could produce a large increment in private capital outflows and would considerably reduce the accumulation of reserves in the peoples bank of china the part of our foreign policy stance that is incoherent is the implicit sometimes explicit notion or belief that our overall trade deficit or our bilateral trade deficit with china is closely connected to chinas policy of neutralizing the impact of the trade surplus and capital inflows the u s trade deficit goods and services in was &# billion there was actually a surplus on the services side of &# billion larger than the chinese trade surplus the trade deficit represents about of u s gdp the bilateral trade deficit with china is about of the overall trade deficit in the u s our trade deficit is the mirror image of the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment in the united states as long as that difference persists we will run a large deficit on current account and that will be perceived as exporting jobs at least in the sectors that are impacted and in the political arena if china and japan stopped accumulating reserves and let their currencies values rise more quickly it is possible that the u s savings rate would shoot up closer to investment but not likely more likely is that the u s trade deficit would simply readjust as a portfolio matter among other exporting countries in the developing world no one knows with certainty japan and china for similar but somewhat different reasons have a problem with high savings the excess of savings relative to investment goes abroad the u s has the opposite condition we finance a deficit of savings relative to investment with foreign investment two of those large foreign investors are the central banks in japan and china they could change their behavior in the near future developing a sudden lack of willingness to buy additional dollar denominated assets but such a sudden change is very unlikely not only do they not want a sudden shift in the values of their currencies but a sudden shift away from accumulating reserves would cause the dollar to fall further raise the value of their own currencies and reduce their export growth by an indeterminate amount it would also force savings up or investment down or both in the u s producing with near certainty a recession here that would be exported world wide in short order in this sense we are all in it together the graceful way out of this is gradual an increase in u s savings relative to investment a reduction in savings relative to investment in china and japan a probable further lowering of the market determined value of the dollar in the short and medium term as part of the process it would be useful if we stopped pretending or alleging that chinas exchange rate policies are the root cause of our trade deficit if our savings rate is stubbornly stuck below our investment rate and if china does allow its currency to revalue over time then we will simply run a deficit with another collection of countries and from a domestic point of view nothing much will have changed except that we wont have this subject to discuss with china anymore mr spence a
