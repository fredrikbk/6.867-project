middle seat mailbox regional airlines battle woes readers blame regionals big partners for some problems but not all of them the chief executive of one regional airline called me to complain that this weeks middle seat didnt put enough emphasis on how big airlines control and sometimes destroy the schedule of regional partners leading to lousy results in service measures such as on time arrival flight cancellations and baggage handling as the column noted big airlines grab the takeoff and landing slots of their smaller feeder carriers when bad weather hits and forces airports to reduce flights the theory all agree makes sense move the greatest number of people inconvenience the smallest number so passengers on big planes get priority over small planes while id agree regional airlines are at the mercy of their patrons and did try to make that point in the column i also think several regional airlines themselves have suffered from lousy service this fall in particular problems they are fully capable of fixing themselves and many readers agree as always letters have been edited tom lutzy said he likes regional jets because they are comfortable fast and bring jet service to some routes that lacked it but the service snags are a problem he said "yesterday i flew on a comair rj from cincinnati to boston while the in flight service was excellent better in fact than that on the other delta flights the plane was delayed leaving because of a minor maintenance problem further exacerbated when they had to pull the first officer off to fill in somewhere else we waited about minutes for a new first officer to show up " according to mr lutzy the captain told passengers he doesnt believe comair which is reorganizing in bankruptcy court and embroiled in labor disputes with its unions hires enough pilots for all their flights more weather delays followed and when they finally landed "we waited minutes for our luggage which was significantly longer than the wait of passengers on other flights that arrived about the same time " patrick fuller "regional airlines stink period its impossible to get work done on a regional jet with a laptop im " so imagine my flight plus the seats are for people like my wife a size " mr fuller like many road warriors laments the lack of first class seats on many regional jets hes an elite level continental airlines customer but a job change left him flying mostly northwest airlines regional partners while his elite status transfers "because of no upgrade availability im not flying the same airline anymore in fact im flying much more on southwest airlines because its at least a regional jets kill loyalty " hickman beckner "atlantic southeast has always been a mess delta tried putting their own people in there when it was independent still a mess when that didnt work they bought it still a mess they finally threw in the towel and sold it off to skywest and the new owners cant turn it around so long as delta looks upon asa as a bastard step child it will always be a mess with the mainline carriers squeezing the regionals for lower costs things will only get worse " alexander schoch was booked on an p m departure from denver to santa barbara calif and left the united airlines lounge in denver at p m to board the regional flight when he arrived the door was already closed and the plane was pushing back several other customers arrived and were told by the gate agent that the departure had been changed to p m so they were supposed to be on board before p m "we air travelers are being forced to align our expectations with this new level of service " he said tony talalay said hes noticed that mainline carriers try to distance themselves from their symbiotic partners even though they price and sell the tickets on the regionals and market it with their name recently he heard a united gate agent "saying well were not responsible for that its an air wisconsin problem they are a different airline true enough but if the mainline carriers force us onto the regional carriers and book us as if its supposed to be seamless they have to take some responsibility too " kathryn tevington offered some appreciation for regionals and i think many travelers agree with her in her case continental express flights between houston and del rio texas make del rio accessible "plus more comfortable planes nice seats and no middle seat " she said "too bad there isnt better major carrier support of their regionals those smaller subsidiaries sure fill a need " paul carmichael also defended the regionals "the statistics look bad but my experience has been different i prefer the smaller regional aircraft over the majors standard planes they are easier to load and unload and i can check my bag on the ramp if a standard and a regional jet are on the same route i will select the smaller aircraft " have a question about air travel or the airline industry write to me at middleseat wsj com
