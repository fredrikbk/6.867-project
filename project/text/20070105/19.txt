chinas option play state run firms embrace plans shanghai stock options may be losing favor in the u s but in china the government is opening the door to their wider use and encouraging stodgy state run companies to issue them as an incentive for traditionally low paid executives in early december china loosened restrictions that blocked domestically listed state controlled companies from granting stock options and cleared the way for other means of enlarging employees shareholdings now dozens of companies are preparing to set up plans appliance maker qingdao haier refrigerator co says its program could involve million new shares chemicals trader sinochem international corp announced its intention to offer options long before the barrier to them was lifted chinese companies in which the state doesnt have a controlling interest already had the right to issue stock options and last march china let state run companies listed overseas issue options but state run companies account for a big chunk of chinas stock market so the policy change is significant the new rules let the state run companies offer a variety of stock incentive plans two types of which are recommended one is stock options similar to what was popular with u s corporate executives who received the right to buy company shares in the future the other involves directly providing shares to employees shares obtained through either of the two ways cant be sold for at least two years "since the government issued the new regulations the whole capital market is preparing for this " says ji dong board secretary of qingdao haier the shares of which trade in shanghai and hong kong the moves are part of a widening discussion in china about how to compensate executives and make state run firms more efficient and market oriented controlling stakes in most chinese listed companies still are held by the government and managers have long been paid far less than their private sector counterparts even when their enterprises are among the biggest in their industries globally some corporate governance experts say this mismatch could encourage executives to turn to graft but raising compensation for state sector managers is also politically sensitive as chinas leadership struggles to narrow a wealth gap between the countrys rich and poor that has widened steadily during nearly years of market reforms even before regulators allowed options some companies were talking about them when sinochem international the listed arm of chemicals trader sinochem corp made all of its shares fully tradable in mid it said it intended to eventually have a program that could involve million shares in a statement to the shanghai stock exchange sinochem said it wanted executives to have stock options in an effort "to give more confidence to minority shareholders and encourage the management team " baoshan iron &amp steel co the listed unit of shanghai baosteel group corp is another corporation wanting pivotal employees to have more shares "we must have a long term incentive plan to keep talented people " says a human resources manager at baoshan "it will bind together the interests of the management team and the company " these arguments echo those made years ago when corporate america began embracing options in a move aimed at aligning executives interests with those of shareholders and give them added incentive to improve their firms performance but skeptics say that given widespread mismanagement and malfeasance in corporate china options programs could easily fall prey to abuse and become little more than a new way for managers to make money hu weidong director of research at xiangcai securities a shanghai brokerage firm says figuring out how to perfectly meld the interests of shareholders and top managers is "a world puzzle not only in china " state run companies say they are aware of the risks and are taking steps to prevent abuse "this is something china hasnt done before we must be very cautious at the beginning " says the baoshan manager that is one reason he says baoshan doesnt plan to issue stock options instead the company will under certain criteria give cash to top executives for buying shares from the market baoshan says it hasnt decided how many people will be involved qingdao haier part of chinas haier group the countrys largest white goods manufacturer is going with options it says that about employees from nearly all levels from salespeople to the chairman will be eligible to participate though no details are available
