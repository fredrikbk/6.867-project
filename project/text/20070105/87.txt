partly reflects the importance of sea power in dealing with iran a senior administration official tells the times that establishment of a new team "helps the president to make the case that this is a fresh start " but thats not how it feels among much of the senior ranks at the pentagon time reports in the wake of donald rumsfelds departure many officers "looked forward to a day when their views on such crucial issues as the iraq war might carry more weight with the white house " time says but the white house seems determined now to stick with its at least months old idea of raising the number of troops in iraq by at least despite opposition to such a move at the pentagon including recent doubts voiced by the head of the marine corps "we do not believe that just adding numbers for the sake of adding numbers just thickening the mix is necessarily the way to go " gen james conway the new commandant said a few weeks ago mr bush plans to unveil the new strategy next week but the white house is still "struggling to overcome deep differences among advisers over both the deployment of additional u s troops and whether the government of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki can deliver long delayed political and military actions " officials familiar with the debate tell the washington post they hope to work out significant policy details this weekend the post reports in addition to the increased deployment the administration plans to launch the latest financial effort to boost reconstruction and job creation in iraq people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal it wasnt clear how such a move would take into account the way a lack of security derailed past reconstruction efforts even before greater sectarian antipathy made the conflict worse the journal notes the measures are certain to be controversial and may spark an administration fight with the new congress and on several fronts the president today is expected to confirm the move of national intelligence director john negroponte to the no post at the state department and his replacement with adm j michael mcconnell a former head of the national security agency that has raised concerns about what the journal notes is expanding control over the intelligence community by current and retired military officials among other key appointments in the works are the shift of zalmay khalilzad ambassador to iraq and before that afghanistan to the united nations and his replacement with veteran ambassador ryan crocker who currently represents the u s in pakistan and previously did so in syria kuwait and lebanon as the times reports and mr bush yesterday accepted the resignation of white house counsel harriet miers the longtime close aide to the president known for her aborted nomination to the supreme court this comes as the democratic congress prepares investigations of several administration actions and the post says "bush advisers inside and outside the white house concluded that she is not equipped for such a battle and that the president needs someone who can strongly defend his prerogatives " as the world goes so go commodities petroleum prices and some costs of the raw material building blocks of global industry have begun the year on a bearish note but as the wall street journal explains no one factor is behind the declines despite opecs recent decision to cut its production quotas oil prices have continued to fall due in part to warm winter weather while the u s housing slump and easing labor stress at mines has taken pressure off copper prices since the decade began it has been the explosive economic growth in china that led to a world wide tightening of the supply and demand equation largely responsible for the steep rise in commodity prices though a host of geopolitical factors also affect oil and as the journal notes the fate of the global economy this year will probably set the direction for commodity prices with iron ore the key ingredient of steel demand continues to outpace supply as the economist reports late last month the australian mining giant rio tinto said one of its biggest customers agreed to pay more for iron ore in though this marks significantly slower growth than the price jump last year and the increase in the reason is no surprise unrelenting growth in china india and elsewhere rio tinto has increased its production capacity but every ton of ore it produces is gobbled up also of note washington post president bush signed a little noticed statement last month asserting the authority to open u s mail
