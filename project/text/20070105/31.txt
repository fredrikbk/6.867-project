eurolinks daily view bushs new iraq strategy may roil congress the bush administrations retooled iraq strategy is certain to prove controversial and could set the administration on a collision course with the new democratic controlled congress which was formally sworn in thursday most democrats have already expressed opposition to the idea of temporarily boosting the number of u s combat personnel in iraq and have instead coalesced around a proposal to begin withdrawing american military forces from iraq later this spring the strategy that president george w bush is set to announce next week will include new money to boost reconstruction economic growth and job creation efforts all part of a broader effort to boost iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki mr bush is expected to request billions of dollars in new aid for iraq and to call for the deployment of as many as additional american combat troops there as part of a "surge" designed to stabilize baghdad and other violence plagued areas the strategy which the white house has dubbed "the new way forward " is also expected to include a new effort to funnel u s money to moderate iraqi political parties to build a centrist political coalition to support mr maliki however the aid request could emerge as a bigger flashpoint with congress than the troop surge in part because democrats might view the additional dose of money as an investment in an iraqi government about which they have doubts the new iraq money would come on top of the more than &# billion that has already been spent on large scale u s funded

defense white paper should put such thoughts to rest china clearly wants a military worthy of its growing regional and global economic clout it wants stability on its borders and it wants to support and protect its economic prosperity that latter goal depends in large part on energy security our editorial writers argue today china receives about of its oil through the straits of malacca which are protected by the u s without a blue water navy china cant secure sea lanes from the middle east so a major goal of the new white paper is to set out a plan to have chinas military keep pace with its economic growth but also importantly this year and in line with the first goal pyongyangs belligerence has caused a strategic rethink in beijing they argue where it has mostly reserved its heaviest ire for taiwan chinas state council puts pyongyang front and center noting that north korea "has launched missile tests and conducted a nuclear test " and adding "thus the situation on the korean peninsula and in northeast asia has become more complex and challenging " our editorial writers argue that this change also reflects the more nuanced approach of president hu jintao toward taiwan ever since mr hu consolidated his power last year his administration has curbed the strong anti taiwan rhetoric that characterized jiang zemins rule the logic seems to be that taiwans natural economic

discoveries might be just round the corner writes sharon begley this year the large hadron collider a nearly &# billion accelerator at the cern physics lab near geneva will be switched on and it might just produce new kinds of matter that nature has hidden from human eyes the collider will send protons the positive charged particles in atomic nuclei racing around a kilometer tunnel at nearly the speed of light one beam traveling clockwise and another counterclockwise until the protons smash head on million of them per second the impact will have an energy of trillion electron volts the resulting fireball will be of a magnitude that last existed physicists calculate just after the big bang that created the universe out of that energy may come miniature black holes and even evidence that quarks and electrons previously believed to be fundamental actually are made of smaller entities read sharon begleys science column http online wsj com article sb html write to michael connolly
