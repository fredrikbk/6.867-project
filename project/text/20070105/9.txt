boeing flight plan for growth record orders in points to a longer boom cycle a record year for jetliner orders for boeing co spurred by unexpectedly strong demand for its most profitable wide body models provides further evidence that the current boom in aerospace may last as many as two years longer than predicted boeing booked orders for new planes last year a company record that likely will push its order count past that of european rival airbus for the first time since sales of wide body jets which typically carry fatter profit margins than narrow body jets fell compared with when popular new and updated models were introduced but they remained at higher levels than some industry observers had expected with an updated version of the venerable and once dismissed posting a sizable sales increase airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co suffered this past year from production woes on the giant a and delays in fielding a competitor to the boeing dreamliner but it also is expected to post a strong order book for its orders will likely be in the neighborhood of to airplanes according to people familiar with the situation that is a drop from jetliners in the banner year but remains a healthy level airbus plans to announce its numbers on jan the implications for the overall aerospace industry are larger with production slots for most of boeings airplane models already largely filled for the next three years and a healthy backlog for several airbus models aerospace factories world wide can expect higher production rates through at least the two companies legions of suppliers are also set to benefit particularly because more of them have adopted lean manufacturing methods in the down years that will enable them to be more productive with fewer people whats more the major u s and european air carriers have yet to join the shopping spree in a meaningful way both manufacturers are eagerly awaiting their chances to try to sell replacement planes for the thousands of aging jetliners that many of the carriers have elected to keep flying while they shore up their balance sheets "orders of this scale are obviously a good thing " said rob stallard an aerospace analyst for bank of america wide body sales are being driven by growing airlines in asia and the middle east and their interest in flying overseas routes the normal replacement cycle already at a high point is being driven further by the introduction of more fuel efficient models boeing had originally predicted that would be a letdown from the then unprecedented net orders that rolled in during instead airlines lined up to place orders for all sizes of boeing jetliners ranging from a record single aisle s to orders for wide body s and four engine s the dreamliner continued its streak as the best selling boeing wide body bringing in orders in a statement boeing commercial airplanes president and chief executive scott carson said boeing was particularly "excited about the breadth and depth" of the order book he noted that the "strong orders for the past two years are a validation of our strategy of focusing on our customers simplifying our product and services offerings and transforming our production system " based on average list prices before discounts boeings orders are worth about &# billion for the family and &# billion for the longer haul wide bodies that constitute the rest of the fleet the wide body number is particularly significant because those planes typically command better pricing meaning that discounts are often not as steep as they are in the highly competitive single aisle product line in addition to strong order numbers boeing said it delivered planes in three more than it predicted airbus officials have said they expected to deliver about planes in some analysts believe the companies will reach peak production rates in or with boeing delivering about airplanes and airbus leveling off at about boeing has said it expects to deliver between and airplanes in and that deliveries are "expected to be higher " analysts are split on when the major u s and european carriers will begin placing significant orders but many of them are confident that airbus and boeing together will collect a combined orders in if so that will mean that the two manufacturers will have gotten a total of almost new orders since how quickly boeing and airbus whittle down the backlog of unfilled orders will be critical if they build too many airplanes at once they risk a production meltdown similar to one that occurred in that year boeing tried to expand too quickly and ended up shutting down its production lines for a month while missing or delayed parts caught up with the airplanes they were supposed to be on that led to the first yearly financial loss in boeings history boeing also hired tens of thousands of employees to turn out those airplanes when the bottom dropped out of the industry following the sept terrorist attacks boeing was forced to lay off more than people leading to a wave of similar job reductions across the entire supply base this time around boeing officials have vowed to do what they can to smooth out what has traditionally been a roller coaster cycle of boom and bust by metering production so that planes are delivered more gradually over a longer period daniel michaels contributed to this article
