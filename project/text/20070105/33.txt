focus groups invade little girls playtime i pondered the article "the selling of nicki" page one dec which highlighted the brainstorming and focus groups employed by the american girl company to design and create the girl of the year series of dolls and was left feeling initially uneasy as the mother of two young girls my husband and i have purchased many american girl character dolls and bitty babies because they are high quality have a historical component and support creative and imaginative play frankly i never considered the calculated marketing tactics behind the expanding line of dolls later as i drove my daughter and her friend both happily clutching their new matching kaya dolls i stopped to pick up the mail handed the new american girls catalog back to the girls and was stunned to hear them both parrot almost verbatim the comments of the focus groups regarding nicki the girl of the year juxtaposed against the article id read just hours earlier im not certain whether to be impressed or terrified perhaps both would be wise sheila marie untiedt stillwater minn
