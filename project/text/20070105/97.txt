weekend journal books more than idol speculation fame junkies by jake halpern houghton mifflin pages &# in when i saw a park avenue psychiatrist for depression there was one framed object in his office that made me believe he was tops in his field it was a prominently displayed photograph of oprah winfrey that the star had autographed to the doctor with a black marker adding "thanks for all the help " when i asked the psychiatrist how he had come to receive the photo he remarked vaguely that he had been on ms winfreys television show leaving the question open as to whether he had given her any other kind of professional "help " yet the glossy had its desired effect making me feel that if the shrink were good enough to make a rich famous zaftig and possibly a wee bit neurotic single woman appreciative he could certainly do the same for one not so rich and famous today thanks to "fame junkies" author jake halpern i know that my psychiatrist and i were really birging together though it sounds like a portmanteau of binging and purging birging is mr halperns shorthand for "basking in reflected glory " on second thought maybe it is about binging and purging devouring information about celebrities especially if it has to do with ones own proximity to celebrity and disgorging the information for anyone who might be impressed birging is perhaps the most obvious symptom of what mr halpern asserts is americas widespread addiction to celebrity culture mr halpern credits arizona state university psychology professor robert cialdini with coining the basking in reflected glory acronym in the s after the teacher observed that asu students often wore clothes bearing their colleges logo on the day after the schools team won but would rarely do so on the day after it lost mr cialdinis birging research eventually discovered the related phenomenon of "boosting" aiming to make themselves look better people tend to praise a celebrity or well known organization with whom they have a connection the researcher had subjects read a short biography of grigori rasputin that painted the russian mystic as a manipulative villain in the court of czar nicholas ii half the subjects were given a biography in which rasputins birthday was supposedly the same as their own "those subjects who shared a birthday with rasputin were overwhelmingly more likely to rate him positively as a strong and effective leader with many redeeming qualities " mr halpern writes why would anyone be proud of even the most tenuous association with rasputin mr cialdini attributes the impulse not surprisingly to another malady low self esteem maybe theres something to it low self esteem certainly helps explain why someone would bask in the reflected glory however dim of a personal tie to say former "beverly hills " bad girl tiffani thiessen mr halperns pursuit of those who make birging n boosting a way of life leads him to hollywoods fading stars would be stars and hangers on including dean johnson who works for ms thiessen mr johnson is a former health care executive who in at the age of dropped everything to move to los angeles and pursue his dream of slaving for a star mr halpern is clearly fascinated with the story of this man with an m b a from the university of south carolina who once oversaw a corporate department and now oversees a celebritys grocery shopping and insists that his current job is more fulfilling for a birger lucky enough to land a job working for a celebrity familiarity with behavior that might provide fodder for a tell all book about my nightmare boss is instead simply horded as evidence of the birgers proximity to stardom "one person i worked for " says the not naming names mr johnson "had to have their diet snapples on the left hand side of the refrigerator it didnt matter whether the payroll came in or the bills got paid as long as the snapples were on the left hand side of the refrigerator i dont make judgments " mr halpern is in his element when doing character studies and "fame junkies" is bursting with them in addition the birging mr johnson we meet in a chapter called "mobs of fame starved children" young hopefuls who compete in the four day international modeling and talent association convention in new york the child talent industrys largest gathering it is unnerving to see fame addiction in its first flower when achieving actual celebrity rather than basking in its reflection still seems possible mr halpern also introduces us to various behind the scenes tinseltown image makers publicists stylists and a paparazzo his portraits include idolizers such as marcy braunstein a rod stewart superfan of the highest order "if im trying to give flowers at a concert and he doesnt take them from me or he takes them from someone else im crushed " ms braunstein says at his best mr halpern displays an evocative insiderish style reminiscent however slightly of tom wolfes when he peered into s celebrity culture see wolfes description in "the kandy kolored tangerine flake streamline baby " of disc jockey murray the ks basking in the beatles reflected glory unfortunately mr halpern is not satisfied with merely observing he feels the need to offer sociological analysis bolstered by comments from academic experts and data from his own "rochester survey " a poll of middle school students views on celebrity the experts tsk tsking views are predictable and the data are rarely as enlightening as mr halperns character studies is anyone surprised that jennifer lopez edges out jesus christ as preteen girls dream dinner guest mr halpern relies so much on outside opinion that contradictions crop up even when hes writing about non birging non boosting garden variety celebrity watchers in other words alas all of us he steps on his own message at one point mr halpern writes that interest in celebrities is often the manifestation of a lonely single persons desire to form "para social" relationships with stars but at another he approvingly cites duke university researcher michael platts assertion based on his study of information gathering in groups of monkeys that steeping oneself in the celebrity lore offered by us weekly and star magazine gives one "an advantage in the reproductive race " given the researchers apparent hunger for their own celebrity the widely quoted pop culture expert and syracuse university professor robert thompson admits a "raw desire to be acknowledged" perhaps fame junkies are better off without professional advice take two episodes of "oprah" and call me in the morning miss edens "the thrill of the chaste finding fulfillment while keeping your clothes on" was published last month by w publishing group thomas nelson
