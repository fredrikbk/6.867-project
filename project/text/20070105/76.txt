seagate aims to make data storage cool stylish disk drives mark bid to win share in expanding market seagate technology has always been good at selling disk drives now it is taking on a tougher task trying to make data storage cool the scotts valley calif company will use next weeks consumer electronics show in las vegas to test whether users can form an emotional attachment to devices for storing their digital photos movies and songs employing stylish design and useful software and hoping to borrow a page from apple computer inc s ipod media player seagate is hoping its new drives could even become a fashion statement for people who want to carry their data with them "its your life on the go " james druckrey a seagate senior vice president heading the effort says of the new devices not that drive makers havent tried to dress up products before now or produce portable versions but they have never come close to generating ipod style excitement despite significant improvements in a technology that helped make such gadgets useful seagate the no manufacturer in terms of global sales accounted for of the million hard drives shipped in the third quarter according to market researcher isuppli corp it sells drives that are installed inside computers and other products as well as packaging drives for sale as external accessories last year it paid &# billion to buy rival maxtor corp u s retail sales of external drives rose in the third quarter estimates npd group analyst stephen baker citing demand that has been fueled by the rapid conversion of photos videos and other content into digital form tom coughlin an industry consultant in atascadero calif estimates that the "tech savvy" home now has about gigabytes of data stored on various media including cds dvds and disk drives by the same household will have terabytes of data on hand he predicts capacity and price have been prime selling points among makers of disk drives until now but the competition has held prices down and drive makers profits havent been predictable hence the search by seagate and other companies for features and styling that could command a bit more money from consumers for maxtor whose brand remains stronger than seagates in retail stores the company hopes to exploit a widening recognition that users should make backup copies of important data such as family photos maxtor drives which have a vault like look will be marketed under the slogan "save your life " according to mr druckrey such messages may become widespread rival toshiba corp which hasnt marketed a retail brand for external disk drives yesterday said it was entering the north american market for such products seagate hopes to make a bolder statement with new external drives that carry its own name along with the new moniker freeagent they are dark brown emit what seagate calls a "molten amber" glow and have a shape that mr druckrey calls "impossibly thin " they were created with help from frog design inc an industrial design firm and are slated to arrive in stores by march seagate calls those new products "data movers " drawing attention to software and other features that help users share information with others or shift files from machine to machine for example a portable model called freeagent go allows users to plug into someone elses computer and immediately have access to their own personalized information including web favorites contacts and passwords when they unplug the device they leave no trace of their private information on that computer seagate says that freeagent go version which stores as many as gigabytes weighs just ounces and is roughly the size of a cigarette package it is expected to cost &# to &# an even smaller variant the freeagent go small stores just gigabytes and has a suggested price of about &# but it is only slightly larger than a matchbox seagate is also offering a high capacity desktop model called freeagent pro that stores up to gigabytes and costs &# to &# in another new thrust seagate plans to announce its first online storage service at the same time like others that offer such services seagate is hoping to appeal to consumers worried about fire or other threats to drives and who want to offer password protected access to files to friends or family members each freeagent pro model comes with megabytes of online storage which is free for the first six months william watkins seagates chief executive is quick to note that the companys past obsession with price and performance was an obstacle in developing such style conscious devices its executives scratched their heads for example at the idea of adding lights to the new drives to give them a sense of life when they are operating "we would have never put lights on it " mr watkins says "you dont need the light and it costs you money " rival style setting efforts are likely mr coughlin says sandisk corp which focuses on storing data on chips known as flash memory has taken a lead in designing attractive consumer products but demand for data storage could create room for many product categories "its well worthwhile for a company like seagate to try to do something to differentiate themselves " mr coughlin says
