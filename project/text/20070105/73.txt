politics &amp economics a higher bar for foreign buyers security terms in alcatels deal for lucent signal new era washington almost a year after a dubai companys bid to buy an american ports operator sparked a furor on capitol hill the government is taking a tougher line on foreign acquisitions of u s assets the recent purchase of lucent technologies inc by frances alcatel sa to form alcatel lucent is an example of this new direction the deal won u s government approval but only after debate among american economic and security officials underscoring the heightened high level scrutiny now being given to foreign investment in the u s however critics warn that the stepped up scrutiny risks stemming that flow of investments from abroad bush administration officials gave the go ahead to the lucent alcatel deal in november but only after attaching a stipulation that gives the u s the authority to unwind the transaction in the future if the combined companies ever breach security commitments made to the american government this so called evergreen limit which has been deployed rarely was pushed by the department of homeland security which had expressed misgivings about the deal according to administration officials the story of the tough line adopted in the alcatel case reveals much about the new realities facing foreign companies seeking to buy u s assets the process for approving such transactions was tightened after dubai ports worlds failed bid last year to manage operations in several u s ports in its aftermath bush administration officials and lawyers specializing in security reviews say proposed deals are subject to more oversight the bureaucracy is more sensitive to political concerns and national security agencies are more prominent in years past economic officials with more of a free market outlook dominated the vetting of such deals in addition lower level officials may have become less reluctant to kick sensitive decisions upstairs to top level political appointees for final decisions "theres no question theres been a tightening up of the whole process " said attorney ivan schlager who handled the recently concluded investment review for alcatel mr schlager a partner at skadden arps meagher &amp flom llp said foreign led deals can still get done in the u s but "bankers and clients have to understand that reviews are going to be much more rigorous " though foreign direct investment in the u s which covers hard assets like factories and real estate has remained steady in recent years critics worry a tightening of the review system could eventually chill the flow of capital from abroad fdi totaled &# billion in the latest figures available that was down from at the center of the debate is the committee on foreign investment in the united states or cfius the government panel that was set up in to review the national security implications of potentially sensitive foreign investment deals such as those involving military equipment manufacturers led by the treasury department the panel includes representatives of the departments of homeland security defense and state as well as several offices within the white house deliberations are secret but in the past two years the panel has drawn attention with critics on capitol hill saying cfius was too cloistered and dominated by professional bureaucrats with little sensitivity to larger political concerns the dp world uproar dramatized unease with the u s s increasing reliance on foreign capital and led to efforts on capitol hill to toughen the review process leaders of the new democratic congress which opened yesterday are pledging to revive the effort but the administration had already begun making changes to strengthen accountability and disclosure at treasury for example senate confirmed officials now must sign off on final decisions administration officials have stepped up communication with congress on cfiuss agenda providing written summaries of all actions and periodic briefings in addition the intelligence community is taking a more direct role in the review process "its a strengthened process theres more scrutiny but that doesnt mean its unfair " said clay lowery assistant secretary for international affairs at the treasury department mr lowery said about of all proposed deals still undergo only a standard day review without being subjected to a second day investigation invoked when authorities suspect there may be a potential security conflict even so the number of cases brought before cfius has surged last year cfius considered deals from more than different countries double the number of cases handled in officials said and while only seven deals went through the second probe last year that number was an all time high equal to the total number of long term investigations conducted over the five previous years because of the secrecy in the system tracking the impact of cfiuss actions is difficult but attorney david marchick of covington &amp burling llp said public disclosures by companies involved in such reviews showed transactions with a total value of &# billion went through the process in the lucent sale posed special challenges for cfius not only did lucents elite bell labs conduct classified research for the government but the &# billion sale to alcatel was the largest cfius handled last year and although alcatel is a publicly traded company based in a nato member state officials approached the transaction cautiously not wanting to spark another debate over national security and foreign investment "after dubai ports world everybody had their attention focused " said stewart baker the homeland departments assistant secretary for policy lucent and alcatel said the combined companies would create an independent u s subsidiary to handle sensitive projects even so the proposed deal set off alarms at the pentagon and justice department as well as at homeland security where officials began pushing the "evergreen" clause "its obviously very strong medicine " said mr baker lucent and alcatel agreed to the "evergreen" clause but its inclusion sparked concern among business groups four major trade groups the business roundtable the u s chamber of commerce the financial services forum and the organization for international investment complained in a letter to treasury secretary henry paulson the group contended that any provision that allows the government to "potentially unwind" any transaction adds uncertainty to the marketplace and the provision represents a "disturbing departure from the governments stated support for an open trade and investment regime " administration officials said the provision doesnt represent a new precedent for all deals "we are trying very hard to make sure we protect national security and continue to welcome open investment " said treasurys mr lowery
