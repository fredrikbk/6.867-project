weekend journal best of tastings the pursuit of perfection in these wines hit just the right note what makes it delicious earlier this year we conducted a tasting of penfolds grange australias most famous wine from vintages the was so special that it earned a rating of delicious a rare honor a month after the tasting we taped an online video segment about grange so we opened another bottle of the for the camera with the first sip we were both speechless incredibly this bottle was even better when we finally spoke john declared it "absolutely flawless " dottie called it "profound " it was like the most perfect piece of music youve ever heard with each instrument offering its distinct voice but all of the elements working together in perfect harmony ultimately it was the kind of wine that reminded us that truly great wine is made by god not by man what makes a wine delicious thinking that it was touched by god is a pretty good start we taste blind around wines a year for this column we enjoy wine so we find something to like about most wines and we always have when we began drinking wine together more than years ago we kept notes on all of our wines and concluded by ranking them yech ok good very good delicious or delicious those ratings mean pretty much exactly what they say when we started writing this column almost a decade ago we simply continued our personal rating system in the index in one wine the grange rated delicious and others rated delicious this means that fewer than of the wines we tasted rated delicious or better which is pretty typical of our tasting experience through the years in other words we like many wines but wines that stand out far above the rest are rare what are the various elements that added together make a wine delicious obviously it needs to taste good that seems simple but its too fundamental not to mention it should have balance so that no single taste or characteristic overwhelms the others it should have depth and complexity so there are various layers of tastes that reveal themselves over time and keep our interest it should taste like its type sauvignon blanc should taste like sauvignon blanc not like chardonnay but it should take the tastes of its peers to another level perhaps purer or more focused it should have a sense of place tasting it we should be able to imagine it growing in the vineyards of tuscany or the barossa valley it should taste like fruit this is grape juice after all but we should also have a sense that the winemaker had a vision of the wine some sense of what he or she was trying to accomplish from the vineyard to the bottle a good deal of luck goes into a great wine the winemaker cant control the weather after all but great wine is no accident a wine thats delicious will make us notice it not because its flashy and slaps us in the face but because we will know somewhere deep down that it tastes both familiar and different and better that haunting sense will make us stop and try to figure out whats so special about it many wines that are delicious are expensive theres a reason for this good land small yields good oak personal attention things like that cost money but just because a wine is expensive certainly doesnt mean it will be delicious and just because a wine is inexpensive doesnt mean it wont be delicious one of our delicious wines of the year cost &# it was bernardus winery sauvignon blanc in a broad blind tasting of american sauvignon blanc it rose to the top and planted a flag on the hill it got everything right the varietal tastes of sauvignon blanc with a backbone that gave the wine gravitas far beyond its price age certainly can help make a wine delicious some people argue that certain fine wines are "undrinkable" in their youth thats cute but silly a wine thats truly undrinkable today isnt going to be delicious down the road great wines can be delicious even in infancy but delicious in a different more challenging way than they will be when they are mature and comfortable with themselves and all of their elements beautiful wines such as the chateau mouton rothschild are already a treat and already delicious fully enjoying them at this point however can take some effort and they will certainly be better in time when they knit together and add the kind of complexity that we often refer to as wisdom in fact in we went back and retasted the first growth bordeaux from and rated two of them delicious they are the same two that topped our lists when we first tasted them back in but they are both still gaining depth and becoming easier and easier to love the grange is gorgeous but in a couple of decades it will be both gorgeous and wise and really how rare is that in our lifetime of drinking wine few bottles have rated delicious those are wines like that grange that are not only flavorful complex and beautifully made but genuinely exciting the kind of wines that we talk about endlessly but still never describe adequately because their beauty goes beyond words finally the most important thing about delicious wines its all about you just because we find a wine delicious doesnt mean that you will the taste of wine is subjective one of our delicious wines of was a viognier this is an unusual somewhat challenging white wine and when we found one that wore its tastes proudly with the focus of a laser we stood up and cheered but in fact we know that many people simply wouldnt like any viognier this is why its so important to find your own delicious wines read our column look at wine magazines talk to merchants but in the long run the only wines that will truly be delicious to you are the ones that touch your soul and no one not even you until it happens knows which those will be wine to us is an everyday treat a wine doesnt have to be delicious to be special to us because we pretty much always enjoy the experience and the time we spend together drinking it but knowing that one out of every or so really will be something well always remember a taste that will always stay with us adds an extra element of excitement and wonder that we cherish in wine melanie grayce west contributed to this column delicious wines of among the many wines we tasted for this column in earned our highest praise the grange was the only wine rated delicious our top ranking fourteen others
