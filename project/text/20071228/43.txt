new york rule proposal riles insurers as new york states attorney general eliot spitzer shook up the insurance industry with tight oversight now as new york governor his handpicked insurance superintendent is riling insurers by proposing to loosen a longstanding rule involving foreign insurers a change critics say could put policyholders at greater risk insurance superintendent eric dinallo has proposed ending the requirement that certain top rated non u s reinsurance companies post assets equal to their potential liabilities if they want to backstop local insurers he says the move would attract more capital to new york and ultimately drive down prices for insurance policies other states such as florida are considering similar steps the move comes after years of pushing by lloyds the london based insurance market which complains the collateral rules hurt non u s insurers collateral rules have been viewed as a way to protect policyholders if a reinsurer becomes insolvent in such a situation an insurer and ultimately the policyholder would be protected because the insurer could seize the collateral to offset any loss arising from the reinsurers insolvency currently u s or non u s reinsurers that arent licensed in new york effectively must post collateral equal to of their share of policyholder claims when doing business with an insurer authorized in new york many big foreign reinsurers are licensed in new york and thus arent required to post collateral some in the u s insurance industry are critical "dinallo has got it all wrong " says clement s dwyer jr a former executive at reinsurance broker guy carpenter &amp co a unit of marsh &amp mclennan cos who sits on insurers boards "if he is responsible for protecting the policyholders first and ensuring the solvency of the companies under his regulatory regime what does this do to enhance that " mr dinallo says regulations must change with the times "it looks antiquated and jingoistic and xenophobic to have these rules for non u s insurers " he says under his proposal lower rated unlicensed reinsurers would be required to post collateral on a sliding scale mr dinallo says risks to u s insurers and ultimately policyholders are minimal he says its only an issue in of cases insurers already know how difficult it can be to collect when legion insurance co of pennsylvania went into liquidation in it filed arbitration claims against lloyds underwriters alleging that it wasnt able to draw down funds the national association of insurance commissioners said in a white paper that an arbitration panel "recognized how difficult it was to draw from the lloyds trusts and awarded legion security in the form of a letter of credit " lloyds responds in the white paper that "to date there have been no cases where it has been necessary to execute a judgment to obtain funds from lloyds" trusts see related letter "letters to the editor insurance firms should actively manage risk" wsj jan
