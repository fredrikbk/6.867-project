buffett to start a bond insurer for cities states warren buffett seizing a chance to profit from turmoil in the nations credit markets is starting up a bond insurer that aims to make it cheaper for local governments to borrow and promises to be a tough competitor for the industrys embattled incumbents the billionaire investors berkshire hathaway assurance corp set to open for business today in new york state will guarantee the bonds that cities counties and states use to finance sewer systems schools hospitals and other public projects the new venture backed by an almost certain triple a credit rating is likely to be cheered by municipalities and municipal bond investors because it will offer them an alternative at a time when other bond insurers ratings look wobbly bond insurers help municipalities lower their borrowing costs but the business demands that they maintain a top credit rating in exchange for a guarantee fee the insurer essentially transfers its premium rating to the city or state issuing the bonds allowing the issuer to pay a lower interest rate and saving taxpayers money lately however credit ratings firms have warned that some of the nations biggest bond insurers including ambac financial corp and mbia inc risk losing their coveted triple a ratings because the increased risk of mortgage related bonds they insure could lead to massive losses and significantly erode their capital thats created an opening for mr buffett whose berkshire hathaway inc owns some businesses including auto insurer geico "a new triple a rated player will take business from ambac mbia and others because their own triple a ratings are suspect " said ed grebeck chief executive of tempus advisors in stamford conn mr buffett said in an interview that interest appears high enough for the new company to seek permission to operate in other states that account for a large chunk of municipal debt issuance after new york he and ajit jain who heads mr buffetts insurance businesses will seek approval to open in california puerto rico texas illinois and florida "ideally wed be licensed in every state but theres a limit to what we can do " mr buffett told the wall street journal "we cant guarantee everything and we will not take risk beyond whats prudent for us " he added however that he would commit "quite a bit of capital if we like the business " according to the securities industry and financial markets association municipalities issued about &# billion in long term bonds in the first eight months of they had been on track to break the record of &# billion before debt markets seized up in august due to fears about mortgage linked securities for years mr buffett has criticized bond insurers for being so eager to write new business that they priced their insurance too low to reflect the bonds underlying risk "we felt that in many cases the prices that people were charging were inappropriate " mr buffett said "as long as people were willing to accept that there was no point in trying to offer something else " all of that changed about two months ago when ratings firms fitch ratings moodys investors service and standard &amp poors announced they were reassessing the triple a ratings of the bond insurers which guarantee about &# trillion in bonds the bulk of which are issued by municipalities few such bonds ended up in default over the past years making the business highly profitable like many on wall street however bond insurers got caught up in the housing boom of recent years and the accompanying mortgage lending frenzy mr buffetts entry into the business is likely to be bad news for existing bond insurers introducing a new competitor at a time when they need profitable new business to bolster their finances he hopes to charge premium rates both because of berkshire hathaways high rating and strong reputation and because his struggling rivals are likely be forced to raise their own fees to shore up their capital but mr buffett said his company will charge more than his competitors because of what he calls the "moral hazard" inherent in bond insurance that is governments that have insurance could take advantage of it by borrowing and spending far beyond their means to repay the debt and simply default leaving the insurer on the hook the risk to mr buffetts new business is that municipal governments decide that its prices are too high and opt to do without insurance "it could be tiny it could be very large " mr buffett said of the venture "itd be nice if it were large but were not pushing for that " he added state and local issuers had expressed interest in a new bond insurer to mr buffett and mr jain and said that they would be willing to pay more for its services although the new company has yet to be rated it is almost certain to carry a triple a rating berkshire hathaway inc is triple a rated and rating agencies consider it to have one of the strongest financial and corporate ratings in the financial sector "we will keep a capital ratio thats stronger than anybodys " mr buffett said while mr buffett isnt shy about investing in complex financial instruments he said his new bond insurance company unlike its competitors will steer clear of so called structured products which include bonds backed by cash generating assets such as mortgages and credit card receipts "we wont stray " he said beyond their own fortunes the woes of the incumbent bond insurers have hurt the prices of many insured municipal bonds making some issuers gun shy about buying guarantees from those insurers fitch last week placed the triple a ratings of guarantors ambac financial guaranty insurance corp and mbia on watch for possible downgrade while moodys cut mbias ratings outlook to negative on dec s&amp p downgraded aca financial guaranty corp a smaller bond insurer from single a to a deep junk rating of triple c potentially rendering billions of dollars of its guarantees worthless the bond insurers took another hit yesterday when fitch put residential mortgage backed securities backed by bond insurers on review for possible downgrade shares of mbia were flat yesterday but have lost two thirds of their value in the past three months shares of ambac fell more than yesterday and have fallen nearly in the past three months moodys credit analysts stan rouyer and jack dorer said last month that the introduction of a new player in the bond insurance industry could put further pressure on the existing guarantors imperiled credit ratings if the new firm threatened to take away a big chunk of market share "it would certainly be part of the analysis " mr dorer said in an interview on nov about the potential impact of a new entrant "everytime we look at ratings we look at the environment the companies are operating in the demand for their product and the effect of another competitor providing supply " he added mr buffett who said new yorks insurance regulator approved his business plans in just a month has capitalized the new business in new york at &# million more than the state requirement the financial weakening of municipal bond insurers has observers predicting that the number of insured bond issues will decrease in for government issuers with strong credit ratings the cost of insurance might not be worth the ratings bump that it produces "the equation is always is it going to be cheaper with insurance or without insurance " said lynnette kelly hotchkiss executive director of the municipal securities rulemaking board but issuers with lower credit ratings are still likely to be hungry for insurance and vulnerable if insurance is less easily obtained or more costly first time issuers such as government agencies created for a specific project often have lower credit ratings and reduce their borrowing costs by obtaining insurance projects in a distressed industry such as housing also could run into trouble without insurance so could speculative projects such as continuing care facilities which pay interest and principal on bonds with revenues instead of taxes conor dougherty and serena ng contributed to this article
