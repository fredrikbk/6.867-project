mideast jewelers look westward cairo egypt years ago azza fahmy won a name for herself as a top jewelry designer here in her native land but when she decided to expand in the nearby persian gulf she had to first make a big detour to europe "we realized that in order for us to do very well in the gulf we have to become an international brand " says fatma ghaly ms fahmys daughter and the general manager of the family business azza fahmy jewellery "we need to go to europe or the u s " gaining credibility on the international scene in places like paris london or new york can boost a mideast designers standing closer to home in part it plays to the so called khawaga complex or foreigners complex in arabic its the feeling for many here that western brands especially when it comes to luxury goods are superior to homegrown ones but endeavors such as ms fahmys also suggest that more mideast designers are starting to win attention abroad for ms fahmy selling her handcrafted necklaces rings and earrings in the west is part dream and part savvy marketing tactic aimed at tapping the wider middle easts big spending clientele flush with petrodollars the region has become a fast growing market for high end goods "you are targeting the elite who already buy bulgari and cartier " she says ms fahmy a year old former civil servant researched the jewelry scene in britain eventually that led to collaboration with designer julien macdonald on a collection featured during london fashion week this year she is looking for product placement deals in western movies lama hourani a jeweler inspired by cave paintings found in her native jordan has sold her pieces in milan boutiques and u s museums and has had exhibits in paris she plans to expand her presence in the glitzy shopping districts of the persian gulf ms hourani has a number of pending exhibitions in the gulf region and the u s "generally speaking people get much better opportunities when theyre already established in the west " ms hourani says "at the same time there are arabs that are very proud of their identity and they try to promote the arab world through art and culture " palestinian designer dima rashid has had her jewelry incorporating brightly colored semiprecious stones and traditional motifs such as the evil eye featured on the cover of the british edition of vogue and displayed in upscale stores from harvey nichols in england to barneys in the u s more recently she started selling her work in jordan and dubai neither ms hourani nor ms rashid had planned her excursion to europe as a marketing

of elegance for many in the mideast mr saab opened a showroom in paris in he now plans to open stores in new york and london "i am proud that my most expensive line the haute couture is made in lebanon " he says ms fahmy got started after coming across a german book about european jewelry from the middle ages it was she didnt read german and the book cost her monthly salary as a government employed book illustrator she bought it anyway inspired she became an apprentice under a master silversmith in the bustling khan el khalili market in cairo where vendors hawk traditional crafts she couldnt afford to quit her government job so she went to the market after work and stayed until midnight the only woman at the workshop she says she started off filing down metal slowly soaking up the trade before she was allowed to design her own pieces her first sale was five silver rings ms fahmy opened her own workshop with just one employee in a rundown cairo neighborhood her style evolved into what later became her hallmark turning arabic words and poetry into intricate calligraphy inscribed on silver and inlaid with gold to adorn her pieces in she opened a factory on the outskirts of cairo today it has more than employees men and women bend over long wooden tables as they drill holes in bangles or pound with small hammers to set stones about a year later she branched out into the united arab emirates but the move wasnt easy "she was quite a success story in egypt but around the arab world not many people were aware" of the azza fahmy brand says fahed ghanim who was the general manager for jewelry and watches at al tayer insignia at the time azza fahmy jewellery came to the uae al tayer holds franchise rights in the uae for such brands as bulgari and boucheron as well as for azza fahmy jewellery when an azza fahmy jewellery store opened in the high end emirates towers shopping mall in dubai lined with european designers boutiques some fashion watchers were skeptical questioning how it would do against europes top brands ms fahmys pieces now ranging from &# to &# seemed too expensive for a local designer the shop is still there to broaden her appeal ms fahmy researched the british market for two years and last year approached mr macdonald the british fashion designer who has previously worked for chanel and givenchy he was familiar with her work because a friend owned some of her pieces he came to cairo for a few days where he saw more of her jewelry toured her factory and exchanged ideas on designs one recommendation no arabic inscriptions he wasnt

and silver and studded with diamonds and onyx the designs were showcased during london fashion week earlier this year the two are now working on their second collection due out in time for februarys
