the court house how one family fought foreclosure amid mortgage misery the davets fended off eviction for eleven years beachwood ohio faced with the threat of foreclosure many homeowners give up and abandon their homes then theres richard davet he and his wife lynn lived in a six bedroom home in this cleveland suburb for nearly years when in he was served with a foreclosure lawsuit rather than turn over the keys he hit the law books flooding the courts with papers mr davet staved off foreclosure for years until this past january when a county sheriffs deputy evicted the couple and changed the locks they didnt make a mortgage payment the entire time "our four scottish terriers are buried there " says the year old mr davet "it was heaven on earth an unbelievable property and they took it from us like candy from a baby " mr davets case is believed to be the longest residential foreclosure of its kind in the history of cuyahoga county which is at the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis currently enveloping ohio and many other parts of the country foreclosure actions are generally routine typically taking from a few months to a couple of years to get the borrower out of the home companies turn the work over to so called foreclosure mill law firms and generally cases are uncontested these days more homeowners are digging in their heels they delay foreclosures by filing for bankruptcy on the eve of a court ordered sale of the property or by refusing to answer the door when the plaintiff tries to "serve" them with a foreclosure lawsuit they pay lawyers a few hundred dollars to file a motion that can buy them a little more time but few are as dogged as mr davet and his fight may not be over yet though ousted from his home for nearly a year now he is trying to get the charming s house back plus damages hes relying on the legal argument currently making headlines that a financial institution can only file a foreclosure action if it can prove it actually owns and holds the mortgage and promissory note "i give him credit he truly believes a banking institution did him a great wrong " says daniel kalk one of several lawyers who at various times represented mr davet in the case "the funny thing is some of the things he argued years ago all of a sudden you see a federal court saying the same thing " a former jewelry business owner mr davet and his wife a former graphic arts tutor bought their home in for &# as its value increased they borrowed against it they made their mortgage payments but on one loan they allegedly made payments late times according to nationsbanc mortgage corp which assessed the couple some &# in late fees after the davets for two years refused demands to pay the late fees during which nationsbanc began refusing to accept their regular mortgage payments the company sued for foreclosure at the time the couple still owed &# in principal plus an additional &# on a second mortgage on the home mr davet insists the late fees were erroneous he points to a deposition in which a nationsbanc employee conceded that the company couldnt back up its claims for a chunk of the fees so he began his full time crusade in the courts to keep his home he started with the help of lawyers but those arrangements didnt last dan dreyfuss who represented the couple when the case was filed called mr davets strategy "a recipe for how to confound the courts " he quit after mr davet filed a motion to disqualify a judge against his advice mr kalk eventually sued mr davet successfully for unpaid legal fees on his own as a "pro se" litigant mr davet was undeterred four times a week he went to case western reserve university school of law to study legal writing and case law in its library his briefs were angry and colorful including football analogies and an aside on enron corp among his maneuvers asking a judge to arrest nationsbancs ceo for initiating a "sham" proceeding against him because the company claimed in error that it owned his loan the judge dismissed the request he later sought to disqualify the judge because she had accepted campaign contributions from real estate developers whose beachwood developments mr davet had publicly protested before the foreclosure litigation when he didnt win that motion mr davet sought to disqualify the judge who had dismissed it he appealed at every chance he could which bought him extra years in his home "mr davet has litigated these same issues over and over again and in each instance the courts have dismissed his claims " said bank of america corp charlotte n c which merged with the owner of nationsbanc several years into the case bank of america took the unusual step of bringing in lawyers from a big corporate law firm jones day five years later in a judge granted foreclosure in the amount mr davet owed and set a sale date for the property so that the creditors could take the sale proceeds but when the property finally went to sale mr davet set up a shell company to win the auction for &# he couldnt pay more than the required &# deposit but the move delayed his eviction by months mr davet says it wasnt a delay tactic and that he was trying to line up investors to buy the property the house was later sold to another family for &# the eviction finally happened on a snowy day in january of this year don saunders who lived three doors down from mr davet and is a trustee of the neighborhood association says it came as a shock in the upscale area mr davet continued to try unsuccessfully to get the federal court to agree that the state judgment was invalid then a possible lifeline arrived this past october when a federal judge in cleveland christopher a boyko dismissed foreclosure suits because the plaintiffs that brought them couldnt prove they owned the mortgages when the suits were filed such a problem can occur when mortgages are turned into securities and sold to investors the companies involved in the transaction may not have checked that each mortgage was legally transferred or "assigned " to the new owners in essence the originating lender continued to legally own the mortgage and would thus need to be the plaintiff in a foreclosure suit in mr davets case however the mortgage which was not securitized changed hands multiple times and wasnt actually owned by nationsbanc until three years after the company filed suit other judges have since followed judge boykos lead the ohio attorney general has asked numerous judges to dismiss or delay foreclosures based on similar grounds earlier this month mr davet filed a second federal appeal this time citing the boyko ruling which he believes he inspired its unclear whether the latest salvo will work if it doesnt mr davet says he will set his sights on the u s supreme court all the litigation makes the homes new owner paul mikhli a dentist "a little nervous " should mr davet succeed he adds title insurance should cover his expenses after spending much of the year living at the homes of friends and family including their daughter a university student in indiana the davets recently moved into a small &# a month home in a rural community east of cleveland "the money is short " mr davet said on a recent afternoon adding that one of his siblings a pawn shop owner has been helping financially but hope prevails from time to time he drives back to beachwood just to see how his old home is doing james r hagerty contributed to this article see related letter "letters to the editor weep not for this loss" wsj jan
