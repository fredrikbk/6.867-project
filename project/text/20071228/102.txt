weekend journal the home front high design for low income housing established and rising architects bring innovation to affordability public housing used to mean fortress like blocks and soulless rows of cheaply built townhouses but now theres a new model privately developed homes and apartments that are well designed well built and attractive enough to win over wary neighbors a growing number of architects from established stars to ambitious up and comers are looking to such projects as an opportunity to do innovative work a single room occupancy building that opened in chicago in march was designed by helmut jahn internationally known for his glass sheathed skyscrapers the unit sro where most residents pay less than &# a month in rent resembles a train with its long narrow shape curved roof and glass and steel exterior in brooklyns east new york neighborhood a group of young architects teamed up to build nine two family homes for families with modest incomes completed in march the homes feature unconventional materials such as corrugated aluminum and unpainted cedar siding and in santa monica calif a recently completed unit apartment building designed by pugh + scarpa architects incorporates green design elements it is partially clad in blocks made of recycled crushed aluminum cans and has a sail shaped metal screen that helps shield the building from the sun groundbreaking architecture still makes up a relatively small percentage of the thousands of units of low and moderate income housing that are built in the u s each year most of the design is "competent " says james stockard curator of the loeb fellowship at the harvard school of design and an expert in the field even that however is progress until the s almost all low income housing in the country was built by the u s department of housing and urban development designed with an eye to quantity not quality today most affordable housing is built by private developers or local agencies with a mix of public and private funding many projects receive government subsidies to keep rents or purchase prices lower than market rates the shift is due in large part to reduced federal funding huds &# billion budget in is a fraction of what the agency received in &# billion in todays dollars the interest in design comes as affordable housing is increasingly being mixed in among middle class and even luxury homes and as costs have soared in many urban neighborhoods more communities have adopted "inclusionary zoning" ordinances that require developers to set aside units for families of modest means the biggest developers in the field such as denver based mercy housing which breaks ground on between and units of affordable housing a year stress thoughtful design in their projects so do many public housing agencies which are increasingly turning to design competitions when selecting architects until last year jeff page years old was living in a rescue mission in los angeles he says hed had a couple of opportunities to move into subsidized apartments but turned them down calling them "old and decrepit " then a new building opened up on san pedro street rainbow apartments developed by the nonprofit skid row housing trust in downtown l a with its sharp angles and bright red window frames that jut out from the otherwise flat concrete exterior the unit building stands out from traditional apartment buildings in the area the slashes of color in particular made an impression on mr page who moved into the building last year "skid row is so dim and dismal " he says "the bright color it kind of wakes up my soul to the point that it makes me excited to come home rather than hang out on the street " michael alvidrez executive director of the housing trust says that was the sort of reaction the organization was hoping for when it hired architect michael maltzan to take on the project "good design actually has therapeutic value " mr alvidrez says for his part mr maltzan says the chance to do interesting creative work may now be more common on affordable housing projects than market rate ones nonprofit developers he says are "constitutionally wired for innovation " green design elements are also being incorporated into affordable housing where advocates say its most needed efficient buildings can save residents or more on their heating bills and natural materials are less likely to give off fumes that can trigger asthma a common problem in many inner city neighborhoods "i believe issues of sustainability are more important in the affordable housing field than in the luxury field " mr stockard says big builders are embracing that philosophy too enterprise one of the largest financial backers of affordable housing projects nationwide promotes sustainable building through its green communities initiative launched in the program helps developers pay for features such as solar panels and rainwater capture systems architecture is also being used as a wedge against nimbyism marcus johnson a public relations professional and a lifelong resident of oakland calif was initially opposed to a low income housing complex being planned for his west oakland neighborhood five years ago mr johnson went so far as to speak out against the project proposed by san francisco based nonprofit bridge housing at community meetings "i was really skeptical " he says "it was going to be a hangout for drug dealing " but after seeing renderings of the building a geometric modernist structure with a charcoal colored exterior mr johnson began to change his mind rather than looking like the drab public housing he expected the building was sleek and contemporary and enhanced the already improving area "it sort of represents what the future of the neighborhood is starting to look like " mr johnson says after the building opened in mr johnson returned to a meeting of the west oakland project area committee a local planning agency to applaud the developers "its actually transformed that particular area " he says unconventional approaches wont work everywhere however bridge chief executive carol galante recalls an architect who proposed a "hip" modern building for irvine calif where many of the homes featured stucco and red tile roofs "we just said no " ms galante says "it needed to fit in with the neighborhood " heres a look at a few of the projects that are changing the landscape of affordable housing schiff residences chicago  unit single room occupancy building for very low income residents in the near north neighborhood completed in the design nonprofit mercy housing developed this building within blocks of what remains of chicagos troubled cabrini green public housing projects richard banks mercys president says the organization wanted its new building to be "a statement that affordable housing doesnt have to be ugly or look like a warehouse " they hired helmut jahn an acclaimed architect who designed a sleek thin building with a glass and steel exterior and clean modern interior the building also includes energy saving green elements such as solar panels and a rooftop wind turbine that doubles as a signature design feature together the panels and the turbine generate about of the buildings power theres also a "gray water" system that captures and cleans water from the sinks and showers and uses it to flush the toilets as well as a gallon storage tank that collects rainwater for use on the landscaping mr banks says the energy saving features will save on utility costs rainbow apartments new carver apartments los angeles rainbow an unit single room occupancy building for formerly homeless residents in los angeless downtown skid row neighborhood was completed in new carver rendering pictured below is slated to start construction in march the design skid row housing trust a nonprofit builder and operator of affordable housing hired los angeles architect michael maltzan known for designing museums schools and high end single family homes mr maltzan set up the units in a u shape surrounding a second floor courtyard which is lined with meeting rooms eating areas and gathering spaces he says the courtyard was meant to be a "bridge" between the solitude of the apartment units and the temptations and dangers of the streets now skid row has hired mr maltzan to design a second project the new carver apartments this building will be shaped like a gear with apartments arranged in a sawtooth pattern around a circular courtyard the sawtooth design corners of each unit jut out from the buildings exterior maximizes the natural light in each apartment by providing another surface for a window mr maltzan says schermerhorn house brooklyn n y eleven story unit apartment building in brooklyns boerum hill neighborhood rendering pictured below to be completed in units are for households earning under of the areas median income and half will be reserved for the homeless or people with special needs the design schermerhorn house will be surrounded by luxury condominiums and townhouses so developers common ground and the actors fund knew good design was vital to winning local support they interviewed top architects and in a sign of growing interest in affordable housing nearly all of them expressed interest "i was even worried if they were going to take my call " says nadine maleh common grounds director of design and construction the developers chose polshek partnership a new york firm known for high profile projects such as the clinton presidential library in little rock ark and the new planetarium building in new yorks museum of natural history polsheks design which has a glass facade and a rooftop garden is meant to fit in with the surrounding buildings but the glass wall isnt just for looks due to site restrictions part of the project had to be built atop a subway tunnel a complex engineering challenge instead of making the north wall out of heavy masonry the architects used textured glass which is lighter and allowed for less costly support trusses "constraints can be challenging but they can provide opportunity " says polshek principal susan rodriguez polshek like many prominent firms working in this field charged a reduced fee
