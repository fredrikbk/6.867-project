paid into a liechtenstein account before being withdrawn the same day and that half a dozen transactions involving million euros ricocheted through related accounts over a three week period auditors at lgt grew suspicious because the payments were characterized as commissions paid by siemens to the two executives according to people familiar with the case the auditors wondered why siemens would pay commissions to senior salaried employees and why the funds would be directed through offshore accounts with no ostensible ties to siemens in november shortly after lgt filed a suspicious transactions report to local authorities liechtenstein blocked million euros in funds that appeared to originate with siemens the authorities alerted their swiss and german counterparts as well as siemens the chief compliance officer at siemens reported the liechtenstein case to the companys audit committee in january according to a court document and a siemens board member by that point senior

the companys chief financial officer according to an internal siemens document the companys audit committee was informed of the suspicious transactions a few days later but it would be many months before the public learned of the suspicions prosecutors in bern switzerland raided the offices of intercom telecommunications systems ag a swiss subsidiary of siemens in march they uncovered further details of dubious invoices tied to mr mavridis and he was questioned in march and june siemens began liquidating intercom in late may that heightened swiss prosecutors suspicions they didnt see an economic reason for closing the company according to a person familiar with the investigation in april mr mavridis left siemens after the company agreed to pay him euros in severance according to a person familiar with the matter on nov one day before its german offices were raided by police siemens filed a civil lawsuit against mr mavridis in greece claiming ownership of million euros that he

siekaczek the former siemens manager in germany who controlled accounts that had funneled money to mr mavridis was arrested nov mr siekaczek told prosecutors that he knew of bribery schemes earlier this decade in more than a dozen countries stretching from brazil to egypt he said the greek unit enjoyed wide latitude in nearby countries such as cyprus bulgaria and parts of the former yugoslavia

the executives interviews with german prosecutors earlier this month mr christoforakos stepped down as chief executive of siemenss greek unit before his departure siemens declined to make him available for an interview and he couldnt be reached independently mr christoforakos recently began cooperating with outside investigators hired by siemens after he balked earlier this summer said a siemens board member liechtenstein prosecutors transferred their money laundering probe involving siemenss telecom unit to counterparts in germany and switzerland earlier this year but they continue to chase a money laundering case involving a siemens power unit german prosecutors say they wont pursue further penalties against siemens over the now dismantled telecom unit but are continuing investigations of individuals and may look into other business units swiss investigators have frozen about million euros in bank accounts they believe are tied to siemens more than half the frozen funds havent been claimed by anyone after several named beneficiaries denied ownership in an internal document earlier this year siemens said it was trying to reclaim nearly million euros frozen in switzerland swiss prosecutors say siemens will have to wait said one swiss investigator "we cant allow the money to disappear in another slush fund "
