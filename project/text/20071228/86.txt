interests of our readers books reviewed in these pages have included titles about the "quants" who practice quantitative analysis on wall street a tabasco fueled family fortune american songwritings golden age email etiquette the racehorse kelso peter druckers management philosophy the publicity machine of the hollywood studio system the poincare conjecture in mathematics the building of the taj mahal and riots over rival shakespeare productions in new york in that left dead we have reviewed fiction gastronomy books childrens books and titles in that occasionally entertaining sometimes nourishing category known as "airplane reading " but of all the books reviewed in these pages these are the dozen that we found the most memorable of david halberstams posthumously published "the coldest winter " about the korean war was "a fitting memorial to his exceptional talents as a reporter and a writer " wrote our reviewer peter r kann "mr halberstam covers all four bases of a military history home run he sets the conflict in its political and geopolitical context perceptively profiles the eras leading statesmen and scoundrels analyzes the many strategic and tactical miscalculations by all parties and provides gripping descriptive narratives of battles and the men who fought them there are few heroes in this book other than the men in combat " reviewer edward kosner described leo lerman as "the last of the conde nast mandarins an industrious aesthete with a lapidary eye for the latest nugget of high culture that could be polished up for the slick pages of vogue " but lerman also kept a journal covering five decades that was edited by his longtime assistant stephen pascal and brought out under the title "the grand surprise " mr kosner wrote that lerman "knew everybody in the incestuous world of the arts and the rich in manhattan and beyond entertained most of them loved many of them and gossiped about all of them" the names include maria callas truman capote ernest hemingway greta garbo norman mailer and marlene dietrich the book itself was a grand surprise mr kosner wrote "a superb secret history of the culture of our times " "hermione lee has done a back breaking amount of research" wrote reviewer barbara amiel about the authors "edith wharton " a biography of the novelist who helped define new york manners at the turn of the th century ms lee "gets all of wharton writer serious gardener cutting edge interior designer war correspondent and intrepid traveler between covers in spite of ediths lifelong determination that no one ever would thus whartons irritating habit of retrieving her letters and barbecuing them she should have known that theres no defense against a determined biographer " long before he signed on as president bushs chief of staff andrew card learned about life behind a food counter when he worked at a mcdonalds restaurant to support his young family while he was in college mr card brought that background to bear in reviewing "my secret life on the mcjob " business consultant jerry newmans account of going undercover at a variety of fast food chains to assess their management practices "he offers entertaining anecdotes and wonderful descriptions of the personalities working at every station of responsibility " mr card wrote "from the fry guy to the consistent mvp the jack of all trades mr newman writes with respect about the tasks that too many see as menial but that must be met with efficient excellence in order to satisfy the demands of corporate brand owners franchise holders and hungry impatient customers " mr newmans book according to mr card "offers many lessons that would be helpful to managers in almost every segment of business or even government " sir harold evans reviewed two books that were stand outs of "john osborne " john heilperns biography of the "look back in anger" playwright and "fathers and sons " alexander waughs "autobiography of a family " mr heilpern captured the many contradictions of osborne who was capable of great sweetness and astonishing cruelty "a radical who hated change a working class enemy of class privilege who despised the sweating proletariat " sir harold wrote the book is "prodigiously researched spiced with revelation and gossip without ever losing a genial authority and often emotionally moving this is the best literary biography i have read in a long time " although many readers might pick up "fathers and sons" hoping to learn more about novelist evelyn waugh this account of five generations of waugh men offers much more according to sir harold alexander waugh evelyns grandson "has plundered the archives of print and memory with zest he has threaded the character studies into an absorbing narrative he is often funny and always direct he keeps nothing from us sex money dishonesty greed envy the crippled emotions of some very clever people it is all here " at michael gates gill a father of five found himself out of work divorced and nearly broke not quite what he expected when he was growing up on manhattans upper east side the son of new yorker writer brendan gill but then mr gill found a life raft in the form of an unlikely job as he relates in the memoir "how starbucks saved my life " reviewer barbara d phillips wrote "mr gill suspects that his parents who had died before his starbucks employment began would not have been pleased with his new life as a working stiff in a baseball cap and apron but surely brendan gill would have appreciated a tale well told in the best tradition of the new yorker how starbucks saved my life is one great read " novelist penelope livelys "consequences " the story of three generations of british women in the mid th century is a "wonderful" addition to her oeuvre said reviewer brooke allen ms lively writes in the tradition of "close attention to characterization and psychological nuance with an underlying humor and sense of proportion" a literary approach that is "dwindling sadly " ms allen wrote which makes ms lively "all the more worth treasuring " "there are at least books on abraham lincoln and even his greatest enthusiasts wont claim to have read a tenth of them do we need another yes indeed what andrew ferguson offers in land of lincoln is the geography of enthusiasm itself " so began reviewer ernest w lefever discussing mr fergusons exploration of and meditation on everything lincoln the author "engages in leisurely conversations with historians boosters memorabilia collectors visits memorials educational centers theme parks and kitschy shops in short he pursues lincoln by sounding out the lincoln in american lives " the result mr lefever said is a "vivid beautifully written book " as luuk van middelaar noted in his review of "infidel " author ayaan hirsi ali has made an extraordinary journey from somalia born hijab wearing member of the muslim brotherhood to former member of the dutch parliament and prominent critic of islam ms hirsi alis account of this life including her collaboration on a film about islamic repression with director theo van gogh who was then murdered by a muslim extremist is "a lucid and captivating autobiography " mr van middelaar wrote "as infidel makes clear ms hirsi ali plans to keep asking questions that many do not want to hear " actor edward herrmann who has directed noel cowards "private lives " found himself surprised over and over again by "the letters of noel coward " the playwright songwriter and performer certainly displayed the expected cleverness in his correspondence mr herrmann said but coward could also be "very serious indeed " this was especially the case during world war ii when coward chafed at being unable to rebut critics who faulted him for not contributing to the war effort by divulging his clandestine work for the british government barry day the editor of the collection did a "superb job " mr herrmann wrote giving us "a portrait of a complex charming driven serious and frankly courageous artist " "calvin and hobbes" creator bill watterson is known for keeping a low public profile especially since retiring the comic strip in but he agreed to review for the journal david michaeliss "schulz and peanuts " a biography of charles schulz the "peanuts" comic strip made such "a deep impression" on him when he was young mr watterson said that he grew up intending to become "the next charles schulz " not that schulzs life was something to aspire to "he was able to expose and confront his inner torments through his creative work " mr watterson recounted "making insecurity failure and rejection the central themes of his humor knowing that his miseries fueled his work he resisted help or change " mr michaelis "has done an extraordinary amount of digging " mr watterson wrote "and has written a perceptive and compelling account of schulzs life this book finally introduces charles schulz to us all " one of the pleasures of greeting the new year is the knowledge that it will introduce us to a fresh array of books that will with their ability to entertain inform explain or inspire distinguish themselves from all the rest in mr lasswell is
