change agent "if you want conventional washington thinking im not your man if you want rigid ideology im not your man if you think that fundamental change can wait im definitely not your man but if you want to bring this country together then i offer a different choice in this race and a different vision for our future " barack obama depaul university oct ask an obama supporter what they love about the presidential contender and some version of this pitch is what youll hear mr obama can "heal divisions " can "win hearts and minds " hes going to change the way crummy old washington does business get past this red versus blue thing and get on with being president of one truly united states of america if the democratic race has been about anything its been about promises of "change " mr obama has made it his signature issue tapping into a national unease with the status quo and riding it to within striking distance of hillary clinton what the charismatic young illinois senator has not yet had to do is explain what shape this change will assume or how he intends to bring it about and lucky for him because its far from clear mr obama is anything but same old same old mrs clinton has also been laboring for "change " though shes kept the focus on republicans her strategy has been to minimize divisions among the democrats presenting herself as their natural leader shes also had an eye to the general election prize where she hopes talk of george w bushs failings will hold appeal for independents and some republicans unhappy with the eight years of gop rule but its been mr obamas more sweeping message that has captured public attention hes seen mrs clintons bet to change which party runs the white house and raised her by promising to change the entire political calculus that goes down well not only with anti bush partisans but paradoxically with voters who complain about too much "partisanship" in washington as a bonus it allows mr obama to hit mrs clinton where it hurts namely voter fear that shed be a return to s battles the message is so strong that it has remarkably allowed mr obama to so far weather his biggest weakness lack of experience especially on foreign policy everyone likes a fresh face but voters have a way of trusting in the old familiar ones in times of danger mrs clinton knows this and has pounded mr obama on his ability to protect us against terror and yet mr obama trundles along with his promise of a new political era what exactly is that new era washington is gridlocked in part because congressional democrats have attempted to govern with an agenda that is too liberal even for many in their own party mr obama is captivating though probably not captivating enough to convince republican rivals to sign up for nancy pelosis game plan his only real tool for changing washington presumably rests in convincing his own party to move toward a more innovative middle yet nothing in mr obamas history or current campaign suggests he intends to forge a new democratic direction as a candidate bill clinton recognized democrats national image problems and ran on a message of "opportunity responsibility community " president bill clinton abandoned most of that within his first days caving to liberals but it remains the case that his signature policy achievements welfare reform and trade were the result of his ability to shift democrats toward the center when mr obama was last heard talking about trade it was to complain that americans had lost their jobs for "a cheaper t shirt" and to promise to "amend" mr clintons nafta with stricter labor agreements this is no joe lieberman who seeks to keep his party from jumping off a foreign policy cliff mr obama criticizes any democrat who supported the iraq war this is no daniel moynihan who favored private social security accounts as a means of alleviating wealth inequality in mr obama suggested private accounts were a form of "social darwinism " this is no former louisiana sen john breaux who wanted to transform medicare into a system that would help seniors buy insurance on the private market mr obama has blasted medicare advantage and boasts of his votes to pour more money into todays failing government run system as for mr obamas claim he is no slave to "rigid ideology " consider his voting record national journal in march released its annual rankings of congress based on key roll call votes and mr obama was found to be more liberal than of his senatorial colleagues to the extent hes teamed up with republicans it has been on issues popular with the electorate say more government transparency back in when a bipartisan group of senators agreed not to filibuster president bushs judicial nominees mr obamas name was notably not on the list mr obama has offered reforms he has proposed requiring employers to enroll workers in retirement accounts he has suggested linking teacher pay to performance and he has agreed that health care reform should include insurance and drug companies but hes already backtracked in the face of interest group opposition telling school union members that pay shouldnt be linked to test scores much of his american dream agenda refundable tax credits for college tuition more after school programs annual minimum wage hikes is an extension of the increasingly standard democratic play off "income inequality " and would result in a bigger federal government most would also be paid for by rolling back the bush tax cuts tax and spend this is pretty standard democratic stuff so what is his plan he may have let it slip in a recent interview when he explained that a big reason he should be the democratic nominee is that he could carry his party to a sweeping congressional victory that would provide a "mandate for change " "i mean if we have a plus one election we cannot get a serious health care bill done we cant have a serious agenda on climate change " he said that doesnt sound like a man who wants to work with republicans toward a bipartisan era it sounds like a man who wants to crush his opponents at the polls and then bulldoze his agenda through an enfeebled opposition there isnt anything necessarily wrong with that its what politicians have been trying to do for decades but its certainly nothing new
