weekend journal review film oil epic should strike acting oscar gold too there will be blood powered by day lewis denzels fine debaters the wondrously monstrous hero of "there will be blood " a turn of the century oil man named daniel plainview vents his rage against humanity by among other things threatening to bury his enemies alive the man who wrote and directed this majestic epic paul thomas anderson and the actor who plays plainview daniel day lewis have taken the opposite approach theyve unearthed a pivotal piece of the american past the script was freely adapted from the novel "oil " by upton sinclair and given it new life with the fervor and clarity of revelation plainview comes by the oil business dishonestly and indirectly a scruffy silver prospector at first he uses his grasp of primitive petroleum technology his snake oil salesmans tongue and his perfect lack of principles to parlay a few ill gotten leases into a thriving enterprise that becomes a california empire and he emerges triumphantly though not happily to say the least as a tycoon with a more than passing resemblance to the california oil baron edward doheny the cautionary aspects of the tale are clear and his story is meant just as clearly to be a parable of predatory capitalism yet the power of the film lies in its particularity far from being a generic ogre plainview is a fascinating predator with a detectable albeit flickering soul and daniel day lewiss portrayal is not just the performance of the year there will be injustice if he doesnt win an oscar but a creation of awesome proportions his most conspicuous distinction is his voice and when i say his im thinking of the characters the actor who hasnt sounded like this before seems to have done a disappearing act that leaves the mustachioed coal eyed hero to fend for himself from the outset when daniel plainview isnt releasing his inner savage he speaks with a grave courtliness that bespeaks the period but also suggests cultivation and compassion qualities of which hes entirely devoid sometimes his gravity evokes the tuva throat tones of john huston the state of plainviews spirit his growing derangement really is given another voice by jonny greenwood the radiohead guitarist whose sensational inspired score can be brutal distressing or clamorous as well as exquisitely lyrical if youre a fan of tasteful unobtrusive movie music listen elsewhere in paul thomas andersons previous film "punch drunk love " jon brions startling score functioned as an anxiety generating machine jonny greenwoods music makes itself heard and felt even more forcefully on the strength of "punch drunk love" and his other well known features "boogie nights" and "magnolia " mr anderson would have seemed an unlikely match for a period piece like "there will be blood " yet americana is americana whether in the san fernando valley of the late th century or the central california of that centurys early years whats so remarkable about this film is not its time frame but the wealth of its detail the production was designed by jack fisk the eloquence of its images the cinematographer was robert elswit and the sweep of its ambition the story of daniel plainviews ascent to the top of the heap is at one and the same time a study in abnormal psychology and an anatomy of untrammeled entrepreneurship and plainview isnt alone in worshipping false gods he has a wild and worthy adversary in eli sunday a charismatic evangelist played by paul dano with a fevered eye trained on the prize of national fame and the bountiful wealth it promises mr dano the gifted young performer who played the brother in "little miss sunshine " was thrust into the part as an almost last minute replacement for another actor he plays two parts in the film eli and a much smaller role for which hed originally been hired the truncated preparation time shows eli is an intricate piece of work to begin with and were meant to see some of the wheels turning in his revival tent performances for all of mr danos skill and formidable energy however we also sense at a couple of crucial points the mechanics of an actor playing an actor in a supporting cast thats impeccable as is always the case in an anderson film the big discovery is bright faced dillon freasier as h w the little boy daniel plainview likes to call his son and his partner with a partner like that a boy could use an attack dog the great debaters the great debaters" isnt a great title but its a greatly affecting movie denzel washington directed this drama based on a true story and written by robert eisele about a debating team at wiley college a small negro institution in rural texas in the mid s the director plays melvin b tolson the scholarly quick tongued instructor who brought the team into being and then badgered bullied enlightened and above all inspired its members who ultimately travel to massachusetts and defeat their white counterparts at harvard the film has its faults a cheerful unconcern with anachronisms a surfeit of plot mostly involving mr tolsons double life as an academic and a left wing farm labor organizer no matter though the actors playing the debaters are so likable and admirable that youd be rooting for these ardent young strivers even if they werent poly underdogs poor educationally challenged and living in a time and place when negroes were being lynched im not sure which is more chilling a scene in which the team comes upon the scene of a lynching or one in which mr tolson explains the derivation of the word mr washington is splendid as always so is forest whitaker as james farmer sr and denzel whitaker unrelated to both of his namesakes is touching and stirring in equal measure as the youngest team member james farmer jr who went on to found the congress of racial equality his teammates are played by nate parker jurnee smollett and jermaine williams mr williams is already well known as for mr parker and ms smollett theres no debating what awaits them stardom very soon persepolis it should come as no surprise that "persepolis " a dazzlingly smart and entertaining animated feature by marjane satrapi and vincent paronnaud looks like a black and white graphic novel come to life it started life as a black and white graphic novel of the same name in that celebrated book ms satrapi recounted her experiences as the privileged precocious girl in tehran during the early days of the islamic revolution and her coming of age as an alienated expatriate in vienna the french language film deserves more space than is left to me here so ill write more about it next week meanwhile see "persepolis" in a theater if you can dvd tip for a refresher course on daniel day lewiss star quality as a younger man consult "my beautiful laundrette" a fresh and vivid look at the culture clash and worse between loutish white street gangs in south london and the pakistani immigrants they detest mr day lewis is a blond thug named johnny stephen frears directed from an electrifying script by hanif kureishi
