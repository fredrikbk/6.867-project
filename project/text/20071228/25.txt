hedge funds feeling pinch on credit too brokers banks raise loan rates say no to potential clients it isnt just consumers who are having a harder time getting credit from lenders its hedge funds too investment banks are cutting back on loans to hedge funds eliminating some clients and raising borrowing fees for others the lenders are slimming their balance sheets after heavy losses in the debt markets in recent months and after taking multibillion dollar write downs they also are becoming more cautious as the economy slows according to people familiar with the situation "banks arent in a position to be accommodating at the moment " said michael hintze chief executive of cqs a london based hedge fund with &# billion under management if the change continues it could put some pressure on the profits of the prime brokerage units of the major banks which make big money by lending to hedge funds as well as helping the funds manage their cash and short stocks by borrowing and selling shares as a bet on falling prices the move also could put pressure on the returns of some hedge funds which often rely on healthy doses of borrowed money or leverage to boost their returns "leverage definitely drives returns " says david gold an executive at watson wyatt worldwide which works with corporate pension plans on their hedge fund investments in particular mr gold says quantitative funds those that trade using certain computer models are seeing their borrowing ability reduced on the heels of the uneven performance of some funds this year he says the move by the banks will have the biggest impact on smaller hedge funds "groups like morgan stanley and goldman sachs will feed more leverage to their bigger better clients " mr gold says firms are turning away more potential clients and scrutinizing newer hedge funds worried about their ability to repay borrowed money even though most hedge funds have had a good year rising about through november prime brokers like morgan stanley which has one of the largest businesses catering to hedge funds have made repurchase agreements so expensive that some funds are going to rival firms to borrow money according to people familiar with the matter hedge funds often borrow money through a "repo" operation a financing arrangement in which a hedge fund sells securities to banks in exchange for cash while entering into an agreement to buy them back at a later date when they pay the money back the interest rate that funds pay for this borrowed money has shot up in recent months one example morgan stanley which has written down more than &# billion of mortgage assets has been asking for as much as one percentage point over the london interbank offered rate or libor to enter into a repo agreement using "junk" bonds as collateral in recent weeks that is up from just point before the summer some rivals have raised their own rates though not as much says one investor morgan stanleys rate on investment grade debt is as high as percentage point up from less than percentage point these people say the move is in line with the jump in all kinds of borrowing rates as the credit market puts a new price on risk "morgan stanley continues to provide financing reflective of market conditions to our clients " says a spokeswoman morgan stanley isnt alone in making lending rates more expensive for funds merrill lynch &amp co also has been increasing its rates a person familiar with the matter said representatives of the firm didnt respond to a request for comment loans to be repaid in three months have climbed by as much as percentage point prime brokers say though rates to borrow money overnight the safest kind of lending havent budged and other kinds of lending by prime brokers havent changed as much investment banks meanwhile are charging about percentage point more to borrow against mortgage backed bonds than they did a month or so ago but funds that use supersafe treasurys as collateral have found that financing has become cheaper in part because treasury prices have climbed and larger hedge funds using stocks to back their leverage havent seen much change bankers say the biggest players catering to hedge funds in recent years have been brokers such as morgan stanley goldman sachs and bear stearns these firms dont take deposits as a retail bank does so they have less cash on hand large banks such as citigroup inc ubs ag and credit suisse group have large low cost deposit bases and some say they may be able to take some market share from the investment banks still jacques mechelany managing director of geneva based hedge fund heritage fund management sa points out that banks like citigroup and ubs have felt deep pain recently and may be unwilling to take risks with their balance sheets and will show more caution when lending to hedge funds indeed prime brokers which once competed for hedge fund business by offering lower borrowing rates than rivals now are accentuating other services they provide no longer undercutting each other on lending rates
