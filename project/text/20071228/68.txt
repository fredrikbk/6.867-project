safety school bucking privacy concerns cornell acts as watchdog staff trained to spot students in distress campus suicides drop ithaca n y for years as a custodian at cornell university sue welch has been taking out the garbage and mopping the floors of residence halls recently she added a new responsibility trying to prevent student suicide ms welch noticed during a recent semester that she was repeatedly having to clean up after a particular students apparent bouts of nausea and told her supervisor she feared the young woman had an eating disorder the supervisor told the residence hall director who encouraged the student to go to the university health center counselors there arranged for her to get treatment for bulimia nervosa ms welch credits the training sessions that she and other custodians attended on how to spot students with mental health problems "these kids are looking to us to provide care " she says "but they dont see administrators every day they see me " ms welchs dual role puts cornell at the center of a debate over the privacy rights of american college students after years in which many colleges have said privacy rules prevent them from interceding with troubled students cornell is taking the opposite tack its "alert team" of administrators campus police and counselors meets weekly to compare notes on signs of student emotional problems people across campus from librarians to handymen are trained to recognize potentially dangerous behavior and starting this year cornell is taking advantage of a rarely used legal exception to student privacy rights it is assuming students are dependents of their parents allowing the school to inform parents of concerns without students permission the virginia tech massacre earlier this year in which a student with a known history of troubling behavior shot and killed people set off alarms about whether schools were overemphasizing the privacy of students at the expense of their health and safety watching over students and keeping parents in the loop may seem like obvious approaches but many schools decline to share information about their students either internally or externally schools say they fervently guard students privacy because a federal law requires them to and because they are afraid of getting sued they also say college students are adults who need to be supported in their growing independence many schools refuse to release information without a students written permission and most rarely invoke exceptions allowed in the law known as the family educational rights and privacy act or ferpa some colleges have paid out settlements when families sued for wrongful death of students and alleged that officials should have raised flags but other schools have won their cases a jury last year decided that allegheny college in meadville pa was justified in not alerting the parents of chuck mahoney to his distress before his suicide despite warning signs and discussions among officials worried he might pose a danger to himself or others ferpa allows privacy to be breached if a student is under and has a drug or alcohol violation or if there is a health or safety emergency the law only protects educational records and doesnt generally apply to observations about student behavior schools are allowed to share information with parents if students are their financial dependents as cornell is now doing this fall cornell used the new policy to inform parents that a student living in a residence hall was no longer enrolled in classes the university says the parents were grateful for the call and took the student home "when parents send their sons and daughters off to college theres an expectation and i think its understandable that there will be people looking out for them " says timothy marchell an associate director of health services at cornell who holds an unusual additional title director of mental health initiatives in the last six years since cornell took it first new steps in the school has had five student suicides it says in the previous six years there were dr marchell years old is a cornell alumnus who grew up in ithaca the son of a guidance counselor and a nurse teacher in the local school district he has been at the center of cornells recent collaborative mental health approach until a few years ago cornell interpreted privacy law as narrowly as other schools even counselors and medical doctors in the health center were reluctant to share information but cornell was battling a reputation as an intense school with a high suicide rate the university was named the most stressful of top schools in a book that surveyed students adding to its reputation was the campuss physical isolation in the rolling hills of central new york state and its unusual local geography over the years some students and others took their lives by flinging themselves off one of ithacas steep gorges stressed out students have sometimes joked about wanting to "gorge out " cornell administrators say the reputation is unfounded and that the school averages one to two suicides a year consistent with the national average for colleges still they believed that some suicides might be preventable dr marchell who volunteered at a local suicide hotline when he was a cornell senior had gone on to earn a masters degree in public health and a doctorate in psychology in cornell hired him with a mandate tackle the schools problems with student drinking the flash point was a campus tradition called slope day on the last day of classes each may students would converge on a steep lawn in the middle of campus to drink themselves silly decades ago the university itself supplied beer trucks and barbecues that stopped when the legal drinking age was raised to in the mid s but thousands of students started toting their own alcohol to the slope ambulances lined up at the edge and students suffering alcohol poisoning or injuries from fights filled the health center and the local emergency room dr marchell urged changes such as arranging appearances by well known bands to make regulating alcohol more palatable the school eventually enclosed the event with a long fence inside which it sold beer but denied it to students under underage drinking dropped sharply and alcohol poisonings began a steady decline by the executive director of cornells health center janet corson rikert began making mental health a communitywide responsibility the shootings at columbine high school had shocked educators into recognizing the danger of failing to spot troubled students like most colleges cornell was starting to see more students enrolled with severe mental health problems as reduced stigma and improved medications allowed more of them to reach college the counseling center was often overwhelmed with demand for appointments dr corson rikert asked dr marchell and others to build a network to train people to notice problems and give them ways to report them while still respecting student privacy an advisory council on mental health strategies made up of cornell staff faculty and student leaders had its first meeting in early and members had a realization in school post mortems after tragedies "each person knew pieces of the story but no one saw the whole picture " says dr marchell "if they had shared the information maybe we could have intervened " dr marchell spoke with several suicide prevention organizations who pointed the school to a surprising model the air force in the s the service decided to try to reduce suicides by airmen and studied each case for warning signs they learned to look at behavior changes discipline problems and poor performance ratings as possible indicators of depression four star generals began to talk publicly about mental illness and encourage all service members to watch for warning signs each member of the air force is now given training in detecting depression and other mental disorders the air forces protocol is one of few suicide prevention programs proven effective the average annual suicide rate dropped by a third from per people to cornell adapted parts of the program dr corson rikert enlisted the universitys president david j skorton to use his speeches and articles to encourage everyone on campus to watch out for each others mental health counselors began seminars to teach the signs of emotional problems or addiction last spring cornells health center began screening students who come in for any reason for signs of depression asking them about trouble sleeping poor appetite difficulties concentrating or thoughts of self harm in september meredith shepard a year old freshman went to the health center with a sinus infection on her questionnaire she scored high for depression and was referred to a counselor who saw her the same day miss shepard told her counselor she was feeling overwhelmed with stress from roommate problems and some "deeper struggles " she says when she was she had experienced depression and anorexia triggered by suffering she had seen on a family trip to nepal now after volunteering last year with genocide survivors in rwanda she was finding the transition to college difficult shed begun over exercising and under eating the counselor referred miss shepard to another therapist who also referred her to a nutritionist a psychiatrist and a medical doctor "its easy to feel lost uncared for and alone " she says but her "team" makes her feel "constantly aware of having a safety net " cornell therapists also make a form of house calls they hold free no appointment consulting hours in locations across campus about halfway through each semester professors in some of cornells seven undergraduate colleges are asked to report students who have bad grades seem disconnected or are failing to come to class "that kind of checking out is a very serious thing " says alan mathios interim dean of the college of human ecology "so waiting for the end of the semester to come is often too late " two psychologists work full time just consulting with professors and staff when they have concerns about students last august a review panel on the virginia tech massacre recommended that colleges do more to share information about troubled students about half the colleges in the country had teams of administrators aimed at doing so and as many as a quarter more have quickly added them according to a risk management firm that specializes in colleges insurance dr corson rikert and dr marchell had started their own multidisciplinary "alert team" in it includes the director of counseling an associate dean of students the campus police captain the universitys judicial administrator therapists and sometimes other administrators the team typically has several students on its agenda each week sometimes administrators are worried that a student has stopped going to class or as happened recently is attending classes despite having been suspended often the police report a student who has been arrested for excessive drinking or drugs therapists are legally required to keep their own patients information confidential so they say they dont share that but they can receive information from other team members and follow up and can give general professional advice recently campus police responded to calls about an alarmingly disheveled and agitated young man in a campus building they took him to the local hospital where doctors diagnosed him as psychotic and admitted him the next day members of the alert team planned travel arrangements for the students parents and set up a medical leave so the student wouldnt fail classes "we were trying to put a system in place so that when a problem gets to this level it doesnt get worse " says gregory eells the schools director of counseling and psychological services protests havent arisen over the universitys interventionist approach but administrators say many of the mental health initiatives work privately and students know little about them some students say however that the university may spend so much time caring for the most emotionally vulnerable students that it has fewer resources left for those who are merely stressed out dr marchell admits thats a potential problem with the schools approach erin geld was disappointed by cornells services last year after a good friend became seriously ill miss geld says she fell behind in classes suffered mood swings felt depressed and slept constantly but when she called the counseling center after a triage interview she was told she had to wait three weeks to see a school therapist and was offered referral to a community health resource for faster help if she wished miss geld says she felt the off campus therapy was ineffective and soon quit "despite stepping to the plate and asking for help i did not really get the support i needed from cornell " the year old from sao paulo brazil who graduated in may wrote in an editorial last march in the cornell daily sun the student newspaper dr corson rikert notes ms geld had the choice of waiting for a school counselor appointment she says the counseling center schedules many appointments within hours or days based on their urgency and tries to schedule others within two weeks but doesnt always manage catherine savage had a better counseling experience the year old whose father committed suicide when she was seven has seen a therapist and taken antidepressants since she was in middle school at cornell miss savage struggled with depression she saw a therapist at the counseling center on and off one night during her junior year miss savage called the health center crying and said she didnt want to live the nurse on the line told miss savage to go to the hospital she was admitted for days some schools have been sued for requiring suicidal students to leave dorms or campuses miss savage got a call from her cornell counselor and one of her teachers visited her at miss savages request the counselor arranged extensions in her classes and a voluntary medical leave and found her a treatment program in her hometown miss savage went home to madison wis and attended the university of wisconsin her cornell adviser helped her pick classes that would earn cornell credit a year and a half later in the fall of she came back to cornell she enjoyed her classes rejoined the cornell university chorus and continued to see her therapist at the health center "all parts of the school made it clear that my mental health had to be among my priorities if i wanted to have a happy life and do all the things i came to cornell to do " says miss savage who graduated in may and works as a hospital dietician in salt lake city "and they gave me the support "
