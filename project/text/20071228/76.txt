the biotech bottleneck as someone who works to develop innovative new therapies to fight cancer teaches oncology and cares for patients with cancer i might seem well prepared to understand what is needed for approval of a new cancer drug the outcome of a recent food and drug administration oncologic drug advisory committee meeting however has left me completely confused and discouraged genentechs blockbuster drug avastin approved in the united states for treatment of lung and colorectal cancer went before the fdas outside oncology drug advisory panel for consideration of approval for treating a form of breast cancer that has spread throughout the body in a large clinical trial avastin added to standard therapy was found to double the time to tumor progression and more than twice as many patients had significant tumor shrinkage avastin treated patients also survived slightly longer but not to a statistically significant level the clinical findings were felt to be of such immediate importance that they were presented in at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology as a "late breaking" abstract late breaking abstracts are reserved for clinical study findings that are "clinical practice changing " the data were met with extreme enthusiasm by physicians who began using the drug "off label" to treat patients with breast cancer still despite avastins widespread acceptance by many oncologists the fda continues to press for survival advantages so the fda panel of outside advisers voted against approval the fda will decide in the next couple of months whether to approve avastin or not in the meantime patients with metastatic breast cancer may find it harder to get the drug because of the fda panel outcome of some meager consolation these patients have other drugs to turn to although none of them produce cures on average these patients only live about two years a more dire situation exists for patients with pancreatic cancer only two drugs have ever been approved to treat this deadly condition and only one new drug has been approved in the last years yet it is one of the most lethal forms of cancer and the nations fourth most common cause of cancer death this year americans will be diagnosed and three fourths of them will die from the disease within months of their diagnosis only are alive at five years the u s has the worlds strongest biotech industry it is home to several leading global pharmaceutical companies and world renowned research institutes collectively we are testing and developing scores of cancer drugs that show great promise but research breakthroughs and drugs in the pipeline are not getting through to the market fast enough our clinical research infrastructure and the fda are stifling rather than encouraging investments in innovation through cumbersome and overly restrictive policies we need to unleash the power of the private sector and our leading academic institutions to fight killer diseases in the s and s government business and academia rose to the challenges presented by the emerging aids epidemic federal funding fueled academic research into aids and other diseases and the fda in accordance with a congressional mandate streamlined the approval process for drugs intended to treat life threatening diseases the private sector responded and developed in record time many fda approved drugs for both aids and cancer in for example the fda approved gemzar to treat pancreatic cancer at the time gemzar demonstrated improvement in treating disease related symptoms such as pain performance of daily activities and weight change further experience and research with this drug demonstrated that it prolonged survival of people with pancreatic cancer it has also been found valuable in treating other cancers including lung and breast cancers since progress against pancreatic cancer has stalled the fdas retreat from the use of streamlined approval procedures for drugs intended to treat life threatening diseases the stagnation of federal funding for basic research and the skyrocketing cost of drug development have all contributed to a pervasive pessimism according to the national institutes of healths clinical trial database the number of later stage clinical trials for pancreatic cancer currently under way is a fraction of those being conducted for other comparable diseases like breast lung prostate and colorectal cancers the pessimism has spread to physicians a recent study showed that more than of patients with operable localized pancreatic cancer were not offered potentially curative surgery because of fatalistic and cynical views held by their doctors to crack through this pessimism we need to kick start a new era of intense focused collaboration between government business and academia for starters the fda should utilize the accelerated approval regulations as they were originally intended when they came into effect in this will allow for conditional approval of promising drugs based on the use of surrogate endpoints which are endpoints requiring shorter term patient follow up but are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit faster approvals from smaller earlier stage trials will provide an incentive for both the private sector and academia to test more ideas and products while larger confirmatory trials are conducted as sadly demonstrated with avastin for breast cancer the fda needs to streamline its approval process for cancer drugs and stop using now outdated problematic endpoints such as survival where confounding factors such as other therapies delivered after the study treatment confuse the test drug effect we should also quickly ramp up the newly created reagan udall foundation which was recently authorized by congress as part of the fda amendments act of the laudable goals of this public private academic partnership are to develop new research tools and techniques that will be available to the entire scientific community address gross inefficiencies in our drug development process modernize product evaluation and streamline the "critical path" drugs travel from discovery to market some have expressed concern that reagan udall will allow the industry to unduly influence the fda approval process the safeguards built into the oversight mechanisms for the foundation make this highly unlikely the benefits that this collaboration could bring in terms of faster and less expensive development of treatments would attract greater investment and talent to the pursuit of breakthrough cures our recent loss of the great italian tenor luciano pavarotti to pancreatic cancer was one more reminder of the human tragedy behind the statistics pavarotti was known as the "king of the high cs" because of his uncanny ability to consistently reach and deliver with unparalleled brilliance that most difficult of notes we too should reach higher in attempting to eradicate deadly diseases dr miller is president and ceo of pharmacyclics and adjunct professor of oncology at stanford university medical center see related letters "letters to the editor no moving the goalposts once
