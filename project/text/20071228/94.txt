weekend journal best of theater discovering the world beyond broadway new york when the lights of broadway went out for days last month i shrugged i was sorry to see such long running shows as "avenue q" and "the drowsy chaperone" shuttered by a stagehands strike but i knew there were plenty of other worthy shows to see both off broadway and out of town in fact i hope the strike will encourage more american theatergoers to explore the wide range of high quality offerings in every corner of the land this isnt to say that theres anything wrong with broadway at its best but most of its best now comes from elsewhere the finest ensemble acting to be seen on broadway in for example was in tracy lettss "august osage county " which was transplanted to new york from chicagos steppenwolf theatre company the best new play of the year conor mcphersons hope stirring "the seafarer " came here in a production by the national theatre of great britain just as the thrillingly bold performances of eve best in "a moon for the misbegotten" and frank langella in "frost nixon" were first seen on the london stage what about revivals i caught some good ones in new york and the daniel sullivan directed production of harold pinters "the homecoming" that opened last week was a pure product of broadway but the others including the pearl theater companys high spirited mounting of s n behrmans rarely performed "biography" and the keen companys th anniversary revival of "the dining room " a r gurneys wryly wistful elegy for the wasp elite were mounted by tiny off broadway troupes that know how to make imagination substitute for fancy sets and costumes more often than not of course it is our regional theaters that are bringing us the most memorable productions of great plays of the past chicagos theater scene long ago established itself as comparable in quality to that of new york and a high number of the best shows i saw in took place there including the court theatres incisive staging of tom stoppards "arcadia " strawdog theatre companys up close and personal version of brian friels "aristocrats " and a performance of nilo cruzs "a park in our house" at victory gardens theater that made me wonder not for the first time why only one play by the winner of the pulitzer prize for drama has been seen on broadway to date the track record elsewhere though was scarcely less impressive who would have thought for instance that id have to go to greensboro n c to see the first revival of erskine caldwells scaldingly frank "tobacco road" to be given anywhere in the past years or that triad stages production designed with eyeball searing authenticity by howard c jones would be so excellent the list goes on and on and i can mention only a few highlights the funniest show i saw was a precision tooled revival of michael frayns "noises off" by washington d c s arena stage though the broadway premiere of mark twains "is he dead " came close thanks in large part to a zany performance by norbert leo butz the best stage comedienne of the year elizabeth aspenlieder did her seductively daffy thing in mr stoppards "rough crossing " performed by shakespeare &amp company of lenox mass the most consistently pleasing summer theater festival in america as for the biggest surprise of shakespeare theatre of new jersey which performs on the campus of drew university in madison n j revived william saroyans all but forgotten "the time of your life" and proved to my amazement and delight that it remains entirely viable i saw two very old pros on the road and marveled at their undimmed skill hal holbrook who is gave a flawless performance as the stage manager in hartford stages winningly plain spoken production of "our town " no less age defying was the year old james whitmore who joined forces with new hampshires peterborough players to kick up his heels as sheridan whiteside in "the man who came to dinner " he didnt look a day over or act a day over my hometown did do well by the classics this year though i wouldnt want to have missed the quiet beauties of long wharf theatres production of gordon edelsteins new performing version of chekhovs "uncle vanya " in which jennifer dundas was infinitely touching as sonia new haven is very very lucky to have that company around on the other hand the finest productions of shakespeare and shaw that i saw in were right here in manhattan and two of them lincoln center theaters "cymbeline" and the roundabout theatre companys "pygmalion " were actually on broadway claire danes formerly of "my so called life " made a tremendous impression in her stage debut as "pygmalion"s eliza doolittle while lauren ambroses hot blooded performance in the public theaters shakespeare in the park production of "romeo and juliet" was the years best piece of classical acting as for the irish repertory theatres small scale production of shaws "the devils disciple " it was wickedly good it was alas a mediocre year for musicals the only new score worth mentioning was that for "the glorious ones " written by lynn ahrens and stephen flaherty and produced by lincoln center theater while the only absolutely first class musical revivals to come my way were chicago shakespeares powerfully concentrated small scale rendering of stephen sondheims "passion " the roundabouts " in the shade" in which the irreplaceable audra mcdonald made her long awaited return to broadway and the brilliant arthur laurents directed city center "encores " version of "gypsy" that finally gave patti lupone a chance to play mama rose in new york its transferring to broadway later this season as if to compensate an unusually large number of new plays and local premieres came to broadway and off broadway in in addition to "the seafarer" and "august osage county " new yorkers got to see alan ayckbourns "intimate exchanges " horton footes "dividing the estate " aaron sorkins "the farnsworth invention " tom stoppards "rock n roll" and the last two installments of his "coast of utopia" trilogy and the strongest one person show to hit new york in ages stephen langs "beyond glory " all were satisfying in their varied ways while "the coast of utopia" whose first installment opened in december of last year was the theatrical event of the season one that will be talked about for a great many more seasons to come and the best all around show of that honor belongs to the manhattan theatre clubs masterly revival of brian friels "translations " directed by garry hynes the founder of irelands druid theatre company and first seen at princetons mccarter theater center it was cause for rejoicing that the mtc brought princetons "translations" to new york but the fact that it is one of only five plays by the greatest living playwright to have made it to broadway in the past years speaks for itself so too does the happier fact that mr friels plays are regularly produced by regional companies from coast to coast it is in the work of these ambitious institutions that the most passionate of american playgoers new yorkers included are increasingly learning to put their trust mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs
