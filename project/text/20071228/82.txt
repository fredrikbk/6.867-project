tracking carbon trail to find why so much fills the atmosphere one mystery of global warming underlies all others nobody knows precisely where all the worlds carbon dioxide ends up every year much of this heat trapping greenhouse gas stays aloft promising to make one of the warmest years on record levels of co in the atmosphere have surged in recent centuries scientists have calculated still that reflects barely half of all the emissions from human activities some of it seeps into soil vegetation and the oceans where it cant affect climate so immediately recently however federal researchers discovered that severe droughts and wildfires have disrupted these natural storehouses of carbon sometimes venting co equal to annual emissions from millions of cars so far scientists have no reliable way to measure all these fluctuating carbon emissions temperature predictions based on future co levels therefore could overestimate the risk of greenhouse warming or dangerously understate it "a quarter of all the co that is emitted is going somewhere and we dont know where " said david crisp at nasas jet propulsion laboratory where he is senior scientist for the &# million orbiting carbon observatory set for launch next december "that raises a lot of red flags " moreover as governments try to prevent climate change through emissions trading where buying and selling emissions rights is expected to top &# billion by the end of next year regulators must track co no matter where it comes from or where it goes to verify transactions to pinpoint the places where the planet naturally absorbs co emissions researchers have turned north america into a test lab no other region is so thoroughly monitored nor does any other area emit as much carbon dioxide about of the worlds annual total the u s mexico and canada together release about billion tons of carbon as co into the air every year from the u s alone but only about a third of it typically is absorbed by so called carbon sinks such as new forests grasslands crops and soil the rest is either in the air or unaccounted for that is according to a new study of measurements collected every week from through and analyzed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations online carbontracker system the carbontracker offers a portrait of the continent in carbon dioxide locating where greenhouse gas upwellings are strongest and where new plant growth and soil most readily remove it from the air greenhouse gas emissions were highest in the midwest which released more co than any country except russia china india and the u s as a whole by the same token co was absorbed mostly east of the rocky mountains and in northern canada where vast boreal forests hold twice as much carbon as tropical woodlands these detailed calculations reveal a countryside where these natural carbon storage zones are failing the noaa researchers determined the higher temperatures that result can through more frequent wildfires and prolonged droughts further interrupt ancient cycles of carbon storage spilling even more carbon into the air such comprehensive climate studies have begun persuading many skeptics the u s climate change science program which released its first state of the carbon cycle report for north america last month documented the same troubling trend nasa and the japanese space agency expect to launch satellites next year to track global co concentrations almost half a million times a day in a more precise diagnosis of this planetary carbon catch and release system no one can say with certainty when growing emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases will tip the balance of the atmosphere into dangerous climate changes but recent events have shown how vulnerable the worlds ability to recycle carbon can be to even moderate increases in temperatures "climate extremes can have a major effect on the amount of carbon dioxide in earths atmosphere " said noaa atmospheric chemist wouter peters an unusually severe u s drought in the noaa researchers discovered left an extra million tons of carbon in the atmosphere an amount equal to the annual emissions of million cars by stunting plant growth that normally might have absorbed the gas "we lost half our natural sink " said noaa geochemist john miller in europe a severe drought in left more than million tons of carbon in the air in turn the dry weather from higher temperatures also has made wildfires in the western u s more frequent longer burning and harder to extinguish large scale fires in western and southeastern states can release as much carbon dioxide in a few weeks as motor vehicle traffic there does in a year university of colorado researchers reported this past october in carbon balance and management in a single week this fall they reported wildfires in southern california released million metric tons of co equal to of the monthly fumes from every car truck factory and power plant in
