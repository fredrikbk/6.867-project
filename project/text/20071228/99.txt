weekend journal taste de gustibus crossing over deconstructionist professors have been trying for years to convince us that gender is a social construct now it seems politicians and even employers are doing their best to put this theory into practice may go down in history as the year of the transgendered person take the announcement in october that under a state law that takes effect in january schools in california not only cant discriminate by sex but also cant take into account "a persons gender identity and gender related appearance and behavior whether or not stereotypically associated with the persons assigned sex at birth " michigan gov jennifer granholm has just issued a similar order in her state barring discrimination against state workers based on their "gender identity or expression " and members of congress have been trying for several months to add crimes against the transgendered to the list of categories punishable under federal hate crimes law the idea is that a person though born with a particular anatomy may not feel that it is the right one he or she may choose to dress differently use hormonal therapy or at the extreme adopt a surgical solution as one such individual recently wrote to the san francisco bay times "my medical condition was not a matter of nurture and or a choice but was caused by a biological error in the womb " it is estimated by the national center for transgendered equality that between and of americans place themselves in this category the transgendered are now grouped with gays lesbians and bisexuals in the abbreviation glbt this makes sense in certain ways but not in others for one thing the transgendered part of the acronym makes a claim on public accommodation that the "glb" part does not and thus poses a radically different challenge to social norms john nemecek a business professor at spring arbor university an evangelical college in michigan was demoted earlier this year because he started wearing makeup and earrings and calling himself julie according to a march story in this newspaper he was diagnosed by a doctor with "gender identity disorder" and started hormone therapy prof nemecek has filed a complaint against the school with the equal employment opportunity commission "essentially theyre saying they can define who is a christian " he has said religious people it turns out are among those who do not accept transgenderism claiming that it destroys the moral foundations of our civilization but they have practical questions that the rest of us may be wondering about too a christian group called the advocates for faith and freedom has launched a lawsuit to stop the aforementioned california law from going into effect robert tyler a lawyer for the group asks "what will prevent the pound linebacker from deciding he wants to share the locker room with the cheerleaders " that sounds like a silly question but isnt really a couple of years ago pauline park a man who feels he is a woman was stopped by security officers coming out of the ladies room of new york citys manhattan mall mr park filed a complaint with the city under the terms of the settlement advantage security adopted a policy allowing people to use bathrooms "consistent with their gender identity " so what is the justification for overturning the millennia old practice of sorting people into two sexes lets start with the science what little there is one might think that "gender identity disorder" is a psychological ailment but the american psychiatric association apa notes that "many transgender people do not experience their transgender feelings and traits to be distressing or disabling which implies that being transgender does not constitute a mental disorder per se " so transgenderism it is argued is a physical ailment for which there are medical solutions in that sense too it is different from homosexuality which is no longer considered an ailment at all let alone one that requires a cure not all experts agree with the apa paul mchugh a former director of the department of psychiatry at johns hopkins university notes that the transgendered patients he has come to know were no happier after sex change surgery than before he writes in "the mind has mountains" "i concluded that to provide a surgical alteration to the body of these unfortunate people was to collaborate with a mental disorder rather than to treat it " in certain quarters the findings of dr mchugh and a few like minded professionals have been met with outrage to question the narrative of the transgendered all that is wrong they say is our societys "social construct" is to invite a ferocious response michael bailey a psychologist at northwestern university published a book in suggesting that some men who want to change genders are living in a kind of fantasy they are motivated by an erotic idea of themselves as women he was met with a campaign of harassment one critic even posted pictures of mr baileys children on the internet with sexually explicit captions under them elites have noticed this ferocity and have begun to accommodate it atlanta hosted the nations first transgender career fair in september according to a report in the los angeles times the expo drew representatives from major corporations but logistical questions came up should applicants list both their male and female names on resumes what if a potential employer called an old reference who didnt know about an applicants "change" even elementary schools have had to adjust an article in the new york times revealed how parents of children with gender confusion are now being encouraged to dress their children as members of the opposite sex "at the park day school in oakland calif teachers are urged to line up students by sneaker color rather than by gender " when officials in port ewen n y decided to let a school principal stay on even after a sex change most parents didnt protest but one resident of a neighboring town told a reporter "god makes things perfect and people want to screw it all up " its a passing remark but it raises an interesting question what does it mean that once conceived a person was somehow given the wrong body should we hold god responsible and what bathroom does he want us going into ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
