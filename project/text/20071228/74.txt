the advent of more information on the amazing history of christmas john steele gordon "a brief history of christmas" op ed dec closes with the statement "if it isnt mentioned in the gospels of luke and mark then it is not part of the christian holiday " actually it is the gospels of john and mark that skip the events of jesus birth by contrast luke gives the most comprehensive account devoting nearly two chapters to the event philip massey la mirada calif mr gordon fails in his endeavor to convince us that our celebration of the birth of christ is a mere decoration riding on the back of secular and commercial rituals instead of the other way around mr gordon asserts "in the s charles dickens wrote a christmas carol which does not even mention the religious holiday " here are three quotes from dickenss story that belie mr gordons words  when bob cratchet relates to his family what tiny tim said "he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made beggars walk and blind men see "  when the ghost of christmas present tells us "it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself "  when scrooges nephew makes the astute observation "i have always thought of christmas when it has come round apart from the veneration of its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from that " and the nephew goes on to describe the holiday as "a kind forgiving time when men and women open their shut up hearts " an uncanny nuance in the history of christianity is the way it spreads itself not from conqueror to conquered but rather to influence those who encounter it serendipitously germanic tribes assimilated the religion from the roman christians they pillaged as did tartars from their christian russian subjects so whats to say that the groundwork for christmas was laid centuries before by god in pagan celebrations of the winter solstice as a preview a plan devised by our creator in anticipation of a coming event he planned to be so great it would change the world could not all those merchants mr gordon holds to be the real instigators of the holiday be duped like the huns and the tartars into a spirit of joy they cant justify or explain as scrooges nephew put it so eloquently christmas is "the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely and think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and i say god bless it " michael d wyly colonel u s marine corps ret pittsfield maine i loved your history of christmas i was raised in a very religious protestant family and always heard the line about remembering "the reason for the season " who knew that "reason" was actually an ancient celebration of the solstice i love it what a great reason to party well im off to spike the eggnog rob ganjon south orange n j
