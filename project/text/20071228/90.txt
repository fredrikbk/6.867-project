weekend journal best of film for this years movies small was beautiful picking best films isnt so hard you list your favorites assign priorities cut the list off at the magic number and there you are picking the one best though can be very hard this year it seemed all but impossible how to choose between a rat the one in "ratatouille" a butterfly as in "the diving bell and the butterfly" or a skunk the oil man played by daniel day lewis in "there will be blood" last year i weaseled by claiming there was no clear best this year ive tried to ferret out my true feelings on the basis of one sole criterion which of these three superb films left me literally speechless only one did if anyone had asked me what i thought as i left the screening room after seeing "the diving bell and the butterfly " i couldnt have managed a single word julian schnabels film adapted by ronald harwood from the memoir of the same title by jean dominique bauby is small in scale and its in french with english subtitles a fact that will limit its audience in our increasingly insular culture as if a film about a man able to communicate only with his left eyelid werent sufficiently limited in its mass appeal but thats not what the film is really about baubys slender volume which he dictated letter by letter by blinking that eyelid speaks to nothing less than the twin miracles of human consciousness and memory and the beauty of his book bespeaks the transformative power of art those are the themes mr schnabel and his collaborators took on when they chose to do the screen version the film rises majestically to the challenge plunge into "ratatouille" at any point the dvd is spinning inside my computer as i write this and the pleasure is intense thats a function of the films density and generosity the writer director brad bird marshalling all the resources of pixar animation studios has stuffed his story with details about restaurants cooking and gastronomy yet never slowed the narrative down and just as much as "the diving bell and the butterfly" is about art "ratatouille" is about the emergence of an artist the hero a rat named remy was born with a hypersensitive sniffer he can smell the ingredients in the garbage that he and his fellow rodents steal early in its development the film was known as "untitled rodent project " but raw talent alone doesnt get remy to the french gastronomical equivalent of carnegie hall the movie tracks what it is that does the little guys yearning his passion and his capacity for practice in pixars films practice seems to make perfect almost every time during the first few minutes of "there will be blood" i didnt time them because for a while i didnt realize that a significant silence was unfolding paul thomas andersons epic film about oil and capitalism has no dialogue except for the single word "no " soon after that word was spoken i spoke a silent "yes " yes this surprising choice of source material is going to work yes the insistently modern man who made "boogie nights " "magnolia" and "punch drunk love" has an equally firm grasp on upton sinclair and americana from the turn of the th century and radioheads jonny greenwood has written a score that like the movie itself vibrates with emotions both repressed and released increasingly the fall and winter release season has become a time for film versions of prestigious novels many of which turn out to be disappointments "love in the time of cholera" and "the kite runner" among them "atonement " on the other hand offers an eminently fair trade astute performances evocative settings searching intelligence and bountiful visual details in exchange for the inimitable inner voices and not quite expressible complexities of ian mcewans masterful book as in "the diving bell and the butterfly " a great deal of credit for the films success goes not only to the director joe wright but to the exemplary screenplay this one written by christopher hampton when people argue the merits of "into the wild" and sean penns film does provoke argument the issues are usually the authenticity or foolishness of the young heros quest the length of the film and the stylistic adornments or fripperies that pop up every now and then on screen any or all of these considerations deserve debate but within the context of an unusually ambitious and remarkably substantial film with a fine starring performance by emile hirsch putting together these lists every year i realize the growing importance of emotional resonance if i continue to feel see or hear parts of a film long after ive watched it in a theater then the film may be a good candidate for the list in the case of "juno " i can hear the tone of the piece at will not just an abstract tone but ellen pages voice simultaneously urgent and edgy tossing off the pungent one liners and studiedly casual aphorisms that constitute the pregnant juno macduffs main line of defense against a world that treats her like a misfit clown and against a scared sensitive self that doesnt want to be outed another factor in this parlor game of list making is afterlife whats the chance that people will still be watching a given movie or years from now "ratatouille" may be a shoo in but no one knows about the prospects of a "juno " or another of several miniaturist marvels on my list "lars and the real girl " all i know is that ill be coming back to sample the surprises and rewards of nancy olivers first feature script craig gillespies direction of a flawless supporting cast and ryan goslings laconic performance as a man who loves weirdly and certainly not too well but who earns great helpings of love for his efforts including a documentary that almost no one has seen may seem like an affectation but my hope is to get you to see "manufactured landscapes " not to impress you with the fashionable obscurity of my taste discovering jennifer baichwals film at the new zealand film festival earlier this year it also played briefly in this country was a perception changing experience inspired by the work of the canadian photographer edward burtynsky "manufactured landscapes" starts with an eight minute tracking shot down one aisle of a chinese factory the size of a small town then it follows mr burtynsky on a tour of industrial asia in order to show without polemics the scale of mans activities and the impact theyre having on our planet i thought i had some sense of that impact until i saw this astonishing doc a writer can strum only so many chords of praise for a single film and ive already run through my repertoire on behalf of "once " suffice it to say that john carneys low budget irish romance with music starring glen hansard and marketa irglova really is about music along with other things including love just as "ratatouille" really is about among other things food and cooking and its one of those little films that you take to your heart not knowing whether anyone else feels the same way thats what happened the first time i saw it now i know lots of people feel the same way my only question concerning "waitress" is whether id feel the same way about adrienne shellys last film if the filmmaker hadnt died hadnt been murdered after making it i think the answer is yes in any circumstances in any year this one of a kind comedy would shine on its own in the context of this list its one of four feature films made on tight budgets with extremely modest resources five if you include "the diving bell and the butterfly " that seems odd i didnt make these choices to prove a point but it also seems right in the ever more threatening business of making films developing scripts finding money fighting off those who understand nothing and want to change everything little movies like these coming in under everyones radar have the best shot at surviving the process unscathed
