weekend journal best of television cause for enthusiasm it wasnt the best of years for television nothing like the one before with a lineup that introduced one entirely distinguished new drama series "friday night lights" nbc and one sturdily satisfying one "brothers and sisters" abc in addition to " rock" nbc an exuberantly unpredictable comedy series whose strength remains undiminished in its second year all three are currently alive and well and doing their part to sustain life in a tv season freighted by the failures and quick terminations all well justified of most new entries add to that the most dismal of all freight on the network lineup and this began long before any writers strike namely the multiplication of reality shows with their parade of weepy contestants making their ways through one network devised competition after another each more unspeakable than the last for all that the landscape wasnt entirely grim this was for one thing a breakout year for hbos "curb your enthusiasm " which has in its sixth season achieved a consistent blazing hilarity stronger than any shown before which is saying a lot this was apparently evident to its star and co producer larry david who has until now kept hbo executives guessing at the end of each season as to whether hed trouble himself to do another one as this years work came to an end mr david according to those in a position to know announced that he was ready and willing to do another one "curb" fans who sat howling with laughter at larrys marital and dating problems not to mention his complex new life with a family of katrina survivors will be happy to hear the news his comedy like that of so many other comedians has of course always fed on the daring there is little more familiar in comedy today than material that traffics in the forbidden particularly when it comes to subjects of race and religion but theres a difference between mr david and most other comedians drawing on the same high voltage material he is one of the few who seems to know in his bones that the mere march up to the forbidden wont do notwithstanding the automatic laughter with which audiences now respond to the merest allusion to the prohibited its the capacity to run with that material and find a comic heart in it that is the trick and it is that trick thats at the core of his work who can forget his venture a few seasons back into the perilous depths of holocaust reference in a show about a waiter working in a new restaurant jointly owned by larry david and his pals the waiter was notably lacking in capacities for his job but they couldnt fire him he was a survivor of the holocaust after all the entire segment turned on this dilemma how could larry and friends fire a survivor the show was smart and knowing though far from hilarious unlike another episode titled "the ski lift " this one in which the comedian tries to pass himself off as an orthodox jew in order to get his friend bumped up to the head of a kidney transplant line dont ask is by now a classic among "curb" devotees for its nonstop hilarity its brazen invention the season just concluded with story lines concerning a black family of katrina survivors who come to make their home in the david household will rank among the shows classics for the same reasons this culture clash of memorable dimensions finds larry horror struck at what his visitors eat for breakfast huge platefuls of fried stuff sausages eggs unimpressed by his advice to throw that stuff out and eat something healthy they continue eating imperturbably who would throw out food like this the idea they explain is to eat it there are clashes more significant including one involving use of the "n" word in which larry is accused but theres no mistaking a powerful bond between the host and his guests or the complications to which all of this leads in the affecting and boisterous cliffhanger of a season finale theres nothing officially comedic about "dirty sexy money" abc one of two new network series that are absorbing enough to keep you watching but contain nothing that would make you desperate if you missed an episode still the comedy is what stands out in this tale about the darlings a fabulously wealthy clan ensconced in a new york city penthouse and headed by the provocatively unreadable tripp darling a role donald sutherland plays with panache the cast is packed with well known names peter krause and jill clayburgh among them but its mr sutherland as father to the brood of wrecks and sociopaths known as the darling children and husband to the elegant letitia who has betrayed him for years who gives this enterprise its heft and charm nbcs "life" the other new drama of interest both have been renewed turns similarly on a single performance that of damian lewis as charlie crews police detective charlie has been confined to federal prison for years on false murder charges then cleared and restored to his job in his dual mission solving crimes and trying to finger the police higher ups who helped frame him charlie is a problem to the department as the talented mr lewis portrays him hes an enigmatic and seductive figure with interesting shades of sexiness that fall away too quickly to grasp all of which is to say that mr lewis has succeeded in imparting an improbably powerful allure to this cop story no list of the years noteworthy television could fail to include "the war" pbs ken burnss sweeping documentary of world war ii mr burns took remarkable care to exclude any note of triumph any suggestion that there had been or could ever be "a good war " the depth of this determination took bizarre turns on occasion not least in interviews the filmmaker gave prior to the opening of the series in which he announced that one of his intentions was to do away with the myth which he seemed to think americans cleaved to of world war ii as a bloodless affair still for all the solemn nonsense implicit in this campaign mr burnss documentary stands as an invaluable chronicle of the war battle by battle not least for its unforgettable portraits of some of the americans who fought it
