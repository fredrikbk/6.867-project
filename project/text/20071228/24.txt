happy new year as the new year approaches investors are looking for any possible edge that they can get in this tough market they may want to look to the month of january the "january effect" the discovery in the s that small stocks strongly outperformed large stocks in the first month of the year has lost its strength recently but there are still some patterns around the new year that may be very profitable for investors historically the january effect was a powerhouse over the past years all the outperformance of small stocks over large stocks has taken place in the first month of the year in fact if you held the s&amp p index for the months from february through december and then switched to a small stock fund for the month of january your returns would soar to nearly a year this return is almost five percentage points above the market beating almost all active money managers no one knows for sure why the january effect existed some believe it is due to tax motivated trading by small traders who sell losing stocks in december to establish a tax loss and buy them back in january there is some evidence that supports this because when small stock do poorly the january bounce is more pronounced another theory is that the january effect is due to the investment in small stocks of year end bonuses and other compensation that takes place in january whatever the reasons the january effect has been far weaker since it was widely publicized in the s from through january the average january return on the russell index has been only slightly more than the percent return on the s&amp p index perhaps the absence of the january effect is due to investors buying small stocks in december hoping to take advantage of the january bounce and then selling these stocks after the new year pushing their prices down and nullifying the effect there has however been a bit of a revival of the january effect in recent years since the average return on small stocks in january has risen to versus for large stocks this is not as big as the historical difference but it is far larger than that found in the s perhaps by traders had stopped playing the january effect and now the anomaly has resurfaced despite the dampening of the january effect january is still a good month for u s stocks both large and small but it is an even better month for foreign stock markets since the january returns for all countries covered by the morgan stanley capital market index are above average and january accounts for nearly one quarter of the total annual stock returns in foreign markets one year end phenomenon has completely changed its stripes in recent years historically the last trading day of the year has been good for stock investors with average daily returns of one third percent more than times the daily average but this end of the year effect has not only disappeared since the average return on the last trading day has turned to a decisively negative interestingly most of the decline on the last trading day occurs in the last minutes of trading this is probably due to year end arbitrage where institutional investors unwind hedges that were created earlier and also take some final tax losses these daily trends open up opportunities for both short term and long term investors speculators can sell stock at p m on dec and then buy it back for a lower price at p m for longer term investors who wish to get into the market put your buy orders in at the close of trading on dec but whatever happens on the last trading day dont let it spoil your new years eve january is generally a good month for stock investors happy new year mr siegel a professor of finance at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school is the author of "stocks for the long run " which mcgraw hill recently released in its th edition
