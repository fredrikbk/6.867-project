the afternoon report watching pakistan online edition unrest wracked the worlds most unstable nuclear power as slain former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto was laid to rest and questions remained about her killers hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in the town of garhi khuda bakhsh in sindh the bhutto familys ancestral homeland where ms bhuttos remains were interred in the political dynastys massive white domed mausoleum such displays along with rioting that convulsed several cities throughout the country overnight provide ample proof of the anger and disappointment coursing through a substantial element of the populace in the port city of karachi three policemen were wounded in a shootout with a mob which also ransacked and burned at least three banks some in the central city of multan looted banks and a gas station and stoned police who responded by firing tear gas soldiers patrolled the streets of karachi and hyderabad for its part the musharraf administration further sought to prove its case that ms bhutto was killed by islamic extremists interior minister hamid nawaz said on friday that "we have the evidence that al qaeda and the taliban were behind the suicide attack on benazir bhutto " likewise more details were starting to emerge on possible new leadership among ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party which was founded by her father a prime minister who was ousted and later executed by the military in the late s ms bhutto has largely ruled the party by fiat and true to pakistani political form stifled the development of other strong leaders who might someday challenge her and as a result the ppp now suffers from a cavernous leadership vacuum ahead of the jan parliamentary elections of course it still remains to be seen whether the party itself will choose to continue with the electoral process where it might garner new support in the wake of ms bhuttos murder or send supporters out into the streets on the leadership front no heir apparent is readily identifiable the chairman of the ppp makhdoom amin fahim has long been identified as a bhutto subordinate and mr bhuttos husband asif ali zardari suffers from health problems a lack of charisma and the taint of corruption more formidable options might include aitzaz ahsan a prominent lawyer and a major opponent of president musharraf others have mentioned sherry rehman a charismatic ppp spokeswoman and bhutto aide who was reportedly injured in the attack on ms bhutto picking the right person to sustain the most viable opposition party will be crucial to the

planning official who is now a senior fellow for india pakistan and south asia at the council on foreign relations however a candidate running simply on sympathy "wouldnt necessarily keep the party
