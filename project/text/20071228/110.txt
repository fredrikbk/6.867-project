yk echoes or not four indicators in next few weeks will suggest whether current credit crunch just vanishes if only the current debt market turmoil were a replay of yk back in investors and bankers worried that computers would seize up the moment the new year hit hoarded cash central banks pumped money into the markets to keep the financial system from seizing up by dawn on jan the millennial bug was a trivia question history repeated itself this year as banks hoarded cash though this time it was to make sure their books squared at the end of the year and central banks again opened the monetary spigots in the hope of keeping markets flowing smoothly that has some investors hoping that the parallel continues and markets return to normal when they open in dont count on it the new year could see renewed problems as banks and investors facing fresh calls on capital continue stockpiling cash "getting through year end is no panacea " morgan stanley banking analyst betsy graseck said in a report this week she added that investors still need time probably until the middle of next year to tally the losses among banks brokers and insurers banks will remain reluctant to lend to one anther for the same reason the risk is that while all this gets sorted out the economy tips into recession "the continued uncertainty of what land mines remain on bank balance sheets has the potential to spill over into restricted lending to industrial firms " economists at moodys investors service said in a note yesterday there are four areas to focus on in the first weeks of the new year to get a sense of whether the markets are improving or worsening one important indicator will be the difference between key central bank interest rates and the rates that banks charge each other to borrow money the bigger the spread the more reluctant banks are to lend to one another in august and november the difference between the rates bank charge each other for loans and the expected interest rates charged by central banks widened to more than a full percentage point such spreads are typically less than a fifth of a percentage point the november spike eclipsed surges seen during the financial crisis and in the run up to yk according to morgan stanley such indicators have calmed somewhat since mid december when the european central bank pumped about &# billion into the banking system and the federal reserve lent out &# billion through a special new term auction facility that seems to have gotten banks through the end of the year but markets improved after the meltdown in august only to worsen again in november the second factor is what the central banks do early next month the ecb will have to decide whether to roll over the short term loans it made this month or withdraw the stopgap funding if the ecb siphons that cash from markets when funding pressures may be rebuilding credit markets could seize up again but keeping the money in markets could be seen as a bailout of financial institutions and expose the ecb to dangers since it has accepted potentially risky assets as collateral for loans to banks the ecbs extraordinary step was "excusable at the end of the year but if that extends further youre going to have a serious issue here where the government is meddling in private industry " says axel merk manager of merk hard currency fund "then we could have more distortions and there could be other folks corporate issuers who should have access to credit being shut out " at the same time the fed will have to decide how much additional money to offer to banks through its new auction facility last week the fed said it would continue these auctions "for as long as necessary to address elevated pressures in short term funding markets " the fed isnt putting as much money to work in markets as the ecb but its new auctions may help bolster bank confidence if banks show that they dont have trouble repaying the loans says ed mckelvey senior economist at goldman sachs "what the fed is hoping is that if banks start to trust one another again you can unlock the money and that can have a beneficial effect " he adds the third factor is the commercial paper market in january about &# billion of commercial paper backed by assets such as mortgages will come due according to federal reserve data yet the market for this kind of debt typically issued by conduits and structured investment vehicles is quickly shrinking for the week that ended wednesday outstanding asset backed commercial paper measured on a seasonally adjusted basis fell to &# billion compared with &# billion at the end of november the amount outstanding peaked at nearly &# trillion in august as this market contracts banks are often forced to purchase the vehicles notes that gives them a big reason to hold on to cash leading to further stress in money markets finally there is earnings season banks start reporting annual results in mid january these figures will be important because they are signed off on by auditors who have taken a tough stand when it comes to marking down securities linked to mortgage debt on wednesday goldman sachs analyst william tanona said in a report that citigroup inc may post an &# billion write down in the fourth quarter the prospects of such hits are likely to keep both banks and investors on tenterhooks well into the new year
