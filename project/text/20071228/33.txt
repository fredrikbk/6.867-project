judge rules finish line must acquire genesco a tennessee judge ruled that finish line inc must complete its &# billion acquisition of rival retailer genesco inc rebuking finish line and its bankers at ubs ag for how they handled details of the merger the trial has been closely watched on wall street as investors and corporate boards look for guidance in how to handle a spate of litigation over scuttled merger agreements the order issued late yesterday by chancery court judge ellen hobbs lyle could chill remorseful business acquirers the page document concludes that finish lines contract was too solid to be broken by claims of material adverse changes at genesco and it batted away arguments that genesco had fraudulently hidden sales data that if revealed would have halted finish lines acquisition plans genesco and its adviser goldman sachs "did not fraudulently conceal information " chancellor lyle wrote instead the "fault is with finish liness advisers ubs and its agents whom finish line was relying on to investigate genesco " to ask for the critical data chancellor lyles final order was a severe one courts are generally hesitant to accept so called "specific performance" language to enforce a transaction against parties that dont wish to complete it but in this case the judge found that the merger has a "reasonable chance of succeeding" and that specific performance is not a "futile harsh result " she did however leave one path for finish line and the swiss bank to extract themselves from the deal ubs which is providing practically all of the financing on the transaction has sued in a separate new york court the bank argues that it would be funding a business that would be immediately insolvent should ubs persuade the court chancellor lyle said it would "halt the merger " the decision nonetheless puts great pressure on ubs which now faces the possibility of committing a huge amount of funding at a moment when it is husbanding its own capital from indications of a statement released last night the bank is prepared to stand behind finish line "we have consistently stood with our client in its position on this transaction and have been prepared to fund the transaction if the conditions of the financing are met " the statement said while noting it "respectfully disagrees" with the courts finding ubs may find some solace in chancellor lyles opinion in it she found that genescos business had in fact suffered a material adverse effect largely because of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions normally finish line would be able to cancel the merger because of those changes but it was prevented in this case because genescos contract strictly forbade it still ubs may focus on chancellor lyles opinion that the downturn has in fact affected the combined companys ability to pay its financing costs while still leaving money for new investment it is now up to the bank to convince a new york court that those conditions are so severe that they would immediately bankrupt a combined finish line genesco
