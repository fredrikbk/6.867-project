bhuttos legacy benazir bhuttos tragic assassination highlights the fears about pakistan that she voiced over the last several months years of dictatorship and sponsorship of islamist extremism have made this nuclear armed muslim nation of million people a safe haven for terrorists that threaten the world bhutto had the courage and vision to challenge both the terrorism and the authoritarian culture that nurtured it her assassination has already exacerbated pakistans instability and uncertainty riots have been reported from several parts of the country as grief has fanned anger against a government that is deeply unpopular as pakistanis mourn the death of a popular democratic leader the united states must review its policy of trusting the military dominated regime led by pervez musharraf to secure stabilize and democratize pakistan the u s should use its influence acquired with more than &# billion in economic and military aid to persuade pakistans military to loosen its grip on power and negotiate with politicians with popular support most prominently bhuttos successors in her pakistan peoples party instead of calibrating terrorism as mr musharraf appears to have done pakistan must work towards eliminating terrorism as bhutto demanded the immediate consequence of the assassination will likely be postponement of the legislative elections scheduled for jan bhuttos party led in opinion polls followed by the opposition faction of the conservative pakistan muslim league pml led by nawaz sharif immediately after bhuttos assassination mr sharif announced that he is now joining the boycott of the polls called by several smaller political parties if mr musharraf goes ahead with elections it is unlikely that it would have much credibility in her death as in her life benazir bhutto has drawn attention to the need for building a moderate muslim democracy in pakistan that cares for its people and allows them to elect its leaders the war against terrorism she repeatedly argued cannot be won without mobilizing the people of pakistan against islamist extremists and bringing pakistans security services under civilian control unfortunately at the moment bhuttos homeland and mine remains a dictatorship controlled through secret police machinations mr musharrafs regime has squandered its energies fighting civilian democrats instead of confronting the menace of terrorism that has now claimed the life of one of the nations most popular political figures his administration will have to answer many tough questions in the next few days about its failure to provide adequate security to bhutto particularly after an earlier assassination attempt against her on oct the suicide bombing on that day marking her homecoming after eight years in exile claimed the lives of people mainly bhutto supporters but the government refused to accept bhuttos requests for an investigation assisted by the fbi or scotland yard both of which have greater competence in analyzing forensic evidence than pakistans notoriously corrupt and incompetent law enforcement the circumstances of the first assassination attempt remain mired in mystery and a complete investigation has yet to take place television images soon after bhuttos assassination showed fire engines hosing down the crime scene in what can only be considered a calculated washing away of forensic evidence bhutto had publicly expressed fears that pro extremist elements within pakistans security services were complicit in plans to eliminate her she personally asked me to communicate her concerns to u s officials which i did but instead of addressing those fears mr musharraf cynically rejected bhuttos request for international security consultants to be hired at her own expense this cynicism on the part of the pakistani authorities is now causing most of bhuttos supporters to blame the musharraf regime for her tragic death in her two terms as prime minister both cut short by military backed dismissals on charges that were subsequently never proven bhutto outlined the vision of a modern and pluralistic muslim state her courage was legendary she stepped into the shoes of her populist father zulfikar ali bhutto without much training or inclination for politics after he was executed by an earlier military ruler gen zia ul haq she was demonized by the civil military oligarchy that has virtually run pakistan since the year of pakistans first military coup but she retained a hard core of popular support and her social democratic pakistan peoples party is widely regarded as pakistans largest political party in at the age of bhutto became the youngest prime minister in pakistans troubled history and the first woman to lead a muslim nation in the modern age for her supporters she stood for womens empowerment human rights and mass education her detractors accused her of many things from corruption to being too close to the u s during her second tenure as prime minister pakistan became one of the emerging capital markets of the world the world health organization praised government efforts in the field of health rampant narcotics problems were tackled and several drug barons arrested bhutto increased government spending on education and new schools were built thousands of teachers were recruited with the understanding that a secular education covering multiple study areas particularly technical and scientific education would improve the lives of pakistanis and create job opportunities critical to self empowerment but pakistans political turbulence and her constant battle with the countrys security establishment never allowed her to take credit for these achievements for years her image was tarnished by critics who alleged that she did not deliver on her promise during the early days after mr musharrafs decision to support the u s led war against terrorism in the aftermath of conventional wisdom in washington wrote her off but pakistans constant drift into extremism and mr musharrafs inability to win pakistani hearts and minds changed that earlier this year the united states and the united kingdom supported efforts for a transition to democracy in pakistan based on a negotiated settlement between bhutto and mr musharraf she was to be allowed to return to pakistan and the many corruption charges filed against her and her husband asif zardari were to be dropped mr musharraf promised free and fair elections and promised to end a bar imposed by him against bhutto running for a third term as prime minister but on nov his imposition of a state of emergency suspension of pakistans constitution and arbitrary reshuffling of the countrys judiciary brought that arrangement to an end he went back on his promises to bhutto and as elections approached recrimination between the two was at its height benazir bhutto had the combination of political brilliance charisma popular support and international recognition that made her a credible democratic alternative to mr musharraf her elimination from the scene is not only a personal loss to millions of pakistanis who loved and admired her it exposes her nations vulnerability and the urgent need to deal with it mr haqqani a professor at boston university and co chair of the hudson institutes project on islam and democracy is the author of "pakistan between mosque and military" carnegie endowment for international peace he has served as adviser to several pakistani prime ministers including benazir bhutto
