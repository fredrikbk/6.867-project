late night talk shows set to go scriptless televisions late night talk show hosts are set to return to the airwaves next week but their jokes will pretty much have to write themselves after sitting out the first two months of the hollywood writers strike the hosts have agreed under pressure from their network bosses to go back to work but members of the writers guild of america including the folks who supply the hosts with most of their laugh lines are still out on picket lines this week and no new rounds of negotiations are scheduled as a result the shows are likely to look very different from what viewers are accustomed to the guilds strike rules are extremely broad and vague prohibiting the late night talk show hosts most of whom are guild members from doing anything that constitutes "writing services " that means the hosts are technically forbidden from writing and performing the traditional opening monologue plotting out sketches in advance or creating fictional characters that would perform on the shows producers of the late night shows are hoping to fill that void with more and longer celebrity interviews but those are proving hard to book especially for the first night that the shows return to air according to celebrity publicists and people who work on the shows many of the most prominent actors are reluctant to be the first to cross the picket lines to appear on late night tv meanwhile producers are also struggling to plot out the rest of the hour long shows while hewing to the guilds rules because of the ambiguity of the rules the guild is encouraging late night producers to be in frequent contact with guild authorities to vet potentially rule breaking bits says chris albers a monologue writer for "late night with conan obrien" who is out on strike and a former president of the guild mr albers says the guild likely would permit a more free flowing monologue in the style of jack paar who hosted a version of "the tonight show" from to and opened the show each night with a more personal approach than the current crop of hosts use he also says that audience participation would probably make the cut but he says anything traditionally written by writers david lettermans "top ten list " for example and anything based on ideas developed by writers before they went on strike are unacceptable because of the gray areas in the strike rules it is entirely possible that there will be violations in that case the guild would bring the case before the writers guild disciplinary committee says sherry goldman a spokeswoman for the guild mr albers says he has been in frequent contact with producers and writers of the east coast late night shows none has figured out exactly how they will fill their first hours back on the air he says the shows plan largely to rely on extemporaneous speeches from the hosts and extra banter between the hosts and the band directors about the strike itself among other topics according to people who work on the shows since much of the "writing" on these shows consists of generating ideas for skits and segments which are loosely scripted and then partially improvised on air producers say it is unclear how much forethought is technically permissible other ideas being batted around by producers that they believe dont violate strike rules include man on the street and audience interviews clips from youtube and other video web sites and footage of political candidates particularly the democrats many of whom have declined to cross picket lines in support of the guild in all seven shows will be returning to the air in the next two weeks cbss "late show with david letterman" and "late late show with craig ferguson" nbcs "the tonight show with jay leno" and "late night with conan obrien" abcs "jimmy kimmel live" and comedy centrals "the daily show with jon stewart" and "the colbert report " which stars stephen colbert mr lettermans independent production company worldwide pants inc which wholly owns both cbs talk shows is in discussions with the writers guild of america to reach an interim agreement that would allow the shows to return with their writers mr letterman has signaled that either way the shows will be returning on jan much is riding on the outcome of the negotiations between worldwide pants and the guild if the two sides are able to reach a settlement messrs letterman and ferguson would have a tremendous advantage over the other hosts both in being able to draw on their writers but also because they would effectively become the only late night outlets available to celebrities eager to talk up their coming projects without having to cross picket lines being writer less is expected to put a particularly heavy burden on the "the daily show" and "the colbert report " these shows which return on jan have a greater dependence on scripted material the shows which also are more focused on politics than their broadcast network counterparts have some prepared material on the election in the can that would likely be supplemented by unscripted grist from messrs stewart and colbert "the daily show" may also be able to rely on help from some of its correspondents most of whom arent in the guild a number of prominent actors with major movies arriving in theaters this winter have pledged their support to the writers and said they refuse to appear on the talk shows the screen actors guild has its own negotiations with the alliance of motion picture and television producers the body that represents the networks and studios coming up this spring and many of their interests align with those of writers late show producers have spent the past two weeks scrambling to book guests including reaching out to musical acts nonunion celebrities and b and c list actors according to people who work on the shows so far only one show has announced guests for its first night back on air if he returns jan mr letterman will host donald trump "weve been on the phone with publicists for the last six weeks " debbie vickers executive producer of the "the tonight show with jay leno " said in a conference call with reporters last week "im not saying its going to be easy but well be able to do the shows " the hosts are returning under pressure from their network bosses and out of loyalty to their nonwriting staffs whom the hosts themselves have been paying out of pocket since the start of the strike while the return of the shows will ease a major anxiety of the media companies how to promote their coming films the hosts have vowed to use their prominent platforms to advocate for the guild there are growing divisions within the writers guild over how to respond to the return of the late shows with some prominent members arguing the guild shouldnt strike an independent deal with worldwide pants or that the guild should only agree to a binding contract not an interim deal these hard liners are pushing to picket the shows when they return next week and are encouraging celebrities to refuse to appear as guests said two active guild members the hosts have had limited contact with their writing staffs since the start of the strike as networks prepared to announce their return last week each host took some pains to reach out to his head writers to explain those decisions according to writers on each of the shows two talk shows returned to air earlier in the strike nbcs "last call with carson daly" and the syndicated daytime talk show "the ellen degeneres show " both drew strong protests from the guild in the last time the writers guild of america went on strike johnny carson was in much the same position that mr letterman is now mr carson tried to negotiate a separate agreement with the guild and when the guild refused he returned without his writers at the beginning of may performing monologues and largely keeping to the conventions of his broadcast within the month the guild agreed to an independent deal with mr carsons production company carson tonight inc and mr carsons writers returned to work sam schechner contributed to this article
