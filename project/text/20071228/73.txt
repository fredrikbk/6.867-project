target pakistan we will learn more in coming days about the circumstances of bhuttos death apparently a combined shooting and suicide bombing at a political rally in rawalpindi in which more than others were also murdered but theres little question the attack which had every hallmark of an al qaeda or taliban operation is an event with ramifications for the broader war on terror with the jihadists losing in iraq and having a hard time hitting the west their strategy seems to be to make vulnerable pakistan their principal target and its nuclear arsenal their principal prize in this effort murdering bhutto was an essential step hers is the highest profile scalp the jihadists can claim since their assassination of egypts anwar sadat in she also uniquely combined broad public support with an anti islamist pro western outlook and all the symbolism that came with being the most prominent female leader in the muslim world her death throws into disarray the complex and fragile efforts to re establish a functional legitimate government following next months parliamentary elections which seemed set to hand her a third term as prime minister this is exactly the kind of uncertainty in which jihadists would thrive no doubt too there are some in the pakistani military who will want to use bhuttos killing as an excuse to cancel the elections and reconsolidate their own diminished grip on power in the immediate wake of the assassination members of bhuttos pakistan peoples party have accused president pervez musharraf of being complicit in it but whatever mr musharrafs personal views of bhutto with whom he had an on again off again political relationship his own position has only been weakened by her death it would be weakened beyond repair if he sought to capitalize on it by preventing the democratic process from taking its course that goes even if the immediate beneficiary of bhuttos death is her one time archrival former prime minister nawaz sharif mr sharif an islamist politician with close ties to saudi arabia and a reputation for incompetence and corruption said yesterday he would boycott next months election even as he is seeking to assert himself as the man around whom all opponents of mr musharraf can rally we have no brief for mr sharif except to say that his claim to that position would be strengthened if the military indefinitely postpones or usurps the election beyond the elections mr musharraf needs to move aggressively to confront the jihadists and not the lawyers and civil rights activists he has been jailing in recent months hundreds of pakistanis have been murdered in recent months in terrorist acts perpetrated by fellow muslims and many of these perpetrators have in different ways and at different times been connected to the pakistani government itself as beneficiaries of the terrorist war pakistan has supported over the years in kashmir or as beneficiaries of the support pakistan gave to the taliban until or as beneficiaries of the ill conceived "truce" mr musharraf signed last year with taliban and al qaeda connected tribal chiefs in the waziristan province worst of all has been the look the other way approach successive pakistani governments have taken to the radical saudi funded madrassas throughout the country that will require a more radical reshaping of pakistans politics than mr musharraf has so far been able or willing to undertake but if bhuttos assassination has any silver lining it may be to show that there is no real alternative during her meeting with us last summer bhutto warned that while the jihadist movement would never have the popular support to win an election in its own right they had sufficient means at their disposal to "unleash against the population to rig an election to kill the army and therefore to make it possible to take over the state " today those words seem grimly prophetic and while she was in many ways a flawed figure her answer to that challenge a real fight against terrorism that would give jihadists no rest and a real democracy that would give them no fake grievance looks to be the only formula by which pakistan may yet be saved
