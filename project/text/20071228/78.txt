hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in the town of garhi khuda bakhsh in sindh the bhutto familys ancestral homeland where ms bhuttos remains were interred in the political dynastys massive white domed mausoleum such displays along with rioting that convulsed several cities throughout the country showed the anti government anger coursing through the population the violence appeared worst in the province of sindh the native home and political stronghold of the bhutto family mobs looted several banks in karachi the nations largest city many people stayed locked inside their homes troops were called out and curfew was imposed in several cities in the province after at least people were killed in a second day of violence train services were disrupted after rioters burnt down several trains across the country nationwide some bank branches were looted for its part the government said it was still considering friday whether to continue on with national elections as scheduled on jan and authorities said they would be consulting with pakistans main political parties to try to widen participation in the vote which is designed to install a new prime minister to share power with president gen pervez musharraf and to restore pakistan to democracy after mr musharraf led a bloodless coup in also today the government blamed ms bhuttos assassination on an al qaeda faction led by baitullah mehsud a pashtun tribal leader and said that ms bhutto had been killed by a skull fracture sustained during the attack not from bullet wounds as earlier reports indicated plenty of countries around the world suffer political assassinations and wrenching political transitions that threaten to turn them into basket cases but as a nuclear armed nation with a substantial islamist element and a largely lawless region that that borders a nation afghanistan where u s troops are currently deployed pakistan presents a compelling package of concerns for u s authorities on a number of fronts perhaps most worrying is the countrys history as an illegal proliferator of nuclear technology in a q khan who led a national research laboratory named after him was placed under house arrest for selling nuclear secrets and materials to north korea iran and libya making a personal fortune in the process in late acting on tips from u s intelligence pakistan detained two of its retired nuclear scientists who had met with members of al qaeda in afghanistan including osama bin laden pakistans position as a somewhat compromised ally in the fight against mr bin laden and other islamic extremists also presents a prickly set of problems ms bhuttos death doesnt help to solve today mr bin laden is believed to have holed up with other elements of al qaeda and the taliban in pakistans mountainous northwestern region where u s intelligence agencies believe the terrorist network has managed to rebuild some of its strength and in a larger sense pakistan stands both geographically and metaphorically between the divergent outcomes witnessed in recent decades by neighbors afghanistan and india as stephen cohen a brookings institution senior fellow focusing on south asia said after ms bhuttos death "i fear for pakistan its further decay will affect all of its neighbors europe and the united states in unpredictable and unpleasant ways " housing data slow stock rally stocks edged

bill because he dislikes a provision that would expose the iraqi government to expensive lawsuits seeking damages from the saddam hussein era in a statement bush said the legislation "would imperil
