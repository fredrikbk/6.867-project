weekend journal catalog critic the body fat skinny it took a test of five digital body composition scales to reveal that though our body fat percentage is fine and our "metabolic age" is youthful our level of trust in digital body composition scales is a bit off in the past two years scale manufacturers have introduced updated instruments that do more than track weight and calculate your percentage of body fat as did the highest tech models of just five years ago program these new versions with your age sex height and in some cases fitness level and theyll also tell you things like how fit you are how many calories you should consume and how much "visceral fat" youve got tucked around your internal organs but youll have to suspend some disbelief as with the earlier body fat scales these updated models send a mild painless electric current through ones legs and in the case of two we tested ones arms as well the scales calculate body makeup based on the way different tissues conduct electricity bioelectric impedance analysis as its called or bia is an accepted way to determine overall body fat says dympna gallagher ed d director of the body composition unit at the new york obesity research center at st lukes hospital in new york but dr gallagher is skeptical about the scales using bia to determine such things as metabolic rate the makers of these scales say they use mathematical equations based on scientific testing for our test we visited the st lukes center for a weigh in and a body fat assessment via a space age machine called a dps the center says its more accurate than bia which calculated our fat by making a three dimensional image of our body a basic rule of thumb is that womens body fat percentage should be under and mens body fat percentage should be under the hospital has no tests against which to compare the scales other claims though an mri could have measured our visceral fat then we came straight home and stepped on the scales our first surprise the model we bought from herrington simply didnt work flashing an error message no matter what we did the remaining scales all registered our weight as a pound lighter than the hospital did and none matched the hospitals body fat assessment the one from skymall had us two percentage points fatter the brookstone entry had us one percentage point fatter nitpicky manufacturers say their scales are accurate within a reasonable range but we suspect that for people obsessed enough to want this much information about their fat one pound and a couple of percentage points would matter a lot best overall goes to the scale we bought from frontgate with hand held as well as sole of the feet electrodes its body fat percentage reading was off by less than one point best value goes to the sharper images scale which underreported our fat by a point and a half but at least was pretty easy to program as for our physical activity score caloric recommendations and the
