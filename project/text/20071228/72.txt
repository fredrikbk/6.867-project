subprime conduct today we have the mortgage debacle and its sleazy backstory the teaser rates and other sales gimmicks lenders concocted and the sales commission they paid brokers to lure unsophisticated homebuyers into inappropriate and ultimately unaffordable properties it plays like a rerun of the telecom meltdown so too does the bad legislation that may emerge like sarbanes oxley exhibit a is barney franks mortgage reform and anti predatory lending act mandating how mortgage brokers are compensated creating a new layer of licensing requirements and enabling plaintiffs lawyers to troll for borrowers in whose names they can sue wall street for packaging mortgages in the secondary market my insight into the recent pendulum of corporate excess followed by political overreaction began with a letter to me from a federal prison inmate in in it the writer claimed "i helped mci cook its books i thought you might want to know " i did at the time mci was part of a stumbling but still iconic outfit called worldcom i visited the writer walter pavlo jr in federal prison in edgefield s c and began reporting a tale of how a once iconic corporation had become corrupt pavlo had been a young fast tracker in charge of collecting debts from the dial a porn and calling card touts mci had started letting on its network to goose revenues and sell itself saddled with a portfolio of clients who had run off with mcis money pavlo appealed to his bosses to write off their debts it was not to be mci was in play thousands of executives were looking to sell the company at the highest possible price and cash in their stock options pavlo helped mci hide bad debts and since everyone else was cheating he took a little on the side for himself ultimately he shunted off &# million to the cayman islands by the time i caught up with him he was getting the punishment he deserved months in prison not long afterward worldcom collapsed the press was filled with stories about how corporate america was rotten to the core lost in the political firestorm was the fact that only a handful of the publicly listed companies had actually been implicated in wrongdoing in washington rep michael oxley r ohio quipped that "summary executions of corporate executives would get about votes in the senate " sensing a shift in the political winds the former staunch ally of business did a quick about face and cosponsored the sarbanes oxley act of it passed the senate by the predictable effects tens of billions of dollars in added costs for american business aka the small investors and pension funds who own them loads of new work for accountants and lawyers a turn away from u s capital markets by foreigners and little if any effect on corporate crime the futility of sarbox style corporate crime fighting is apparent in recent survey results forty three percent of companies have had to deal over the past two years with serious economic crimes including accounting fraud asset misappropriation and bribery says pricewaterhousecoopers the incidence of such wrongdoing is actually up six percentage points since the year after sarbanes oxley if legislating good corporate conduct doesnt work what does enlightened self interest at goldman sachs the notion that its dumb to sacrifice the franchise for short term gain is summed up in the informal motto "long term greedy " elsewhere too many executives are wedded to the short term version a number of managers i have confronted about behavior that seems within the letter of the law but ethically suspect have replied "its industry practice" or "everyones doing it " such rationalizations help explain how executives live with themselves while foisting unaffordable mortgages on the ignorant booking bogus telecom bandwidth swaps and ripping off teachers and the elderly with unsuitable annuities its just the sort of stuff that convinces washington to step in and muck up the economy further corny as it sounds corporate leaders can clean up their acts and keep politicians and lawyers off our backs only by setting the right tone at the top then unlike enron which on paper had a model code of ethics they must actually live by it that means setting strict rules for personal conduct and punishing even top talent for breaking them something the pricewaterhousecoopers survey found lacking it means making sure performance pay rewards workers for doing the right things and not the wrong ones the remedy for corporate wrongdoing in other words is not in our laws but in ourselves mr weinberg is a senior editor at forbes and coauthor with walter pavlo jr of the recently published "stolen without a gun confessions from inside the largest accounting fraud in history the collapse of mci worldcom" etika books see related letter "letters to the editor more dealing with crimes" wsj jan
