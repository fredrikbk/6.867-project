the caucasus nation back on a path to western style democracy badri patarkatsishvili said yesterday he was pulling out of the jan vote because he needs first to clear his reputation amid claims he was plotting a coup this week georgian authorities released a videotape of mr patarkatsishvilis campaign manager apparently offering a senior georgian interior ministry official &# million to order his men not to intervene against mass street protests planned by the opposition to contest the election results after the vote the offer of &# million "is absolutely true " mr patarkatsishvili said in a

was trying to blackmail him with the threat of violence georgias president called the election in an effort to help restore the countrys battered democratic credentials after the government cracked down on opposition protesters last month using tear gas and rubber bullets the government also forced two opposition tv stations off the air including one part owned by mr patarkatsishvili who is reputed to be georgias wealthiest man western diplomats see restoring stability to georgia as vital in part because the country has become a key corridor for energy routes from the oil and gas fields of the caspian sea georgia led by u s educated president mikheil saakashvili was also seen until last month as a bright spot in the region for the development of western style democracy after the november crackdown mr saakashvili stepped down and called early elections to defuse public anger against him but the election campaign increasingly has focused on the day after the vote when opposition leaders say they may call people into the street to contest the result mr saakashvili leads in most opinion polls but appears unlikely to win the plus one vote needed to win outright and

it is now i expect a protest from the people " said david usupashvili leader of the opposition republican party which supports mr gachechiladze georgias government has invited hundreds of international observers to monitor next weeks vote in an effort to show the country remains committed to developing a western style democracy mr saakashvili himself came to power on the back of pro democracy street protests against a fraudulent election in but the euphoria surrounding that victory has dissipated as most georgians remain poor despite rapid changes to the economy that the
