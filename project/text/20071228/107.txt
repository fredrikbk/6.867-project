who needs soy lecithin s t lawder naturally cherokee iowa when mark schuett mentioned to his wife that estee lauder cos wanted to work with him to develop an ingredient for a new line of beauty products she took him to the nearest mall an hours drive away in sioux city to prove how important this potential new client was "id never heard of them before " says mr schuett "i thought it was spelled s t lawder " a year later mr schuett years old has no problems spelling the lauder name his company american natural soy inc a seed processor that makes ingredients for organic food has become a key supplier for estee lauders origins organics line of beauty products this small town in the farmlands of northwestern iowa ended up as a stop on the world wide beauty map thanks to the booming sales of organic personal care products which rose last year almost to &# million about eight times the rate of increase in overall sales of cosmetics and toiletries according to euromonitor international some of women say makeup with all natural ingredients is important to them according to a survey earlier this year by data company mintel international and young beauty consumers are especially enthusiastic about one third of teens surveyed said that all natural mineral based or ecologically friendly claims are important when selecting makeup products to use mintel reports while origins lines have claimed to be all natural competition from a flurry of competitors including loccitane en provence and loreals body shop in the increasingly crowded field of products boasting organic ingredients prompted estee lauder to seek the u s department of agricultures organic seal requiring at least of the products ingredients to be organic before estee lauder launched the nine product line this fall it spent three years on a global treasure hunt for ingredients that would allow it to qualify organic palm oil was found in brazil clove in indonesia coconut oil in the philippines olive oil in greece thyme in spain and lavender in bulgaria but origins organics was nearly a bust because a crucial ingredient for the planned moisturizers and lotions an organic emulsifier couldnt be found after repeatedly scouring organic industry trade shows newsletters and the internet origins researchers still couldnt find the organic emulsifier they needed "we were told it wasnt possible " says lynn mazzella vice president of global product development for origins an emulsifier serves as a chemical bridge that unites oil and water in products makers of organic foods such as peanut butter and chocolate can rely on an organic egg based emulsifier but that wasnt an option for the brand which had declared it wouldnt use animal products while not all the origins organics products need the emulsifier it was crucial for some of the most important ones such as body lotion and facial moisturizer "body and face lotions are our biggest sellers " about of origins sales says daria myers president of origins "but we learned organic lotions are very difficult to make " eventually after two years of looking an origins researcher last year spotted organic soy lecithin a type of emulsifier while scouring the ingredient lists of packaged organic foods in a grocery store armed with a new internet search term she eventually found mr schuetts plant in iowa usually soy lecithin which is derived from soybeans is extracted chemically but american natural soys plant in cherokee was extracting lecithin mechanically using a process that involved heat and pressure thereby qualifying for organic certification mr schuett working with another company that sells soy had spent four years perfecting the process of extracting lecithin from organic soybeans seeking to fulfill the need for emulsifiers in organic foods like chocolate and nutrition bars "we had a lot of sleepless nights trying to figure it out " says mr schuett the iowa farmer went into organic seed processing in hoping that a local plant would encourage more small family farms in the area to go into organic farming as they faced increasing competition from large scale corporate farming operations business is booming over the past two years his company has grown from eight people to and now operates around the clock early next year the company will complete an expansion project to double its capacity mr schuett deliberately keeps a low profile on his company for fear of overextending his facilities "were always maxed out in production " says mr schuett working with a beauty company was a new frontier for mr schuett and his partner clarkson soy products llc because the germ levels permitted in beauty products are stricter than those of food products given cosmetics long shelf life and vulnerability to contamination estee lauders technical requirements for the emulsifier were tougher than the two companies were used to curtis bennett vice president of clarkson says he told origins researchers they couldnt meet those standards "but they kept persisting and wouldnt take no for an answer " microbiologists from estee lauder traveled to cherokee to help messrs schuett and bennett fine tune their processes meanwhile researchers worked to maximize the antimicrobial elements of the products other ingredients including lavender red thyme clove patchouli and rose a blend that the company is in the midst of patenting origins also found an "airless pump" for its packaging to keep germ fostering air out of the product by june of this year messrs schuett and bennett finally had four drums of soy lecithin ready to ship to an origins production plant "that was a big moment " says mr schuett four months later origins organics hit store shelves in the u s and has launched in europe and asia over the past several weeks origins a high end line of products isnt sold in the rural northwest corner of iowa where mr schuett and his family live but his wife julie planning on driving about five hours north to minneapolis for some post holiday shopping hopes to find an origins store and purchase some of the products their plant made possible "i cant wait to see it " she says
