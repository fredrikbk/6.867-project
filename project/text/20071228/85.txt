weekend journal best of art a year of taste makers and trend setters really good shows keep you riveted while youre in the galleries and remain so vivid that they seem to have happened more recently than the dates in the catalog affirm its the opposite of the view expressed by the french philosopher henri bergson that time that is full of content is short while being lived through and long in recollection case in point when i began thinking about the exhibitions that captured my attention most intensely in the ones that delighted my eye informed me about things i didnt know or made me think freshly about things i thought i knew i was surprised to discover that the museum of modern arts brilliant informative "manet and the execution of maximilian " which reunited all of the painters widely dispersed revisitations of motif had opened in november of last year too bad because the show was a thrilling opportunity to follow the evolution of manets thinking it not only set the three major versions of the execution theme side by side but it also provided a context of related works by manet along with contemporary photographs magazine images articles and the like since the exhibition lasted through january perhaps technically im allowed to mention it theres no ambiguity about "cezanne to picasso ambroise vollard patron of the avant garde " which opened in january this gathering of works owned commissioned or sold by the legendary dealer brought to life a personage whose name is familiar to anyone interested in modernist art as in picassos "vollard suite" of etchings but who usually remains in the background of most accounts of the period at the met we were introduced to the pug nosed bearded subject of the show by the artists he represented cezanne renoir bonnard picasso dufy who all painted his portrait and in a film clip of the beefy vollard moving with surprising delicacy in the aged crippled renoirs studio the dealers role as patron was attested to by the wide ranging works he commissioned including lithographs and etchings most famously by bonnard and picasso lively ceramics by matisse and derain among others and perhaps most important books illustrated by "his" artists a series of "shows within the show" celebrated individual artists through their works that passed through vollards hands the section devoted to cezanne whom vollard his first dealer began to represent only in when the painter was and had about a decade to live amounted to a stellar mini retrospective the period under review and the artists included in the exhibition are obviously well studied and well known yet the show revealed unexpected connections and provided a window into the history of taste in the early days of modernism at the dallas museum of art began with "matisse painter as sculptor " a splendid traveling exhibition jointly organized by the dma the baltimore museum of art and the nasher sculpture center dallas the sharply focused survey which is now at the baltimore museum of art through feb underlined the complex dialogue between two and three dimensions at the core of matisses work by setting his sculptures among a tight selection of his closely related drawings and paintings it afforded enlightening comparisons by including key works by the sculptors who influenced him matisses evolution was clarified and his originality inventiveness and daring in three dimensions were emphasized that daring may have been in part a function of his having been largely self taught as a sculptor lack of formal training liberated matisse from conventional notions about say the transfer of weight and permitted him to rethink radically how figurative form might be developed in space the show notably enriched our understanding of this endlessly absorbing complicated artist back in new york the literally sumptuous "venice and the islamic world " offered an immensely pleasurable lesson in the salutary effects of cross cultural admiration rivalry exchange competition and cross fertilization those bracketing dates refer respectively to the year that venetian merchants carried the body of st mark back to their hometown from a coptic church in egypt at the miraculous request of the saint himself and to the fall of the venetian republic relations between la serenissima and the east over the centuries were documented by glass ceramics metalwork luxury textiles carpets arms and armor sculpture furniture and domestic objects paintings drawings manuscripts prints printed books book bindings maps scientific instruments and ive probably forgotten something intricate exchanges between cultures were dramatized by for example eye testing sequences of islamic glass venetian glass inspired by islamic glass and venetian glass made for muslims and more such as venetian paintings populated by exotically clad characters in settings furnished with close relatives of things wed been studying moments before not only did the show offer a feast for the eye but ill never again look at a giovanni bellini madonna without paying close attention to the damask behind her and the carpet draped over the parapet another high point of was "the unknown monet drawings and pastels" at the clark art institute in williamstown mass while its difficult to believe that anything remains unknown about a painter so beloved so prolific and so frequently exhibited the title of the clarks exhibition was perfectly accurate even though monet worked on paper throughout his long career filling sketchbooks with preparatory studies and making finished pastels very few of these works have been exhibited most are in far flung private collections and monet himself played down the importance of drawing in his work cultivating the myth that he worked at dizzying speed without preparation responding directly to the particulars of the motif and the ephemera of the moment at the clark the lie was given to this notion by rapidly scribbled drawings of rouen cathedral that show the artist searching for a resonant viewpoint and by economical notations of the lily pads and cloud reflections on the surface of the celebrated lily pond the pastels were dazzling as complete as paintings but often looser and as spontaneous as the impressionist myth would have us believe they made us feel we were watching over monets shoulder as he rushed to capture changing effects of light one series despite important differences between individual works seemed to have been done within a short span from the same spot as a storm passed summer visitors to the clark expecting yet another crowd pleasing impressionist show would not have been disappointed by the variety and richness of the works on view they would have learned a lot about monet too the year ends with a bang at moma thanks to the pairing of the stunning intimate "georges seurat the drawings" and a well chosen impeccably installed martin puryear retrospective seurats intensely physical urgently worked conte crayon drawings are testimony to how nuanced expanses of darkness can evoke a universe of light the year old sculptors insistently present yet delicate forms make us think hard about mass volume and allusion and momas problematic atrium has never looked as good as it does populated by mr puryears fragile strangely elusive but authoritative constructions ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " at the denver art museum through feb
