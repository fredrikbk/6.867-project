weekend journal travel hotels go to the dogs allergic animal averse struggle to find truly pet free rooms people who dont like pets like them even less at &# a night in a bid to attract pet owners hotels have been welcoming pets in greater numbers in recent years nearly half of u s hotels accept pets according to the american hotel and lodging associations annual survey up from about years ago many now offer elaborate pet friendly perks from "canine cocktail hours" at the hotel indigo chain to "rover relaxation massages" at peninsula hotels but the rising acceptance of pets in hotels is pitting the of u s households that own pets against the estimated of the u s population that tests positive to cat or dog allergens as the popularity of pet programs has grown many hotels have stopped keeping track of which rooms pets have been in now guests with allergies asthma and pet aversions are finding themselves in beds where animals have slept the night before or on elevators with dogs that they fear will slobber or shed on their clothes one big issue is lack of consistent information on what rooms allow pets or where pets have stayed cleaning procedures for rooms that have had pets in them also vary widely among hotels as a result some travelers with high sensitivity to pets are becoming amateur detectives trying to keep track of hotels animal policies and sniff out rooms where pets may have been ahead of time janice lichter a retired research analyst in mequon wis who is extremely allergic to cats used to go regularly to the boca raton bridge hotel in boca raton fla last june she learned that the hotel was under new management and now pet friendly "i was like uh oh " says ms lichter the hotel says it allows pets only on the second floor but when ms lichter called to confirm she says the reservation agent assuming she was a pet owner told her "oh no you can have any room you want " ms lichter immediately canceled the reservation hotel spokeswoman melissa payson says the agent was mistaken reliable information can be hard for guests to pin down a reservation agent for the park hyatt washington said last month that there were "definitely" pet free rooms available but a hotel spokeswoman says this is incorrect pets are allowed in every room agents for the ritz carlton on central park in manhattan say they can request pet free rooms for guests but the front desk says they have no record of where pets have stayed in march yvonne sherrer a rheumatologist in fort lauderdale fla sent a letter to the head of the disability rights division at the department of justice expressing her particular concern for young children with asthma "in most cases parents are not even aware that there has been animal dander exposure because hotels do not generally make it known when they allow animals in any room " wrote dr sherrer a spokesman for the justice department says the letter is under review dr sherrer who had a severe allergic reaction herself three years ago at a newly pet friendly sheraton near stanford university in palo alto calif has been asking hotels about their pet policies ever since and says she has found it surprisingly hard to find dander free accommodations a spokeswoman for starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc which owns sheraton says "weve received a tremendous amount of positive feedback from our guests about our pets are welcome or paw program " dr sherrer was disappointed to find out that the four seasons resort in jackson hole wyo where shed been hoping to stay recently allows pets in every room "we do accept pets but theyre not allowed to run wild around the resort " says a spokeswoman for the hotel last year she skipped a medical conference in new york at a marriott for the same reason the marriott offered to help her locate a pet free room nearby some groups such as the asthma and allergy foundation of america argue that hotels are obligated by law to keep at least a few rooms animal free under title iii of the americans with disabilities act anyone who owns or operates a place of public accommodation such as a hotel or restaurant cannot discriminate against individuals on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the place mike tringale director of external affairs for the asthma and allergy foundation says this implies that every facility should offer allergen free rooms for guests with allergies just as they must offer ramps and large elevators for guests in wheelchairs gary phelan a disability lawyer with the firm outten &amp golden llp says theres no law requiring hotels to offer pet free rooms but that people with severe asthma and allergies have qualified as disabled under the act on rare occasions the americans with disabilities act defines a disability as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual " and breathing is considered a major life activity says mr phelan american hotel and lodging association president joe mcinerney says there are too many different types of allergies for hotels to accommodate everyones specific needs some million americans suffer from allergies according to the asthma and allergy foundation and the second most common after pollen is to animal dander tiny flakes of skin hair and dried saliva that float in the air and cannot be removed from a room by steam cleaning the carpets or hand washing the walls for severe allergy sufferers reactions to dander can require hospitalization and can be life threatening without proper medications allergists say pets have been welcome in some hotels for decades the four seasons for example says it has always allowed guests to bring animals provided the pets weigh less than pounds but other big chains have only recently begun to follow suit starwood decided to make all of its sheraton westin and w hotels in the u s and canada pet friendly in after a company commissioned study of dog owners found that of respondents said they would be more loyal to a hotel chain that accepted dogs even when they werent traveling with their pet pettravel com an online travel guide for pet owners has added almost pet friendly hotels this year the list now comprises hotels world wide president jerry hatfield who started the list years ago with about properties says a big reason hotel managers ask to be listed on the site is that guests traveling with pets tend to stay longer because theyre not anxious to get back to the kennel hotels have other reasons to cater to pet owners as well pet owners have a higher average income &# according to the national pet owners survey than non pet owners who have an average income of &# a year americans spend &# billion a year on their pets double the amount they spent years ago with nearly &# billion going to services like grooming and boarding though its impossible to eliminate pet dander a thorough cleaning can get rid of some of it post pet cleaning procedures vary widely from hotel to hotel the ritz carlton which accepts pets at some of its domestic properties typically charges pet owners a &# fee depending on the property to cover the deep cleaning which takes twice the length of a normal cleaning and includes shampooing the carpets and disinfecting the walls the park hyatt washington which doesnt have designated pet rooms and offers dog beds toys treats and stainless steel dog bowls says it dry cleans bedding in rooms after pets have stayed replaces air conditioning filters and steam cleans the carpets the peninsula doesnt have a special cleaning routine for rooms that have housed pets cleaning is commensurate with the condition of the room a spokeswoman says the four seasons in beverly hills calif says its housekeeping staff steam cleans the carpets after pets instead of vacuuming and airs out the rooms longer than normal but that air out time depends on how soon the room is needed for the next guest starwood which adds &# to the nightly rate for pets and levies a &# cleaning fee airs out rooms for hours after pets depart and purifies the air with ozone yet no amount of cleaning can erase the image of animals from some picky travelers minds raquel skinner has no allergies but the year old chemical buyer in grand blanc mich avoids staying at pet friendly hotels when she can she says she simply doesnt "care for animals running around salivating where i will be sleeping " most hotel guests have slept at pet welcoming properties without knowing it third party bookers and travel agents are often paid commission for each hotel room they book so its in their interest to assure callers they can have pet free rooms on pet free floors says mr mcinerney president of the american hotel and lodging association even if the hotels front desk doesnt record which rooms have housed pets hotel employed reservationists are paid a flat salary and are often judged by their supervisors on how many calls they "convert" to reservations he says though their "job is to sell you something that meets your expectations " dale mcgill a year old real estate agent and mother of two in morgantown w va says she called ahead to ask about the pet policy at a crowne plaza hotel in williamsburg va and was told that pets are allowed only on the first floor but when she got to her room on the third floor a few weeks later she saw two terriers running around the hallway and heard other dogs barking behind guest room doors "my lungs just shut down i couldnt breathe when i woke up " says ms mcgill the front desk referred her to parent company intercontinentals customer service center which offered to relocate her to a holiday inn express nearby crowne plaza spokeswoman natasha gullett says there are designated "pet friendly" rooms on the first floor at the crowne plaza williamsburg but if all of the rooms on the first floor are occupied then the hotel will make arrangements for guests with pets to be placed on another floor there are some holdouts of the pet friendly hotel movement more than half of the ritz carltons properties still do not take animals only about of full service hyatt properties in north america are pet friendly some hotels including the mandarin oriental in miami and the peninsula in beverly hills have introduced blocks of allergy free rooms which are maintained by an outside companies like pure solutions and environmental technology solutions nylo hotels a new brand that opened its first hotel in plano texas this month will offer at least one floor of allergy friendly rooms at each location some guests are more concerned about pets in public spaces than in the rooms don mazzella a year old owner of an information and consulting company in ridgefield n j who travels frequently on business says his pet peeve is a dog owner who "thinks its cute to bring a small dog wrapped in a coat into the hotel dining room " most recently he says he saw this at the marriott wardman park in washington during a conference last december the hotel is pet friendly but says it doesnt allow pets in the dining area "it is the smaller dogs that seem to be pampered pets of people who have no concern for others " mr mazzella says
