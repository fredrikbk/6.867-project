ahead of the tape elections dont mean vote for stocks you heard it here first the stock market will go up next year how do we know because is a presidential election year skeptical you should be the presidential election indicator is another in a long line of dubious market predictors that have worked in the past only when they didnt with the election fever setting in this one will be tossed about more than the iowa poll numbers since stocks have risen in the last seven months of the year in of presidential election years according to the stock traders almanac during when george bush defeated democratic candidate john kerry the dow jones industrial average rose nearly the idea is that incumbents want voters to be in a good mood when they go to the polls so they do all they can to juice the economy with tax cuts and higher spending there are plenty of reasons that the cycle may not pan out next year miller tabak strategist phil roth says the first half of the cycle hasnt gone according to pattern stocks typically fare poorly in the first one or two years of a presidents term since thats when presidents often push through painful economic measures such as tax increases but the bush administration didnt raise taxes and stocks rose for three straight years potentially upsetting the cycle the bigger reason that investors shouldnt give much credence to indicators such as the presidential cycle right now is that the economy is venturing into uncharted waters this week the s&amp p case shiller home price index showed that home prices in major cities fell in october a record decline the financial industry is struggling through one of its most painful periods in memory wading through billions in losses on subprime assets what the broader impact on the economy of all of this will be is a mystery investors should also keep in mind the one time in the last half century the presidential cycle didnt work when the dot com stock bubble imploded no amount of fiscal stimulus could stave off that bear market it remains to be seen if washingtons pump priming machine will work this time around new home sales data may contain a bit of hope the commerce department will report new home sales today and wall street is looking for surprise more bad news but in the report may be some glimmers of hope economists polled by dow jones newswires estimate that an annualized new homes were sold in november down from in october that would make it the weakest month in more than years and put sales nearly below their peak be forewarned that this report is extremely volatile and subject to big revisions it could be much better than estimates or as has been the case lately much worse but while new home sales have been in retreat so have the number of new homes on the market there were new homes for sale in october below the high of deep cuts in construction spending suggest that number will continue to fall so do falling prices there still are far more new homes on the market than there should be especially with so many previously owned houses on the block but seeing the inventory of new homes for sale decline is at least a start justin lahart email scott patterson wsj com and justin lahart wsj com
