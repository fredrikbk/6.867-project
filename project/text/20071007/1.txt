getting going small loss okay large one no way to make good money youve got to risk losing money the trick never lose too much as this summers market swoon reminded investors the stock and bond markets are treacherous places yet you have to find some way of coping with the dangers involved the reality is if youre going to retire in comfort you cant afford to spend your investment life cowering in savings accounts and certificates of deposit instead you need the rewards of stock and bond market investing without getting derailed by the risks make no mistake quick and hits are a fact of life for stock market investors the key is to make sure your losses arent much larger than that or it could take years to recover to drive home this point with clients investment adviser charles farrell uses a chart that shows how long it takes to bounce back from investment losses depending on how large those losses are and what sort of return the clients subsequently earn suppose you lose and then clock a year thereafter result it would take years to recoup your losses that may sound grim but it could be a whole lot worse for instance if you suffer a drubbing you would need years or almost twice as long to get back to even meanwhile a thrashing would set you back nine years or more than three times as long as a hit "a decline is a bummer " says mr farrell who is with denvers northstar investment advisors "but it gets substantially worse as the declines get bigger " at issue is the daunting math of investment losses lose and all you require is an gain to recoup your losses lose and you need a bounce back down now you have to earn to get back to even as you strive to recoup your losses you will get help not only from the financial markets but also from the money youre socking away on that score younger investors with small portfolios have a big advantage "lets say youre saving &# a year in your k and you already have &# in there " mr farrell says "if you lose a third you can make that back with the next years contribution but if you have a &# million portfolio and you lose a third it can take years to get back to where you were " moreover as your portfolio grows dollar losses from even a routine market decline can be staggering if you lose thats a &# hit on a &# portfolio but a &# chunk out of a &# million nest egg lets be honest most of us would be a little rattled by a &# loss indeed theres a serious risk we would panic and sell locking in our losses and losing all chance to profit from the subsequent market recovery got a hefty nest egg because your dollar losses can be so horrifying and because your regular savings will be a pittance compared with your portfolios size consider cutting risk by keeping a healthy sum in bonds suppose you have half your nest egg in stocks and half in bonds "if youre and the stock market falls you might be down " mr farrell notes "in fact with the interest you get from your bonds you might be down just or for the year im a big advocate especially in the later years of being more balanced " as you aim to limit losses dont just focus on your stock bond mix also make sure you are well diversified within these two categories to that end here are four pointers dont stash more than of your stock market money in any one stock thats especially true if it is your employers stock after all you already depend on your employer for a paycheck and health benefits if you also bet a big hunk of your retirement savings on the company things could be bleak if the firm gets into financial trouble even major stock markets can suffer long dry spells think about the japanese market which fell over the years through april or the nasdaq composite index which is still at just half its march bull market peak to protect against those sorts of losses build a portfolio thats spread across multiple markets consider buying oddball investments like real estate investment trusts gold stocks commodities and natural resources shares because they sometimes post big gains when everything else is suffering this sort of trend bucking performance isnt guaranteed just look at this years weak reit performance in addition these are volatile sectors so keep your bets small putting no more than of your portfolio in each bonds are a great buffer against stock market declines but unfortunately they can get decimated by rapid inflation what to do buy both conventional high quality bonds and also inflation indexed treasury bonds conventional bonds fare well when the economy is weak and inflation is slowing while inflation indexed bonds offer protection against accelerating inflation with both in your portfolio you should be in decent shape no matter what happens a separate "getting going" appears each wednesday in the wall street journal email jonathan clements wsj com
