real time seeking truly mobile music new efforts try to make it easy to buy and share music wirelessly online edition last week starbucks began testing a new service letting those with itunes on their laptop or carrying an iphone identify and download songs playing in the ubiquitous coffee bars in recent weeks weve heard apple tout its new itunes wi fi music store weve seen microsoft show off improvements to its zune music player talk up the players ability to share music and unveil zune social a new community site cellular service providers such as sprint nextel verizon wireless a verizon vodafone joint venture and at&amp t continue to sell songs over the air and experiment with various music related offerings and what about services that recommend and stream music from pandora to rhapsody theres a flurry of activity around a common theme making digital music truly mobile instead of contained in music players that get topped up at desktop pcs but what will be the effect of this newfound musical mobility could it mark a substantive change in the digital music experience or will wireless buying and sharing remain mere offshoots of the familiar pc mp player ecosystem currently both buying and sharing are largely restricted to the pc music players with wireless capabilities such as sandisks sansa connect are fairly new meanwhile the cellular service providers efforts have largely been stillborn because until fairly recently they wanted to charge as much as &# for a download despite the fact that itunes had made &# a de facto standard why the high prices a number of reasons from the record industrys desperation for an alternative to the itunes model to infrastructure costs that cut into already razor thin margins on downloads wireless carriers were stuck with a bad choice between a low margin business or a low volume one the carriers have accepted cent downloads and tried to escape the low margin trap by expanding their musical offerings to include access to streaming music ringtones and ringbacks music videos the ability to "sideload" digital music from pcs to phones and even services that "listen" to snippets of music and identify the song "our strategy is to make mobile music as easy to use and as inexpensive as possible " says aaron radelet a sprint spokesman "were trying to build up a set of services that have value to consumers while mobile " says rob hyatt executive director of premium content for at&amp t mobility a hopeful sign the carriers seem to understand that cellphones are no threat to displace the pc as the hub of the digital music experience "i still think the pc is the place where consumers want to have their digital library and its certainly where they want to store and manage that library " says forrester research analyst charles golvin who ticks off a list of advantages pcs have over mobile devices their user interfaces are more convenient theyre harder to lose and theyre easier to back up mr hyatt indicates at&amp t has acknowledged that and warns against measuring the wireless carriers success solely by over the air downloads "i dont think that will be the primary music acquisition means " he says before suggesting that if pc downloads are the grocery store over the air downloads could be the eleven a place to go for a track or two the ipod touch and iphone have an advantage in that many of their users will already be familiar with the itunes experience but its hard to imagine that even the most dedicated road warrior will buy the bulk of his music collection that way or that apple imagines he would "these things make sense to me for impulse buys " mr golvin says "you hear something think you love it buy it and might even pay a little premium because you dont want the hassle of writing it down it adds that convenience for the occasional impulse buy but i dont think those transactions will ever amount to a big share of the overall picture " perhaps sharing could be different mr hyatt notes that a cellphone can hold a music collection and a list of the people you call most "theres an opportunity to share right there " he says adding that the challenge is "how to get these individual parts connected up together " but sharing is tricky stuff music is at once highly social and intensely private on the one hand we wear band t shirts at least for a while join together with other like minded fans for shows and proudly display our music collections in bookshelves or at least we used to on the other hand as commuters cars or headphones mark the boundaries of our private musical worlds one of the joys of digital music is its anonymity on itunes you dont have to suffer an indie clerks scorn for buying the pussycat dolls for a music fan its anxious business making a playlist for a party or a mixtape to use an out of date analog term for a friend youre making the private public with unknowable results perhaps things are different in high schools but i find it hard to believe that many people will share songs between wi fi enabled digital audio players particularly if it takes two of the same kind of player to share good luck finding another zune to share with the concept strikes me as dippily utopian like the urban legends of early ipod users gesturing with headphone jacks to sample each others music and barring a sea change in attitudes the record labels will always put shackles on sharing for example tracks shared by zunes now no longer disappear after three days but theyre still only good for three plays and can only be passed once "the purpose behind wireless music downloading is to finally go beyond music playback where the ipod and most mp players are stuck today and address music discovery " says forresters james mcquivey "because sometimes you want to tell your device what you want to hear and sometimes you want your device to tell you what you should hear " but how to do that even if zune style sharing proves popular among kids its hamstrung and its no fun to be stuck with brief samples of friends songs or have them expire but bringing the internet to devices that can play digital music can be about much more than enabling over the air purchases it can let those devices tap into recommendation engines and streaming music subscription services a mutable category that includes the likes of last fm ilike mog rhapsody napster and pandora the subscription services seem like the stuff of digital music dreams the celestial jukeboxes of a decade agos imaginings but theyve been slow to get traction as many consumers stubbornly insist on owning their music even if the only difference is the bits are stored on their own hard drive instead of on one far away but perhaps such services could thrive as an on the go alternative youll flip over to your contacts list but instead of calling your friend youll check out his latest playlist tapping into a subscription service to do so like a song from that playlist youll bookmark it to download via your pc later or pay a slight premium to download it over the air ensuring youll have it even if wi fi isnt available boosted by sharing subscription services will find their niche and the idea of not having millions of albums available on your mp player will seem as amazing as the idea that people ever headed to work with just a single album for company how would being able to buy music wirelessly change your digital music experience would you like to share music with friends and others how should music sharing work in a world of net
