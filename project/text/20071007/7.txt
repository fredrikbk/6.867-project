pendulum swings back to growth funds during a summer rife with uncertainty the stock and bond mutual funds that performed best were generally those that could assuage investors concerns about unsettled debt markets the falling dollar and a slowing u s economy funds holding super safe government bonds and stocks of big companies with strong growth prospects were the stars of the quarter ended sept along with funds holding foreign stocks and stocks of companies that dont need to do a lot of borrowing financial stocks meanwhile along with high yield bonds and bank loan portfolios took a beating some of the recent trends like the surge in "growth" stocks and the weakness in financials are expected to continue into market watchers say to be sure wall streets appetite for risk didnt diminish altogether funds that invest in risky emerging market stocks stumbled but still clocked double digit returns but investors were less inclined to bet on a robust american economy consider the fate of so called value stocks which look cheap based on fundamentals like price earnings ratios many value companies have slower earnings growth or are out of favor making it difficult to get a vote of confidence when investors are concerned about the economy these stocks especially the small ones were pummeled during the third quarter as investors favored companies with the potential to deliver strong returns even if the economy languishes thats a sharp turnaround from previous quarters when value handily outperformed growth "its an inevitable cycle turn " says howard sontag founder and principal of sontag advisory in new york mr sontag expects growth will shine for several quarters more particularly since value stocks are coming off an unusually long run after a multiyear run up in value stocks "we started hearing from small cap value managers that theyre having a difficult time if not an impossible time finding stocks to buy " says steven roge a portfolio manager at wealth advisory firm r w roge &amp co in bohemia n y the prices of large growth stocks on the other hand have been relatively flat for the past few years despite strong financial results making these stocks much more attractive large growth funds were one of the weakest u s stock categories over the past five years according to researcher morningstar but profit at market giants like cisco systems and general electric are up strongly and stock prices recently rallied big multinational firms tend to do relatively well during an economic downturn since they can hedge any losses in the u s with international sales and big companies tend to have easier access to capital making them more attractive than their smaller brethren when lending tightens as it has lately says steven merkel vice president of portfolio management at financial advisory consultants in naples fla the global credit crunch sparked by troubles in the subprime mortgage market has dragged down financial stocks among specialty funds those that focus on financials did the worst in the third quarter falling according to morningstar "the downward trend in financials is going to continue " mr merkel says he thinks banks and other lenders will continue to suffer through weakness in the housing market through on the flip side technology stocks are largely immune to the worlds credit problems thanks to cash rich balance sheets tech stock funds surged in the third quarter gaining tech stocks "have been a haven this year " says morningstar stock strategist toan tran "youre going to see a lot of money continue to flow into technology " international stock funds have long been a refuge for skittish american investors and market watchers expect foreign stocks will continue to turn in strong results the outlook for the global economy remains healthy and weakness in the dollar should continue to benefit foreign stock funds since returns are amplified when converted back to dollars the dollar hit a record low against the euro and traded low against the british pound this summer still advisers and fund managers say investors should probably temper their expectations going forward foreign large growth funds for instance returned a solid in the third quarter according to morningstar but they didnt eclipse u s large growth funds thats a reversal from the first and second quarters in bonds as with stocks much of the movement in the third quarter was defined by what investors feared in this case inflation and defaults funds holding long term government bonds were the strongest bond category returning better than most stock funds inflation protected bond funds were another strong performer returning thats a stark change from last quarters negative return inflation worries surged for many bond traders after the federal reserve cut interest rates half a percentage point to in september funds holding below investment grade high yield bonds meanwhile were down as investors demanded higher yields for the risk and prices fell in the bond world rising yields equal lower prices bank loan funds also rattled by credit woes were down one of the worst performing bond categories both bank loan and high yield funds show signs that theyre on the mend returns were relatively strong in september and the funds stopped hemorrhaging money from investor withdrawals high yield bond funds have had the stronger recovery bond fund giant pimco recently said it still sees opportunities in high yield bonds but expects defaults to rise slightly
