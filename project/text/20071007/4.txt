love &amp money readers the burden of being an executor readers responded in huge numbers to a recent column i wrote about making sure im prepared to handle my grandmothers affairs after she dies many readers sounded a similar theme i better be ready because its probably a lot more work and responsibility than i could have imagined patricia marek in woodland hills calif says an uncle asked her and her older sister to serve as his so called personal representatives when he died they agreed when the time arrived in the fall of they combed through his filing cabinets safe deposit box and other personal items to determine assets and liabilities ms marek headed off to florida to deal with the remnants of his life there "the amount of time i spent addressing each detail consumed days nights and weekends for months " ms marek says "poring over irs documents to make sure i submitted all the required forms became like a second job it was a labor of love but its still not over yet while the court closed the probate and discharged us of our duties in january the irs will not release us as fiduciaries of the estate until september " ms marek says that as she performed all the various duties "my thoughts centered on never again making the promise to handle anyones last will and testament " unfortunately she had already promised to do the same for her mother long before her uncle died and her mothers estate she says "will be complicated " so ms marek is applying some of the lessons she has learned and her mother having seen all that her daughter went through "opened up and now actively involves me in her financial planning " ms marek says one example her uncle owned old bonds in his safe deposit box that had become unclaimed property back in michigan and it took ms marek six months to work through that bureaucracy now her mom has at least added her daughters name to the checking account "so i can pay bills prior to receiving authority from the court " looking at whats ahead ms marek says "some days i hope ill pass before she does " after serving as co executor of her fathers estate lynne elander in kirkland wash offers these tips know the location of important physical assets that includes knowing where the keys are to any safe deposit boxes and the combinations of any safes in the house also "know the secret hiding place for any special pieces of jewelry" or other heirloom items ms elander says "you dont want to throw out an old can of peas only to realize it had moms special pearl earrings " know if a safe deposit box exists the one ms elander had known about for years and for which she was an authorized signatory was closed without her knowing she had to spend time calling around to various financial institutions her parents dealt with to determine whether a box still existed be prepared to front the estate some money "it took some time to get cash out of my dads account and into an estate account but in the meantime there were bills due including a &# property tax bill that would have incurred late fees and other penalties " ms elander says she put up the money and had the estate reimburse her have multiple copies of death certificates for both parents while financial institutions will want to see these for obvious reasons ms elander says "the biggest surprise was the magazine companies each required an original certified copy to eliminate the payment obligation " household goods are worth less than you think nobody wants any of it ms elander says unless theyre good antiques "we hired a professional estate sale manager and he took off the top of all sales " she says "but the biggest benefit was he also donated the stuff he couldnt sell and we didnt have to worry about trucking it to goodwill " in contrast to ms elanders last piece of advice susan newman in tucson ariz says the biggest mistake she made when settling her moms estate was "selling my moms furniture through one of those estate sale places "at the time i felt compelled to dispose of her furniture and appliances " she says "now i wish id kept more of it in storage and taken the luxury of thinking more carefully about what i might have wanted to keep or what someone else might want we got an insultingly small figure from the sale "it still bothers me that my mothers prized possessions were sold for pennies to people i dont know " note in my original column i mentioned that a financial planner had given me an essential document locator that i gave to my grandmother so that she could list where all her important papers assets and other things are located countless readers asked for a copy of it you can find it online at wsj com loveandmoney jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
