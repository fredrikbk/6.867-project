weekend journal bookmarks last rituals by yrsa sigurdardottir morrow pages &# the mystery novels spiritual home may still be the english countryside its victims scattered between the paddock and the rectory but corpses have a way of refusing to stay put these days mystery writers have established thriving franchises in botswana and thailand italy and japan the genres expansion has been not only geographic but graphic readers have come to expect more and more inventive violence with ever greater explicitness about each grisly doing in yrsa sigurdardottirs "last rituals" embodies both trends her chilly tale unfolds in her native iceland and its victim harald guntlieb a visiting german graduate student suffers a ghastly fate he is found dead one morning in a university building with a rune like symbol carved in his chest and his eyes plucked out he also has a forked tongue but not from any murderers rage while alive harald went in for self mutilation iceland i confess may be my favorite country i try to get there at least once a year i naturally took pleasure as ms sirgurdardottirs heroine a young lawyer and single mother named thora negotiated her way around reykjavik interviewing haralds young and druggy friends "last rituals" captures both the citys freneticism everybody seems to be working at least two jobs and its leisureliness parties once begun never seem to end i once taught english at the very university where poor haralds body was discovered although the most violent action i ever witnessed on campus was someone kicking angrily at a heap of plowed snow that blocked his cars exit from a parking lot which brings us to the oxymoronic nature of ms sigurdardottirs quest an icelandic murder mystery icelanders it turns out are remarkably inefficient when it comes to killing each other off their murder rate is among the lowest in the world even so "last rituals" shows the confident pacing of a tale set in a far bloodier place chapter by chapter the book passes what might be called the velocity test it moves with sufficient speed to hold even the most jaded readers attention and theres something satisfyingly true to iceland a literary land that often claims to publish more books per capita than any other country in the world when ms sigurdardottirs mystery ultimately turns on a battle over rare medieval manuscripts most of the novels problems arise sentence by sentence maybe it reads better in the original icelandic but its english is tic ridden and ungainly "how thora gaped in astonishment " and "how convenient exclaimed matthew taken aback " and "something else laura asked amazed " and "no big deal echoed thora perplexed " admittedly few of us pick up mysteries for their prose any more than we go to tokyo for tranquility or for that matter reykjavik for pastry we pick them up in order to ask what next "last rituals" keeps the reader asking brad leithauser
