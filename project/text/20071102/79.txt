politics &amp economics doubts snag mukasey bid bush defends attorney general nominee amid torture controversy washington president bushs pick to head the justice department veered off the path to a smooth confirmation around a m on oct it was the second and final day of senate hearings on michael b mukaseys nomination for attorney general and the former chief federal judge from new yorks southern district appeared uncomfortable as sen russell feingold a wisconsin democrat tried to pin him down on the scope of presidential power specifically whether the constitution allows the president to disregard certain laws the questions put mr mukasey in the middle of divisive debates about torture warrantless wiretapping the fight against terrorism and the ill fated tenure of the man he was nominated to succeed alberto gonzales his equivocal answers have been seized upon by some senate democrats turning doubts about mr mukaseys legal views into a force that threatens to derail his confirmation "the fundamental issue is very simple where does judge mukasey stand on a certain highly controversial expansive view of executive power that has been taken by lawyers representing the present administration " says jed rubenfeld yale university law professor and former assistant u s attorney in new york who counts himself a longtime admirer of mr mukasey mr mukasey would likely still win a majority vote in the senate but his chances of winning endorsement from the senate judiciary committee are shaky enough that president bush yesterday went on the attack against democrats for forcing his nominee to answer questions about torture before he takes the helm white house aides fanned out to shore up support among wobbly republicans "its wrong for congressional leaders to make judge mukaseys confirmation dependent on his willingness to go on the record about details of a classified program he has not been briefed on " the president said in a speech to win confirmation mr mukasey needs a simple majority on the member judiciary committee four democrats have said they oppose him democratic sen charles schumer of new york who led the effort to oust mr gonzales and suggested mr mukaseys nomination to mr bush hasnt said whether he plans to back mr mukasey a committee vote is scheduled for tuesday unlike other controversial bush picks john bolton for united nations ambassador or mr gonzaless nomination for attorney general mr mukasey a longtime judge carries no political baggage and didnt generate the type of letter writing and lobbying campaign by liberal and civil liberties groups that could have hurt his confirmation the first day of his confirmation hearings was full of good cheer that mood changed early on the second day and mr mukasey detected the shift "youve suggested that ive gone overnight from being an agnostic to being a heretic " he said less than three hours later under pressure to say that an interrogation technique that simulates drowning known as waterboarding constitutes torture mr mukasey responded "if it amounts to torture it is not constitutional " at the end of the mukasey hearings sen patrick leahy of vermont chairman of the judiciary committee expressed discomfort with some of the judges answers but ended on an upbeat note "you know the question in this hearing is not whether youd be confirmed the real test is going to be what kind of an attorney general youd be " a week later however as democratic aides studied mr mukaseys answers they decided to ask follow up written questions that delved deeper particularly on the themes of presidential power and torture as mr mukasey became ensnared in the debate over surveillance and privacy and over legal protections of terror detainees his problems grew two liberal senators in particular richard durbin of illinois and sheldon whitehouse of rhode island stoked the fire in opposing mr mukasey they asked whether u s interrogation tactics are harming the nations moral status some republicans also expressed their misgivings "anyone who says they dont know if waterboarding is torture or not has no experience in the conduct of warfare and national security " sen john mccain who was tortured while a prisoner of war in vietnam said during a television interview over the weekend mr mccain and other wavering republicans have now expressed support for the nominee "once you are confirmed and fully briefed on the relevant programs and legal analyses we urge you to publicly make clear that waterboarding can never be employed " said the letter signed by sens mccain john warner of virginia and lindsay graham of south carolina human rights first said yesterday that it and other groups would send a joint letter opposing mr mukasey the groundswell seems limited to the halls of the capitol "theres no "no on mukasey" coalition as there was on gonzales " said chris anders legislative counsel for the american civil liberties union "on gonzales we had a big lobbying campaign " on mr mukasey the aclu is trying to draft a letter urging senators to ask for more assurances on the torture question
