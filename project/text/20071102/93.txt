tensions and hopefully keep any turkish military actions from sparking broad based fighting in northern iraq ms rice wasnt only in turkey to talk about the current crisis with the kurds a conference on iraqi stability also convenes in istanbul late friday and saturday underscoring how prominently turkey plays into any equation on iraq but the core issue today stems from rising violence led by the rebel kurdistan workers party or pkk government and media have said attacks against turkish positions by the pkk which wants greater autonomy for kurds living in turkey has left dead including soldiers and the turkish public has expressed a mixture of frustration and fury over what they say is a failure by either iraqi powers or the u s to crack down on the pkk which operates bases on the other side of the border in kurdish controlled northern iraq today ms rice met with both turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan and her turkish counterpart foreign minister ali babacan and at a news conference held after the meeting ms rice said the u s is "committed to redoubling its efforts" to help turkey in its struggle against the rebel fighters "we consider this a common threat not just to the interests of turkey but to the interests of the united states as well " she said "this is going to take persistence and its going to take commitment this is a very difficult problem " for his part mr babacan continued to push for more concrete action saying "we are at the point where words have been exhausted and where there is need for action " experts say the u s is in a tough position vis a vis turkey long cold war allies relations between the two nations have soured since the u s invasion of iraq which turkey opposed "i think we have very little in the toolkit right now with the turks " said steven cook the douglas dillon fellow at the council on foreign relations who studies turkey and the middle east mr cook says thats what has really been restraining the turks from taking military action against pkk fighters in northern iraq are concerns against getting bogged down in fighting there as such the best option for the u s might be to try to shape the turkish response in the hopes that fighting would be as limited and targeted as possible in order to cut down the odds of destabilizing what has been the most peaceful area of iraq since the u s invasion that might mean supplying the turkish government with "actionable intelligence" to help them better plan whatever action they eventually take mr cook said there are some signs that this best case scenario might play out on wednesday a u s department of defense spokesman said "we are assisting the turks in their efforts to combat the pkk by supplying them with intelligence lots of intelligence " and mr babacan says if the turkish army does move into iraq it will try to avoid confronting the kurdish leadership of northern iraq "any cross border attack would be aimed at hitting terrorist bases and would not be an invasion " said mr babacan of course in the volatile middle east keeping military actions limited often proves easier said than done indexes eke out gains stocks crept up despite a flagging financial
