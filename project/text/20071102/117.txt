weekend journal the drivers seat lexus ls h l pale green lexuss &# hybrid the biggest con running in the auto industry right now is the notion that hybrids represent some sort of quantum leap in green transportation not only is this patently untrue hybrid technology is actually decades old but it shamelessly plays to the hypocrisy of our society if we really wanted to save the planet instead of buying hybrids we would start walking or riding bikes maybe a few more of us would try public transportation how about starting with slowing down to the speed limit on the freeway but lets be honest most americans arent willing to change to conserve energy even lifestyle choices like driving a small car carpooling and living in the vicinity of where we work are largely anathema which is why im not the least bit shocked by the lexus ls h l this is a hybrid limousine with a base sticker price of &# meaning that its the perfect way for a captain of industry to show the little people that he too will sacrifice nothing in his attempt to demonstrate to the world that he sort of cares about the environment and of course he does as these days there are profits to be made by selling all manner of "green" products whether they have any tangible environmental benefit or not toyota is bullish on the ls h ls "super ultra low emissions vehicle" rating the epas tightest standard for gasoline powered vehicles of course that standard has nothing to do with carbon dioxide emissions which are strictly tied to fuel economy and with an epa combined rating of just mpg this foot two and a half ton sedan isnt doing a lot to combat global warming it will get two miles per gallon more than the nonhybrid ls l on which it is based a car that costs &# less cost benefit analysis clearly doesnt figure into the allure we did the math the hybrid version will save its owner enough on gas to break even after only million miles keeping with toyotas brand strategy for its lexus division hybrids the ls h l deploys its technology as a badge of exclusivity rather than environmentalism with the sort of "why because we can " bravado thats endemic among luxury car brands though in this case theres not even another hybrid that competes in this part of the luxury arena with its five liter v supplemented by an electric drive motor a generator and a nickel metal hydride battery pack the all wheel drive system makes total horsepower compared to a mere horsepower from the liter v engine in the standard ls this is the most seamless hybrid system extant thanks in large part to a continuously variable transmission thats even more amazing than the eight speed automatic in the internal combustion only version in the hybrid you can feel a slight effect of the regenerative braking system transmitted through the brake pedal this system uses the cars rolling inertia to turn a generator which in turn creates electricity to recharge the batteries but thats the only thing about this car that makes it any less refined than its conventional sibling which is arguably the paragon of luxury sedans introduced for the model year the ls l the nonhybrid was the first long wheelbase version of lexuss flagship sedan even in this extended inch wheelbase configuration the ls remedies the biggest shortcoming of the previous generation its exceptionally soft suspension and numb handling the big sedan is now as enjoyable to drive as it is to be driven in so too is the hybrid version despite carrying an extra plus pounds the hybrid is reasonably engaging from behind the wheel courtesy of its three setting air suspension system an endless list of available features automatic parking system pre collision system with adaptive cruise control air purifier so on not to mention a gargantuan back seat carries over from the standard ls so does the look of massaged blandness that passes for lexus styling the hybrids interior gets some extra embellishment in the form of a wood and chrome shift knob and a headliner made from alcantara a man made material resembling suede that is commonly found in luxury cars the most noticeable cosmetic differences outside are a "hybrid" badge below the rear doors unique wheels and led headlamps with blue accents which toyota claims are an industry first you do lose some cargo capacity in the hybrid as its battery pack eats up a good chunk of space behind the rear seats unfortunately for all the brilliant technology that resides within this &# plus vehicle its missing a feature that has been commonly available on cheap cars for years battery rundown protection i discovered this when the main volt battery of the car i was testing drained while sitting overnight after charging the battery the car started back up but then the automatic trunk opener wouldnt work a quick visit to the dealer got it reprogrammed and the car exhibited no further problems lexus said i must have either left the cars accessory power on or forgotten to turn off one of the interior lights while the irony of not being able to start a car with a fully charged volt battery pack wasnt lost on me the greater incongruity of the ls h l isnt nearly as humorous would that we could save the planet while reposed in the back seat of a chauffeured limo air conditioned seats reclined watching a live earth concert on dvd and writing a check for carbon offsets reality dictates
