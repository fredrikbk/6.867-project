three face the prospect of a tough u s market dragging on well into next year for ford the moves include an effort to trim budgets and spending by up to in some departments people familiar with the matter said though it was unclear how the cuts would be implemented chrysler yesterday said it will eliminate shifts at five plants in the u s and one in canada resulting in the loss of to jobs chryslers cuts mark new flexibility under new labor contracts that allow it and general motors corp to cut jobs and trim production to adjust to market shifts previous labor agreements made cuts difficult leaving detroit at a disadvantage to asian rivals like toyota motor corp ford could soon earn the same flexibility said people familiar with the matter the dearborn mich company is close to agreeing to a framework of a new labor agreement with similar terms with the united auto workers union according to people familiar with the matter though last minute issues could stop a deal ford could get uaw concessions such as the ability to put less up front cash into a union run fund for retiree health care in return for keeping open one or two plants it had intended to close said these people a ford spokesman declined to comment the domestic auto makers need to scale back operations was highlighted yesterday in octobers auto sales which overall rose but again demonstrated the strength of asian rivals fords sales for the month fell and chryslers declined according to autodata corp gms sales rose boosted by sales to rental fleets and incentives on big sport utility vehicles by contrast toyota and honda motor co posted record months and toyota leapfrogged ford once again in october to post the second biggest sales results behind gm fords sales difficulties are being compounded by major shortfalls in efforts to cut materials costs people familiar with the matter said its expected budget move represents a midcourse correction in fords restructuring plan which calls for a return to profitability by in early ford projected &# billion in net material cost reductions by two years into the plan the savings are just two thirds of that a shortfall equal to about &#

hundreds of thousands of union retirees so they often chose to build as many cars and trucks as they could produce even though they usually ended up using deep discounts and rental sales to push them
