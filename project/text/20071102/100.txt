vaccinations is it an ounce of prevention or first do no harm ari brown is exactly right in her oct editorial page commentary "vaccines and autism " for years i have practiced pediatrics and have seen numerous misguided attempts to discredit the benefit of vaccines and to single them out as the root cause of many ills including mental retardation and autism a number of large studies have shown no causal association between vaccines and autism this pseudo science creates fears in the parents of children who need to be immunized and too often these fears keep children from being protected against potentially fatal illnesses like dr brown i have seen children die from diseases that are now vaccine preventable both here in the u s before these vaccines were available and currently in developing countries such as kenya and zambia where many of these vaccines are still not available i often tell parents that if they could only see what these diseases do to children if they could only see what i have seen firsthand they would have no hesitation about deciding to immunize their loved children jerry a miller jr m d president augusta pediatric associates associate clinical professor medical college of georgia augusta ga dr brown trots out the usual emotional appeal against those who dare to question the medical zeitgeist of vaccines i have no doubt of her sincerity on this issue but in addition to not really refuting the possibility that vaccines contribute to autism nitpicking a few facts from a single book doesnt vindicate vaccines dr brown is apparently oblivious to the problem with compulsory vaccinations after calling the recent dissent "dangerous" and a form of "new mccarthyism " dr brown reports "a small but growing number of parents are even lying about their religious beliefs to avoid having their children vaccinated " hmmm why would they have to do that if vaccines were truly voluntary in fact the grassroots internet campaign against vaccines is little match against the institutional propaganda machine that pressures families to immunize she says she gladly vaccinated her own children fine why doesnt she believe others i e other parents should be able to make the choice not to vaccinate their children craig sasse lees summit mo i wish to echo dr browns perceptive commentary as a pediatric colleague of dr browns i could relate personally and professionally to her experiences caring for patients who experienced the ravages of a vaccine preventable disease although dr browns patient was not fortunate enough to benefit from varicella immunization many of our patients now are i am asked daily both professionally and socially about the adverse effects of vaccinations and with flu season the questions have become more frequent while no intervention is ever perfect vaccinations have allowed us to achieve remarkable strides in public health and prevent morbidity and mortality of tremendous proportions we have the ability to provide our children with health care advantages through immunization that are duplicated only by hand washing as a pediatric infectious disease physician i enjoy counseling parents about the risks and benefits of vaccinations my discussion of the former is brief and the latter long there is often significant uncertainty in medicine and medical care however the benefits of routine childhood immunization both for the individual and the community are certain i relish the consultation in which i am able to have a dialogue with parents that concludes with an agreement to vaccinate i dread the one where i have to explain that their child may have had a fighting chance if he or she had been vaccinated andi l shane m d mph assistant professor division of pediatric infectious diseases emory university school of medicine atlanta we cannot refrain from vaccinations that protect our children from many diseases dr browns experience in the particular case of the young girl with chicken pox was very enlightening but unfortunately very sad i would like to respond as a parent and a health care provider in the early s as a sophomore in high school i went on a field trip to lakeview hospital in erie pa because i was interested in pursuing a nursing career the hospital was filled with contagious disease patients children and adults the area that made the biggest impression on me were the patients in iron lungs these were the polio patients who were unable to breath on their own they were inside a large round cylinder with just their head and feet exposed the pump that was attached beneath the cylinder was breathing for them there were also other contagious disease patients there many with scarlet fever and measles polio was very prevalent in the s when a family had a member of the family with a contagious disease who was living at home and the person was at home a red sign was attached to their front door to warn visitors lakeview hospital is no longer in existence vaccines have made the difference my nursing career extended years as a school nurse believe me vaccinations are essential i urge parents to discuss vaccinations with their doctors
