the daily fix dogged by cocaine accusation martina hingis chooses to retire online edition martina hingiss comeback has come to an end ms hingis hung up her racket in because of foot and leg injuries but returned in to reach two grand slam quarterfinals and win two lesser tournaments she finished the year ranked no though was more difficult she missed six weeks before wimbledon with hip and back injuries and was ranked no this week but it wasnt the injuries that forced her aside this time according to ms hingis she tested positive for cocaine on june the day she was ousted at wimbledon ms hingis said she has never taken drugs called the accusation "monstrous " and said shed hired an attorney who found "various inconsistencies" with the urine sample from wimbledon but despite that and this is the part raising eyebrows around the sporting world this morning she said she was retiring rather than endure a lengthy legal battle so is she guilty and leaving in a huff innocent and departing in disgust or using the test guilt or innocence aside as an excuse to avoid more on court frustrations on espn bonnie d ford writes that "in all probability she knows few people will be inclined to believe her she might have had a fighting chance a few years ago before olympic gold medalist marion jones baseball all star rafael palmeiro tour de france winner bjarne riis and others fouled the waters the statement also indicated that hingis has had a chance to observe what happens to athletes who stand and fight the time and money it takes and the impossibility of completely bleaching the stain away that coupled with her age and the chronic hip pain that has kept her from playing regularly since last spring prompted her to pull the plug " in the sydney morning herald mark hodgkinson notes this isnt the first time ms hingiss considerable ego has been a factor in her decisions "it was not power she brought to wimbledons centre court and elsewhere but class and craft and other clever stuff " he writes "it was tennis with an iq mensa on strings however that lack of height and lack of punch off the racquet became a problem when the williams sisters became proper forces on the tour for all her clever clever style hingis was occasionally just overpowered by the baseline sluggers when she retired in citing injuries you felt it wasnt the whole story hingis probably believed that she could not dominate any more and once you have been the little queen of the courts it is difficult for your ego to then take the hit and accept your role as a player on the second tier of the game " in the times simon barnes offers a warts and all appreciation of ms hingis praising "one of the cleverest athletes i have seen " "martina hingis used to smile all the time " he writes "people said it was because she played with youthful freedom with girlish abandon she had all the girlish abandon of a centurion tank the smile was pure armour plate more a rictus of concentration than a signal of inner delight perhaps she did it to annoy her opponent to be beaten by a year old is bad enough to be beaten by a year old grinning all over her face is a great deal worse and annoying people was her greatest sporting attribute and for that reason she was an absolute delight to watch " the new york yankees introduced joe girardi as their new manager yesterday but found their thunder stolen by a familiar name the los angeles dodgers formally admitted baseballs worst kept secret by saying that yes joe torre will be their new manager unveiled at yankee stadium mr girardi modeled pinstripes with a rather significant on the back the yankees as their extremely shy fans can sometimes be persuaded to whisper in your ear have won titles but in the new york times harvey araton wonders if that was a good idea "didnt hank steinbrenner the ownership son who has dramatically risen recently suggest a moratorium on the yankees must win now doctrine in fairness to girardi " he asks "wouldnt it be wise to back off on the bombast when the yankees have just kissed off alex rodriguez when they have so many young pitchers whose timetable for yearlong success cant possibly be known wouldnt the more prudent approach be to let the red sox carry the burden of endgame expectation which finally swallowed no less a legend than torre for a year or two " in the bergen record ian oconnor takes a hard look at the machinations that surrounded the dodgers managerial search analysis that undermines the conventional wisdom that mr torre was wronged and martyred by the yankees heres the relevant fix given the incentives he received in previous contracts was the yankees offer really such an insult when did the dodgers and mr torre start chatting and wasnt this a shabby way to treat grady little the dodgers manager at the time mr oconnor ends by skewering the former yankee manager but good "who knows maybe a rod isnt far behind his agent scott boras surely has to be impressed with torres work in l a so far on girardis big day in the bronx his former manager upstaged him joe torre didnt handle the end of littles reign any better than the yankees handled the end of his " the miami heat lost their season opener to the detroit pistons last night in the south florida sun sentinel dave hyde writes that the heat knew they were in for a struggle because dwyane wade was absent but what about the relative absence of shaquille oneal "is thursday what oneal is now " he asks "is that it no points in the first half nine points and seven rebounds for the game constant foul trouble throughout no one expects the year old oneal to play like hes everyone understands those times he can pick up the opposing team on his finger and twirl it around are gone but he can still be a presence he should still have more impact " on tuesday night high school coach roger barta told his smith center kan charges to get off to a fast start in their playoff opener against plainville boy did they the score was with seconds left in the first quarter "you expected to hear joy in roger bartas voice " wayne drehs writes on espn "you expected the kansas high school football legend to pick up the phone and start bragging about his teams latest accomplishment the most dominating first quarter anyone has ever played instead you find a man who is uncomfortable uneasy almost embarrassed " in other words mr drehs didnt accidentally dial bill belichick thank you tip your waitress detroit tigers fans probably never imagined the california wildfires could affect their teams chances of returning to the postseason in but they have on saturday fireballing reliever joel zumaya was moving possessions from the attic of his parents chula vista calif home when he accidentally dislodged a heavy box which landed on his right shoulder hell be out until at least the middle of "zumaya needs to stop treating his right arm like one of the billion other arms currently in use on planet earth " michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "he must act like he has a rare antique porcelain vase dangling from his right shoulder if this means that when its time to help his parents move boxes he checks three times to make sure nothing will fall on him then thats what it means this might sound like im picking on zumaya im not i just want to see his boyish enthusiasm and lightning bolt of an arm on the mound for a long time i want to see him make so much money that he can buy gold teeth for his pets " tip of the fix cap to reader michelle alessandri found a good
