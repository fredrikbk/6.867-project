this makes voter fraud easier sen hillary clinton was asked during a debate this week if she supported new york gov eliot spitzers plan to give drivers licenses to illegal immigrants at first she seemed to endorse the idea then claimed "i did not say that it should be done but i certainly recognize why governor spitzer is trying to do it " the next day she took a firmer stand sort of by offering general support for gov spitzers approach but adding that she hadnt studied his specific plan she should and so should the rest of us it stops just short of being an engraved invitation for people to commit voter fraud the background here is the national voter registration act commonly known as "motor voter " that president bill clinton signed into law in it required all states to offer voter registration to anyone getting a drivers license one simply fills out a form and checks a box stating he is a citizen he is then registered and in most states does not have to show any id to vote but no one checks if the person registering to vote is indeed a citizen that greatly concerns new york election officials who processed voter registrations at dmv offices last year "it would be tough to catch if someone wanted to get a number of people registered who arent citizens and went ahead and got them drivers licenses " says lee daghlian spokesman for new yorks board of elections assemblywoman ginny fields a long island democrat warns that the states "board of elections has no voter police" and that the state probably has upwards of illegal immigrants old enough to drive the potential for fraud is not trivial as federal privacy laws prevent cross checking voter registration rolls with immigration records nevertheless a congressional investigation found that " illegal voters possibly cast ballots in a disputed house election" in california after the justice department found that eight of the hijackers were registered to vote under pressure from liberal groups some states have even abandoned the requirement that people check a citizenship box to be put on the voter rolls iowa has told local registrars they should register people even if they leave the citizenship box blank maryland officials wave illegal immigrants through the registration process prompting a justice department letter warning they may be helping people violate federal law gov spitzer is treading perilously close to that despite a tactical retreat this week he says he will only give illegal immigrants a license that isnt valid for airplane travel and entering federal buildings mr spitzer has taken active steps to obliterate any distinctions between licenses given to citizens and non citizens in a memo last sept he ordered county clerks to remove the visa expiration date and "temporary visitor" stamp on licenses issued to non citizens who are legally in the country a spitzer spokeswoman explained the change was made because the "temporary" label was "pejorative " given that some visitors might eventually stay in the u s under fire mr spitzer backed down this week delaying the cancellation of the "temporary visitor" stamps through the end of next year but he has not retreated from another new bizarre policy it used to be that county clerks who process drivers licenses were banned from giving out voter registration forms to anyone without a social security number no longer lou dobbs of cnn reported that an oct memo from the state dmv informed the clerks they dont "have any statutory discretion to withhold a motor voter form " whats more the computer block preventing a dmv clerk from transmitting a motor voter registration without a social security number was removed gov spitzers office told me the courts have upheld their position on social security numbers sandy deperno the democratic clerk of oneida county says that makes no sense "this makes voter fraud easier " she told me while states such as new york are increasing the risk of such fraud a half dozen states have recently adopted laws requiring voters to offer proof of identity or citizenship before casting a ballot a federal commission co chaired by former president jimmy carter and former secretary of state james baker gave such laws a big boost in when it called for a nationwide policy requiring a photo id before voting mr carter has personal knowledge of why such laws are needed he recounts in his book "turning point" how his race for georgia state senate involved a local sheriff who had cast votes for the dead it took a recount and court challenge before mr carter was declared the winner measures that curb voter fraud on the one hand and encourage it on the other will be central to the election the supreme court will rule on the constitutionality of indianas photo id law next spring while lawsuits challenging gov spitzers moves will be in new york state courts despite her muddled comments this week theres no doubt where mrs clinton stands on ballot integrity she opposes photo id laws even though they enjoy over support in the polls she has also introduced a bill to force every state to offer no excuse absentee voting as well as election day registration easy avenues for election chicanery the bill requires that every state restore voting rights to all criminals who have completed their prison terms parole or probation pollster scott rasmussen notes that mrs clinton is such a polarizing figure that she attracts between and support no matter which republican candidate shes pitted against even libertarian ron paul she knows she may have trouble winning next year maybe thats why shes thrown herself in with those who will look the other way as a new electoral majority is formed even if that includes non citizens felons and those who suddenly cross a state line on election day and decide they want to vote someplace new mr fund a columnist for opinionjournal com is author of a forthcoming revised edition of "stealing elections
