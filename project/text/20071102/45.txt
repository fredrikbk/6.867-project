festering wounds impair writers talks deal set in is key complication as studio pact expires as the threat of a strike hung over hollywood the day after screenwriters and studios were unable to reach a three year deal it was clear the two sides must resolve deep wounds before they can deal with future issues the writers guild of americas contract expired early yesterday with no further talks scheduled the timing of any strike remains uncertain but there were indications yesterday that a walkout today at least was unlikely people close to the matter said the boards of directors representing the west and east coast branches of the wga are required to ratify any move to strike this process would likely not be completed thursday night preventing the guild from calling a strike friday these people said as many as guild members were expected to attend a general membership meeting last night at the los angeles convention center the purpose of the meeting was to update writers about the status of negotiations with the alliance of motion picture and television producers which negotiates on behalf of the major hollywood studios a guild spokesman said the breakdown in contract talks was evidence of the deep rooted resentment writers continue to feel over what turned out to be a disadvantageous deal they struck in just before the home entertainment market which later morphed into the dvd boom became a force now the writers want to reclaim part of the dvd pie before moving on to discuss how much they will be paid for use of their work on the internet and in other new media the studios say they are unwilling to renegotiate the dvd issue "theyre not bargaining in good faith " says nick counter president of the amptp "weve been talking to a wall " the studios may have aggravated the issue when earlier this year they proposed a rollback and restructuring of the entire residual system which pays writers when their works is recycled in reruns in syndication and on home entertainment platforms the guild has dug in its heels because it doesnt want to take a back seat to two other unions the directors guild of america and the screen actors guild whose contracts expire next june many observers thought the writers would try to work without a contract through early next year in order to link up with the two other guilds "writers dont want to strike they want to negotiate a fair and reasonable deal but they will strike if they must to ensure a deal that gives them a share of content they create " said john bowman head of the wgas negotiating committee the current wga leadership appears to be staking its claim as the lead negotiator on behalf of hollywood creative types "this time the writers want to lead the industry and show they can make the deal and the directors and actors will be in their debt not the other way around " says jonathan handel an entertainment attorney at troygould in los angeles and a former wga lawyer "thats a very different attitude than you saw in the s and s " should a strike materialize tv producers will be hit first the networks have stores of reality and game shows in their vaults plus offerings they can pull from sister cable channels and at nbc and cbs archives of procedural crime shows that repeat well in a conference call on thursday cbs chief executive leslie moonves said his network has "a full slate" of programming that is "ready to go " both now and mid season he said a strike would have "no material impact on the company for the remainder of the television season " merissa marr contributed to this article
