weekend journal sports by the numbers powering the patriots while this sundays showdown between the undefeated indianapolis colts and the equally unblemished new england patriots has football fans buzzing an even more significant story line has been pushed aside so far this season the patriots have been the most dominant team in nfl history bill belichicks pats got to their wins in super bowls xxxvi xxxviii and xxxix with defense this year its their offense thats performing with historic efficiency they are currently on a pace to score regular season points which would shatter the nfl mark of points set by the minnesota vikings and theres another scoring record the patriots are threatening to break kerry byrne of coldhardfootballfacts com points out that when it comes to points per game over a regular season the vikings are fourth on the list behind the los angeles rams houston oilers and chicago bears the patriots with a best ever scoring average so far could clean up the record book theres a surprising common thread between the vikings and this years patriots squad wide receiver randy moss mr moss acquired from the oakland raiders this year for a fourth round draft pick currently has tds halfway to jerry rices single season mark of td receptions remarkably because of a players strike in mr rice set that record in only games and mr mosss quarterback tom brady is having an even bigger year hes already set a personal best with touchdown passes and seems well on his way to the record of set by colts qb peyton manning three seasons ago with yards hes also within striking distance of dan marinos single season record of set in plus mr brady has thrown a mere two interceptions but scoring prowess alone doesnt guarantee success of the nine teams in nfl history that scored more than points in a season only the st louis rams the san francisco ers and the denver broncos won the super bowl thats because teams that score prolifically often give up points just as fast thats not true for this new england team led by newcomer adalius thomas the patriots have given up points per game fifth best in the nfl the colts are a surprising second giving up points per game to see how bill belichicks team has dominated on both sides of the ball we turn to p wins which takes a teams points scored and its points allowed and squeezes those numbers through a formula that resembles the pythagorean theorem with p wins the new england patriots are on track to be the most dominant team in nfl history the only team to crack p wins over a game schedule was the bears and p wins is a better predictor of success than overall scoring is of the six other teams to crack p wins all but one the vikings went on to win a super bowl so while the colts enter sundays game as the defending super bowl champs and winners of their last three matchups with the patriots history suggests that theyre facing an uphill battle but tony dungys team may have brought that problem upon itself the colts come from behind win in last seasons afc championship game was likely the catalyst for the player moves that turned this new england team from a championship contender to a team that for a half season at least has played like perhaps the greatest team of all time
