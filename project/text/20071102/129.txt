weekend journal the wealth report the revolution of chairman li chinas richest man leads others to give bucking nations taboos shantou china li ka shing asias richest man is shaking up philanthropy in china while multibillion dollar donations by western entrepreneurs such as warren buffett bill gates and mexicos carlos slim are turning private wealth into a force for tackling social problems philanthropy remains a radical concept in china the communist party has long stymied privately funded institutions from churches to schools viewing them as a threat to its grip on power and traditional confucian beliefs hold that charitable donations should be done quietly so as not to extract personal benefit from altruism now mr li the chairman of hong kong conglomerate hutchison whampoa ltd is leading a growing group of wealthy chinese who are challenging tradition and embracing a more open approach to giving last year mr li announced plans to give a third of his fortune a pledge estimated at more than &# billion to his foundations that fund philanthropic projects around the world the move will give the li ka shing foundation an endowment that rivals the &# billion ford foundation the second largest u s philanthropy after the bill and melinda gates foundation "in the u s philanthropic support from entrepreneurs is tightly integrated into the fabric of society whether its health care medical research or education " the year old mr li said during a rare interview about his philanthropic work "now slowly china will know this " dozens of high profile chinese entrepreneurs are following mr lis lead yang lan a prominent talk show host who is often dubbed the chinese oprah winfrey has donated an estimated &# million to set up a foundation aimed at cultural exchanges environmental protection and education according to the hurun report a publication that tracks philanthropy in china yu pengnian the year old head of the chinese luxury hotel empire shenzhen pengnian hotels has donated close to &# million roughly of his net worth to health care causes including funding cataract operations for thousands in rural china hurun report says and niu gensheng chief executive of mengniu dairy group has donated all his shares in one of chinas largest milk companies valued at nearly &# million to a foundation devoted to agriculture education and medical endeavors according to the company the chinese government is gradually becoming more open to philanthropic giving as capitalism generates new concerns about wealth disparity while the average wage in china is less than &# a month some chinese have a net worth over &# million and china is home to about billionaires according to hurun report "as the wealth gap grows the government is concerned about growing social discord because the poor are being left out " says john peralta managing director of the consulting firm global philanthropic in hong kong china will eventually "embrace philanthropy as a way to maintain social harmony " he predicts but today many factors work against private giving in china one is the regions long tradition of family money remaining within a family "in asia our traditional values encourage and even demand that wealth and means pass through lineage as an imperative duty " mr li said last september shortly after he announced the donation he called on asia to "transcend this traditional belief " china has no comprehensive law on charitable giving theres no requirement for instance that charities disclose information on their activities or works which can lead to suspicions among the public about their activities moreover beijing still requires that all donations be funneled through the government but the government is growing more accepting of philanthropy a major report released at the th party congress in october said chinas social welfare programs should be "complemented with charity programs " "there are high expectations for a comprehensive law on philanthropy in china " says liu youping chief editor of china philanthropy times which is published by the ministry of civil affairs the ministry couldnt be reached for comment in the meantime donors tend to stick to causes considered "safe " like health care to avoid conflicts with officials but not even all health related donations pass muster earlier this year the government shut several offices of the china orchid aids project which provided funding to aids patients and detained the organizations head many saw the move as a warning to charities about the risks of getting involved with causes considered controversial by the government in china mr li has stuck to relatively uncontroversial causes such as education at a leafy university campus near his childhood home in southern china mr li has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build shantou university and is helping shape the schools unusually global curriculum starbucks coffee co founder howard schultz lectured students on business ethics last year former cnn correspondent peter arnett has been teaching journalism since february three u s congressmen came through in april to discuss the u s political system and a crew of former nba stars was recently hired to help shantous basketball squad with their bounce passes born in china in mr li fled to hong kong with his family in after japanese troops began bombing his village in his teens he lost his father to tuberculosis and had to drop out of school which he never formally finished from then mr li saved his paychecks from a hong kong watch factory and in his early s bought a plastics factory that became the largest supplier of plastic flowers in asia the father of two says he had enough money at to last his entire life now as chairman of hutchison whampoa and cheung kong he sits on top of a business empire that operates in countries and employs people working in retail telecommunications and ports his personal stake is valued at over &# billion in hong kong his rags to riches story has bred as much resentment as admiration many locals refer to the foot inch mr li as "superman" for his ability to time markets his detractors resent the control his businesses have over the economy of the capitalist enclave and at times have attacked his philanthropy in mr lis foundation gave one billion hong kong dollars about us&# million to the medical school of hong kong university which renamed the school the li ka shing faculty of medicine that prompted street protests by some university graduates who said it amounted to mr li buying the name of a storied institution mr li dismisses the accusations as "jealousy " and says his donations dont have any correlation to his business interests while western philanthropists face increasing pressure to bring accountability and transparency to their work mr lis charitable deeds remain opaque he wont provide any estimate of his net worth or the exact amount he plans to give away he says he is " of the way" toward donating a third of his fortune to the foundation though he wont disclose how much that is mr li is spry sharp and very engaged in his work he says he wakes around a m and plays golf about four times a week he wears an inexpensive seiko wristwatch which he sets minutes fast his project at shantou has grown from an empty field years ago into a compact campus with a man made lake nine schools including one of chinas best medical schools and a &# million library that is under construction for nearly two decades mr li passively funded the school and left the curriculum in the hands of government bureaucrats but several years ago when the schools mission seemed adrift mr li assigned solina chau his personal companion and the director of the li ka shing foundation to take a more active role in the schools affairs since then ms chau who provides much of the strategic vision that drives mr lis foundation brought in a new cast of academics administrators and scientists largely educated outside of china as part of an effort to turn a second rate college in a depressed coastal town into one of chinas top universities the changes havent been easy even the smallest have involved negotiations with local officials the local communist party and the universitys state employees the university for example was reluctant to keep the cafeteria open most of the day as many western universities do to allow students more flexible schedules at chinese universities cafeterias are open for only a brief window at lunch and dinner chinas educational system has traditionally stressed rote memorization over critical thinking but the educators at shantou are trying to create a new educational paradigm for china that is more open to debate discussion creativity and freedom "if you cant do it in a university how can you do it in society " says gu peihua the universitys vice president who moved to shantou from calgary canada "youre changing peoples behavior " sue feng contributed to this article
