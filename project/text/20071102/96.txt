business day sign up for the e mail here investors who dumped shares yesterday as they fretted about the state of credit markets in general and citigroup in particular may find little comfort in revelations that merrill lynch has been offloading mortgage backed securities onto hedge funds in what may have been a bid to shore up its balance sheet after a brief spell of relative stability in which it seemed like the credit market turmoil was behind us investors changed their minds thursday and fled the stock market sending the dow and the s&amp p down each and the nasdaq down overnight asian markets followed suit with indexes from tokyo to hong kong to sydney each losing around by this morning in europe shares also pulled back one uncommon move overnight was in gold where prices briefly retreated in what hsbc analyst james steel called a sign that investors were raising cash in order to meet margin calls "this was the pattern in august this year where the initial impact on gold of the credit crisis was a brief bout of liquidation followed by a pronounced rally as investors increased gold positions " mr steel told dow jones newswires as the financial times writes "the biggest single reason for the decline in equities was the revival of worries that big banks in the u s and europe would unveil further credit write offs " one big bank in focus yesterday was citigroup whose shares tumbled after an analyst speculated it will need to raise more than &# billion to restore a healthy capital position and big share declines in citigroup and other financial firms arent necessarily a buying opportunity some investors say "these companies dont own factories they dont own hard assets its a confidence game " the head of a private equity firm who has examined a purchase of financial companies told the wall street journal "if you dont believe the numbers its hard for us and others to get involved all you need is a little change in their reserves and you wipe out equity " businessweek asserts that thursdays market sell off is a sign that wednesdays rally originally thought to have been a sign of relief in the feds quarter point interest rate cut was something else entirely funds buying stocks before closing their books on fiscal brian gendreau investment strategist at ing tells the magazine that the high dividend yield on financial stocks was their only attraction and with the capital position of banks like citigroup now in question its not clear if the dividend yield is sustainable furthermore the problems that start in the housing market and work their way toward banks bottom lines are far from over the journal suggests as mortgage servicing companies which collect payments from borrowers report that delinquencies have been worse than expected "mortgages are still deteriorating at an accelerating pace and thats scary " karen weaver global head of securitization research at deutsche bank tells the paper meanwhile the journal reports that regulators are scrutinizing whether merrill lynch home to &# billion in credit write downs and consequently no longer home to chief executive stan oneal knew that its mortgage related problem was bigger than what it indicated to investors throughout the summer people close to the situation tell the journal that merrill made deals with hedge funds "that may have been designed to delay the day of reckoning on losses " in one such deal a hedge fund bought &# billion in commercial paper issued by a merrill related entity containing mortgages in exchange for the right to sell back the commercial paper to merrill itself after one year for a guaranteed minimum return the deal delayed for one year any risk of a write down if the commercial paper got stuck on a shelf with no willing buyers the paper reports that merrill has recently been scurrying to line up hedge funds to take as much as &# billion in mortgage related securities "at issue with any hedge fund deals is whether there was an attempt by merrill to sweep problems under the rug through private transactions kept out of view from investors some previous scandals such as the collapse of enron corp and the troubles of japans financial system in the s involved efforts to hide problems through off balance sheet transactions " the journal writes jay gould a securities lawyer at pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp tells the journal that if a firm is unloading securities from its books "without a real commercial purpose other than to create a value for pricing purposes that can be a problem " bart barnett head of equity trading at morgan keegan suggests to the washington post that this kind of revelation is just what investors are worried about "everyone wanted to think it was over everyone wanted to think there was light at the end of the tunnel but everyone is writing down billions and billions of dollars if its of greater intensity at merrill and the analysis of citi comes to fruition who knows who else is out there people are saying wow whos next " still not everyone is proclaiming gloom and doom steve sachs director of trading at rydex investments tells the new york times that thursday was just a logical play it safe reaction to an uncertain outlook now that the fed has signaled its unreadiness to further cut interest rates "today was nothing more than a round of profit taking " mr sachs said "the markets been rallying why not take some off the table " hollywood writers call for walkout leaders of the union representing hollywoods film and television writers last night declared

networks have been hustling to put together episodes of existing scripted shows but with their audiences already fragmenting weak programming will hurt " npr writes furthermore the l a times says a
