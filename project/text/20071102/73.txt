allowing its biggest customer washington mutual inc to exert pressure for higher property valuations to help ensure that loans went through the case marks one of the highest profile government actions yet to assign blame for the mortgage crisis that is causing havoc in the financial markets the page complaint filed in state court in manhattan alleges that eappraiseit llc a unit of santa ana calif based first american allowed washington mutual loan originators to "handpick" appraisers who brought in high valuations and permitted bank employees to pressure them to increase estimates that came in too low in one example new york state said eappraiseit lifted its estimate of a property to &# million from &# million after the company was told by washington mutual the higher number would help the loan go through first american in a statement said the complaint "has no foundation in fact or law the allegations largely based on a handful of e mails that have been taken out of context or mischaracterized and an incomplete review of the facts belie our record of compliance with applicable law " according to the suit anthony r merlo jr eappraiseits president sent emails to his superiors at the parent company in which he first said his unit would "roll over" and submit to washington mutuals demands on appraisals later in an email he wrote that he viewed the banks conduct as a violation of federal regulations the suit seeks an injunction to stop the alleged illegal activities and asks first american a title insurer and provider of housing and mortgage data for unspecified damages restitution and disgorgement of gains obtained through the allegedly fraudulent acts it says eappraiseit handled more than appraisals in new york for washington mutual and received more than &# million although appraisers have long been the subject of criticism it has been difficult to target them for legal action because appraisals are subjective opinions prosecutors in the new york case are relying on laws that mandate appraiser independence from outside influence by lenders and others washington mutual isnt named as a defendant but the suit shines a spotlight on the lender state prosecutors say federal pre emption rules complicate their ability to charge the bank directly according to washington mutuals third quarter earnings release the seattle bank generated home loans totaling &# billion in the first three quarters of this year in a statement washington mutual said it is "surprised and disappointed" by allegations in the complaint and that it is suspending its relationship with eappraiseit until it can "investigate the situation " "we have absolutely no incentive to have appraisers inflate home values " washington mutual said "in fact inflated appraisals are contrary to our interests we use third party appraisal companies to make sure that appraisals are objective and accurate " lenders require appraisals usually by trained appraisers but sometimes by computer programs that analyze past sales before making home loans the appraisal is supposed to ensure that the lender has an authoritative estimate of the propertys value an inflated appraisal can cause lenders to advance more money than the house is valued at exposing the borrower the lender and investors who buy mortgage backed securities to losses the risks can be high if the home buyer is borrowing as much as of the purchase price a practice that was becoming more common until the mortgage market turmoil earlier this year ohio attorney general marc dann sued mortgage lenders on behalf of individual borrowers alleging they violated state consumer protection laws by pressuring appraisers to inflate the homes values the state has gotten a default judgment against one lender and is in settlement talks with two others kevin l petrasic managing director of external affairs for the office of thrift supervision the treasury department agency that oversees washington mutual says the agency is "looking into the allegations that were put forth in the new york complaint " he added that it "concerns us" that the attorney general "had information that consumers were not protected but didnt bother to contact the federal regulators isnt that the whole point of regulation " the lawsuit in new york bolsters arguments by critics of the appraisal business who have warned for years about the growing pressure on appraisers to inflate home values the appraisal system has an inherent conflict of interest appraisers are often hired by mortgage brokers or lender employees whose incomes are based at least partly on the number of loans they get approved appraisers complaints about pressure to inflate property values have risen studies suggest in a survey of real estate appraisers released
