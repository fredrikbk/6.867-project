weekend journal review theater in a strange land the home place guthrie theater south second st minneapolis &# &# closes nov cyrano de bergerac richard rodgers theatre w th st new york &# &# closes dec minneapolis brian friel and tom stoppard the english speaking worlds two foremost playwrights have brought a pair of plays to america this year only one of which will be seen in new york mr stoppards "rock n roll" opens on broadway next week while mr friels "the home place " which was supposed to have been produced off broadway by the roundabout theatre company instead received its u s premiere at minneapoliss guthrie theater a dispute over casting is said to have caused the scuttling of the roundabout production which would have been one of the major events of the season not wanting to miss out on the excitement i flew to minnesota last wednesday to see "the home place" and returned to manhattan feeling embarrassed for my home town that so self evidently significant a work of dramatic art should have opened in minneapolis says a lot about that theatrically savvy city and even more about the diminished state of serious theater in new york "the home place " first performed in dublin two years ago is the latest of mr friels increasingly subtle and penetrating variations on a theme that has preoccupied him for much of the past half century it is the story of a man torn between two countries and two identities alienated from his native land but ill at ease in the place where he has chosen to live that place is of course ballybeg the fictional irish town that is to mr friel what yoknapatawpha county was to william faulkner the year is and the poor peasants of ballybeg are fast losing patience with the wealthy anglo irish landlords who rule them even one as sympathetic as christopher gore simon jones a kindly widower whose only sin is that his english ancestors chose to seek their fortunes in ireland he loves his adopted home in a superficial but well meaning way and he also loves margaret sarah agnew the much younger irishwoman who keeps his house and runs his life all christopher wants is to live out his days in peace but the angry young men of ballybeg are about to bring him and his kind not peace but a sword part of mr friels genius and i use that word deliberately lies in his near miraculous ability to treat irelands tangled political life as a means not an end his end is art not propaganda and his study is the human heart in all its fearsome complexity though the plot of "the home place" is deeply embedded in irish history its true subject matter is the unappeasable loneliness of the exile "no home no country a life of isolation and resentment and that resentment will stalk him and never forget it down through the next generation and the next and the next the doomed nexus of those who believe themselves the possessors and those who believe theyre dispossessed " joe dowling the irishman who runs the guthrie has been directing mr friels plays for some years and the two men are close friends as well as close associates thus it is with trepidation that i admit to having felt that much of the acting in mr dowlings staging of "the home place" runs to caricature knowing and appealing to be sure but caricature all the same the women in general and ms agnew in particular seemed to me more true to life than the men it may simply be that i dont know the difference between real irish and stage irish though my skeptical response might also have been due to the fact that id just come from chicago where i saw strawdog theatre company perform mr friels similarly themed "aristocrats" in a setting so intimate that it made the guthries large scale ultranaturalistic production of "the home place" seem overblown by comparison whatever the reason for my doubts please dont let them stop you from seeing "the home place " whose strongest moments the wrenching last scene above all are as good as anything mr friel has written i long to watch it again preferably in new york though id go just about anywhere to see a new play by brian friel "i write for the irish " he says "and if others wish to overhear were happy " not so his plays are about the irish but they are written for all men in all conditions that is what makes them great new york if youre wondering what a year old french verse play is doing on broadway i can tell you in two words jennifer garner the star of "alias " " going on " and "dude wheres my car " has now made her stage debut opposite kevin kline in "cyrano de bergerac " alas ms garner is no claire danes though she does do better than julia roberts in "three days of rain" which isnt saying much i admire her nerve but her performance is vocally monotonous and just as narrowly limited in every other way and the play even when performed as it is here in anthony burgesss now standard and more than serviceable rhyming translation edmond rostands tale of the long nosed soldier poet who pines in vain for his beauteous roxane is less a work of art than an iconically familiar idea whose appeal is perennial accordingly it has been filmed many times under various colors including "roxanne " steve martins updated version and "the truth about cats and dogs " in which the genders of the protagonists are switched and turned into an opera at least twice would that the play itself were better but in truth its a well gnawed hambone an exercise in romantic hokum that can nonetheless be ennobled by its leading man mr kline who was last seen on stage in the public theaters awful "king lear " is a brilliantly gifted comic actor who lacks the innate gravity needed to anchor cyranos wilder flights into rhetorical flamboyance still he gives it all hes got and his performance is mostly very gratifying indeed though david leveauxs staging and tom pyes set are too stark to set it off properly the only possible way to do "cyrano" today is with all stops pulled and all flags flying including a roxane who is vivid enough to justify her cyranos mad extravagance mr kline shines so brightly that ms garner for all her undeniable prettiness is nowhere to be seen mr
