point of keeping to his own style rather than mitchells more florid one "im out of the terse hemingway school " he says mr mccaigs wife prepared a chapter by chapter guide to the original to make sure

sold in countries the new novel has many familiar characters as well as scenes known to readers from mitchells book including the famous "frankly i dont give a damn" chapter near the end but here told from rhett butlers "emotional vantage point " mr mccaig says in the original that moment comes when scarlett confesses that she realizes how much she needs rhett in her life mr mccaig writes "rhett
