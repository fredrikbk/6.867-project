weekend journal tastings a gift from down under aussie red is big in price and taste avoiding impostors each year around this time we suggest one break the bank you shouldnt have bottle for the wine lover in your life we make this recommendation long before the holidays to give you plenty of time to find it our suggestion this year penfolds grange if you just broke into a broad smile and a warm glow coursed through your body youre already familiar with grange wine lovers remember their first grange the way they remember their first kiss we still remember where we were at a country inn and even what dottie was wearing green velvet when we had our first and well never forget how each tiny sip of this wine was filled with rich intense and truly unique tastes grange was created by penfolds winemaker max schubert in and has long been australias most famous wine its made from shiraz occasionally with a little bit of cabernet sauvignon from various vineyards generally in the barossa valley and aged for about months in new american oak somewhere around to cases are made every year and the wine is released five years after the harvest even though australia has become a major player on the worlds wine scene over the past decade no other wine has come close to approaching the quality and fame of grange which was called grange hermitage until and even though it can be expensive &# and up up up even well aged grange can seem positively reasonable these days compared to some of californias cult wines and the latest "vintage of the century" bordeaux what vintages are out there how much do they cost and how are they drinking we bought vintages going back to to find out we got them earlier this year in may and kept them in our cellar so theyd have a chance to relax these are not the kind of wines youll usually find down at the corner wine store but they are available at many good stores and on the internet at sites such as wines com hdhwine com and cellar com the wall street journal has reported in the past that the fame of grange has made it a target of counterfeiters so its particularly important to deal with a reputable merchant when youre buying these and if you do have a bottle shipped to yourself or a friend make sure to get express delivery so it doesnt have to travel for long in uncertain weather we tasted the vintages over more than a week we did not taste these blind drinking one each night over several hours both with and without food to give each wine every opportunity to show its stuff and what stuff it was we have been writing this column for almost a decade now and have been drinking and studying wine for years but we have never had such a consistently exciting tasting we expected to enjoy these wines but we never would have guessed that five of the wines would rate delicious or higher like all great wines these are impossible to adequately describe in words but heres a hint the color is quite dark preparing you right away for a wine of some weight and intensity the nose is massive and complex with rich soil cedar tobacco blackberries and blueberries all with a certain meatiness to it the taste at first is explosive with concentrated focused pure flavors of ultra rich fruit then surprisingly the wine smooths out with a perfect amount of oak taste soothing the tannins as the wine finishes just the right dash of acidity keeps the wine from being too big too brawny it becomes elegant and structured despite its rich intensity after its swallowed the finish is as explosive as the first sip leaving an endless taste of earth and fruit if we had to use a single word to describe the experience we guess it would be lusty our very favorite among the wines to our own surprise was the youngest the which rated a rare delicious but it was difficult to choose among them these age so well that even the was beautiful and could age for still more years in fact the biggest surprise of the tasting was the consistency of the wines through decades winemakers and even corporate owners these wines all shared a similar vision thats the result of careful grape selection and blending "big wine" has become a cliche these days it tends to mean heavy alcoholic mind blowing "a mans wine" you know the kind that could put hair on your chest grange proves that big ripe fruit even with a good dose of oak can create a wine of tremendous elegance even with some explosive intensity grange also shows what shiraz can be and thats too easy to forget these days when so many australian shirazes are sweet alcoholic simple and unpleasant grange is one of those wines that wine lovers buy and talk about far more than they actually drink it because it is so special and because it seems like it will always be better with more age we tend to look at our bottles think about opening them and put them back on the shelf thats why a bottle of grange is a great present for someone who has never tried it or for a budding wine lover whos ready to stretch some taste buds but also for a wine lover who knows it well in the latter case enclose a note that says "this isnt to cellar this is to drink now " at any age grange is a special treat melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones grange index in a tasting of vintages of penfolds grange here are our notes in order of our preference these wines are designed to age for many years serve with a great steak or robust savory vegetable dishes we have noted the prices we paid but these are specialty items and prices vary widely young bottles of grange probably should be decanted especially if you dont have all night to linger over the wine but taste first to make sure it needs the extra air vintage price &# rating

dry mineral finish vintage price &# rating good very good tasters comments tired and a bit prune like soft and lacking complexity with some time it pulls itself together for a time and is charming but

life or character note wines are rated on a scale that ranges yech ok good very good delicious and delicious these are the prices we paid at wine stores in california and new york prices vary widely
