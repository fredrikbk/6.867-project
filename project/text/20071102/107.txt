weekend journal review books all the wisdom without the words how to talk about books you havent read by pierre bayard bloomsbury pages &# i never read a book i must review " said oscar wilde "it prejudices you so " pierre bayard who avails himself of this quotation would surely have understood my not reading his book since he too as his title makes plain feels that reading a book is no requirement for discussing it i went ahead and read mr bayards book anyway chiefly because i am being paid to write about it and i prefer to think myself an honest workman over the years i have read a number of books that had i not been paid to write about them i would never have allowed in the house joseph hellers "something happened" nothing by the way did is one such book another is "ancient evenings" by norman mailer who may have written this long novel though it is hard to believe that he could have read it and still allowed it to be published i probably shouldnt bring any of this up but mr bayard holds that one of the best reasons for reading a book is that it allows you to talk about yourself "how to talk about books you havent read" is an amusing disquisition on what is required to establish cultural literacy in a comfortable way lightly laced with irony the book nonetheless raises such serious questions as what are our true motives for reading is there an objective way to read a book what do we retain from the books weve read mr bayard a professor of literature in paris and a practicing psychoanalyst relieves his readers of any self reproach they might feel about not having read all the books they are supposed to have read "only in accepting our non reading without shame " he writes "can we begin to take an interest in what is actually at stake which is not a book but a complex interpersonal situation of which the book is less the object than the consequence " although he doesnt say so straight out mr bayard does suggest that the well read man or woman like the perfect lover doesnt really exist some of us have read more books than others but everyone has failed to read something of significance not to worry mr bayard counsels just because one hasnt read a book doesnt mean that one cannot talk about it with the same confidence as someone who has and perhaps with greater acumen not having to get bogged down in messy details mr bayard doesnt mention samuel johnson who claimed rarely to have finished a book such were the powers of extrapolation of my friend edward shils the eminent sociologist that he could read a few paragraphs in a book and tell you what the authors politics were and whether his parents ate in their dining room or kitchen mr bayard says that he has never read "ulysses " which hasnt kept him from confidently discussing the book in his classrooms people with the most impressive claims to literary culture have failed to read books that are thought to be essential to the cultured person paul valery the great french poet never read proust though he wrote about him montaigne claimed to have forgotten not only much of what he read but also a good deal of what he himself wrote i myself not so long ago re read dostoevskys "the idiot" because i could remember so little from my first reading and yet i still cannot tell you anything about its plot of most books we retain shards from somerset maughams "the razors edge " i chiefly remember that the books hero one afternoon sat in a chair in his club and read the whole of william jamess "principles of psychology" in a single sitting what i wonder did he remember from it mr bayard argues that the gaps in our reading shouldnt distress us his thesis helps one own up to the fact that there are many books that one is supposed to admire but cannot my own list would include "lolita " robert musils "the man without qualities " the novels of hermann broch most of walter benjamin all of gunter grass then there are those writers who seem to have existed less to be read than to have had susan sontag write essays about them roland barthes w g sebald michel leiris to the not reading of books to reverse ecclesiastes there is no end as mr bayard notes one doesnt always have to read a book to grasp its value if certain critics for instance are enthusiastic about a book that is all i need to know i cannot count how much time the ecstatic endorsement of books on the part of john leonard by instantly putting me off reading them has saved me over the years authors like restaurants should perhaps be given a second but not a third chance having read one or two books by a writer who disappoints need one really read more "it should be the most normal of behaviors " mr bayard writes "to acknowledge that we havent read a book while nevertheless reserving the right to pass judgment on it " he speaks of "aggressive" nonreading which has been my relation to joan didions "the year of magical thinking " her best selling book about the death of her husband a work i would as lief cut off both my thumbs than read i recently assured two troubled widows who were reading the book not to let it throw them since the emotion in it was likely to be more literary than real discuss a book with someone else mr bayard notes and you are almost certain to undergo the disillusionment that "arises from the discovery of the unfathomable distance that separates us from others " so different are the things that people extract from books too true and further evidence that we take from books what we need and leave behind the rest along the same line mr bayard devotes a chapter to the disappointment authors feel when readers who praise their books reveal how ignorant they are of them i have myself been praised for stories and essays ive never even written it seemed good manners modestly to accept the praise the only escape from the prison house of culture it turns out is to arrive at a condition in which one does not care if other people think one is cultured or not "truth destined for others " mr bayard writes "is less important than truthfulness to ourselves something obtainable only by those who free themselves from the obligation to seem cultured which tyrannizes us from within and prevents us from being ourselves " a just and true statement the only problem is that one has to have read a great many books and to have acquired a reasonable amount of culture before one knows how true it is mr epstein is the author most recently of "in a cardboard belt essays personal literary and savage" houghton mifflin
