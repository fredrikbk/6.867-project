democrats hope to craft veto proof spending bill washington democrats abruptly changed course and agreed to a scaled back &# billion domestic spending package that they hope will better attract republican votes in the face of continued white house veto threats almost &# billion would still be added above president bushs budget request chiefly for education medical research and veterans health care but the door is reopened to allow mr bushs top priority the pentagon budget to advance free of the impasse over domestic spending house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis said he hoped both steps would help to win over republicans and bring the white house to the negotiating table but his abrupt swings back and forth caught even top democrats by surprise and reflect the level of confusion that has bedeviled the new majority in managing the appropriations process this fall a month after the oct beginning of the new fiscal year none of the annual spending bills have gone to mr bush most of the government remains dependent on a short term spending resolution due to expire nov while this keeps the government running agencies are effectively frozen at last years funding level and managers are hindered in planning hiring and contracting after the collapse of the budget process in under republican rule it means another year of uncertainty for cabinet departments the white house has seen a political opening and in recent days mr bush has been increasingly aggressive in portraying congress as flailing about at the nations expense in a speech yesterday he went beyond the budget debate to focus on pending national security legislation with the president comparing democratic leaders to those who ignored the rise of lenin and hitler in the last century house speaker nancy pelosi returned the fire "he stoops to a level that in my view is beneath the dignity of the office that he holds and i dont want to go there with him " she told reporters later in a separate interview she was even blunter "hes the flailer " she said of mr bush separate from the appropriations fight ms pelosi said she has signed off on another round of changes in a child health insurance bill in hopes of winning sufficient support among moderate republicans to override mr bushs veto but democrats remain frustrated by their inability to implement some of the changes in senate debate conservative republicans by raising procedural obstacles made it harder to implement the revisions as a result the child health bill cleared the senate last evening without the changes this sets up yet another veto confrontation in which the democrats have little chance of prevailing but ms pelosi said the talks would continue with swing republicans and she would be prepared to make a third attempt to pass the bill before congress goes home for the year senate republicans could raise procedural problems as well for the veterans and education bill now being readied but mr obey hopes that by breaking out the pentagon budget he has made it easier to send the bill to the president a veto seems certain but in shaping the bill mr obey sought to respect republican priorities such as abstinence education and a final compromise yesterday seeks to end the use of influenza vaccines containing potentially toxic thimerosal by the flu season
