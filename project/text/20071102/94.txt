the grassley visa tax congress has failed to pass immigration reform so industries that depend on foreign workers have already been left in the lurch but senator chuck grassley now wants to make things worse last week mr grassley the iowa republican slipped an amendment into a spending bill that would tax businesses that hire skilled immigrants an additional &# per visa to a total of &# each according to the national foundation for american policy this represents a &# billion tax increase over five years on some of americas fastest growing companies companies employing foreign professionals who are here on h b visas already pay &# per individual the fee was originally set at &# in but at least past increases have also included a rise in the number of available visas when mr grassley floated this tax back in april it would have been part of a senate bill that lifted the h b visa cap by and put in place an escalator provision that allowed market demand to determine future increases but the grassley tax proposed last week includes no such trade off leaving the h b visa cap of per year intact the need to increase this arbitrary quota if not eliminate it is clear this year the u s citizenship and immigration services received approximately applications for h bs on the first day they were available in addition to the hiring fee current law already requires h b professionals to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage or actual wage paid to americans in similar positions so its not as if u s businesses pursue foreign engineers computer scientists and the like because theyre cheaper to employ nor are these foreign workers overrunning the country and displacing americans in new h b professionals comprised percent of the labor force citing anecdotal evidence "people have called our office " a spokeswoman tells us senator grassley says the fee increase is necessary to combat abuse and fraud but the back wages owed to h b hires amounted to just &# million in down from &# million the previous year in a &# trillion economy those numbers are infinitesimal department of labor investigations reveal that some of violations are paperwork offenses and good faith misunderstandings the senator also maintains that his tax increase is needed to fund more federal programs for high achieving u s born students who are notoriously underrepresented in math and science leaving aside the dubious notion that the federal government doesnt spend enough money on education the high tech industry has already shelled out more than &# billion to fund scholarships over the past decade and thats not counting their other philanthropic efforts nor the state and local taxes these companies pay to support public education mr grassleys justifications notwithstanding the reality is that these skilled foreign nationals help u s companies compete globally and keep jobs and innovation inside the u s this is especially important when other countries are opening their doors to this human capital the european union which says its facing a shortage of some million skilled workers over the next two decades has announced plans to streamline its immigration process to attract foreign talent so while even european bureaucrats are wising up to the importance of attracting global talent to keep an economy competitive a republican senator is joining liberal protectionists to move the u s in the opposite direction go figure if congress cant see its way to fix our broken immigration system the least it can do is not drive more jobs offshore see related letter "letters to the editor investing in america making things worse" wsj nov see related letter "letters to the editor grassley is off the mark" wsj november
