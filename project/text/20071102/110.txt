weekend journal review television burnetts gold she was so utterly american " a canny observer notes in the "american masters" portrait "carol burnett a woman of character" monday p m et on pbs check local listings theres a powerful ring of truth in this perception and it rings forcefully throughout this hour and a half largely devoted to carol burnetts television comedy these were the sketches best described by one of the films other commentators as "gold gold gold " and so they were to the america that looked forward hungrily to those wonderful sequences with the imperturbably haughty dim witted secretary mrs wiggins those takeoffs on old movies the equally hilarious ones about mama and eunice with their disturbing dark edge that gold gold gold wasnt of course achieved alone as ms burnett and this film make perfectly clear there were those essential priceless collaborators vicki lawrence who played mama among other characters harvey korman a master of dead on parody and tim conway with this team the burnett show held television audiences in thrall for straight seasons from to when its star decided finally to quit while they were ahead her network variety show had been the first such success to be headed by a woman a performer whose immense warmth endeared her to audiences nearly as much as did the brazen brilliance of her comedy not for nothing did the producers of this film director kyra thompson include clips of so many of those question and answer exchanges between the star and the studio audience that used to open each show these may not have yielded much high comedy but they told a lot about the disposition of the shows star as week after week she parried and thrust her way through all sorts of strange personal questions and did it with evident relish one of the less bizarre audience queries came from a teenager who rose to say shed played the same role in a high school production of "once upon a mattress" that carol burnett had when it was a broadway hit and shed like to know now if ms burnett would sing one of the songs the girl and everyone else surely knew what would happen she was invited on stage for a duet the musical encounter was brief but long enough to cast a glow long enough too to remind us now of the unfeigned radiant engagement the master comic brought to these encounters with her public part of that deep engagement one can guess derived from gratitude for a success this child of two hopeless alcoholics once would have found difficult to imagine difficult but evidently not impossible it took only a little encouragement to turn her thoughts to new york and hope of an acting career her struggle and success are a familiar story very much in the american grain her journey took her from poverty and the single room she shared with her grandmother in a run down part of west hollywood to ultimate stardom and she was not disposed to forget while still quite young shed been given over to the care of her grandmother a loving protector but one like others in the family who dismissed the idea of a show business career in new york as "a pipe dream " fragments of embittered memory of this kind clearly color those inspired exchanges in the sketches about the tormented eunice and that endlessly disparaging mama character whose hectoring malice vicki lawrence refined to perfection still make no mistake the aim in the mama sketches is comedy and theyre hugely successful as such their persuasive atmosphere of misery rage and entrapment notwithstanding as for the rest of the burnett feast here it offers nothing but pure joy mingled perhaps with wonder at the still uncontrollable laughter some of these scenes provoke try ms burnett as starlet ohara floating proudly down the stairs at tara with her newly created gown made of drapes we can end the description here in the interests of that underprivileged sector of the population about to watch it for the first time for so many of ms burnetts admirers of course who have seen these sketches again and again reveled in their freedom and wit while choking with laughter it will feel always and forever like the first time nbcs " rock" thursdays p m et rewarded with the emmy for best comedy series its first year out seems to have begun its new season intact thats to say the writing remains sharp and as in the first season a slight aura of the unpredictable hangs reassuringly in the air a good part of that aura derives from the character of network chief jack donaghy played by alec baldwin with a perfect mix of sleaze and charm the characters strength is now such that the writers recently gave him material verging just a bit on the forbidden and outrageous which is to say satire with racial overtones just a bit goes a long way as far as the networks are concerned still there was jack a week ago carrying on in ghetto accents a variety of them in a scene in which hes supposed to be trying to cure the black comedian character tracy jordan of problems about the father he never had in his life not a brilliant comedic concept as it turned out but worth it all the same for that baldwin riff on the accents thanks to mr baldwin and creator tina fey who has worked her way into an increasingly strong character as liz lemon head writer of the fictional tv show and also to the magnetism of the thuggish tracy jordan played by tracy morgan " rock" seems set to continue on its entertaining way those looking for respite from political power struggles here at home may want to turn their attention abroad and consider "the deal " hbos strange though ultimately intriguing story of an alleged secret pact between tony blair former prime minister of britain and gordon brown the current one thursday p m et directed by stephen frears the drama traces the early strong friendship between these two labour party leaders to be gordon brown portrayed affectingly by david morrissey is a grimly earnest scot who has had his eye on the leadership of the party since the age of tony blair michael sheen its soon clear is to have the role of the heavy here as opposed to the unworldly brown blair is popular youthful and this portrayal suggests the sneakier and less principled of the two its the films contention that tony blair pressured gordon brown to step aside and let him have the leadership first its a lively enough drama written with flair all thats lacking is a compelling reason to believe the thesis the introduction announces that "most of what follows is true" which should be taken as warning of a lot of fiction dead ahead
