congress split on how to curb amt spread house pushes tax boost to offset lost revenue senate unlikely to follow washington the houses tax panel passed &# billion in tax increases hitting private equity managers and others a move designed to fund a measure halting the spread of the alternative minimum tax but much of the money comes from policies unlikely to become law this year amid differences between the house and senate raising questions about how congress will complete tax legislation widely viewed as essential among the proposals the senate is unlikely to take up one that would treat "carried interest " a slice of private equity managers profits now taxed at the capital gains rate as ordinary income taxed at rates of up to senate democrats said they too will advance legislation that prevents the amt from hitting millions more taxpayers this year and extends dozens of expiring tax breaks and many want to comply with pay go as a symbol of democrats promise to be more fiscally responsible than their republican predecessors pay go reinstated when democrats took over congress this year requires new tax breaks and spending programs to be offset with revenue increases or spending cuts however it will be difficult and perhaps impossible for democrats in the closely divided senate to get sufficient republican support for passing tax increases and loophole closers of the magnitude taken up in the house the bush administration is another hurdle treasury secretary henry paulson in a statement on the house bill said it contains tax increases "that hurt our economy" and make it "very difficult" to pass amt relief quickly rather than giving up on amt however senate democrats would be more likely to try to waive pay go rules which would require votes senate majority leader harry reid said he still wants to pay for the tax legislation "we are going to give amt relief and it should be paid for " the nevada democrat said the possibility that senators wont follow congresss pay go rules has put them at odds with house democrats "were talking about a train wreck " said rep charles rangel d n y the chairman of the house tax panel the amt a parallel income tax was created to prevent very wealthy people from avoiding taxes but it wasnt tied to inflation and is now set to hit millions more people this year many republicans dont think tax increases are needed to offset amt relief because the government never intended to collect the revenue sen charles grassley of iowa the top republican on the senate tax committee joining many other republicans and some democrats isnt inclined to support an increase in taxes on carried interest this year the proposal would also hit venture capital firms and some real estate deals "even if i decided today that it ought to be taxed as ordinary income im not sure in this environment with the subprime loans and all that stuff and the economy being a little shaky that i would want to make that change now " he said some provisions in the house bill show areas of common ground with the senate private equity firms that go public would no longer qualify to organize as partnerships a method that some such as blackstone group have used to avoid paying higher taxes as corporations firms that already have gone public would have two years under the house bill before the change would hit them in the senate mr grassley and finance committee chairman max baucus of montana have proposed a similar change though it would give more time at least five years and possibly more for firms to adjust another house proposal limiting the ability of hedge fund managers to defer taxes on their compensation by holding it overseas has uncertain chances in the senate but it echoes a proposal the senate passed earlier this year limiting certain tax deferred compensation plans used by executives the senate proposal was dropped in talks with the house but is expected to resurface this year
