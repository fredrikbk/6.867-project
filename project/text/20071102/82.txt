resolving the kurdish dilemma as president bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice prepare for next weeks crucial meetings with turkeys leaders about the attacks by kurdish pkk rebels they should look beyond crisis management to deal with the wider turkish kurdish agenda if they do it is possible that the political stalemate within iraq can begin to be broken as well broadening the agenda could make diplomacy easier iraqs responsible kurdish establishment is appealing to washington for support kurdish leaders like iraqi deputy prime minister barham salih see the u s as the indispensable player in resolving the crisis turkey has put aside anger over a recent congressional resolution on the armenian genocide it also looks to washington to advance its legitimate demand that the pkk threat in northern iraq be dealt with once and for all the problem is that while washington is relevant politically it will be tough to broker a deal that will meet turkish expectations the momentum in turkey towards a decisive military confrontation is strong so is the resistance in the kurdish region of iraq towards a crackdown on the pkk which is popular among kurds along both sides of the border mr bush and ms rice may be tempted to simply soothe tempers and focus on the pkk problem but all indications are that wont solve much and a turkish invasion even if limited to the qandil mountain stronghold of the pkk could have disastrous consequences it would destabilize the most successful part of iraq and further solidify kurdish nationalism rendering compromise over the flashpoint oil rich town of kirkuk even more difficult averting crisis in kurdistan requires dealing with the three most neuralgic issues the pkk oil and kirkuk turkey sees kurdish control of kirkuk and its oil as the precursor to a kurdistan independent from iraq which could in turn lead to the violent breakaway of turkeys kurdish region iraqi kurds see kirkuk as an inalienable piece of kurdish patrimony and a source of revenue producing oil and gas a comprehensive deal will take some time to negotiate but a signal from washington to finally deal with all these issues and make tradeoffs across all three could be the key to defusing the current crisis instead of simply delaying resolution of kirkuk as washington has asked the kurds to do so far the u s should table creative options like giving the town a "special status" under the iraqi constitution the constitutions wide federalism provisions permit making kirkuk its own region while at the same time guaranteeing full power sharing and property rights for its turkomen arab and other minorities while not achieving maximal kurdish aspirations to reclaim all of kirkuk under their control a special status would advance much of the kurdish agenda without crossing turkish red lines it would also stimulate much needed dialogue with kirkuks sizeable non kurdish minority roughly of the population as for oil the kurds have been a major obstacle to a comprehensive package on production and revenue sharing necessary for a political settlement in iraq as a whole in july a breakthrough seemed close but fell apart largely over kurdish concerns about their autonomy to enter into contracts unfettered by baghdad likewise the question of whether kirkuks oil and gas is from "current fields" subject to sharing with others in iraq or "new fields" possibly exempt from the same kind of sharing is another nettlesome question that has so far defied resolution up to now kurdish leaders have adroitly played their role as "kingmaker" in baghdad helping determine which shiite leader governs iraq in exchange for freedom to assert their demands on oil and kirkuk now these same kurdish leaders facing their most serious crisis since the u s invasion in might be more willing to listen to creative carefully crafted proposals from washington an oil deal addressing kurdish concerns about interference from baghdad while providing firm guarantees about production and revenue sharing is certainly possible and a breakthrough on oil could advance discussions on the other political questions progress on kirkuk might make possible a badly needed conversation in baghdad on political arrangements to accommodate the concerns of the capitals mixed populations such as helping people to relocate safely if they feel the need while acknowledging the reality as seen in kirkuk that the countrys demographics have been altered by war mr joseph is visiting scholar at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies mr ohanlon directs the "opportunity project" at the brookings institution
