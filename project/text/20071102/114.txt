weekend journal taste houses of worship people of the book s last month the reform movement the largest synagogue denomination in america began shipping its long awaited new prayer book "mishkan tfilah" to congregations more than two decades in the making "mishkan tfilah" literally "a dwelling for prayer" is billed by its editors as the first prayer book "of the people " and the people have definitely had a say in its production having tested out various incarnations at synagogues across the country and at several national conventions if "mishkan tfilah" is accepted as the standard prayer text in the movements congregations it could affect how more than a quarter of american jews pray "mishkan tfilah" replaces "gates of prayer " released in which in a nod to the movements ethos of personal choice contained different worship services from which individuals could choose the new book offers only one its principal innovation is its design a two page layout in which each prayer is accompanied by a translation from the hebrew a transliteration a commentary and a "spiritual reading" all aimed at appealing to multiple orientations within the context of a single service the architects of reform judaism in formally rejected the idea that jews are obligated to perform ritual observances like eating kosher food and keeping the sabbath over time it has fallen to individuals to heed their own conscience in deciding what and whether to observe today the movement is reaping the fruits of that decision reform judaism covers such a vast territory of theological conviction and religious practice it includes classical reform jews who still conduct sabbath services on sunday as well as a younger generation more open to traditions once shunned as inconsistent with the movements liberal theology that its sometimes hard to see what ties it all together the editors of "mishkan tfilah" hope the new book will keep the movements million adherents quite literally on the same page if the book does find broad acceptance it wont be for a lack of alternatives a number of new prayer books have been or are about to be released that taking a different tack from "mishkan tfilah " cater to diverse perspectives rather than joining them together under one rubric "shaarei simchah gates of joy " the first contemporary orthodox prayer book authored by women aims for gender inclusive language though within the limits imposed by orthodox jewish law at the jewish theological seminary in new york a rabbinical student is at work on a prayer book for "anusim" "forced ones" in hebrew descendants of th century spanish and portuguese jews who converted to escape the inquisition but continued to practice judaism in secret and next year congregation beth simchat torah a gay friendly synagogue in new york expects to publish an updated version of its own prayer book that does away with liturgy that they worry appears to privilege heterosexual marriage in the amidah prayer for example the new text references jacobs quasi wives bilhah and zilpah an acknowledgment of the role of partners of lesser legal status in child rearing the proliferation of jewish prayer books is itself nothing new prior to the printing press individual communities had no choice but to develop their own liturgies which reflected their particular religious and cultural sensibilities today with our raucous religious marketplace those sensibilities have multiplied and with them the desire for ever more particularistic forms of prayer around the country smaller prayer communities have sprung up to satisfy the diversifying needs of the religious market each committed to an ever more nuanced religious and spiritual outlook many experiment with new ways to balance the often conflicting demands of egalitarianism and tradition others place particular emphasis on music or the arts or on social justice or participatory worship the new prayer books reflect this fragmentation but seeing prayer books as a means to satisfy and thereby validate this diversity begs the question of whether the function of prayer is to affirm the individuals personal religious outlook perhaps worshipers should be encouraged to wrestle with traditional texts even problematic ones rather than edit them out of existence at the moment the former view is ascendant particularly in more liberal precincts but it wasnt always this way in the reform hebrew school where i used to teach some years ago the instructors encouraged students to see prayer as one of the great unifying forces in jewish life we justified the hours spent mastering the prayerbook whose broad structure has been essentially static since the second century as an exercise in kinship with jews world wide equipping students with knowledge such that they could visit any synagogue anywhere in the world and feel at home the very notion of a niche prayer book threatens that idea a concern that the editors of "mishkan tfilah" likely had in mind when deciding to consolidate services into one it is of course important that prayer resonate with a persons core beliefs but the cost of achieving such a resonance in an era when the colors of belief come in near infinite shades is high mr harris writes about religion for the jewish telegraphic agency
