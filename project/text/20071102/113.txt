weekend journal taste de gustibus living out the american dream one mortgage payment at a time if you look carefully at the staircase banister of the elephant hotel in somers n y you will notice a small cameo embedded there legend has it that it was placed on the handrail by the buildings th century owner hachaliah bailey of barnum and bailey fame as a subtle indication to all visitors that the building was paid for paying off a mortgage was no small feat then especially if you werent a wealthy farmer and cattle merchant like mr bailey in fact the word "mortgage" comes from french common law meaning "dead pledge " it was a fixed and absolute debt and put home ownership out of reach for most people though it was easier to accomplish here in the u s than in europe americans had homesteading programs and did not have to contend with noble landowners loath to relinquish their holdings only of americans owned their homes in and that number declined a bit during the depression today according to the census bureau about of us could put a cameo on our handrail these days when people have sent that last payment to the bank they celebrate by going on a long put off vacation or most commonly throwing a mortgage burning party having just bought our house in somers about six miles from the elephant hotel this year my husband and i are a long way from the cameo or any sort of celebration how long well im afraid i needed to pay better attention in high school algebra to figure that out because we have both a fixed rate term mortgage and a variable rate equity loan if your house costs x and it is y square feet in size what is your cost per square foot f you make a downpayment of your monthly mortgage payment is z but of that payment q is interest how much are you paying in principal p and how many square feet do you actually own at the end of each payment its enough to make me wake up in a cold sweat especially during this volatile credit market when that q number is all over the place i never know what the bill will say when i open it i used to believe that since we made a down payment at closing we own of the house outright for arguments sake lets say thats the dining room so when we wrote and mailed the monthly check i would take a moment to appreciate the roughly more square feet of home that actually belonged to us say a bit of the floor underneath the refrigerator but its recently become clear that my theory has a few holes in it should we default on our mortgage which please nice people at chase take note we have no intention of doing we dont get to keep the dining room and feet of kitchen the bank will take the whole kitchen and caboodle it was something of a shock the first time i actually worked out the math i knew wed be paying interest i just had no real conception that interest would constitute the vast majority of every payment we made i was blithely figuring that with our regular payments and a few extra when we could afford them wed have this mortgage thing done with well before our year term i have since been disabused of that notion but for all the uncertainty about payments we relish each of the additional square feet of home we seem to own each month and of course we appreciate that the bank allows us to act as if we already own the place letting us redecorate or make as much of a mess as we want to the house with the white picket fence is a part of the american dream for a reason having your own space even bought in increments is nothing short of bliss thirty years from now when weve mailed that last check and can safely occupy the last square feet of the attic i think well go a bit more dramatic than the banister cameo the bank note bonfire in the back yard is much more our speed ms lavoie is the arts graphics editor for the editorial page of the wall street journal correction a recent article "living out the american dream one mortgage payment at a time " taste page nov stated that hachaliah bailey was the partner of p t barnum in fact the famous circus was founded several decades after hachaliahs death by mr barnum and a man named james anthony bailey he was an acquaintance of hachaliahs nephew who as a young man took the bailey surname wsj nov
