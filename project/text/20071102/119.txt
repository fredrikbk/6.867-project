weekend journal review film epic american gangster stands up to mob genre scotts tight direction seinfelds bee movie aims low misses target frank lucas the s harlem drug lord and entrepreneur played by denzel washington in "american gangster " takes pride in many things but most of all in the quality of his merchandise a southeast asian heroin as pure in its fashion as ivory soap thats a reflection of the drug trades lethal paradox the better the product the worse the devastation a different paradox conditions our response to the film which was directed by ridley scott from a script by steven zaillian and co stars russell crowe as an unstoppable cop on lucass case the better it gets and the drama grows in power over its quasi epic course of minutes the more it brings to mind the truly great gangster films of american movie history starting with "the godfather" and extending back to such landmarks as "the public enemy" and "scarface " yet these recollections are part of the enjoyment they lend stature by association to the impressive product on the screen "american gangster" is based on a true story a "true juggernaut success story " according to the publicity frank lucas who is still with us was in fact a rags to riches businessman who took over what had been a mafia monopoly and richie roberts the laconic womanizer played by russell crowe was the detective and later prosecutor who brought the kingpin down truth inevitably turns fictional when a character as murderous as lucas is portrayed by the buoyant and dashing denzel washington but not as fictional or romanticized as you might think in the grand tradition of gangster sociopaths this extravagant black godfather franks chinchilla coat helps lead to his undoing can go from effortless seducer to stone killer in one beat of whatever serves as his heart lucas dominates the action though thats not to suggest that mr crowe is overmatched this formidable actor has never been overmatched except by a few bad scripts he plays richie as a perpetual high school kid who happens to be fiercely intelligent its a big performance and a beautifully modulated one i thought of wallace beery that makes the role seem more substantial than it is during long stretches of the narrative richies main function is to make shrewd assumptions about lucass m o which involves smuggling vast quantities of heroin into the united states inside caskets containing the remains of soldiers killed in vietnam one of those assumptions leads to a thrilling sequence at a stateside air base from the very first scene an attention grabber that does its work shockingly well mr scott and his colleagues most notably the cinematographer harris savides and the production designer arthur max provide a densely populated lavishly detailed view of the period the direction is impeccable whether in the sweeping action of the set pieces or in the department of small talk and murmurs the supporting cast includes chiwetel ejiofor cuba gooding jr josh brolin ted levine armand assante and an affecting if overwrought ruby dee mr zaillians script has more on its mind than cat and mouse or mongoose and cobra games both frank and richie are by their own lights men of honor bound by their own codes the irony of those parallels is obvious but still interesting both go to great lengths to assemble trustworthy teams and in a reach for more meaning the film draws a parallel between franks downfall and the fall of saigon thats not such a reach in a literal sense since his supply channel depends on the vietnam war in the end though the success of "american gangster" doesnt flow from the originality of its ideas or its bid for epic status as much as from its craftsmanship and confident professionalism its a great big gangster film and a good one bee movie bee movie" isnt a b movie its a z movie as in dizmal this animated feature might have been tolerable though for what demographic im not sure if its hyper vocal star jerry seinfeld had chosen to drone instead he delivers every line every stupid bee joke that he and his cronies could cook up with a pounding punishing triumphalism that recalls not the seinfeld of "seinfeld" but milton berle on a really bad night as you may have gleaned from a publicity campaign thats been slightly less invasive than the influenza pandemic of mr seinfelds character a bee named barry b benson has just graduated from college and cant face a life of making honey the storys borrowings from "the graduate" include a swimming pool escaping the hive he goes out into the world as a pollen jock a member of an airborne squadron that sprinkles a dreamworks version of disney dust on central park and falls in love with vanessa bloome a florist voiced by renee zellweger and why not since barry can talk his problem and ours is that he cant stop talking and her boyfriend ken is monstrously dislikable vanessa is no bargain either at least for a while why not indeed whats the harm if one of the most successful comics in show biz history business gets to buzz around in a would be comic fable about the bees and the bees the graphics are pretty enough a vision of the hive thats somewhere between richard scarry and rube goldberg and the script is not after all content free once barry discovers that people eat honey he sues the human race for exploiting his species treasure its just that the movie aims so low and still manages to miss all distinction at one point in barrys honey trial an exasperated defense lawyer asks "how do we know this talking bee isnt some kind of hollywood wizardry " would that wizards had left their mark this is hollywood hackery dvd tip theres no more eloquent visualization of childhoods mystery than victor erices "the spirit of the beehive" one of the most important films ever made in spain in the key scene a castilian village child named ana played by year old ana torrent watches james whales "frankenstein" at a traveling cinema then takes the film as a touchstone with which to interpret subsequent events in her life luis cuadrados cinematography is as it was meant to be beautiful beyond words
