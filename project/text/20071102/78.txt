mukasey and the democrats democrats welcomed michael mukasey as a "consensus choice" for attorney general only weeks ago but incredibly his confirmation is now an open question the judges supposed offense is that he has refused to declare "illegal" a single interrogation technique that the cia has used on rare occasions against mass murderers all of the democratic presidential candidates have come out against the distinguished judge and democrats on the judiciary committee appear ready to block his nomination from even reaching the senate floor this is remarkable not for what it says about judge mukasey but for what it reveals about democrats and the war on terror theyd disqualify a man of impeccable judicial temperament and credentials merely because hes willing to give u s interrogators the benefit of the legal doubt before he has top secret clearance could there be a clearer demonstration of why voters dont trust democrats with national security in the war against al qaeda interrogation and electronic surveillance are our most effective weapons yet democrats have for years waged a guerrilla war against both of these tools trying to impose procedural and legal limits that can only reduce their effectiveness judge mukasey is merely collateral damage in this larger effort their immediate political figleaf is that the judge wont pre emptively declare "waterboarding " or simulated drowning to be illegal mr mukasey has declared that torture "violates the law and the constitution and the president may not authorize it as he is no less bound by constitutional restrictions than any other government official " but he refuses to say whether waterboarding meets the statutory definition of torture based only on "hypothetical facts and circumstances " this seems fair enough given that he has not been briefed on any of the classified interrogation details as top congressional democrats have been it also seems wise given that if confirmed he will have to read and consider legal memoranda already approved by justice department officials on the same subject how can he declare himself before hes read them most important his discretion serves the american people by helping to keep our enemies in some doubt about what they will face if they are captured the reason that cia interrogation methods are kept highly classified is so that enemy combatants cant use them as a resistance manual if terrorists know whats coming they can prepare for it beforehand and better resist whats really at stake here is whether u s officials are going to have the basic tools required to extract information from americas enemies as cia director michael hayden pointed out in a speech this week "the best sources of information on terrorists and their plans are the terrorists themselves " mr hayden added that fewer than captives "have gone through the interrogation program since it began in with the capture of abu zubaydah " a top aide to osama bin laden and plotter yet those interrogations have generated "thousands of intelligence reports " more than of the human intelligence that makes it into formal u s intelligence estimates "is based on detainee information " as for waterboarding it is mostly a political sideshow the cias view seems to be that some version of waterboarding is effective in breaking especially tough cases quickly press reports say it has been used only against a few high value al qaeda operatives like khalid sheikh mohammed and zebaydah as former cia director george tenet points out in his book "at the center of the storm " ksm and others never would have talked about "imminent threats against the american people" had they not been dealt with harshly "i believe that none of these success would have happened if we had had to treat ksm like a white collar criminal " he writes if democrats want to strip the cia of this tool then they ought to legislate it openly not make law under the table through the confirmation process congress has twice had the chance to ban or criminalize waterboarding but it declined to do so in both the detainee treatment act of and the military commissions act of and not for lack of trying in debating the military commissions act ted kennedy offered a detailed amendment that specifically prohibited waterboarding as well as other coercive interrogation methods it lost on the senate floor the political calculation here is clear democrats want to pander to the antiwar war base of their party that doubts we are even in a war and in any case wants to treat terrorist detainees no differently than a common street felon yet they dont want to be responsible for passing a statute that blocks cia attempts to gain information that could prevent an imminent terrorist attack so they dodge and employ ambiguous language that the justice department must then interpret and then they try to run judge mukasey out of town because he wont do their political work for them in their less cynical moments some democrats will admit that a technique like waterboarding may prevent a future attack in extreme cases "we ought to be reasonable about this " said one senator at a hearing in "i think there are probably very few people in this room or in america who would say that torture should never ever be used particularly if thousands of lives are at stake it is easy to sit back in the armchair and say that torture can never be used but when you are in the foxhole it is a very different deal and i respect i think we all respect the fact that the president is in the foxhole every day " he added that all of this should be public in order to have "legitimacy " that senator new york democrat chuck schumer who recommended judge mukasey for attorney general in the first place now mr schumer wont say one way or the other whether the judge has his support if the democrats reject mr mukasey it will tell us they simply arent serious about the realities of the war on terror
