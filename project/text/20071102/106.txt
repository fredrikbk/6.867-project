weekend journal hollywoods quality glut falls films fizzled can prestige movies save the holidays peter sanders and sam schechner report as the home stretch of the movie year arrives hollywood has rarely been more in need of a holiday pick me up film and tv screenwriters may be about to go on strike after months of bitter fruitless negotiations and a fall movie season that was supposed to deliver both healthy box office returns and a pack of oscar contenders has fallen short on both counts thats why a lot is on the line as the holiday film season arrives today with a big one two punch the denzel washington russell crowe epic "american gangster" and jerry seinfelds animated "bee movie " hollywood is eager to restart a selling engine that stalled out around the middle of the summer with tepid performers like the "invasion of the body snatchers" remake "the invasion " and never got back on track and the academy awards race which usually has produced one or two sure bets for best picture by now is instead wide open the scramble for both commercial and oscar gold will proceed on two fronts with a handful of films seeking to prove themselves in both categories in the prestige department producers and executives at studios specialty arms say that this holiday season is more packed with award seeking fare than usual the slate includes not just big name dramas like "gangster " but also several films with literary pedigrees "the kite runner" and "atonement" and the latest offerings from major filmmakers like mike nichols "charlie wilsons war" joel and ethan coen "no country for old men" and francis ford coppola "youth without youth" "there definitely isnt a front runner " says miramax films president daniel battsek of the awards race "thats a good thing and it also makes us that much twitchier " miramax will release the coen brothers picture domestically on nov the box office race meanwhile includes dreamworks animations "bee movie " which mr seinfeld labored over for four years and warner bros sci fi flick "i am legend " starring will smith living in a post apocalyptic new york also on the fantasy front theres new line cinemas &# million computer graphics heavy "the golden compass " based on philip pullmans "his dark materials" fantasy novels and "beowulf " which uses performance capture technology to recreate angelina jolie and other actors in a virtual world finally vince vaughn stars as santas brother in "fred claus " many of these films hope to be the foundation for franchises that can generate sequels for years to come the drive to make these films click with audiences is especially intense after the industrys forgettable fall fueled by the private equity financing that has poured into the movie business over the past couple of years too many films were released over the past few months this year films opened at or more theaters in september and october according to media by numbers llc a box office tracking firm in encino calif compared with in that period five years ago the unhappy result the crowded field led to shorter time frames for films to germinate in the marketplace and build buzz preventing most movies from catching on in the public discussion even films that generated positive press or good word of mouth on the fall festival circuit like sean penns "into the wild" and george clooneys "michael clayton" fared only marginally meanwhile movies tackling issues surrounding the political climate and the iraq war failed to gain traction or widespread box office success writer director paul haggiss "in the valley of elah " starring tommy lee jones and charlize theron has brought in only &# million in ticket sales since it opened sept in contrast mr haggiss oscar winning film "crash " took in &# million in its first six weeks in its first two weeks new line cinemas "rendition " with reese witherspoon and jake gyllenhaal has raked in about &# million other movies including touted projects like "elizabeth the golden age" and "the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford" have done poorly the latter film which opened sept has sold just &# million in tickets so far the bad news is that the holiday release schedule offers precious little relief from these market dynamics viacom inc s paramount vantage had such a full slate this fall that it opted to shift the u s release of the coen brothers"no country for old men" to miramax which co financed the film rather than give up a chance to open in autumn the coen thriller will open opposite the robert redford directed "lions for lambs " which stars tom cruise and meryl streep and the comedy "fred claus " despite the crowded landscape studios usually cant resist slotting a movie into the last few weeks of the year if they think theyve got the goods to compete in the oscar race "atonement " a drama that stars keira knightley and is based on the ian mcewan novel could have been ready to release this past spring but focus features decided to release the movie in december in part because the studio "felt it could feature well in award season " says tim bevan one of the films producers paramount vantage president john lesher says that with so many so called prestige movies opening nothing is a sure bet "its survival of the fittest " he says
