las vegas goes all out to attract gay travelers las vegas on a recent night at the palms resort and casino here young men in fitted shirts and an abundance of hair gel clamored to get into a playboy club party featuring female card dealers in bunny costumes steps away at another club hundreds of shirtless men crowded a roaring dance floor at party billed as a "non stop weekend of sensual sizzle and decadence" for the gay community the juxtaposition of such divergent groups is likely to become more common as the gambling mecca after years of ignoring the gay and lesbian market courts it with vigor major properties on the las vegas strip are now offering lavish commitment ceremonies to same sex couples though same sex marriage is illegal in nevada as well as special hotel and entertainment packages geared specifically toward gay and lesbian travelers some resorts have mandated sensitivity programs to teach employees how to make gay and lesbian travelers feel welcome las vegas began courting the gay community a few years ago as part of a broader effort to target a range of minority audiences but the gay targeted campaign intensified as casino commissioned market studies showed the gay and lesbian travel market to be among the most lucrative according to research from community marketing inc a gay and lesbian market research company gay and lesbian travel accounts for &# billion of the overall u s travel market harrahs entertainment inc started marketing to the gay and lesbian community months ago after research showed gay men spend an average of more than their straight counterparts when traveling "that was a key statistic that caught our attention " says michael weaver vice president of marketing for ballys paris las vegas and the rio all owned by harrahs now vegas casinos clubs hotels and spas are marketing themselves as "gay friendly " with ad campaigns in gay media such as outtraveler and advocate magazines and cable channel logo featuring images of same sex couples holding hands at romantic dinners and checking into hotel rooms together the fight for gay and lesbian tourists also reflects a major shift in vegas culture as the casino industry continues to remake itself into an upscale luxury destination with an ever growing menu of pricey gourmet restaurants spas and opulent hotels the citys hotel supply is expected to grow each year through according to a bear stearns analysis "vegas has come to realize and respect the power of the gay and lesbian dollar " says john dalessandro the former executive director of the international gay and lesbian travel association "they want folks who can afford the expensive shows and restaurants i think they looked at these demographics and realized its a dream market and we have to fight for it " while vegas has never shunned gay and lesbian travelers it has never offered them much either until two years ago when the nightclub krave became the first gay club to open on the strip gay tourists looking for convivial company were relegated to an off strip corner of the city known for its small cluster of gay bars in the forward of steve friesss "gay vegas a guide to the other side of sin city " published in august the author jokes that when he first told people he was writing a book on gay vegas the typical response was that it was going to be a very short book since then the landscape has changed dramatically he says "it really did happen overnight " says mr friess who committed to his partner in a ceremony at the palms in march commitment ceremonies are offered by mgm mirage at several of its properties part of an aggressive marketing campaign begun last year "to communicate a welcome message to potential lesbian gay bisexual and transgender customers " according to an mgm mirage marketing synopsis in one advertisement for the chapel at luxor the manicured hands of two women cut a wedding cake together the tagline reads "declare your love for each other loud and proud " "as we learn more and more about the travel trends of the gay and lesbian market we are very excited about our brands were learning its a very strong market " says mgm mirages vice president of marketing chuck bowling the casino commissioned research also showed that most gay tourists in vegas are couples harrahs decided that paris las vegas its romance themed property was best suited to market to gay couples mr weaver the companys marketing vice president says the next step was preparing employees if guests ask paris employees where to find gay bars employees are ready with a brochure on gay friendly spots reception clerks have been instructed not to assume two men checking into a room with one bed must have made a mistake in the reservation its a small detail mr weaver says but an important one "for a lot of gay travelers the moment of checking in is a bit of a moment of truth it is one of the key moments when you realize oh will i be accepted or will i be actually welcome " says mr weaver who is openly gay the hotel now has a web site dedicated specifically to gay travelers www gayparislasvegas com which it uses to attract and track gay and lesbian guests booking at the hotel the web site features a video playing romantic music as a camera pans over two mens razors two bottles of aftershave and two champagne glasses with a note that reads "after after shave " the site touts paris as "the ultimate destination for gays and lesbians " but mr weaver says the hotel was careful not to alienate the general market and from the beginning resisted remaking the property into a "gay hotel " instead he says the company focused on marketing its wide range of attractions still gay advocates and tourism experts arent predicting that las vegas will abandon its strip club and bachelor party roots discretion they say will probably be the watchword for some time to come as mr friess puts it "i just dont know that its a good idea to be holding hands at the nascar cafe or margaritaville "
