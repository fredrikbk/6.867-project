big oils profits may have peaked amid high price of crude exxon rivals are pressed by margins costs nations even as oil prices continue their climb profits for western oil companies appear to have peaked for the moment as underscored by a surprisingly weak earnings report from exxon mobil corp the reasons include aggressive governments that are grabbing a bigger slice of the oil pie as well market dynamics that are somewhat sheltering consumers in the u s and elsewhere from the full effect of oils rise exxon said its profits slid in the third quarter exxon the largest nonstate controlled oil company in the world is hardly in the poorhouse it made &# billion in just three months still one of the most profitable quarters in u s corporate history but the news drove down exxons stock contributing to a decline in the dow jones industrial average other oil companies including bp plc and conocophillips reported falling profits last month until recently the companies were able to achieve significant profit margins when they turned crude oil into gasoline and other products for the end user outages earlier this year crimped supplies and sent fuel prices soaring at a faster rate than oil but the worlds refineries now are running closer to their full capacity adding more supplies of fuels like gasoline to the market "the secret ingredient of record profits was refining and thats gone away " said paul sankey an analyst at deutsche bank "weve entered a phase where the higher the crude price the lower the refining margin " this was the second consecutive quarter that exxons results fell below expectations following a string of record profits in the fourth quarter of and throughout crude oil prices have risen more than this year although the benchmark crude oil futures price fell &# or to &# per barrel yesterday on the new york mercantile exchange normally the rise in prices would be good for western oil majors which pump tens of millions of barrels out of the ground every year that they can now sell for more money but the upheaval in the oil market has unleashed a series of challenges oil field costs have risen steeply as rigs steel and skilled personnel are in high demand producing countries are demanding a bigger cut of profits sometimes by jacking up taxes and other times by using political pressure to expand the states ownership of projects russia recently raised its already hefty oil export duty which combined with other levies boosted the states marginal tax take to almost cents on the dollar this has particularly affected london based bp which has more exposure than its peers to russia and to other countries where tax rates are so high it derives limited benefit from red hot crude prices in the past two weeks the provincial government of alberta raised royalties for oil sands deposits and the u s raised royalties for future gulf of mexico lease sales whats more exxon and its peers are finding it hard to boost production in response to higher prices exxon said its production of oil and gas fell from a year earlier that is partly because exxon was booted out of venezuela after refusing to modify its contract so the government could take a majority stake but exxon was also affected by oil production contracts in western africa one of the few bright spots for western oil companies in recent years the contracts contain provisions that as oil prices rise the companies can claim fewer barrels exxon is getting less oil there this quarter versus the year ago period "under a production sharing agreement if you incur &# of costs and the oil price is &# you get one barrel of oil " said pedro van meurs who advises oil producing countries on their contracts with oil companies "but if you incur &# and the oil price is &# you only get a quarter of a barrel " exxon mobil did a little better than royal dutch shell plc and bp the second and third largest nonstate controlled oil companies respectively both reported a drop in output in the third quarter compared with the falloff could accelerate with access to most of the worlds largest resources now off limits to those companies known as international oil companies or iocs as opposed to national oil companies like state controlled saudi aramco they are finding it harder to replace oil reserves "look at the top five iocs reserve replacement ratios over the last five years compared to the oil price theres a huge decline " said fatih birol chief economist at the international energy agency the energy watchdog based in paris perhaps the most challenging factor is that operating expenses are rising faster than the price of oil exxons third quarter revenue rose from a year earlier to a record &# billion but its costs rose to &# billion the results show the high standards to which the irving texas company is being held its profit one of the best quarters ever by a public u s company was down from the &# billion profit a year earlier separately the associated press reported that the alabama supreme court threw out nearly all of a record &# billion verdict the state government won against exxon mobil in a dispute over natural gas royalties in an decision the states highest court awarded alabama &# million in compensatory damages the court threw out all punitive damages jere beasley one of the states attorneys said the state likely will ask the court to reconsider
