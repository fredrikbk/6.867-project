a failed deal at acs sets off a board brawl independent directors receive blunt demand resign immediately in the restrained world of americas corporate boardrooms the letter sent earlier this week to five independent directors of affiliated computer services inc was the equivalent of a back alley smackdown "i am writing on behalf of acs to demand your immediate resignations from the board of directors of acs because of your numerous and egregious breaches of fiduciary duties and other improper conduct " read the letter sent tuesday by lawyers for acs a dallas computer outsourcing company the wall street journal reviewed the letter acs chairman darwin deason a flamboyant entrepreneur who built the company teamed up with cerberus capital management lp during the buyout frenzy earlier this year to take the company private some investors objected early to the &# billion proposal reasoning that the board could get a more lucrative offer but such a bid never materialized and earlier this week cerberus pulled its offer citing turmoil in credit markets the clash highlights how the credit crunch is fraying nerves across the corporate landscape as hoped for deals go sour and it reveals the fraught dynamics created inside boardrooms when insiders try to take public companies under private ownership acs management along with some of its biggest shareholders including oppenheimer funds blamed the independent directors for allowing the deal to slip out of their hands by refusing to set a vote on the bid before pursuing alternatives the directors say they had a duty to look for other potential bidders given that cerberuss proposed deal included the participation of acss chief insider company founder mr deason who controls of its shares and still exerts strong influence "in years of trying to track these kind of events i cant say ive come across such an example" of a conflict between board and management said john mcconnell a professor of management at purdue university the dispute is all the more extraordinary given the close even cozy relations mr deason once enjoyed with a number of the independent directors robert b holland iii j livingston kosberg frank a rossi dennis mccuistion and joseph p oneill several of them enjoyed business or personal ties with mr deason in past years those relations frayed last year amid federal investigations into alleged manipulations of the companys stock options an internal board investigation concluded two senior executives as well as a third executive who had left acs for unrelated reasons were closely involved in stock options manipulation at the company federal investigations are continuing after the independent directors learned that senior management hadnt been candid with investors about the gravity of the options problems they demanded that the chief executive and chief financial officer leave their posts according to a person close to the independent directors mr deason initially balked at such a move this person says but relented and the two officers resigned relations between mr deason and the board were never the same the person says a person close to mr deason agreed that relations had chilled since the options investigations but said the fault lay with the independent directors who adopted a bunker mentality and stopped communicating effectively the six page letter sent tuesday sparked a vitriolic back and forth between mr deason and the directors before erupting publicly yesterday afternoon the confrontation began tuesday during a six hour board meeting when mr deason demanded the directors resign immediately he threatened to nominate a new slate of independent directors for election at the next shareholder meeting in may if they refused according to people close to the independent directors he also said he would issue a news release accusing them of neglecting their duties if they didnt comply by yesterday these people said a spokesman for mr deason said no threats were made despite the heated exchange tuesday night the two sides agreed by unanimous vote of the board not to make any public statements until the boards next meeting yesterday at noon according to a person involved in the talks wednesday lawyers for both sides negotiated the details of separation agreements for the five directors and believed they had reached a consensus the person says but that agreement was blown apart when the directors issued their sharply worded retort to acss letter yesterday in a separate letter issued publicly yesterday mr deason said the board "has lost shareholder trust due to its failure to permit the shareholders to vote on the cerberus offer and its failure to explain its actions and directly respond to shareholder comments to date " the directors responded in their own sharply worded letter "your ultimatum resign in one hour or i will go to the press and smear your reputations was a remarkable piece of bullying and thuggery and it almost worked " the five directors said they would be willing to resign but only after vetting their successors late yesterday the independent directors filed a lawsuit against mr deason and other acs executives in delaware chancery court asking for a declaratory judgment that they havent breached their fiduciary duties the dispute dates to march when cerberus proposed to acquire the company together with mr deason for a price that would eventually rise to &# a share the agreement included a six month exclusivity clause between cerberus and mr deason the independent directors felt the exclusivity arrangement negotiated by mr deason would "chill the interest of potential competing bidders " according to their lawyers at the same time the directors didnt want to sign off on a cerberus deal without soliciting other offers mr deason countered that the company had searched for another bidder for five months prior to striking an arrangement with cerberus and that no competing offers had emerged moreover his exclusivity arrangement with cerberus would have ended once the board signed off on the proposal allowing other bidders to come in such debate delayed the process for months in june cerberus agreed to grant a two month waiver to its exclusivity arrangement a number of parties expressed interest in acs before and after the waiver including unisys corp computer sciences corp and accenture ltd people familiar with the matter say unisys indicated it could pay &# a share these people say yet the committee conducting the search for the board didnt produce any firm offers and the waiver expired one of the most serious allegations acs leveled against the independent directors is that they gave a competitor access to company secrets during discussions with unisys according to people close to acs a spokesman for the special committee says that the directors didnt do anything improper and that the information provided to unisys was "standard and customary " throughout the summer mr deason was eager to have the committee approve the cerberus deal and search for other potential partners the advantage of that approach people familiar with his thinking say would have been to lock in a deal for shareholders if the committee succeeded in getting a richer offer acs would have been obliged to pay a breakup fee to cerberus equal to of the deal total but some deal would have been in place "if the transaction were in fact fair whatever that means the board was not functioning properly if the proposal were not fair arguably the independent directors were functioning properly given how serious they were taking concerns about insider dealings " said prof mcconnell of purdue "fair has got to be measured against the next best alternative "
