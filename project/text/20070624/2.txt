bond yields jump but fed can sit tight while bond yields have recently jumped investors shouldnt expect the federal reserve to change its short term interest rate at its meeting this week or at any time soon fed policy makers gather wednesday and thursday amid a very different bond market environment than at the time of their last meeting in early may longterm treasury bond yields have shot up from to those bond yields partly reflect stronger than expected economic growth which has erased expectations that the fed would soon trim its short term interest rate technically the fed sets a target for the fed funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks with higher bond yields the fed now also has less reason to raise its target rate thats because businesses and consumers face higher borrowing costs which are likely to produce slower growth ahead in effect the bond market is doing some of the feds job of keeping total spending in the economy and thus inflation pressure within the economys normal capacity meanwhile higher yields are clearly rattling stock investors last week the dow jones industrial average tumbled and the nasdaq composite index dropped those declines trimmed year to date advances to for both benchmarks going forward higher yields could mean investors have a tougher time making money on stocks especially riskier types there are several reasons longterm rates have risen just a few months ago investors seemed convinced that falling housing demand would send the economy into a downturn forcing the fed to cut short term interest rates several times since then those expectations have been almost wiped out by data that show the economy bouncing back in the second quarter improving manufacturing output and healthy job growth higher u s yields also reflect a pickup in foreign growth and inflation pressure central banks in europe the united kingdom canada sweden switzerland and new zealand have raised interest rates or threatened to do so that has sent bond yields higher in most foreign markets with world capital markets now so closely integrated higher rates overseas often translate into higher borrowing costs in the u s as well in addition lewis alexander chief economist at citigroup says there are signs that the "global saving glut" that fed chairman ben bernanke has credited for holding down long term interest rates may be lifting "you are seeing in some parts of the world a decline in excess savings over investment most notably in the middle east and russia " another factor may be that china has shown signs of shifting its massive foreign exchange reserves from u s treasury bonds to riskier assets such as an investment in last weeks initial public offering of blackstone group so just as michigans economy may suffer when strong growth in california drives up u s interest rates the u s is paying the price in higher long term rates for stronger growth outside its borders higher long term rates are not principally "reflective of stronger aggregate demand in the u s it is in part a reflection of these forces from abroad " says mr alexander of citigroup because of the higher yields and thus higher borrowing costs mr alexander has trimmed his u s growth forecast for both the second half of this year and all of next year to an annual rate of higher long term rates could be especially troublesome for the housing market which is already suffering from an overhang of unsold homes and a withdrawal of credit to lower income "subprime" borrowers mr alexander figures u s growth will be more driven by exports and less by housing and other interest sensitive sectors another factor that might be driving up long term rates is that investors are becoming more riskaverse for the last few years investors have been as willing to lend money for years as they have for one year traditionally investors demanded higher interest rates to lend money for longer periods but recently some shortterm rates actually topped longterm rates that remarkably low "term premium" has puzzled experts including at the fed it may be that lenders are now a little less willing to be so poorly compensated for lending for long periods and thus the term premium has risen indications that inflation excluding energy and food prices is headed lower give the fed little reason to raise rates inflation fell from over early last year to below last fall and has since rebounded to reflecting the gyrations of energy prices but excluding energy and food "core" inflation has been more stable by the feds preferred price index core inflation probably edged down to in may just inside the to "comfort zone" of many fed officials this heartens fed officials even those that dont agree with that comfort zone and they may acknowledge the improvement with tweaks to their statement this week still fed officials fret that the low unemployment rate could be a sign of an economy operating close to or above its normal capacity inflation could easily move back up above over the next year if the economy improves therefore they are likely to continue to cite their concerns about inflation as the main driver of interest rate decisions from an investment perspective higher bond yields dont only crimp corporate profits by themselves they also make bonds a more attractive alternative to stocks jeff knight chief investment officer for global asset allocation at fund company putnam investments says low bond yields fueled investor demand for all sorts of risky assets "nearly all asset classes have been in a bull market for the last four and a half years " now that yields are rising all asset classes treasury bonds corporate bonds u s and foreign stocks could struggle he predicts the u s stock market will remain near current levels for the rest of the year he also predicts that as investors become more risk averse they will prefer u s to emergingmarket stocks and large stocks to small ones "wed expect leadership to shift back to the more conservative side " he says email forum sunday wsj com
