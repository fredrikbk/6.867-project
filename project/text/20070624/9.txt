love &amp money extracurricular expenses start cheap we all hate to skimp on our children thats the impression ive been getting lately as i watch parents shop for the gear their kids need to participate in extracurricular activities be it soccer or lacrosse dance or band parents particularly those going through it for the first time seem eager to lay down large sums of money for the best equipment their dollars can buy i understand the sentiments only the best for my budding little star but it seems to me that parents lost in our own vicarious field of dreams are oblivious to a key factor in this financial calculation that our budding little stars interest may have a shelf life of weeks if not days and then what as i watched parents spending illogically on ballet and tap shoes recently i got to wondering about whom these expenses really benefit the kids or the parents does a child who has never taken a dance class never played soccer never picked up a baseball really need the best gear available when as a parent do you commit to spending a lot of money on an extracurricular endeavor and when do you go cheap recognizing that you might just be wasting your money to begin with a couple of weeks ago our daughter soon to be four years old registered for her first dance class to outfit her with the proper attire my wife amy and i last weekend stopped by a boutique that sells the shoes and tutus that girls need for dance lessons not certain whether our little ballerina will actually like dancing amy opted for the low end accoutrements some utilitarian tap and ballet shoes and a single pair of tights she spent all of &# stunning to me though were the moms who were outfitting their little princesses in the best of everything dropping a couple hundred dollars on their wannabe dancers these girls hadnt yet performed their first arabesque yet theyll show up in class on day one decked out like a pro does that really matter to these girls or does it matter to mom no doubt this is as much an emotional issue for parents as it is a financial one on the one hand you want to give your kids every opportunity to find some activity they love and you cant help but buy into the belief that it really is the equipment that will make all the difference in excelling on the field or court or dance floor moreover do you really want your kid going on the field or the dance floor or the court looking second rate compared with his or her peers on the other hand theres also common sense just because you want your child to be a musical prodigy doesnt mean your child gives two hoots about the &# you blew on a professional trumpet a trumpet is a trumpet when theyve never even put one to their lips whats more it doesnt have to be expensive equipment to add up even the small necessities begin to pinch when youre regularly dumping money into sports teams and various types of lessons just so your child gets a taste of a bunch of different opportunities a friend on the east coast has a &# package of unopened lacrosse balls sitting in his house right now his preteen daughter signed up for lacrosse a sport that i can tell you from my collegiate experiences is expensive basically my friend says he was several hundred dollars into the game before his daughter even hit the field and then she left the field after playing for just two weeks while thats money he knows he threw away he sees the cost as a learning experience for his little girl "i wish she had played for more than a couple of weeks " he says "but is it such a bad thing to spend &# to find out if your kid has a passion about something " tara a friend in philadelphia says she "invested a fair amount of money" in horse riding lessons for her then year old daughter buying new riding boots jodhpurs helmet and saddle "i knew she loved horses and would like riding " tara says "so i felt like it was a worthwhile investment in terms of safety and long term use " except the circumstances changed the lessons had to be rescheduled school and other interests intervened and tara was left with &# of riding gear her daughter didnt need but tara has also seen the flip side she bought a cheap pair of ballet shoes for her daughter who wanted to quit the class soon after starting it even though she said she liked the class her teacher and her friends "she finally told me the shoes hurt her feet " tara says "we went and picked out better ballet shoes and she grew to love ballet "i almost sabotaged the whole experience by going super cheap " the irony in my family is that while we went downscale for my daughters dance shoes we went upscale for my year old sons new soccer cleats spending on them more than i spend on my own shoes and while that sounds unfair it actually makes a broader point when my son first started out with soccer we bought him low end cleats from a discount store and an inexpensive ball we wanted to find out just how much he liked the game over time before we really opened our wallet we did the same when he joined a baseball team a year later he was the only one on the diamond with a blue glove made of faux leather just about every other kid had a high end leather mitt heres the thing he ultimately gravitated toward the constant movement of soccer and never developed a passion for the long periods of relative inactivity in baseball it didnt cost us much to figure that out though less than &# for that glove a ball bat and cleats thats a manageable initiation fee and were glad to pay it for whatever he wants to try we paid about the same for him to try out for his school band which he ultimately dropped because it didnt fit his schedule but going into his sixth year of soccer now and demonstrating great affection for the sport we feel he has earned the right to have more expensive equipment that will give him greater enjoyment of the game and well do the same one day for our daughter if she ultimately shows she loves to dance then shell have the best tap or ballet shoes we can afford until that point though were decking her out on the cheap jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney
