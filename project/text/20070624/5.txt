early retirement pitches can be too good early retirement remains a goal for many people its a chance to walk away from the grind of the office and perhaps reinvent yourself but early retirement carries significant risks as well your nest egg will have to support you for a longer period of time and your eagerness to start the next chapter of your life could leave you susceptible to bad advice especially when it comes to decisions about pensions and payouts from savings "its a particularly vulnerable moment " says elisse walter a senior executive vice president at the national association of securities dealers a self regulatory body for the brokerage industry your "entire life savings is at risk " if youre thinking about retiring early its critical that you understand the basics of retirement finances whether your nest egg is big enough to allow you to retire what kind of annual return you can expect on your savings and how much money you can withdraw safely each year from your portfolio remember when you retire you will be making decisions in all likelihood about the largest sum of money youve ever had hundreds of employees at bellsouth found this out the hard way according to a recent case brought by nasd between and brokers from the charlotte n c branch of citigroup global markets held more than seminars and hundreds of individual meetings with bellsouth workers to show them how they could take early retirement central to the brokers pitch was that the employees could expect to earn a year from their investments and could withdraw about a year from their accounts according to the nasd complaint "you should be able to expect " one broker told a couple according to the nasd "that is not guaranteed we may do may do or but good times bad times i think that we would do " what the workers were not told about was the risk they were taking by cashing out of their pensions which provided guaranteed payouts and putting the money in the stock market where returns would fluctuate the brokers materials didnt mention that returns were above the stock markets average returns over the long term a year over the last years according to standard &amp poors in addition nasd said brokers didnt adequately disclose that customers would pay annual fees of to and as a result workers would actually have to earn to on their investments to hit the promises made by the brokers when the stock market turned south the brokers held a series of conference calls to try to hold onto accounts opened by bellsouth early retirees the nasd said during these calls the brokers made various predictions that the markets would soon rebound one prediction the dow jones industrial average would rise to or by the dow is now around in the end more than bellsouth employees saw their original investments decline by about &# million according to the nasd these actions resulted in citigroup agreeing last month to pay more than &# million to settle nasd charges related to the brokers activities while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing "we take this matter very seriously " citigroup said in a statement "the firm is also working on all fronts to prevent a similar situation from occurring again " the citigroup case highlights several important aspects of the retirement calculus the first key variable is the expected return on investments while the stock market may return about a year over the very long term its certainly not a smooth ride "we hope its going to be a bull market but its probably going to be a combination of bears and bulls " says christine fahlund a senior financial planner at t rowe price group the baltimore based mutual fund company "and the sequence is going to matter " if for example theres a big drop in the stock market just as you start to retire that can reduce the amount of time that your savings will last the standard practice among financial firms is to employ complicated computer programs that run "what if" situations based on stock market history known as monte carlo simulations these programs provide a probability that peoples savings will last as long as they do at fund company vanguard group in malvern pa financial planners look for about an chance that money is going to last until age says ellen rinaldi head of investment counseling and research "wed rather you got to age or and discovered you still had money left " she says an important variable in making sure that money lasts until age or is capping the amount of money thats withdrawn from a nest egg each year research has shown that a rate of withdrawal meaning if you have savings totaling &# you can withdraw &# gives most nest eggs a good chance of lasting as long as their owners but when it comes to early retirement that safe withdrawal threshold is even lower says ms fahlund at t rowe price "if youre years old youre talking about a year retirement and would be too much " she says "more likely it would be in the neighborhood of a withdrawal rate " the situation gets even more complicated when a pension is involved notes vanguards ms rinaldi tax issues need to be considered if early retirement takes place before age and there are choices about how to structure pensions payments such as whether to take a payout that factors in benefits for a spouse yet reduces the immediate payout "everything has a trade off that you have to make thats what makes it confusing " ms rinaldi says the nasd which published an investor alert about early retirement pitches on its web site nasd com last september recommends getting a second opinion about your financial plans thats especially true if youre dealing with a financial adviser with whom you dont have a long history and if your first contact is a seminar held by an adviser to drum up business "people need to look at these things with a grain of salt " says the nasds ms walter and in the end as appealing as early retirement might be the numbers might not add up just waiting a few years can make a big difference says ms rinaldi "you can put time on your side " email encore wsj com
