designed to safeguard the editorial independence of dow jones this person said for the bancroft family which has controlled dow jones for more than years the offer by news corp is the only one on the table others have circled including general electric co and pearson plc but new corp s premium over dow joness preoffer stock price has scared away potential rivals dow jones negotiators are trying to craft a proposal that would give a measure of protection for the journals journalistic integrity acceptable to bancroft family members and at the same time hope to win a bit higher price the news corp side wants recognition that if it buys the company it gets to control all its assets including the journal and news corp headed up by rupert murdoch portrays its &# a share offer as a very full price though the murdoch side hasnt ruled out a modest increase as a way of sealing a deal dow jones was working on how to respond to news corp late yesterday according to a person close to the bancroft family marcus w brauchli the journals recently appointed managing editor and paul gigot editor of its editorial page have been advising the family on editorial principles and have taken on a more central role over the weekend according to a person familiar with the matter talks have speeded up ever since the bancrofts last week gave dow joness board the power to negotiate with news corp both sides described the negotiations as constructive and said that an agreement in principle for news corp to acquire dow jones could come together quickly but any final agreement would be subject to the direct approval of the bancroft familys four board representatives and would be made only after consultation with the broader family according to a person close to the bancrofts the proposal had been hotly debated among family members and some of them remained uncertain whether it could be enforced in a way to keep mr murdoch from meddling in the editorial content of dow joness properties the two issues that concern the family enforcement and perpetuity of any structure according to the person close to the family the bancrofts control of the companys voting power but the holding is spread across about three dozen family members after receiving the proposal from dow joness board friday news corp s mr murdoch called dow joness ceo richard f zannino and bancroft family legal adviser martin lipton to express his anger and disappointment with the proposal according to people familiar with the matter mr murdoch was incensed by the contents of the proposal which he found "insulting " according to a person close to him his advisers drafted a two page withdrawal of his &# a share offer for dow jones over the weekend but before it was sent a top news corp executive called a dow jones board adviser and they agreed that the two sides could negotiate say people close to news corp the proposal from dow jones called for a seven member special committee on editorial and journalistic independence and integrity according to a draft of the proposal news corp officials took issue with the makeup of the committee which called for two bancroft family designees two news corp designees and three independent members chosen by the family and approved by news corp in its response news corp proposed a member committee with members appointed by news corp but with five of them being independent members agreed upon by both news corp and dow jones news corp said replacement members on the committee would be nominated by news corp and approved by the five independent members dow joness proposal suggested that the committee members appoint their successors news corp also cut back the number of bancroft family members on its member board to one from two as was suggested in the dow jones proposal news corps response also took out any mention of the journals publisher and the managing editor of dow jones newswires the dow jones proposal which was essentially the proposal the bancroft family had drafted in recent weeks had suggested that the special committee have approval rights over the appointment and removal of "essential journalistic officers" such as the managing editor editorial page editor and publisher of the journal as well as the managing editor of dow jones newswires the proposal also guaranteed the jobs of the existing people in those positions the dow jones proposal also gave the managing editor and the publisher of the journal authority over use of their budgets it suggested they be consulted about the use of dow joness brands in a letter to the bancroft family last month mr murdoch proposed a board "exactly along the lines of" the one he established at the times of london and the sunday times that board must approve appointment of editors some critics have said that board has proved ineffective failing to stop mr murdoch from forcing out editors he didnt like most famously harold evans in any proposal to safeguard editorial independence is viewed skeptically by some in the journalism community "its like a prenup and were going to get married and assume something is going to go wrong " says roy peter clark vice president
