debris in space chinas foreign ministry acknowledged on tuesday what the world press had reported for almost two weeks a test of an anti satellite weapon in space the danger now is that partisans and pundits will overreact some will claim the launch represents a new threat to the united states others will warn of the militarization of space they are both wrong the real threat is that washington will miss an opportunity to move china along the path to more diplomatic openness and democracy and deter it from aggression against its neighbors and american interests it helps to begin with a few facts first it is not especially difficult to make a "killer satellite " if a country can build a satellite it is easy to build one that can approach another satellite and destroy it modern guidance technology is widely available and more accurate than ever so this step is not difficult conversely it is impossible to ban killer satellites without banning all satellites even if a country did not build a dedicated killer and train its operators the skills for space rendezvous docking and refueling like the russian "progress" vehicle used to supply the international space station are the same second because these technologies and skills are interchangeable it is impossible to verify a ban on killer satellites unverifiable treaties are worse than no treaties at all because they offer the illusion of control where none exists third the chinese test is not a major step in "militarizing space " space is already heavily militarized most major military powers use satellite based systems for communications navigation and imagery its all available from commercial venders the u s may operate more satellites than any other country but it is not uniquely dependent on them fourth even if one were to somehow ban killer satellites there are many other ways to deny an adversary the use of space for example by bombing an enemys ground stations or jamming the radio links he uses to command satellites so even if a ban on killer satellites were possible it would not solve the vulnerability problem in short anyone concerned with the ability of the u s to use space should be concerned less by the fact that china tested a weapon and more by the kind of weapon it tested press reports say that the chinese killer satellite was a "kinetic" weapon similar to the kind the u s and the soviet union tested years ago these satellites destroy targets by ramming into them at high velocity or by shooting their victim with a mass of pellets like buckshot either way the result is a huge amount of debris in orbit creating a hazard to other satellites most of this debris remains in space for several decades or longer according to nasa there are already approximately objects larger than centimeters circling the earth the number of objects smaller than that mainly unused rocket fuel exhaust waste and flecks and chips from routine operations is so great as to be practically incalculable in time an accumulation of this debris could make space operations extremely difficult the material orbits the earth at seven kilometers per second or more depending on its altitude at this velocity even minute objects can cause enormous damage to satellites this is why u s space operators are required to minimize debris under regulations administered by nasa since the chinese have ambitions of their own to use space they have as much interest as the u s to limit debris washington should use this test as an opportunity to discuss an international convention on the subject these discussions could codify the guidelines that russia japan the european space agency and the u s already follow and would bring china into the fold there is a precedent for an agreement on space debris the incidents at sea agreement america signed with the soviet union in at the time u s and soviet warships were playing an aggressive game of intimidation stunting and near misses as each shadowed the others exercises neither wanted to give in nor allow the game to go too far in talks over the course of a year the two navies agreed to guidelines for avoiding collisions the agreement was negotiated largely at the working level where naval officers dealt with each other on a professional basis to achieve a practical understanding if washington simply protests the anti satellite test or ignores it the u s will tell the chinese military that there is no penalty for their actions nor any real desire abroad to stop them on the other hand if there is any discussion or disagreement among chinese leaders on this subject america can at least let beijing know the test will affect u s china relations minimizing space debris is just like protecting intellectual property and setting a market value for the renminbi its an obligation china must meet if it expects to take part in the free market well never demilitarize space but we can make it a safer place to work and in the process move americas
