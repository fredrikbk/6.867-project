some surprises too in the oscar nominated scores the nominees for this years oscar for best original score suggest the voters favor traditional orchestral works these are the nominated composers and the films for which they are nominated alexandre desplat "the queen" philip glass "notes on a scandal" javier navarrete "pans labyrinth" thomas newman "the good german" and gustavo santaolalla "babel " all are available on compact disc and for downloading at the itunes store the voters bypassed mr desplats "the painted veil" score a golden globe award winner that merged chinese modes and instrumentation with western orchestral music mr newmans aloof and curiously charming score for "little children" was overlooked perhaps because its largely a work for piano and vibraphone while the best original song category may have more appeal for the casual filmgoer the best original score field is one of the most interesting and may be among the toughest to handicap because of the dual nature of the composers assignment during a great cinematic experience the score bolsters story and character by reinforcing what we see and hear and yet the score must also on occasion rise from its supporting role to communicate directly with us to illuminate foreshadow or in some cases redirect our attention but to paraphrase john williams if you notice the score the composer hasnt done his job this year the voters selected scores that emphasize tone and character while buttressing the films themes with a blend of pathos and melodramatic grandeur mr desplats orchestral score for "the queen" has an undercurrent of whimsy and thus is a reflection of the film which contrasts the reaction of queen elizabeth and the people of england to the death of princess diana the film seems to say there is much silliness to royal tradition and much to be admired and respected in the current monarch the movies delicate affectionate score never condescends violins flutes a harp bells and brass convey mr desplats feather light touch mr glasss score is in synch with the icy ominous mood of "notes on a scandal" and its main character the duplicitous schoolteacher barbara covett played by judi dench like mr desplats work for "the queen " mr glasss composition continually pulls us forward heightening the sense of action and in this case dread in a film that relies on barbed insinuating dialogue as with many of mr glasss most notable works swirling strings are at the musics center with long languorous orchestral lines serving as counterpoint an almost unbearable tension is the result while the churning strings at first suggest a flight to escape in fact they show a dark hole opening beneath us nothing good will come of this the beautiful disorienting music tells us be forewarned which is just the right message for a mannerly film of quiet madness for his potent score for "pans labyrinth " mr navarrete chose to emphasize the bleak realistic aspects of the story which is set in spain shortly after the countrys civil war his muse is year old ofelia whose innocence has been corrupted by the war her fathers death and her mothers marriage to the cold arrogant captain vidal the captain is battling guerrillas in a mountain forest home to an underworld of fairies and fauns only she sees mr navarretes orchestral score is forceful even when it promises the tenderness the young girl requires the world in which she lives is cruel the music tells us without determination there will be no way out even the memorable lullaby mr navarretes wrote for the film is as assertive as it is lovely and given the musics role as our discreet companion hes written the only piece among the five nominated scores that audiences can hum on their way out of the theater thomas newmans score for "the good german" is deliberately evocative of the gritty war films of the mid s which is appropriate since the black and white picture seeks to re create the era for its tale of murder and collusion on the eve of the potsdam conference in the score is a stirring work occasionally stately frequently melancholy and it seems to speak of the secrets in the soul of its female protagonist lena brandt a german jew whose compromising choices help her survive the film often seems more concerned with filmmaking than the story its director steven soderbergh is obvious in his appreciation for bygone technique though mr newman an eight time oscar nominee shows a similar appreciation his score can be considered an homage to max steiner and other great composers of the era including his father alfred newman it is never self conscious nor does it overwhelm even his brassy fanfares and use of military drumming feel right mr santaolalla used a different approach than the other nominees for his "babel" score using native stringed and percussion instruments rather than a full orchestra his music bridges the gaps between new cultures as the movies setting shifts among morocco the u s japan and mexico communicating effectively and unmistakably the score reinforces the conceit that we are bound by more than language and that culture is a real but not insurmountable barrier an exquisite piece appears very late in the film featuring pianist ryuichi sakamoto cellist jaques morelenbaum and mr santaolalla on guitar echoing an earlier interlude it suggests a depth and breadth the rest of the score may lack mr santaolalla won the best original score oscar last year for his work for "brokeback mountain " if he does so this year it will be at the expense of richer more traditional works mr
