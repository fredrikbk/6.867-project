housing glut gives buyers upper hand as spring home shopping season looms supply mounts and prices fall in some areas builders see slow recovery amid a continuing glut of homes for sale in most of the country buyers should have plenty of choices and lots of bargaining power in the spring selling season typically the busiest time of the year many builders and real estate brokers for their part hope the housing market will start recovering this year as buyers respond to price cuts and other sweeteners offered by increasingly nervous sellers in some markets agents say buyer traffic has picked up in the last month or two but any recovery is likely to be gradual donald tomnitz chief executive officer of d r horton inc a home builder told investors this week that the market which began slumping in may bottom out by mid but that "we dont see any rapid improvement thereafter " given all that sellers should expect buyers to take their time and be tougher negotiators david lee who recently moved to wenham mass to take up a post as an associate professor of physics at gordon college has rented a home for his family and says they plan to be "quite picky and choosy" as they look for a home to buy dr lee doesnt feel any pressure to decide quickly because he figures prices wont rise in the near term and could fall further a quarterly survey of housing conditions in major metropolitan areas by the wall street journal showed that the inventory of unsold homes at the end of was up substantially in nearly all of the markets from the already plentiful level of a year earlier the biggest increases were in the metro areas of miami fort lauderdale orlando tampa and jacksonville fla phoenix and portland ore unlike the other cities portland had a lean supply of homes a year before the survey also includes recent pricing trends nearly all negative based on surveys of real estate agents by banc of america securities in new york a unit of bank of america corp as well as data on late mortgage payments and job creation prospects from moodys economy com a research firm in west chester pa employment figures have a huge effect on housing demand home price trends vary greatly from one region to another and even within metro areas for instance housing demand remains weak in the detroit area sapped by auto related job losses while the chic urban zones of san francisco and manhattan where space for new construction is extremely limited generally have stayed firm though price appreciation is far slower than a year or two ago the good news for home sellers is that unemployment remains low in most areas wages are growing and energy prices have fallen from their recent peaks whats more mortgage interest rates are still low allowing people with good credit records to obtain year fixed rate loans at around but many lenders are growing more cautious about how much debt home buyers should be allowed to take on and more inclined to ask for proof of income this tougher attitude will exclude some marginal buyers from the market hurting demand even as a rising number of foreclosures throws more supply on the market dataquick information systems a research firm in la jolla calif said yesterday that mortgage lenders sent default notices to california homeowners in the fourth quarter up from a year earlier and the highest in more than eight years meanwhile home builders still have lots of unsold homes that they will unload by further cutting prices and dangling such incentives as help with closing costs or kitchen upgrades discounts on new houses in turn will make it harder for some sellers of previously occupied homes to attract buyers some of the biggest gluts of new homes are in florida phoenix and the outer suburbs of washington d c says ivy zelman a cleveland based housing analyst for credit suisse group many of the gluts are due to frantic building of condominiums over the past few years the supply of condos listed by real estate agents is up from a year earlier in the las vegas metro area in washington d c and in the northern virginia suburbs of washington in floridas miami dade and broward counties the listed condo supply has more than doubled from a year earlier in miami dade the number of existing condos on the market is enough to last months at the current sales rate says jack mccabe a real estate consultant in deerfield beach fla the oversupply will grow he says as about condos are expected to be completed this year and in "its going to get bloody down here " mr mccabe says he estimates that condo prices in miami dade fell between and last year and will drop in eventually he predicts hedge funds and other investors will step in to buy surplus condos in bulk at huge discounts in californias san diego county developers have more than condos available for sale in new buildings projects under construction or properties being converted from rentals says peter dennehy a senior vice president at sullivan group real estate advisors a consulting firm based there he says that supply is enough to last more than months at the current sales rate that number excludes several thousand condos being offered for resale by speculators and others mr dennehy estimates that condo prices have fallen at least to in the county over the past year though its hard to measure price changes because sellers often give incentives such as free upgrades or help with closing costs that arent reflected in the price in the boston area lower priced homes in blue chip neighborhoods are moving pretty quickly but ones that are overpriced or located on main streets are languishing says sam schneiderman broker owner of greater boston home team "its got to be a really good deal " he says "an ok deal doesnt quite cut it buyers are holding out " the glut in inventories is likely to increase in some markets as sellers try to take advantage of what they hope will be a stronger selling season some sellers pulled their homes off the market late last year intending to relist them in the spring at the coldwell banker residential brokerage office in scottsdale ariz near phoenix listings are up roughly since the end of december the office expects listings to increase further in late february and early march as sellers who pulled their homes off the market before the holidays relist them some of last years strongest housing markets now are showing signs of cooling a bit in the san francisco bay area the median price paid for new and resale homes in december was &# up just from a year earlier according to dataquick but prices fell in parts of the bay area they were down from a year earlier in sonoma county and down in solano county dataquick says one of californias weakest markets last year was the sacramento area anthony graham an analyst at trendgraphix inc a provider of housing data says sellers of previously occupied homes there have had trouble competing with the huge discounts and incentives offered by builders mr graham expects average home prices in the sacramento metro area to fall between and this year but believes the market will begin to recover modestly by the fourth quarter assuming that home builders continue to cut their production greg paquin president of gregory group in folsom calif which gathers data on new home construction throughout the state also thinks sacramento is stabilizing after last years price cuts "buyers who were on the fence are starting to say hey this is a pretty good deal " mr paquin says californias central valley which includes such cities as bakersfield fresno merced and stockton may take longer to absorb excess new home inventory and bring prices down to more affordable levels mr paquin said he said that area may not bounce back until next year in manhattan big bonuses recently doled out by wall street firms will help support the market in this years first half says jonathan miller chief executive officer of miller samuel real estate appraisers in new york but a rash of new condo developments will help moderate prices he expects price increases this year to average to in manhattan on long island he believes prices are likely to be flat to slightly higher this year in new jersey "im optimistic that home sales will begin to rebound in the spring " says jeffrey otteau president of otteau valuation group inc an appraisal and research firm in east brunswick n j "however that would signal the end of the decline not a return to higher prices " mr otteau figures home prices fell an average of about in new jersey last year for he believes homes costing less than about &# are likely to rise modestly around while homes above that level are about flat in the luxury end of the market prices may edge down again this year mr otteau says in the chicago area some homes that have sat on the market are finally moving says barbara oconnor an agent with baird &amp warner but some sellers have had to accept far less than they had hoped for jody andre a restaurateur put her three story victorian style home in the edgewater neighborhood on the market in august at &# she later lowered the price to &# but still got no offers "this is a hot neighborhood and a lot of people couldnt understand why the house didnt sell " says ms andre who accepted a &# offer last week "i waited too long to put it on the market " she says the end of the year is normally a slow time but in some parts of the country traffic has increased in the last month or two helped by unseasonably warm weather in philadelphias center city buyer traffic began to pick up in november and has continued to climb over the last two months says mike mccann an associate broker with prudential fox &amp roach realtors a recent open house for a three bedroom home priced at &# drew parties mr mccann reports in the summer and early fall he says "we didnt want to do open houses because it was a wasted day " sales are also increasing but negotiations are taking longer and many offers are contingent on the buyers selling their current homes mr mccann adds prudential fox &amp roach is also seeing more people asking to get pre approved for a mortgage a sign that they may be ready to buy in atlanta where the housing market began to soften in august business started picking up again in december says lewis glenn president and chief executive of harry norman realtors "theres more negotiation " and builders are cutting prices and offering concessions such as buying down the borrowers mortgage rate he says in scottsdale some sellers are cutting prices by or more says dale pavlicek sales manager for the coldwell banker residential office there "there are a lot of vacant homes on the market " he says sellers who bought in the past year or two are barely breaking even or are coming to the closing table with money to pay off their mortgage and other costs he adds houston remains one of the nations more buoyant housing markets supported by job growth in the energy industry rob cook chairman of the houston association of realtors says the supply of homes on the market is enough to last about six months at the current sales rate what he calls a "balanced" market prices are rising only modestly though because texas has plenty of room for new construction "we just keep expanding out farther and farther " mr cook says seller beware if the housing market starts recovering this year it is likely to do so only gradually a glut of condos in markets such as miami and san diego is pushing prices down price cuts by home builders are putting pressure on sellers of existing homes in many markets buyers can afford to be picky and take their time
