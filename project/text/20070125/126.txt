trade winds in call to deregulate business a global twist onerous rules hurt u s stock markets but so do new rivals prominent figures in the u s are warning that the nations financial markets have been handicapped by post enron regulatory overreach treasury secretary henry paulson has made addressing the problem a signature political issue a blue ribbon committee chaired by former bush economist glenn hubbard has echoed this sentiment as does a report commissioned by sen charles schumer of new york and new york city mayor michael bloomberg their key evidence is data suggesting that u s stock markets are increasingly unattractive places for companies to list shares mr hubbard now dean of columbia universitys business school says this is the "canary in the coal mine " an early warning of the increasing costs to u s companies of raising money which in turn threatens investment and growth their solution a lighter touch in regulating corporate behavior yet this position which has gone largely unchallenged downplays a different explanation why u s exchanges are under pressure the changing nature of global finance stock markets around the world have become better and deeper encouraging companies to seek ipos in their home market trading across borders has become simpler cutting the prestige and usefulness of a big country listing everywhere and private equity buyouts are a global phenomenon not a uniquely american one meanwhile other countries are stiffening their own rules bringing them closer to the u s model andrew karolyi an ohio state university economist who specializes in international stock exchange listings agrees with mr hubbard that some new regulations especially parts of the sarbanes oxley act impose burdens that outweigh the benefits but mr karolyi is skeptical of the stock exchange evidence which he links instead to transitory global trends regulations "should be judged on their own merits and not on any evidence of a supposed decline in the attractiveness for prospective listings from overseas " mr karolyi says mr paulson acknowledged in a speech last november that foreign markets have improved which he called "unequivocally a positive " but he devoted most of his attention to the costs of u s accounting and governance rules and the legal climate mr hubbards committee on capital markets regulation consisting of academics and finance executives and endorsed by mr paulson spent pages discussing the harm done by u s regulatory and legal risks among the charges suing corporations for fraud is too easy resulting in a ninefold increase in the number of shareholder lawsuit settlements between and civil and criminal prosecutors are overzealous producing civil enforcement penalties more than times higher in the u s than the u k in auditing standards are unreasonably onerous for small companies as this criticism has increased in volume regulators have eased some sarbanes oxley standards for companies internal financial controls in addition they have made it easier for foreign companies to stop adhering to u s rules and the department of justice has imposed more conditions on prosecutors seeking evidence when investigating executives in an interview mr hubbard concedes theres "no smoking gun" that proves whether global or u s specific forces are behind the smaller number of foreign companies listing in the u s "both factors are important " he says he also cites a complex piece of evidence in favor of the domestic theory historically overseas companies received a boost in their stock price when they listed in the u s an indication of how meeting u s requirements inspires investor trust but recently the premium earned by companies from advanced countries has shrunk faster than that for shares in emerging market companies for companies already meeting stringent governance standards at home mr hubbard argues the costs of meeting u s requirements therefore exceeds the benefits a spokeswoman for mr paulson said he was unavailable to comment for this article in a written statement she said mr paulson sees the global changes as "unquestionably a factor to consider" alongside regulatory and legal burdens the treasury is holding a conference this spring to discuss these topics theres little doubt u s exchanges are facing increasing competition theyre losing out to overseas exchanges for initial public offerings many overseas companies are deciding they dont need an american listing and in the u s itself many companies have decided theyre better off private taken alone the cost of regulation cant explain whats happening to u s financial markets and paring regulations might not alter the outcome except to give a helping hand to wall street "well functioning capital markets are central to the success of the economy " says former treasury secretary lawrence summers now a harvard university economist and managing director at a hedge fund "what fraction of capital markets transactions runs through new york is of much less broad based significance " one piece of evidence mr paulson and others cite is the falling u s share of ipos at the peak of the u s ipo boom in the new york stock exchange and nasdaq stock market notched of world wide ipo proceeds up from in according to thomson financial a financial data provider by last year that share had fallen to regulatory costs may be one factor another big one is the shrinking quality gap between u s and overseas capital markets and an explosion in ipos from the developing world the worlds largest ipo the &# billion offering from industrial &amp commercial bank of china listed in october in both hong kong and shanghai the biggest gainer in ipo business has been hong kong which snagged of world ipo proceeds in compared with zero in "the hong kong market is deep enough and liquid enough that theres really no need to list elsewhere " says paul calello asia chief executive for credit suisse one of the managers of icbcs ipo another gainer is the london stock exchanges alternative investment market set up in the s to cater to small companies with little operating history aim has far less government oversight of governance accounting and disclosure than the lses better known main market or u s markets its foreign listings not all of which are ipos have skyrocketed to from in and include some u s companies aims success is seen by some as evidence that some companies have sought a haven from u s rules protonex technology corp southborough mass a maker of fuel cell power systems went public on aim in scott pearson its chief executive officer says it would have cost three times as much to list in the u s in large part due to legal and auditing costs related to sarbanes oxley but many of aims companies probably couldnt have listed in the u s even before either because they didnt meet u s requirements or were too small to attract interest from u s underwriters and investors "many of the companies listed on aim today wouldnt come anywhere close to meeting an nyse listing standard " says noreen culhane executive vice president of listings at the nyse in addition to ipo share listings of foreign companies on u s markets have fallen since their peak in foreign listings on the nyse have fallen to by the end of although thats up slightly from since foreign listing have fallen to on nasdaq its hardly an american disease excluding aim the london stock exchanges blue chip main market has seen foreign listings decline since the deutsche boerse is down tokyo down the world has changed for all big country stock exchanges for years says mr karolyi investors "were trapped in their local markets" because foreign stock exchanges had differing standards for example over how to finalize payments over time those standards have been strengthened and harmonized increasing "global investors appetite for going directly into those markets " shanghai for example has listed companies up from in furthermore says mr karolyi a u s listing may have had particular appeal to foreign companies in the late s because of the buoyant stock market which faded with the markets downward turn after the tech bubble burst most of the delisted companies had little trading volume and trading in those that remain is generally healthy cellphone maker nokia corp based in finland shows how companies make decisions in light of these changed circumstances nokia sought a london listing in to raise its profile and listed on the nyse in in about of trading in nokia stock occurred in new york in london and in helsinki then as a condition of joining the european union in the mid s finland began permitting brokers in other eu countries to trade on helsinkis stock exchange in the late s helsinki launched an electronic trading system and finland adopted the euro as its currency by helsinki had captured of nokias trading volume leaving the lse with less than nokia delisted from london and paris where its shares were also traded "people still could trade nokia but we did not have to pay annual listing costs to the london and paris stock exchanges " says spokeswoman arja suominen today of nokias shares are held outside finland but of the trading occurs in helsinki and about a quarter in the u s meanwhile u s investors are less insistent that foreign companies list in the u s before theyll buy shares mitchells &amp butlers plc a british operator of taverns delisted from the nyse in it says the low volume of trading less than of the total didnt merit the annual &# million cost which included filing sec statements and auditor fees related to sarbanes oxley this makes little difference to ray mills who owns about &# million in mitchells &amp butlers shares for the &# billion stock fund he manages for t rowe price group inc a baltimore mutual fund house he bought the shares in london even though they were listed on the nyse at the time and isnt bothered that they no longer are "we want to go where the liquidity is " mr mills says mitchellss stock was more liquid that is easier to trade in its home market than in new york "we have trading desks not just in the u s but hong kong and london so we have hour coverage of the markets " in his november speech mr paulson suggested many publicly traded companies are selling to private equity firms removing themselves from public trading and sec scrutiny because of the "regulatory requirements" of being a public company in the u s but the buyout boom too is not merely a u s trend but a global one between and private equity buyouts represented of all mergers and acquisitions in the u s and in the rest of the world between and the fraction has increased to in the u s and in the rest of the world according to thomson financial david rubenstein managing director of carlyle group washington d c one of the worlds largest private equity firms attributes much of the boom to the simple fact that firms such as carlyle have so much cash from investors eager to share in the sectors impressive returns and from banks hedge funds and others ready to lend on easy terms regulations have also been blamed for the growing number of venture and private equity backed companies being sold privately "the costs and regulatory hurdles to go public in the u s today are driving venture backed companies away from our capital markets system " keith crandell managing director of chicagos arch venture partners told congress last year carlyles mr rubenstein cites another reason its easier for private equity firms to recoup their entire investment by selling to another private equity firm rather than the small portion they typically sell in an ipo early last year carlyle filed to sell a stake in industrial manufacturer rexnord corp through an ipo for up to &# million a few months later carlyle instead sold the entire company to apollo management lp another private equity firm for &# billion the importance of sarbanes oxley in the decision of many public companies to go private "has probably been overstated " mr rubenstein says more important he says is "not just the quarterly but hourly" pressure from wall street for stock and earnings performance mr hubbards committee worried about how the u s regulatory burden has risen relative to that of other countries the bigger the differential the greater the potential competitive disadvantage yet even as the u s debates whether it has gone too far other countries are tightening their rules the eu canada mexico australia hong kong brazil the u k and germany have to varying degrees beefed up standards for audit committees this means many companies wont escape tighter regulation by avoiding the u s major provisions of sarbanes oxley "have not competitively disadvantaged u s markets simply by virtue of the fact that they have been widely adopted elsewhere " says a study by ethiopis tafara director of the securities and exchange commissions office of international affairs the netherlands abn amro bank nv dropped its london listing last year because of low trading volume and now trades only on the nyse and euronext two exchanges in the process of merging spokesman jochem van de laarschot says while the u s regulatory burden has risen the same is true of most countries where it operates in hong kongs then chief securities regulator andrew sheng told a senate panel that sarbanes oxley brought global attention to corporate governance hong kong he said has moved "closer to the u s sec regulatory model " though without as much detail and prescription sec chairman christopher cox said yesterday at a conference that his agencys recent guidance on sarbanes oxley relaxing its implementation "benefited greatly" from other countries experience with similar rules europe is moving too "pretty soon the vast majority of sarbanes oxley will be applicable either at the european level or at the national levels " says andrew bernstein a cleary gottlieb partner in paris who advises many french corporations "the regulatory costs are in the process of converging " kate linebaugh in hong kong contributed to this
