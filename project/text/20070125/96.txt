ryszard kapuscinski the journalist as metaphysician whenever we met in warsaw for dinner on one of my recent trips there the drill was the same ryszard kapuscinski world traveler to the most dangerous hotspots in the third world the risk taker par excellence wanted to meet at his favorite italian restaurant in the city order the same insalata mista pasta pesto and bottle of montepulciano that he always did this writer of literary "collages" as he called them nearly two dozen books treated warsaw as his refuge his island of normalcy and familiar routine in a life that overflowed with the extraordinary and the unpredictable kapuscinskis death on tuesday at age marked the passage not just of a gifted writer who mesmerized readers with his tales of far flung travels and near mystical powers of observation of mood and place it also symbolizes a troubling transformation in the world of journalism which was a subject he fretted about over one of our dinners last year during a talk with a group of young italian journalists he recounted he urged them to go out to see the world afterward a couple of them came up to him and complained that they were never allowed to leave their desks and their computers he was profoundly saddened by that encounter "when i was starting out my editor would get angry if he caught anyone at his desk he wanted to know why you werent out reporting " its unlikely that kapuscinskis editor ever had to admonish him on that score as a reporter for the polish news agency pap in communist times he quickly discovered that he could go off and report from strife torn regions of africa or latin america and he rarely had to worry about censors back home as he only partly joked most of those assigned to policing reporters couldnt have cared less about the obscure civil wars riots famines and other tragedies that he wrote about indeed they often had no idea where he really was by his own account kapuscinski covered coups and revolutions narrowly escaping death again and again "when they tell me its dangerous somewhere thats where i go " he once said admitting that he was not immune to fear but he added "the attraction is too strong " he was drawn in particular to africa which he called his second home he began taking his long journeys there in the colonial period and kept going back to observe its painful transition to chaotic independence he described the violence and suffering in harrowing detail but his books like "the soccer war" and "the shadow of the sun" also radiated a near romantic fascination with the continent and its people he bemoaned the disintegration of traditional tribal structures and expressed admiration for the tight sense of community that allowed people to cope with the continents unforgiving climate and geography but it was his books about authoritarianism "the emperor" about ethiopias haile selassie "shah of shahs" about the last monarch of iran that resonated the most with his readers at home and abroad because dictatorship is always based on contempt for the governed and accompanied by a deep sense of insecurity he wrote in the latter book "it spares no pains to demonstrate to itself and others the popular approval it enjoys even if this support is a mere charade it feels satisfying so what if its only an appearance the world of dictatorship is full of appearances " any inhabitant of warsaw bucharest or moscow in those days knew exactly what he was talking about born in pinsk in then a part of eastern poland he remembered the soviet takeover of the town in and the ensuing mass deportations of poles by their new rulers today pinsk is in belarus and kapuscinski always fondly recalled the economically desolate but culturally rich town that he knew as a boy with a mix of poles russians jews belarussians ukrainians and others he also liked to talk about how its fate switching hands between different countries was a parable for the turbulence of the times and provided him with automatic empathy for other peoples caught up in similar conflicts no matter on what continent kapuscinskis writing career didnt bypass his homeland completely when poland experienced its brief first liberalization in he wrote a daring article about the grim life of workers at a steel mill near krakow that was supposed to be the shining star of the communist state denounced by the authorities but later hailed by reformers he nonetheless jumped at the opportunity to begin his peripatetic life abroad a few years later when the solidarity movement rose up in poland to challenge the communist regime he joined that struggle publishing in the underground press but he left no doubt that his first love was writing about more distant peoples and struggles free from the internal battles of polish politics both in the pre and post communist era in the s however he decided to focus on a subject closer to home the vanished soviet union drawing upon his memories of trips there in the s and s along with more current observations he served up his typical "collage" in his book "imperium" a mixture of history reflection and above all vivid scenes the climate was different than in africa he noted but there was a similar sense of danger "when you are in kolyma or vorkuta " he said referring to regions in russia "and cant find any shelter for half an hour in degree temperatures youll die " the climate along with the murderous soviet system instilled a sense of fatalism that accounts for the lack of rejoicing after the old system collapsed "the so called soviet man is first and foremost an utterly exhausted man " he argued kapuscinski never looked exhausted during our last dinner three months ago when speculation was rife that he might win the nobel prize for literature he discounted the hoopla he accurately predicted that the turkish writer orhan pamuk would win which he dubbed an understandable political choice whatever the literary arguments besides he said with a grin he was in the ideal situation as someone who always figured in speculation about the prize he received enough publicity to sell his books but not the avalanche of publicity that often kills the productivity of actual prizewinners and he had so much more he wanted to do another book on latin america perhaps a book about his hometown of pinsk he went on and on while his health was failing he had every intention of traveling more it was the only way he could write he insisted by seeing for himself that he always did even as so many younger journalists were trapped behind their computer screens mr nagorski is a former warsaw bureau chief for newsweek and now a senior editor at newsweek international his latest book "the greatest battle stalin hitler and the
