web site to holy site israeli firm broadcasts prayers for a fee jerusalem on a recent wintry afternoon in the old city here orthodox jews in black coats and hats huddled at the western wall bobbing their heads as they prayed at one of the worlds holiest sites some wedged prayers on crumpled pieces of paper in the crevices of the ancient wall a practice stretching back centuries behind them on the ledge of a nearby building a small webcam carried the scene live on the internet speakers inside the camera played the sound of prayers mostly from people thousands of miles away in the u s the camera is owned by a start up in tel aviv called pray over ip the ip stands for "internet protocol" it sells phone cards that allow customers to record their prayers which are then transmitted to a holy site of their choice via internet phone and webcams "its just &# or &# and you get eternal life " says hanan achsaf chairman of poip "with the lottery you pay that amount and what do you get a piece of paper this is much better value " the start up is part of an explosion of technology being used for religious purposes in recent years churches in brazil offer audio clips of services through cellphones ringtones using religious music are gaining popularity a survey by the pew internet and american life project found that of adults online use the internet for their religious pursuits mr achsafs company which estimates it has users a day sells its phone cards on two web sites one for christians and the other for jewish users the sites stream video from the companys webcams giving users a real time look at where the prayers are broadcast a user records his prayer by using a poip phone card which allows a prayer of as long as two minutes after calling a poip phone number he hears in the u s and inputting a personal identification number from the card the user gets a choice press one for the holy site of jerusalem press two for the holy site of the sea of galilee and so on the companys webcams at these sites transmit prayers from users around the world though more than are in the u s the company has equipment at eight sites in israel including the sea of galilee the basilica of the annunciation in nazareth and the western wall in jerusalem and has plans for more but some religious leaders believe that high technology has no business near such holy places it could also cut into religious tourism which is the largest segment of tourism in israel offering a virtual visit to the holy land could make religious tourists feel less compelled to travel to the country particularly in light of ongoing violence tourism has plummeted since the second intifada began in officials at the private entity that runs the sea of galilee site initially suggested poip pay for attaching a webcam to a nearby tree a deal avshalom neumann poips co founder and ceo says he rejected he argued that the service would help promote the site to potential visitors from afar some users can also feel uncertain about sharing their personal affairs in prayer over a telephone "theres a lot of trepidation in saying something that will be broadcast somewhere over a speaker " says year old jerry hochfelsen who runs a printing company in fort lauderdale fla mr hochfelsen nevertheless likes the service enough to have bought poip phone cards which he gave to friends and business associates during the recent holidays he says some didnt get it "they said why would i pray into a phone when i can pray from my home or car anytime " he recalls but most liked the service he says mr neumann says the company doesnt listen to the prayers but it has a program to monitor them for foul language the prayers generally fall into three categories health wealth and finding a spouse he says some question whether the service demeans religion but others defend poip jesus said the temple in jerusalem "should be a house of prayer for all nations " says david decker an ordained evangelical pastor who has a congregation in jerusalem and travels frequently to ministries around the u s "how do you reach all nations today the internet is a way to do that " he says the year old mr neumann who has worked for several high tech start ups in israel and admits he rarely goes to synagogue says he got the idea for the company visiting the western wall about months ago he noticed people dialing their cellphones after praying then holding their cellphones up to the wall for the people on the line to pray to begin spreading word of the company mr neumann in september traveled through the bible belt in the southern part of the u s meeting with various heads of megachurches he wants his cards placed in their gift stores next to the piles of cds books and other religious materials now they can be found at eleven convenience stores around the region "if we reach even a small number of these churches the numbers are still huge " says mr neumann the company expects to generate revenue this year of between &# million and &# million he says much of that money will go into expanding the system so the company doesnt expect to break even until the first quarter of he says in addition to selling the cards on the web sites the company sells them directly to churches priced at &# to &# the churches then determine how much to charge their members typically &# to &# sometimes higher for fund raising purposes the company plans to offer another service that allows users to access video of the holy sites on their cellphones charging &# for five minutes of viewing in november the company caught a break yossef azran a prominent rabbi in israel endorsed the company "after considering the distance between believers and holy sites and the desire to have their prayers heard i am asking the guards of the holy sites to assist the poip campaign " he said in a statement a month later the sea of galilee supervisors called mr neumann and asked for another meeting service is now at the site says mr neumann the service at jewish sites must stop during the sabbath in line with rules that prohibit the use of electronic devices during the sabbath "what we are doing is no different than what pat robertson is doing " says mr neumann "were just a one way messenger to the lord "
