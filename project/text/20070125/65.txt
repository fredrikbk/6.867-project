israel and europe must beware the peril facing freedom and democracy perhaps israels european detractors would be mollified if israel would simply march into the mediterranean and thereby reduce global tensions "with friends like these " by fania oz salzberger editorial page jan despite ms oz salzbergers impressive credentials exceeded only by her largeness of spirit her analogy of current anti muslim sentiment in europe with pre world war ii anti semitism is not convincing i dont recall a segment of european jewry during the s publicly executing innocent non believers under authority of the torah does anyone doubt that such an event would have produced a great outcry from jews of the time condemning the practice ms oz salzbergers position reveals an all too common practice among liberal thinkers to explain away the evil done by others muslims might find wider acceptance and trust in europe if a substantial number of them protested the evil done in the name of their venerable religion jonathan shirer pittsburgh in another era it would be possible to read ms oz salzbergers essay and be moved by her desire for israel to have support in europe on the basis of all that is right with the jewish state free markets in a free society inhabited by a spirited creative and productive people unfortunately while she references the low opinion europe has for her nation she apparently fails to understand completely the dire straits that both israel and those in support of a free and democratic europe find themselves in today it should be clear to anyone paying attention that the collective enemy of this freedom is an overly tolerant pan european culture combined with an increasingly insular muslim population that sees salvation not in integration but in a segregation fueled by an anti modern and anti free view of the world this is israels true enemy and ms oz salzberger would do well to understand that in this instance the old adage "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" rings demonstrably true though the hot war against the insurgents may be in iraq and afghanistan the real struggle for our future is in europe and it is a battle that neither israel nor the united states can afford to lose kenneth davenport fort collins colo fania oz sulzberger got it wrong there is nothing wrong with israelis finding common cause with other groups of people also threatened by islamist extremism nor do such bonds constitute islamophobia but simply self defense and even survival ms sulzberger praises the tolerance of islam in its early phases indeed there were periods of relative tolerance however there was precious little tolerance in the muslim conquest of egypt the massacre of the banu qurayza jewish tribes in medina at islams founding set a precedent whereby peace treaties may be broken once muslim forces are strong enough to overwhelm an enemy albert memmi a tunisian born jew and professor in france chronicled the travails of jews in arab lands he asserted that arab tolerance of jews was a myth spread by predominantly ashkenazi jewish historians the latter so focused on the european jewish experience that they could not believe anything anywhere else could be similar jews in arab lands suffered "dhimmi" status including restrictions on domicile employment and movement the "mellahs" in north africa let alone those in yemen were as cramped and as oppressive as the ghettos in europe hitler borrowed the yellow star from the caliphates there were periodic pogroms and forced mass conversions there were periods of tolerance and during those minorities such as christians and jews were allowed to rise to some status however the dominant experience was of subjugation and fear ms sulzberger mentions the existence of maimonides as a proof of islamic tolerance in fact one of maimonides most famous letters is his "guide to the perplexed" to yemenite jews undergoing forced conversion for a recent comparison does the existence of an albert einstein prove central european tolerance of jews perhaps when the story of jews from arab lands is finally chronicled by jews from arab lands and not europe the myth of tolerance will be exposed shaul lavan atlanta
