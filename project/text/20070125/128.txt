u s car makers stand to gain from bush plans health fuel initiatives reflect effort to ease pressures on big three president bushs broad new proposals to change the nations health care and energy policies have an important but little noticed common thread white house aides hope they will boost the ailing american auto industry whose pleas for help have largely been ignored by washington in recent years the question now is how much chance those hopes have of becoming reality particularly with the democratic majority in congress controlling the fate of mr bushs agenda the energy proposals crafted in a way that would erase some of the advantages enjoyed by the u s industrys japanese competitors appear to have a shot at becoming law the health program which critics say could help auto companies but hurt auto workers seems unlikely to gain traction anytime soon one thing is certain however no industry would be directly affected more than the auto sector by the domestic program the president laid out in tuesday nights state of the union address "the president obviously recognizes some of the challenges the domestic auto makers have been facing " joel kaplan a white house deputy chief of staff told reporters in advance of the speech still industry executives whose calls for aid have been spurned repeatedly by the bush administration cautioned that any benefit detroit derived from the proposals would depend on how the final rules were drafted and how they were implemented "we agree with the president in that theres a clear need to cut americas dependence on foreign oil however its our belief the decision should be one of customer choice " said david elshoff a spokesman for daimlerchrysler ag the presidents health care proposal mr elshoff added "clearly addresses the uninsured and the underinsured but it doesnt address the need to level the playing field for companies who have made the commitment to provide health care for their employees " while mr bush used tuesday nights speech to tout the overall health of the economy democrats were quick to point out americans widespread anxiety about the security of their jobs and benefits fears heightened by the struggles of many u s manufacturers particularly auto makers with their u s operations in the red general motors corp and ford motor co have eliminated a total of more than jobs during the past year largely through employee buyouts and plan to close more than two dozen north american factories between them as they shrink to adapt to declining u s sales japans toyota motor corp meanwhile is on track to overtake ford as the no auto maker in the u s perhaps as early as this year and is gunning to replace gm as the worlds leading auto maker shortly thereafter daimlerchryslers chrysler group which previously appeared healthier than its two detroit rivals is now in the red too next month it is expected to roll out a restructuring plan calling for plant closings and job cuts though many factors have contributed to the industrys woes soaring health care costs are a big part of the problem the detroit giants are paying the price for years of buying labor peace by agreeing to provide rich health care and other benefits to their unionized workers gm for example has said its health care costs average as much as &# for each car it sells in the u s at a white house meeting with mr bush in mid november chief executives of the big three auto makers made a special plea for help controlling runaway health care costs white house officials said this week that mr bushs proposal would do that "in general anything that can reduce the cost of health care is positive for the industry " said david cole head of the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich mr bushs chosen method for promoting wider health coverage however could hurt some employees like auto workers who get especially generous health benefits from their employers and that reduces the chance of congress enacting his proposal the bush proposal would tax the value of employer provided health benefits in excess of &# and give tax breaks to people with less generous plans the administration says most workers would get a tax break under the plan but because some union policies are worth more than &# those workers would face a tax increase sen debbie stabenow a michigan democrat re elected in november with strong backing from the united auto workers said in an interview that the bush plan would "tax health care benefits for middle class families its absolutely the wrong direction for them to go " alan reuther legislative director for the uaw said the plan also could encourage younger workers to desert employer provided plans leaving them with older and sicker people to cover in addition to the toll taken by health care costs the big three have lost ground to japanese rivals especially as demand for more fuel efficient cars has grown in recent years the bush energy proposals could tip the balance more in detroits favor one way is through the proposed reform of fuel economy rules under the current corporate average fuel economy or cafe system auto makers need to meet a fleetwide minimum average requirement of miles per gallon for light trucks and miles per gallon for passenger cars sold in the u s that means that companies selling larger less fuel efficient cars need to sell more small fuel efficient cars to bring up their average detroit auto makers whose big cars are more profitable and competitive than their small cars say the current system handicaps them against toyota and honda motor co which have sold more fuel efficient fleets in the past and can use credits amassed under the system to offset less efficient larger vehicles the presidents plan would make a significant change in the way passenger car fuel economy is regulated and one much desired by the big three the new system would assign fuel economy targets to car models based on their size instead of mandating a fleetwide average a car like the full size chevrolet impala for example would be required to meet the standard for its size class such a change has already been adopted for light trucks depending on how the rules were written the change could give detroit more freedom to sell its more profitable lower mileage cars without having to rev up sales of smaller less profitable models the uaw may oppose that change however union leaders argue that the current laws encourage detroit to make small cars in the u s absent the fleetwide rule they fear those small car factories would close one uncertainty for auto makers is how much the administration might increase fuel efficiency standards as it overhauls them "the key for us is were going to have to see the details and how it all flushes out " said paul ballew gms top market analyst "its one thing to go to categories its another thing to go to categories and change the standard " another white house priority a huge increase in federally mandated use of alternative fuels like ethanol could also be a boost for american auto companies while japanese companies dominate the market for fuel efficient hybrids the big three think they would gain an advantage if broader ethanol use became the preferred approach to reducing the nations gasoline consumption american companies unlike their japanese rivals have long experience with building ethanol burning engines in places like brazil and already sell more ethanol capable "flex fuel" vehicles in the u s in response to mr bushs address fords group vice president for corporate affairs ziad ojakli said in a statement "ford supports reducing gasoline usage through an increase in alternative fuels such as ethanol we have produced almost two million flex fuel vehicles with ethanol capability in addition we have announced plans to make half our annual vehicle production flexible fuel vehicle capable by " boosting ethanol is politically popular with both democrats and republicans particularly in farm states but technical hurdles remain to mass distribution "one key component that needs to be considered is infrastructure " a gm spokesman said "what are the incentives to increase both storage and availability of pumps " at an appearance at a dupont co research facility in delaware yesterday mr bush also appeared to promise more federal funds for research to improve another technology the batteries that help power hybrid vehicles a top priority of u s auto makers who lag behind their japanese rivals in that area
