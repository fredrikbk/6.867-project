mail here energy security worries have long headlined policy confabs political promises and investor worries but this week even beyond dialogues at the white house and davos happens to be a good time to watch some of the subjects geopolitical algorithms at work for instance chinese president hu jintao is a man whose government doesnt often feel the need to justify its actions but there officials were yesterday defending beijings economic ties to sudan ahead of an african trip by mr hu that includes a stop in khartoum as the financial times reports mr hus visit comes at time when china has broken with the u s and europe over attempts to make sudan let u n troops help quell the violence in darfur but foreign ministry official zhai jun made clear his government sees nothing shameful when it comes to sudan "with sudan we have co operation in many aspects including military cooperation in this we have nothing to hide " he said china whose petroleum thirst played a big role in the rising price of crude over the past four years gets almost a third its oil imports from africa as well as other raw materials the latest attack on a nigerian oil facility today in bayelsa state didnt target shell but rather employees of the chinese national petroleum company and it doesnt seem coincidental that beijing has made serious efforts to court the continent more vocal criticism about such ties from the u s may be muted by washingtons reliance on the likes of saudi arabia across the indian ocean energy was playing a role in relations between russia and india vladimir putin in new delhi on a two day trade visit today signed a memorandum with indian counterpart manmohan singh that would see russia build four new nuclear reactors for india whose economic growth is beginning to rival chinas in its need for fuel the deal comes at a time when india is about to gain access to u s nuclear technology and when the u s is also trying to sell more military hardware to india historically an important client for soviet and then russian arms sales but president putins trip also included a new agreement on russian aircraft engines and another on joint development of a military transport plane the associated press reports and indias incentive to make deals with moscow is increased by its desire for access to russias oil reserves as the new york times points out also on mr putins agenda is a proposed joint venture for oil exploration in siberia the times adds india may now be a major power in its own right but its also just one country among many in western southern and central asia where russia is playing or trying to play a dominant economic and political role tied to its muscle in energy markets iran is part of the same petro political equation and if this is just the latest chapter in russian regional aspirations that hail back to the great game it also comes at a time when energy is again a big source of global anxiety "the quest for energy security in short is a global scramble of power money and ideas " the wall street journal says adding "the worry is that the geopolitical and economic equilibrium that long enabled the oil industry to smoothly supply customers is a thing of the past " the journal predicts events this year the rise or decline of turmoil in exporting nations and whether large consumers like the u s and china can curb their consumption will test that view cheney slams senate opposition on iraq a day after president bush asked congress to back his decision to send more u s troops to iraq the senate foreign relations committee voted for a nonbinding resolution that criticizes the new plan and declares "it is not in the national interest of the united states to deepen its military involvement in iraq " more than four and a half years after the u s led invasion the vote moves the senate closer to what would be its first official repudiation of mr bushs leadership of the war as the los angeles times puts it only one republican chuck hagel joined the panels democrats to pass the measure but as the wall street journal notes the vote gives chairman joseph biden "a solid foothold from which to begin talks with republicans who share his concern about sending more u s troops to try to quell sectarian violence in baghdad " these include sen john warner ranking republican on the armed services committee who introduced an alternative resolution that also challenged the presidents new plan the senate resolutions were denounced yesterday by vice president cheney who complained that administration critics and the media "are so eager to write off this effort or declare it a failure" that theyre undermining the war effort as the washington post reports congressional opposition "wont stop us" from deploying more troops mr cheney said adding that it will only "validate the terrorists strategy " the notion that iraq has become a "terrible situation" is just wrong mr cheney argued declaring that in fact the administration had achieved "enormous successes" there also of note washington post after the bloodiest year in afghanistan since the u s invasion the bush administration is preparing a
