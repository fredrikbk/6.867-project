lower copper prices have undermined those hoping for a new bidder the outcome of the deal will mean big profits for those who bet right but more important it will offer clues to how smart investors see the commodities cycle unfolding after a strong run over the past several years many commodity prices have skidded during the past few weeks along with copper oil prices also have dropped before stabilizing recently this downturn has left some investors concluding that many commodities are in for a long retreat while backers of the freeport phelps deal hope it is only a momentary bout of weakness many funds involved in the freeport phelps deal piggybacked on new york hedge fund atticus capital llc atticus which manages &# billion in assets turned optimistic on copper prices in and began to amass a large stake in phelps dodge more than months ago as a way to express that view and its belief the companys stock was cheap at the peak atticus owned of phelps dodge according to regulatory filings and has publicly pushed for a deal earlier this month atticus threw its support behind a deal "in the absence of a higher offer for phelps dodge our current intention is to vote for the merger with freeport mcmoran " the hedge fund said the firm said it now holds of freeports shares and when the merger is completed it will hold of the combined company atticus will make a profit of hundreds of millions of dollars assuming as is likely the merger goes through "this is one of the best examples of how a hedge fund can drive the whole process and create value " said the head of one multibillion dollar london hedge fund which is among those piggybacking on atticus "by calling the bankers and shopping the company to everyone from private equity to strategic investors they have driven the stock up " atticus disclosed its push for a sale in filings with the securities and exchange commission phelps dodges share price leapt on the new york stock exchange upon news of the offer

been equally important to find the right investment the freeport mcmoran bid comes at a time when the outlook for most commodities is murky and as many investors have taken money out of hedge funds that specialize in commodities copper for example trades at about &# a pound and is well down from the record of &# a pound it reached this past may still many analysts and hedge fund managers remain bullish on copper despite the pullback they say new supply that has come on the market is of lower grade and demand for high quality copper remains robust "i am a copper bull " said leigh goehring managing director of chilton investment co a new york fund with &# billion under management "the quality of the copper ore has dropped dramatically there is a structural gap between supply and demand " moreover unlike steel for instance there is a long lead time for copper to come on stream at least some of the rise in commodities prices during the past several years was due to speculation as much as fundamental factors while the outlook remains unclear hedge funds are betting the weight of money will keep commodity prices higher than many industry experts expect china is a huge part of the equation both for the bulls and the bears optimists say china is ramping up its investment after a brief lull and that will boost demand for copper to the copper bears that is all wishful thinking "dont overlook the demand side " said stephen roach chief economist for morgan stanley "there will be slack on the demand side " mr roach cites the slowdown in the u s housing market and a decline in the rate of economic growth in china as bearish factors for industrial metals like copper in the fourth quarter demand for copper in the u s was hit hard by the slowdown in the housing market and a drop in copper orders from suppliers to some that order falloff has ended and the next move will be back up analysts at bear stearns cos expect the average price of copper in to average only about &# per pound many hedge funds have piled into phelps dodge on the back of atticus and its research into the company not just for only the outlook on the copper market they say the company has been trading at a multiple that doesnt reflect its value and has been hurt by the mistaken perception it is a high cost producer "their biggest mine may be low grade but it isnt deteriorating " said the analyst for one fund with a major position "this company has been underrated by the market " they also say the deal will give freeport much stronger earnings growth potential at a reasonable price
