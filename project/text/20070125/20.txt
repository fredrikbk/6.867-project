china faces increasing pressure for more energy transparency beijing calls are growing for china to be more transparent with its energy data to give experts a better shot at calculating how much oil the country uses each year instead of relying on educated guesswork secrecy over oil stockpiles and the absence of official estimates for volumes of smuggled crude and fuel oil give traders a regular headache as they bet on demand in the worlds second largest market for energy the latest plea for more openness was delivered by the international energy agency which delayed the publication this month of its five year outlook for the global oil market because of inconsistencies in the data it gets from china "we say that its not possible to have a good energy policy if you dont have good data " executive director claude mandil said last week ahead of talks with china with china starting to fill its strategic oil reserves mr mandil said secrecy over timing and crude volumes was self defeating because it encouraged speculation in the market and meant that china could end up overpaying for crude his comments are in tune with those of analysts who complain that chinas energy statistics are incomplete and are released in a disorganized fashion preventing them from getting a grip on the countrys oil needs energy data are released in dribs and drabs each month with the breakdown of oil products trade data often coming through unofficial outlets while the iea is forecasting that chinas oil demand grew by year to year in the u s energy information administration predicted a growth rate of "its not so much that the data is corrupt its just that its lacking and i think that the chinese probably choose to report what they want to report " said david hurd head of asian oil and gas research at deutsche bank a key issue is that chinas trio of state run oil companies isnt obligated to release commercial stock levels and the government doesnt release the data either the reason for this secrecy may be attributable to chinas sensitivity to the charge that its spiraling oil consumption was responsible for driving up oil prices three years ago and it knows that big stock drawdowns or buildups on a monthly basis can sharply affect demand chinas desire to capitalize on lower oil prices to fill its oil reserve was widely thought to be behind a surge in consumption in november to nearly million barrels of crude per day that was almost one million barrels a day above octobers level but on par with a spike in september analysts at barclays capital said foreign oil for the reserve accounted for as much as of the year to year rise in chinas crude imports in the fourth quarter of last year there are signs that beijing is listening to calls for better data mr mandil said the iea was working closely with chinas statisticians to improve the quality of their data "the day to day relationship that we have with the chinese authorities is much better and closer than the one we have with several member countries of the iea " he said according to state media the national bureau of statistics has recognized that flaws in its data gathering are hampering efforts to get a better grip on the countrys sizzling economy "a major task in is to focus on addressing problems related to key statistics " the head of the national bureau of statistics xie fuzhan told the state backed china daily newspaper citing the collection and timely release of energy related data as issues of key importance
