such such were the joys of the uninhibited life dancing in the streets by barbara ehrenreich metropolitan press pages &# sometimes the first chapter says it all at the outset of "dancing in the streets " barbara ehrenreich declares that her purpose is "to speak seriously of the largely ignored and perhaps incommunicable thrill of the group deliberately united in joy and exaltation " this mission she explains originates in a "sense of loss" stemming from the "decline of community that human societies have endured in the last few centuries " her aim is no less than to revive humanitys "capacity for collective ecstasy " caveat lector in fact the book tells a familiar story at least to those acquainted with a certain genre of utopian political literature unspoiled human beings happy in the state of nature or their simple communities engage in innocent ecstatic rituals that affirm and bond the group until the nasty people show up and spoil all the fun in chapter the nasty people are bronze age warriors in chapter theyre roman aristocrats in chapter the fathers of the early church chapter the fathers of the medieval church john calvin does the heavy lifting for at least three chapters pretty much single handed among the other predictable villains are european city fathers european imperialists missionaries slaveholders and industrialists more recently but no less predictably the forces of commercialization smother the ground up spontaneity in modern festivals such as rock concerts and sporting events ms ehrenreichs story is hardly eurocentric however she finds more than enough killjoys to go around muhammad ibn abd al wahhab the founder of wahhabist islam for example brings guns and close order drilling to the desert and with them purges the happy sufis from the arabian peninsula this is nothing if not a broad ranging and ambitious work it takes as its subject any group festivities that involve music dancing eating drinking and putting on costumes it covers ground from bacchic rites and african ring dances to european carnivals and maypoles although it inexplicably ignores the popular liberty pole and charivari traditions that undergirded the american revolution it boasts scholarly apparatus of nearly pages including an extensive bibliography citing works from disciplines as diverse as history psychology and sociology but any book whose index lists in a single column entries for "trance behavior " "trinidad" and "triumph of the will " as well as "ukraine hasidic pilgrimage to" and "upper class disdain for ecstatic rituals " is bound to spread itself thin i might use the phrase history lite to describe it or even anthropology lite but it is in fact so heavy handed as to defy any such term ms ehrenreichs thesis is that the repression of festivity and ecstatic rituals was the conscious work of social elites throughout history primarily male social elites she avoids the obvious enemies of group joy capitalism and industrialism for the even larger target civilization itself and all the social hierarchies that support it as she mourns "even communism which might have been expected to celebrate human sociality turned out with the arguable exception of cuba to be a drab and joyless state of affairs " instead elites sponsor tightly regulated spectacles as a means of social control from roman games to nazi parades in case youve missed the point ms ehrenreich puts it still more bluntly "ecstatic rituals still build group cohesion but when they build it among subordinates peasants slaves women colonized people the elite calls out the troops " the story does have a novel twist ms ehrenreich claims that suppressing festivity especially communal music and dancing subverts our biological nature and has led to an epidemic of depression that has lasted from the late th century to the present by learning "to sever the neural connections linking the perception of rhythm to its expression through muscular motion" that is to listen to music without dancing human beings have become alienated from their natural selves and lost a cure for their anomie and sadness one hesitates to contemplate the stereotypes that this vision of happy high stepping natives conjures up the claim that humanity has labored under a half millennium of depression seems strained to say the least despite protestations to the contrary ms ehrenreich apparently takes sources such as puritan spiritual diaries replete with authorial claims to be the "chief among sinners" at face value rather than recognizing them as a form of genre art she even expresses surprise that oliver cromwell a calvinist party pooper if ever there was one enjoyed wine and music what if she knew about methodist evangelist george whitefield who on a trans atlantic voyage during the s was accustomed to knock back six or more bottles of wine a night or that john winthrop first governor of puritan massachusetts wrote decorously randy letters to his wife indeed the entire book shows a striking naivete anyone who can quote deadpan a line that the middle ages was "one long party punctuated by bouts of hard labor" is missing something about the period that brought europe feudalism and the black death the french revolution she says yielded one of the "greatest moments in all of human history to be alive " the july festival of federation that celebrated the storming of the bastille the year before a nationwide event in which people of all classes "shared wine and food with dancing that wound through whole cities and out into the fields " never mind that parts of rural france were gripped by unrest that was a successor to the great fear of the summer before ms ehrenreich waxes equally romantic about the rock festivals of the s not only were they a rebirth of carnival they were "the beachheads of a new ecstatic culture " rock n roll was not only going to bring on the revolution but to effect a change in human nature ushering in a world of "happy nonconformity and miraculously nonpossessive individualism " this is taking fun a little too seriously if you really want to read about carnivals and their enemies you still cant do better than ben jonsons satiric play "bartholomew fair " no one has ever come up with a better killjoy than puritan minister zeal of the land busy unlike "dancing in the streets " jonsons party comes without the trappings of limousine anarchism and its a lot more fun ms arkin is a professor at fordham law school
