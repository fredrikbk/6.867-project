bank start ups rush in despite profit loan woes the banking industrys fading profit growth and mounting pile of bad loans arent slowing a nationwide frenzy of bank start ups more than banks were launched last year the most since according to snl financial lp a charlottesville va research firm the number expected to open their doors this year looks just as large say regulators start up advisers and investors scouring the country for the most promising prospects among them the continued rush is a sign that the industry remains relatively robust despite deepening credit quality problems and an interest rate squeeze that is shrinking the difference between the higher rates banks charge for loans and the lower rates they pay on deposits investors pouring money into start ups are betting that the industry wont stumble into a crisis that the nations economy will perk up as slowdowns in housing and manufacturing ease and that small banks will continue to be snapped up by the big ones at hefty premiums many experts warn though that some start ups face an uphill slog for months or even years beyond the loss period typical for new banks the tough environment ultimately could force some fledgling institutions to put themselves on the block at a time when takeover premiums are lower than when the industry was flying high last year small banks fetched an average of times book value down from times book value in according to snl jonathan d holtaway managing director of danielson capital inc a bank consulting firm in vienna va worries that the abundance of start up capital is making it possible for some mediocre bankers to win financial backing for flawed business plans "i call them the b team " mr holtaway says many small banks rely heavily on commercial real estate loans making them particularly vulnerable to competition and any erosion in credit quality "when youre a one trick pony if the pony dies youre in trouble " says d anthony plath a former loan officer and branch manager who now is a finance professor at the university of north carolina at charlotte still the lure can be irresistible bankers at the newest start up in town can instantly become major players in their local market pitching themselves as a much needed alternative to the megabanks that are gobbling up an increasing chunk of u s deposits but often reducing face to face contact with customers some of the best run start ups often acquire other banks or eventually sell to a larger bank that is hungry to enter their market florida california and georgia have been the most popular states for bank start ups partly because of the financial success of the previous round of bank openings there eleven of the banks that opened in georgia through last years third quarter were in the atlanta metropolitan area executives at newly opened banks acknowledge that the environment is more challenging than they expected when they started planning their ventures it usually takes about months to clear required regulatory hurdles "we got spoiled with some years that were just fantastic " says henry vick president of first covenant bank which opened in woodstock ga in september "we have to readjust for some years that are only ok " first covenant hopes to overcome industrywide pressures with a focus on gathering deposits from churches and other religious organizations and by offering free donation management software mr vick says first covenant which isnt affiliated with any particular religious denomination plans to use its deposits primarily to make residential and commercial real estate loans he says first covenants employees many of whom have worked together at other banks have longstanding relationships with many local home builders and developers rockbridge commercial bank in atlanta which opened in november after raising more than &# million is using its relatively large supply of capital to make bigger loans than most start ups do it is targeting businesses with annual revenue of as much as &# million "should we find that we are not achieving our expectations our board will be challenging us to change things " says lauch d mckinnon rockbridges chief executive hoping to woo commercial customers away from regional banks such as bb&amp t corp and suntrust banks inc rockbridge is issuing remote check scanners so its clients employees need to make fewer trips to the banks sole location commercial real estate loans are likely to be as much as half of its overall portfolio but rockbridge will stick largely to financing owner occupied properties with owners who keep their deposits at the bank mr mckinnon says regulators generally play down the risks to bank start ups saying they are scrutinizing business plans to make sure they are solid enough to withstand the industrys current problems another positive sign in the third quarter the latest period for which figures are available the typical new bank was started with &# million in capital up from &# million in even though takeover premiums have declined investors in new banks regularly make a solid return if they get in early and hold on for several
