senators worry airline deals hurt competition consumers washington members of a senate committee expressed strong skepticism that sweeping consolidation in the u s airline industry would be good for consumers and were particularly unenthused about us airways group inc s &# billion hostile bid for delta air lines inc a three hour hearing was punctuated by testiness as us airways chairman and chief executive doug parker staunchly defended the tempe ariz carriers takeover offer which was condemned by gerald grinstein deltas ceo who insisted that the atlanta airline would be best to emerge from bankruptcy on its own later this year despite a grilling from lawmakers on the senate committee on commerce science and transportation the highly anticipated hearing was somewhat anticlimactic because in recent days the official committee of delta creditors appears to have been shying away from the us airways bid according to people familiar with the situation one of the biggest concerns by committee members is that a merger could force delta to remain in bankruptcy while a deal is ironed out and that resistance by delta executives could derail the process meanwhile talks about a possible merger between delta and northwest airlines corp have been put on hold further deflating speculation that a frenzy of deal making among u s airlines is imminent still while congress cant block proposed mergers yesterdays hearing made it clear that even the prospect of consolidation faces resistance from many lawmakers especially those worried that mergers would reduce or even eliminate air service to smaller communities "i am not a fan of mergers " said sen byron dorgan a democratic from north dakota "inevitably whats going to happen is the other network carriers are going to decide theyre going to merge i think it gives consumers fewer choices less competition " other consolidation concerns included the possibility of higher fares and additional impact on airline employees who have suffered steep pay cuts layoffs and the loss of pension benefits during the industrys latest downturn mr parker reiterated his assurance that a takeover of delta wouldnt result in job cuts of any front line or nonmanagement employees though he acknowledged the combined work forces would be reduced through attrition "youre making a big leap here " said sen trent lott a republican from mississippi who complimented mr parker on the merger he engineered two years ago between america west airlines and us airways "im not opposed to the delta merger it does bother me when its a hostile effort " he said another lawmaker recalled that amr corp s american airlines pledged to take care of twa workers when american acquired assets of the carrier in then eventually left most of them jobless the packed hearing room included dozens of uniformed delta pilots who stood against the walls wearing "keep delta my delta" buttons mr grinstein said delta was financially strong enough to maintain its independence after exiting bankruptcy and he disputed mr parkers stance that acquiring delta would lead to lower fares while maintaining adequate service levels "we have to keep an open mind" about consolidation as a remedy for the industrys high leverage even though airlines are poised to return to profitability this year said andrew steinberg the transportation departments assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs
