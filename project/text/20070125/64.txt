insurers tab for katrina could grow the insurance industrys final tab for resolving outstanding legal disputes in mississippi left in the wake of hurricane katrina could be several hundred million dollars or more industry experts said after sorting through the terms of a state farm fire &amp casualty co agreement reached tuesday to address such matters the bloomington ill firm which is the largest home insurer in the nation agreed to pay out at least &# million itself to resolve disputes with the state and with individual policyholders robert hartwig president of the insurance information institute a trade group said the industrywide total is "likely to be well under a billion dollars " and concluded it would probably be under &# million douglas pawlowski an analyst at fitch ratings estimated the industrywide total could be between &# billion and &# billion before the latest settlements the industry tab for homeowner claims had already hit &# billion in mississippi from katrina that suggests the remaining payments in mississippi might not be an overwhelming burden for the industry which enjoyed booming profits last year however many claims also still need to be resolved in louisiana so the bills could mount a state farm spokesman said there are too many variables to extrapolate what the company may ultimately pay as a result of the settlement coming up with precise figures is difficult because even the amount that state farm will pay under the agreements it reached remains to be determined the deal sets no upper limit according to the mississippi attorney generals office some state farm cases would be reopened under the settlement the final toll for state farm would depend largely on how many of those people ask for their cases to be reviewed and how many pursue sums greater than what they are offered through arbitration which the settlement would allow also uncertain is how many mississippi homeowners who have already filed suit against state farm will decide to keep fighting in court if those people win judgments against state farm that would also affect the final toll it also remains to be seen whether other insurers agree to the same or similar terms as state farm in their own discussions about a settlement two of the other major insurers in mississippi sought to distance themselves from the settlement after it was announced tuesday
