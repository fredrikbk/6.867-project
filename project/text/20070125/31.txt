death of spy who ingested polonium spurs drug makers chemet a drug developed by ovation pharmaceuticals inc of deerfield ill to treat the symptoms of radiation exposure wasnt getting much attention until last november but that month a rare radioactive isotope was used to murder former russian intelligence agent alexander litvinenko and a week later ovation got a call from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases could the company brief the agency on chemet ovation is one of a few u s drug companies and laboratories that are attracting new attention because of mr litvinenkos death in london from poisoning by polonium in the case of ovation the company hasnt received federal funding but thinks its chances have dramatically improved the federal governments interest precedes mr litvinenkos murder and is linked with the sept terrorist attacks on the u s in the bush administration launched project bioshield a federal program to obtain drugs against nuclear biological and chemical agents one of the programs aims is to prepare for a possible attack on the u s by terrorists using a "dirty bomb" a conventional explosive laced with a lethal chemical biological or nuclear agent last fall the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in bethesda md and the pentagon separately offered funding for research into promising radiation injury treatments the institute is looking for remedies for civilians while the pentagon is seeking to prolong the lives of soldiers irradiated by nuclear weapons now pharmaceutical companies are giving notice that drugs they have developed or are developing for cancer and other diseases can also be used for exposure to radioactive elements including possibly polonium most must be taken within hours of exposure to be effective british authorities havent completed their investigation of mr litvinenkos murder but say that his killers may have slipped the isotope of polonium into his drink or food nov when his first symptoms appeared he died nov in a london hospital after weeks of agony radioactive elements attack the body by damaging the dna in blood cells the cells stop dividing and die and the body ends up short of the blood cells it needs to survive chemet pronounced kem et works by accelerating the evacuation of heavy metal isotopes from the body it works by binding with the isotope and moving it from the bone marrow essential to produce blood cells to the kidney says jason bradt ovations executive director of medical affairs the movement away from the marrow "increases survivability " he says kidney damage can be dealt with later cleveland biolabs inc takes a different approach with its drug protectan the cleveland based company developed the drug as a cancer treatment but in november it said it was responding to a department of defense announcement seeking a radiation treatment drug andrei gudkov the companys chief scientific officer says that he was inundated with questions after mr litvinenko became an international news story protectan works by preventing cells from self destructing thus giving "them a time window to repair the damage " mr gudkov says "you give the cells the metaphorical equivalent of antidepressants " mr gudkov says he cant be sure that protectan meant to work against gamma rays will be effective against polonium which emits another kind of energy called alpha particles gamma rays pass through solid objects alpha particles travel only a short distance cant penetrate the skin and only cause damage if ingested or inhaled inside the body alpha particles bombard and punch holes in organs "i tell them we cant say protectan will work with alpha particles" until its tested on a nonhuman primate says mr gudkov a third possible antidote for polonium is being developed by hollis eden pharmaceuticals inc of san diego and the pentagon the drug nuemune treats radiation by promoting the growth of bone marrow but a drug like neumune starts working only after an isotope like polonium is expelled from the body says dwight stickney hollis eatons vice president for medical affairs so one idea would be to combine drugs one like chemet for instance would remove the isotope from a victims body or isolate it in a lethally nonthreatening place like the kidney a drug like protectan could stop the cells from committing suicide and one like neumune could promote production of more blood cells "there could be multiple cocktails that could have a synergistic benefit " says ovations mr bradt battle plans three cancer drugs in development that may be able to treat polonium exposure each with a different goal chemet removing radioactive isotopes from bone marrow protectan keeping blood cells from self destruction neumune promoting growth of bone marrow source wsj research
