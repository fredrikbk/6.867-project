pigs get the ax in china tv ads in nod to muslims porcine prohibition sends marketers scrambling a new year complication shanghai next month china will ring in the year of the pig nestle sa planned to celebrate with tv ads featuring a smiling cartoon pig "happy new pig year " the ads said this week china central television the national state run tv network banned nestles ad and all images and spoken references to the animal in commercials including those tied to the lunar new year chinas biggest holiday the intent to avoid offending muslims who consider pigs unclean "china is a multiethnic country " the networks ad department said in a notice sent to ad agencies late tuesday "to show respect to islam and upon guidance from higher levels of the government cctv will keep any pig images off the tv screen " suddenly companies reaching out to chinas booming consumer market have a pig problem the edict has sent nestle and others scrambling to adapt to the last minute rule change altering spots that had included pigs nestle is now figuring out what to do with its ads says its media buying company mindshare a unit of wpp group "we act in line with any requests that we receive from the authorities" about the content of ads says francois xavier perroud a spokesman for nestle coca cola co says it already had plans to run two versions of its new year ads one featuring a cartoon panda and the other a pig the company says it will be using the pig free spot in which a young panda tries to get home to its family for the holidays on cctv the pig ads will run on local tv in markets without significant numbers of muslim viewers says a coca cola spokeswoman the pig ban is a significant shift for a government that seldom puts the interests of minority groups ahead of those of the broader population china has more than million muslims but they constitute less than of its population for most other chinese the pig has powerful and positive cultural associations as one of the signs of the chinese zodiac year of the pig decorations already festoon cities and villages all over china pork is the meat most widely consumed by the countrys han chinese majority on average chinese annually eat more than pounds of pork according to united nations statistics at banquets in southern china people often roast whole pigs decorated with blinking red lights in their eye sockets tens of millions of people have been born in the year of the pig which occurs every years people born under the sign of the pig are believed to be happy and honest astrologers say this year is held to be especially auspicious for new births pigs symbolize prosperity and good fortune as well as fertility and virility "pigs are fat and they mean good luck " says miao saiwang a spokesman for the bank of china a commercial lender in some areas this year the bank is using the slogan "golden pigs bring good fortune " chinese tvs ban comes in the wake of the killing of muslims by police in the countrys remote northwest earlier this month the government accused the men of being terrorists muslim activists have called for an independent investigation the policy shift offers a window on the inner workings of chinas governmental machinery known for its surprise edicts and abrupt shifts in regulation it wasnt immediately clear whether the ban applies just to ads or to all tv content and some analysts said the government could still reverse itself or offer exceptions to the ban advertising industry executives in china say senior communist party leaders recently told cctv that references to pigs should be avoided to prevent conflicts among ethnic groups cctvs move was then announced to advertisers just as many were finalizing their spots for the holiday which begins feb the ban could have an impact because cctv is chinas monopoly national broadcast network both the biggest media company in the country and the official voice of the communist party advertisers spent &# billion in on cctv air time because programs such as the nightly weather report regularly reach million people the message has left advertisers and their agencies rushing to alter ads or pull them entirely "i am sure there will be a lot of last minute overtime work by the creative agencies and production houses " says bessie lee the chief executive of wpps groupm china unit which manages media buying for advertisers ad agencies say they arent totally surprised by the ruling marketers in china often have to contend with a welter of sometimes inconsistent government edicts as beijing attempts to control the media and popular culture though few have struck so directly as the ban on pigs in recent years regulators have banned ads for breast enhancement and reality tv shows that feature people under the age of last year cctv banned some ads for infant milk formula after the government launched an initiative to encourage breast feeding "this is all about the government positioning itself as the patriarchal protector of the people " says tom doctoroff the chief executive of the north asia operations of wpps jwt ad agency even as cctv keeps pigs off the air images of the animal are proliferating in stores as well as in print ads and billboards in anticipation of the new year holiday starbucks corp shops in china are selling bright red pig shaped piggy banks emblazoned with the chains name as well as stuffed animal pigs walt disney co which is making a major push into china after opening a theme park in hong kong is building its marketing efforts for the year around piglet winnie the poohs cartoon sidekick the company says that market research into chinese culture and traditions led them to prioritize piglet who is a lesser character in other markets "piglet will be disneys most eye catching image throughout in china " said the company in a statement before the ban chinas postal service has also launched "year of piglet" stamps surrounded by images of the character disney had no comment on the ban pigs have often been at the center of communal violence between chinas muslim minority and the chinese majority protests ensued when a pigs head was nailed to the door of a mosque several years ago tensions have flared again since security forces killed the accused terrorists in an area the xinjiang uighur autonomous region known for muslim separatist activity uighurs are turkic speaking muslims who have long bridled at beijings rule "after an incident like that the government often tries to make up for it in an overt propaganda way " says dru gladney an anthropologist at pomona college in california who studies chinas muslims "but nothing in reality changes on the ground " china closely monitors mosques and islamic religious schools and the government has worked to damp muslim protests over issues that have prompted outcries among muslims elsewhere such as a danish newspapers publication in of cartoons depicting the prophet muhammad "muslim people hate pigs and dont even mention pigs in their daily lives " says ma yunfu the vice chairman of the china islamic association mr ma said he hadnt been informed of the cctv ban but views it as "a precaution " "we dont want to see any misunderstanding like the one years ago " during the last year of the pig says mr ma at that time mr ma says some newspapers published a tale in which a pig saves the life of muhammad "that aroused a lot of anger " he says sue feng tang hanting and juying qin contributed to this article see related letters "letters to the editor pc pusillanimity
