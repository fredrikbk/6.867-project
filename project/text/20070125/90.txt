readback the wizard behind the curtain a scott bergs biography of max perkins uncovers the man who shaped literary legends like so many people who love to read fiction i have written a novel it will never be published because it isnt any good but after reading a scott bergs biography "max perkins editor of genius " i began to wonder if a skillful experienced and patient editor like mr perkins couldnt turn my sows ear into a silk purse or at least a purse mr perkins who worked for the new york publishing company of charles scribners sons for years virtually memorized his authors manuscripts then suggested thousands of changes from the loftiest abstractions to the tiniest details if his authors became discouraged he gave them pep talks and fixed their problems often lending them money from his own pocket today when people read the works of ernest hemingway f scott fitzgerald and thomas wolfe they probably dont realize that maxwell perkinss hand was on almost every word perhaps more important it was on many words that didnt appear in the published books mr perkins always urged concision and mr wolfes original manuscript of "look homeward angel" was more than a million words long as mr perkins often said "it is better to give a little less than the reader wants than more " its a tough job to make a man who sits at a desk all day reading and rearranging words into a heroic figure but mr berg who won a national book award for "max perkins " does it with just the right amount of reverence mr perkins had his faults his attitudes toward women were antediluvian he believed in phrenology the study of character as revealed by protuberances of the skull and he was a poor speller the first editions of f scott fitzgeralds "this side of paradise" had more than typographical errors but mr perkins worshipped great literature he reread "war and peace" dozens of times and he doted on his authors like sons and daughters "there could be nothing so important as a book can be " he once wrote to mr wolfe the best authors make writing seem effortless but even naturally gifted ones like messrs hemingway fitzgerald and wolfe wrote four five even a dozen drafts before they and mr perkins were satisfied characters and scenes were added and subtracted the beginning became the middle the middle was the new beginning and because successful writers often turn into big babies mr perkins had to put up with frequent tantrums hysterics and jealous rages then when the book was finally printed the critics were waiting with glistening knives several critics savaged "the great gatsby" in print taking mr perkins to task for having published such a trivial mystery novel one critic told him personally "that new book by your enfant terrible is really terrible " about thomas wolfes "look homeward angel " a critic wrote "i can see no reason why anybody should abstain from writing like that if he wants to write like that i can see no reason why anybody should read the result " yet the years of mr perkinss editorial hegemony the s and s were a thrilling period in american literature with stuffy and archaic conventions giving way to modern voices and themes "the job of an editor in a publishing house " another scribner editor john hall wheelock wrote is the "dullest hardest most exciting exasperating and rewarding of perhaps any job in the world " mr perkins who died in at the age of was a private almost pathologically self effacing man who tried to hide in his writers shadows early in his marriage he told his wife that his ambition was to be "a little dwarf on the shoulder of a great general advising him what to do and what not to do without anyones noticing " public recognition of book editors mr perkins believed might undermine readers faith in writers and writers confidence in themselves his writers however knew that without mr perkins they would never have become giants dedicating his novel "of time and the river" to mr perkins mr wolfe wrote " to a brave and honest man who stuck to the writer of this book through times of bitter hopelessness and doubt and would not let him give in to his own despair " many readers responded to my last column
