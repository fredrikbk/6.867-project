for those nostalgic for typed commands enso does a nice job back in the early days of personal computing if you wanted a computer to do something you typed a command on the keyboard it was quick and direct but also off putting for millions you had to learn a complex command language and enter commands in just the right way and the commands were different for different programs then apple building on work done by xerox introduced computer systems that you could control without typed commands instead you used a mouse to click on icons and menus microsoft soon followed with windows and today all consumer personal computers work this way out of the box however for some people especially fast touch typists removing a hand from the keyboard to use the mouse is annoying and picking through menus is slow they prefer to use keyboard shortcuts but these shortcuts must be memorized and can vary program to program now theres a new software system that allows you to use keyboard commands to do common tasks but this back to the future system is different from the old approach its commands neednt be memorized because they are entered in plain english and they stay the same no matter what program youre using the system is named enso and it comes from a small chicago company called humanized inc interestingly humanizeds president aza raskin is the son of the late jef raskin an early apple employee who worked on the macintosh enso is dedicated to his memory there are two initial enso products which can be downloaded at humanized com one called enso launcher allows you to launch programs and switch among windows via typed commands the other called enso words allows you to do spell checking even when the program youre using doesnt include that capability and to look up the meaning of words both products also include a simple calculator and the ability to launch google searches enso is dead simple to use you just hold down the caps lock key and type an enso command which is displayed in a translucent overlay once the command is typed you simply release the caps lock key to activate it and the overlay disappears if you type fast it all happens in a flash for instance to launch the firefox web browser you just hold down the caps lock key and type "open firefox " to look up the meaning of the word "proclivity " you just hold down the caps lock key and type "define proclivity " you lose the normal use of the caps lock key enso launcher costs &# and enso words costs &# both have a day free trial for now they work only on windows xp not the new windows vista or the macintosh ive been testing enso and it works as advertised enso launcher is simpler and seems more useful than enso words partly because so many programs now have spell checking i wasnt able to test the calculator and google features which were late additions to enso enso commands are even faster to enter than they might seem the program auto completes the commands as you start typing and it provides the likely choices in its translucent overlay which you can navigate with your arrow keys suppose you want to open the windows calculator program you hold down caps lock and type "open calc " and enso launcher completes the suggested command "open calculator " even before that when you typed "open cal " the drop down list appeared with "open calculator" at the top in addition to "open " enso launcher also has a command called "go " which can take you to any open window or tab in a web browser while i was writing this paragraph in microsoft word i held down the caps lock key and typed "go patriots" to get to the new england patriots web site which i had open in a tab in firefox there are also commands for quitting programs and for closing maximizing and minimizing windows in enso words you can select any text in any program then hold down caps lock and type "spellcheck " an overlay window appears with your selected text any misspelled words are highlighted and you can correct them by either retyping or choosing from a list of suggestions when youre finished you just press caps lock and type "done " and the corrected word appears where you were entering it if the selected text contains no errors enso tells you its correct this spell checker is clumsier than the built in checkers in programs like microsoft word but it might be handy in instant messaging programs or web based email programs or in other web pages where spell checking isnt built in the "define" command also brings up a thesaurus as well as dictionary definitions in addition to typing the word you want to look up into enso you can also select a word already on your screen and just hold down caps lock and type "define" or "thesaurus" to get an answer from enso and you can select a block of text on your screen and use ensos "word count" or "character count" commands to measure it enso isnt for everyone if youre fine with the mouse menus and icons you may not want it but for keyboard addicts it could be a blast from the past watch me walk through the enso software system at wsj com onlinetoday email me at mossberg wsj com
