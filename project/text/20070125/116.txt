the daily fix manning is mum on thumb as colts prepare for bears ah the joys of the first week between the conference championships and the super bowl nows the time to get too revved up for the game ensuring that next week with its increasingly recycled hype will be excruciating in the chicago tribune mike downey tries to work up some dislike for indianapolis and the colts suggesting the insult "horseshoe heads " among other things "everybody is being way way way too nice so far what this game needs is a little old fashioned hostility " he moans adding "i am supposed to insult indianapolis how it is practically impossible indianapolis is a nice place with a whole bunch of nice people this is the mister rogers of metropolises you almost never hear indianapolisians what the heck are they called say or do anything mean " if the bears and colts meet without hatred at least anxiety should be in the cards in the chicago sun times roman modrowski reports on the results of super bowl xli as played by the simulation engine accuscore as played more than times in fact click here to read what accuscore had to say in indianapolis the talk is of peyton mannings thumb if youll recall mr manning smacked the thumb of his throwing hand on teammate tarik glenns helmet in the fourth quarter of sundays come from behind win against the new england patriots then was seen telling backup qb jim sorgi to "be ready " the thumb was fine then but is it now the latest report sore but not broken mr mannings report "i attended the bill belichick school of discussing injuries so theres my answer " in the indianapolis star bob kravitz tells tales of players undone by the crushing pressure of the super bowl and the spectacle surrounding it as former player turned analyst solomon wilcots puts it you can only win the super bowl on sunday but you can lose it in these two weeks "the cautionary tales are everywhere " mr kravitz writes "stanley wilsons coke binge the eve of the super bowl atlanta safety eugene robinsons arrest the night before the game for soliciting sex from an undercover policewoman oakland center barret robbins mental collapse in the days leading up to his teams super bowl against tampa bay not so coincidentally all three of those players teams lost the super bowl " what about the quarterbacks in philadelphia the daily newss sam donnellon squeezes in between various accounts of what the eagles are doing nothing to ask whether the bears rex grossman has a chance against mr manning "its duane bobick against muhammad ali richard nixon debating jfk and your mother driving on a sunday afternoon vs junior johnson " he writes "rex grossman dueling it out with peyton manning jesse james had a better chance against robert ford or so it would seem the list of unheralded quarterbacks making super bowl history is rich enough but that list shrinks considerably when an unknown super bowl soldier matches up with a name quarterback it shrinks even further when the no name trades throws with someone headed to the hall of fame " but have hope bears fans mr donnellon thinks hes found his best match for mr grossman and its the new york giants phil simms in super bowl xxi against the denver broncos "back then the giants quarterback was known more for what he wasnt than what he was " he writes "like grossman he was widely seen as the beneficiary of a stifling defense and a solid running game and he was as inconsistent and unimpressive at times in his season preceding the big game as grossman was this season simms threw touchdown passes in the season and was picked off times his passer rating was and yet the giants finished grossman had touchdown passes in the regular season and was intercepted times he finished with a passer rating of the bears finished what both shared was a toughness that allowed them to struggle and still make big plays " mr simms who wound up the super bowl mvp is also the subject of this column by the bergen records ian oconnor "he only needed a little sunshine on his tired frostbitten bones " mr oconnor writes of that long ago day "a quarterback so sick of being wind whipped across the nfc east tundra only needed clear skies and a warm california breeze to deliver the nfls answer to don larsens perfect world series game twenty years ago today phil simms rose to a brand new world he had gotten three hours of sleep maybe less passing the time flipping channels and watching joe montana and walter payton co host saturday night live simms said he wasnt nervous about facing the broncos i feel great he announced he was in pasadena after all two weeks after surviving mph winds in the nfc title game victory over the redskins the climate made him feel young strong alive " stick with it for mr simms closing account of flipping channels a few years ago and finding a replay of the game "i watched myself and my teammates on that tape and said damn look at us we were young we were strong we were athletic and wouldnt it be great to be all of those things just one more time " two biographies of pistol pete maravich are on the way one by mark kriegel the other by wayne federman and marshall terrill on espn com bill simmons reviews both books by way of remembering mr maravich who spent his final fading days in the nba as a member of the boston celtics mr simmons conclusion "he was the most entertaining player alive and the most tortured one as well you marveled at pete maravich but you worried about him too stick the pistol in the modern era and he would be the most polarizing figure in sports someone who combined t o s insanity a rods devotion to stats and nashs flair for delighting the crowds skip bayless would blow a blood vessel on cold pizza screaming about pistols ball hogging the sportscenter guys would create cute catchphrases for his no looks bloggers would chronicle his bizarre comments and ghastly hairdos fantasy owners would revere him as if he were ladainian tomlinson or johan santana nike would launch a line of pistol shoes hed be the subject of more homemade youtube videos than every other player combined and have a trophy case filled with espys " joel sherman of the new york post has an issue to work through "i like bernie williams a great deal " he writes "it feels proper to start there when i am about to support the yankees current plan not to bring back one of the most important and beloved players in their history i have enjoyed chatting with williams as much as any player during the years he was unique an artist in a jockstrap he was contemplative he actually considered questions and was a cliche free zone he was bright articulate and insightful in his second language he was polite dare i say a gentleman in a forum that does not beget many " notice the past tense which is the crux of the issue regarding the year old outfielder is concerned "because the way the yankees are constructed the only reason to retain williams is because of his dignity and history essentially because your heart overrules your brain " mr sherman writes ok fix readers make sure youre sitting down if youve got something sensitive on tap soon a big meeting a presentation a
