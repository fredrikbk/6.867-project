according to a prosecutor the loans would be unsecured if his investments went bad and he couldnt repay the loans bawag had no right to go after his other assets the prosecutor says what made the

deteriorated wall street firms issued margin calls demanding cash to cover his positions mr floettl later told police selling off the positions to meet the calls would have left him broke mr floettl said he met the margin calls primarily with money he had borrowed from bawag according to an austrian national bank audit conducted during the investigation last year "the margin calls over a period of six business days reduced our investment to almost nothing " mr floettl said in his statement to prosecutors and police he lost about &# million over a short period in including about &# million borrowed from bawag according to an arthur andersen audit of mr floettls trading records ordered by the banks board mr elsner later told police investigators that he began to worry that bawags losses would be revealed that october bawag lent mr floettl another &# million according to a written statement by mr elsner to other bank executives "mr floettl has very prominent friends " mr elsner told prosecutors "we had a lively discussion in the management board meeting and decided to prevent the situation from becoming public that required bawag to ensure mr floettls economic survival " bawag lent mr floettl an additional &# million to keep his gulfstream jet aloft according to the central bank audit last year mr elsner told the banks management board the loan was to ensure no one noticed

floettl met in london "mr elsner terminated our business relations " mr floettl told prosecutors "he said he doesnt want to have anything more to do with me " bawag wanted to find a way to permanently hide its losses austrian national bank auditors later concluded the result they say was a complex series of transactions beginning in that had the effect of converting the bad loans to mr floettl into an asset that appeared on bawags balance sheet to be worth far more a settlement agreement struck last year by bawag with the u s justice department and securities and exchange commission described the scheme as follows bawag sold bonds to a virgin islands fund for million euros which roughly equaled what the bank had lost in its most recent transaction with mr floettl but the deal was a sham

account at refco bawag valued that account on its balance sheet at between million euros and million euros details of mr floettls losses didnt leak out for five more years mr floettl continued to sell
