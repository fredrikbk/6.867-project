capitol hill power shift could aid philip morris in many ways the new democratic congress looks like big trouble for big tobacco representative henry a waxman d calif long the industrys chief capitol hill scourge just became an important committee chairman loyal republican allies of big tobacco are now in the minority including john boehner r ohio a smoker who in famously handed out checks from tobacco lobbyists on the house floor he later apologized and roy blunt r mo whose wife is a lobbyist for altria group inc the parent of philip morris usa mr blunts office notes that his wife doesnt lobby the house because of the changes on capitol hill the public could be seeing all sorts of ideas floated that had sunk quickly before from a federal excise tax increase to photos of diseased lungs on cigarette packs from the point of view of the nations largest cigarette maker philip morris the shift in power could be a blessing in disguise thats because it could help ease the way for legislation to give the food and drug administration new powers to control how cigarettes are made and marketed that ironically could help philip morris maintain its current market domination the fda doesnt regulate cigarettes under former commissioner david kessler it tried years ago to claim jurisdiction over cigarettes as drug delivery devices the drug being nicotine but that effort was challenged by tobacco companies and rejected by the u s supreme court most tobacco companies are opposed to fda regulation of cigarettes which among other things would likely ban the use of descriptors such as "light" and "mild" and require big new warnings to cover at least of cigarette packs philip morris however has embraced the idea that the fda should have broad powers over tobacco "legislation that reduces the serious harm caused by smoking would be a very good development and it is not about giving a competitive advantage to any one company " says steven c parrish senior vice president of corporate affairs for altria the companys rivals contend that new restrictions would hurt them more because their brands are much less known than the famous philip morris marlboro brand with marketing potentially dramatically curtailed by fda regulation they would have fewer ways to promote themselves the result they say would be that marlboro would keep its market share philip morris usas share of the retail cigarette market was as of the third quarter of competitors such as reynolds american inc s r j reynolds tobacco co which markets camel and kool cigarettes gripe that fda regulation is the "marlboro monopoly act " oversight by the fda also would help philip morris develop a legal way to market its cigarette products that are meant to be less hazardous such as marlboro ultra smooth which already have been selling in limited test markets but without any explicit health related marketing claims a bill in the works includes sections that define reduced risk products laying out how they can be marketed in coming weeks sen edward m kennedy d mass chairman of the senate health committee and rep waxman chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee are expected to formally introduce fda tobacco legislation sen kennedys plan is for hearings in february and a vote in his committee on the bill in march phillip morris usa chief executive officer michael szymanczyk and other cigarette company chiefs are expected to be asked to testify before congress they could face tough questions about some new findings from researchers at the harvard school of public health alleging that tobacco companies increased the level of addictive nicotine in their cigarettes philip morris disputes the findings another hot topic might be whether legislation should give the fda power to demand that all cigarette makers reduce nicotine levels all the way to zero in the past philip morris has argued against that on the grounds that doing so would make cigarettes unacceptable to consumers traditional antiregulatory sentiment on the part of the republicans has proved an obstacle to passage of fda regulation the democrats win in november means that legislation to regulate tobacco has more votes than in the last session of congress but with a presidential race gearing up and the congressional clock always racing many bills may fall by the wayside as priorities shift rep waxman has been particularly tough on cigarette makers in he called cigarettes "the single most dangerous consumer product ever sold " and he was chairman of the hearings that exposed major tobacco executives over the health risks of smoking seven executives declared under oath that nicotine isnt addictive the companies have reversed course reynolds suggests smokers rely on the conclusions of the u s surgeon general and other public health and medical officials while philip morris usa agrees cigarettes are harmful now rep waxman will be in the position of arguably aiding philip morris by introducing the fda bill on the house side his spokeswoman said yesterday that the bill could come soon and would likely give the fda the power to regulate nicotine but not eliminate it "i dont think theres been any love between philip morris and henry waxman " said rep waxman in an interview yesterday noting that he is aware that some employees of the cigarette maker used to mock him as "hollywood henry" a likely reference to the fact that he invited movie stars and celebrities to his hearings "i dont care about philip morriss interests " he added "cigarettes as dangerous as they are are the only consumer products that are completely unregulated by the federal government " among the antitobacco measures democrats might take would be increasing the federal cigarette excise tax now cents the last increase was legislated in antitobacco advocates also hope there might be political opportunities for the u s to finally ratify the terms of a world health organization treaty known as the framework convention on tobacco control the u s signed it in and about other countries have ratified it including the united kingdom japan and canada the treaty calls for a ban of terms such as "light" and "low tar" and would require text or pictorial warnings covering at least of each tobacco pack in canada and some other countries using pictures the images include a diseased lung and a drooping cigarette to show tobaccos ill effects on male sexuality the odds of passage this year are uncertain because the state department has yet to introduce the legislation that would make the treatys terms legally binding "we agree with most of the treatys core principles and we want to engage with the rest of the world to help bring them up to our standards " white house deputy press secretary tony fratto said wednesday "the treaty requires statutory changes that we would have to make before ratifying it and also raises some constitutional concerns particularly with respect to the first amendment i cant say at this time how quickly those issues would be resolved " another likely move would be to pass legislation that would limit internet sales of tobacco products in the last congress there was debate about providing the states additional authority to ensure that state taxes were paid the proposal is likely to surface again this year says wendy k d selig lobbyist for the american cancer society in washington
