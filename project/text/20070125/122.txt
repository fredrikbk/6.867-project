the numbers guy winning a longer life can winning a nobel prize really add several years to your life thats what a study released last week in england alleged it adds to a growing body of research examining the effect of status on longevity related research has suggested that actress helen mirren might live longer if she wins an oscar next month for her performance in "the queen " the reason according to researchers is the bump in prestige enjoyed by winners compared with nominees who dont win the nobel and oscar studies join other research that has found that even among people who are already wealthy and successful status can extend their lives these studies have inherent limitations leaving their conclusions subject to debate their sample sizes are generally small and their subjects societys elite are private the circumstances of someones death often play a role in the research the nobel study for instance tried to exclude accidental deaths reasoning that luck shouldnt be a factor and these are observational studies not experiments with control groups so its impossible to prove that some other underlying factor isnt causing both long life and success such nuance generally wasnt captured by news coverage of the study in reuters the associated press and discovery news "want to live longer " the pittsburgh post gazette jokingly suggests "heres one practical thing you can do go out and win a nobel prize " the research builds on older studies that have shown status affects health among the poorest members of society testing the same effects among the wealthy is "not so easy " said donald redelmeier professor of medicine at the university of toronto who conducted the oscar studies there arent many "elite members" of society he said and they tend to guard their privacy however other redelmeier research has suggested certain honors dont bring life extending benefits one study found that medical school class presidents lead shorter lives than their peers by an average of years oscar winning screenwriters meanwhile live shorter lives than nominees who lose by an average of years which according to several researchers can be ascribed to writers lifestyles and has me wondering if i should have put my math and physics education to a different use for the nobel study university of warwick economics professor andrew j oswald and his then graduate student matthew d rablen faced their own set of challenges they examined the winners and nominees for the prizes in physics and chemistry between and they had to go so far back because names of nominees are sealed for years they omitted scientists for whom they couldnt find a date of death at least three appeared to still be alive another four were excluded because of the way they died two in combat two from accidents they also excluded the four women on the list to make sure results werent influenced by gender that left them with people the study didnt exclude three scientists who died from exposure to radiation and two who committed suicide the data collection process took "about a year " prof oswald said after making adjustments for the potential effect that longevity might have on winning the nobel prize live longer and you have a greater chance of living long enough to win the researchers concluded that winners live years longer than nominees the method has its limitations among them the average birth year of the scientists studied was possibly limiting the applicability of the findings to the present also why just winners in physics and chemistry prof oswald said he considers those the "classic" prizes he and his coauthor did gather data on some medicine prize winners but didnt include them in the study the nobel peace prize isnt a "pure" measure of status he said because of its political implications and because most winners already possess a measure of status and as for the literature prize "we just didnt pursue that " prof oswald said those decisions limited the sample size and seem somewhat arbitrary "im inclined to think on the hard sciences this is quite a good laboratory test " prof oswald said he added "i will sleep easier in my bed when this can be replicated in other circumstances " shane reese an assistant professor of statistics at brigham young university who looked over the study at my request said the researchers made a "very good faith effort" to isolate the effect of winning the nobel prize on longevity by running follow up tests to match nobel winners with nominees who were alive at the age they won however he cautioned that there are always other factors researchers might have studied such as the lifespans and income levels of the subjects parents to see if they were associated with increased longevity "if you were to give this topic to researchers in the area of epidemiology everyone would add one factor to the list " dr reese said sir michael marmot professor of epidemiology and public health at university college london inspired studies of public figures with his research from the s through the s into the mortality of thousands of british civil service workers follow up investigations stretching to years discovered that mortality rate decreases for higher level job titles even when adjusting for health risk factors such as smoking or high cholesterol the effect persisted at the highest levels of civil service where poverty which can mean a lack of access to the best health care isnt a factor dr redelmeier the university of toronto researcher and his colleagues investigated oscar winners "because their work productivity and their lives are such a matter of public scrutiny and the public record " their oft reported finding that winning actors live years longer than nominees has been criticized for failing to adjust fully for the fact that as actors live longer and make more movies they have more chances to win a paper last year in the annals of internal medicine suggested that the winners benefit is closer to one year meanwhile kenneth y chay an associate professor of economics at the university of california berkeley led research that found a bump in lifespan for baseball hall of famers compared with peers who fell short of enshrinement in cooperstown n y the study hasnt yet been published even if winning major prizes can extend lives its unclear how to apply the finding david boyum brooklyn n y based coauthor of the book "what the numbers say " asked "is there anything from a policy perspective or public health perspective that can be done" with these findings on the effect of status on health dr redelmeier says his research and related work does have policy implications by suggesting that it takes more than tangible resources to narrow societal gaps in health care "its not just a matter of giving people better diet and better shelter although diet and shelter is very important " he said sir michael who studied british civil servants said he thinks status is a proxy for other factors harder to measure such as control and personal satisfaction to distribute such healthful influences more equitably "you can change the way the workplace is organized " sir michael said "you can give people lower in the hierarchy more control over how their jobs are structured you can start in childhood by giving equal access to education there is much that we can do " thanks to everyone who posted to the most recent forum about my column on crime statistics ill be reading and responding to your comments about longevity in a new forum
