middle seat mailbox an airline policy divides readers is selling first class seats to the stranded a form of gouging or just capitalism it happened to bob forsyth too mr forsyth a premier executive elite level frequent flier on united airlines was stuck in dallas and trying to get home to denver after a blizzard before christmas he was told the earliest rebooking was christmas eve when he asked if any seats were for sale he was offered a one way coach seat on a flight two days earlier the cost full fare &# plus a &# booking fee for telephone service while mr forsyth was miffed and has requested a refund so far denied by united readers debated the practice this week of holding some seats for sale even when hundreds of canceled travelers are waiting for seats after big storms this weeks column examined the practice and policies of different airlines some defended united some blasted the airline the debate was most interesting in the new online forum we launched this week for the middle seat where readers offered their own assessment along with questions and tips on how to handle storm disruptions youll find lots of fascinating comments from savvy road warriors there in the forum there was genuine outrage at uniteds practice of having some seats for sale reserving first class seats for first class customers for example until shortly before a flight leaves but in the middle seat email box some of the reaction was far more supportive of united the column suggested that travelers could if willing to pay richly to jump to the front of the line use the availability of tickets for sale for their own benefit and several readers emailed comments echoing that they supported uniteds tactic as simply capitalism and questioned why travelers who bought tickets like charlene king should be upset when theyd used the system to their advantage as always letters have been edited timothy jasionowski "i must disagree with your assessment of ms kings situation what you didnt make clear until we experienced the full extent of her outrage was that she was traveling on a united award ticket not a revenue one under uniteds rules these tickets are clearly marked as nonupgradeable and booked in one of the lowest fare buckets meaning that even if it were upgradeable shed be clearly at the bottom of the list in regard to upgrade priority considering ms kings low priority she did precisely what she needed to do to guarantee a seat on that plane purchase an open one in first class and skip the irregular operations upgrade queue " mr jasionowski also thought "united was overly generous on restitution and we should applaud them for giving back far more than they should have under the circumstance " carl friddle "were it not for uniteds policy that empty first class seat would have gone to someone else your article implies she was flying on an award ticket putting her at the bottom of the wait list in effect shes complaining about a system she used to her advantage " steve allen said the travel lawyer quoted in the article was wrong to liken the practice to gouging since united was only selling first class seats at normal prices not jacking up the price "those who want to pay can get them those who do not can wait and see if a coach seat becomes available when someone else is upgraded by the usual process " some readers suggested that ms king had few rights and certainly low priority since she was on a "free" frequent flier award ticket paying customers should be accommodated first they noted ive long tried to dispel the notion that a frequent flier award ticket is "free " a majority of miles today are earned with purchases by credit card companies and the like so airlines are paid for frequent flier seats the pay can be quite good one penny or two per mile paid to the airline and it comes in advance to the airline furthermore ms king had to buy up to the unrestricted coach award level at united paying with miles for an unrestricted coach ticket should earn her the same rights as a paying customer since united did get paid something for the miles on the other side of the debate some readers thought the airline was wrong to be selling seats when lots of displaced travelers were waiting to find them for christmas christi hill "your story of uniteds cavalier approach to customers would appear to provide ample indication of the source of the airlines financial ills " eugene o kelly "just reinforces the truth in the unspoken airline motto were not happy until youre not happy " that was some of the attitude found in the online forum too warren d miller "if i ran my business the way the airline creeps run theirs id be in jail " note to readers middle seat mailbox discussion will now shift to the forum ill
