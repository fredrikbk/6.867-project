a dogfight in business class london as if airlines didnt have enough to worry about some upstarts are trying to steal the legacy carriers most profitable customers were talking about all business class airlines today silverjet becomes the third such company to fly the london new york route joining eos airlines and maxjet airways earlier this month lavion began service between paris and the big apple they may be just the latest suckers to fall for the glorious gleam of the airplane which has lured many an entrepreneur into ventures that crashed and burned or perhaps they simply see an opportunity that the incumbents have ignored and are going for it full throttle either way and this is the genius of free market capitalism the winners will be consumers who will end up with lower prices better service or both there are two business models in play here the more prevalent one is essentially the low fare airline model in which prices are driven by costs even if many customers would pay more that allows the company to operate at the bottom of the pricing scale charging as little as possible without forsaking profitability "when we set this business up " silverjet ceo lawrence hunt told me here "the most important thing was to get the price point down where the legacy carriers cant compete " in this case the goal is yes to nab some customers from british airways virgin atlantic airways and the like but its also to create new business class customers by offering the service for around gbp or &# compared with an industry average closer to gbp "what were seeing " maxjet ceo bill stockbridge explained in a telephone interview "is that a lot of the small private businesses that may have a tighter budget are taking our service and were also attracting people from the legacy carriers that ordinarily would fly business class we think its a wider spectrum " the second model which eos alone is following so far is to go upmarket "our view of the marketplace " eos founder and chief strategic officer dave spurlock said "is that when an airline has invested in product and service and has gone head to head with an airline that hasnt the airline that has taken that first approach has won market share and profit share "thats something thats played out over years of airline competition " mr spurlock continued naming singapore airlines british airways virgin atlantic and cathay pacific as exemplars of the strategy "its not the low cost carriers its the service leaders that have won " together the two models have opened up a second front for the legacy carriers which are already accustomed to seeing coach customers flee for supercheap tickets offered by the likes of southwest airlines and airtran airways in the u s and ryanair and easyjet in europe yet while coach tickets might be nice for the legacy carriers to sell business class passengers are where the money is the incumbents reactions will go a long way toward determining whether the all business class model works and their reactions may depend on which type of customers the new entrants target "if you go toward the high end of the market the big guys like british airways and american airlines will notice and try to take you on " said ray neidl an aviation analyst with calyon securities "i think trying to attract the person who wouldnt have traveled or would have bought coach probably creates the least amount of problems from the big guys " the way things have played out so far seems to confirm that mr spurlock of eos said the reaction from the incumbents has been to upgrade their business class cabins and services trying to maintain their status as the top dogs maxjets mr stockbridge also noted the legacy carriers changes quipping "hopefully the traveling public appreciates what were doing for them " as for the price angle the expected restraint seems to be playing out so far "were seeing some fare sales" from the legacy carriers mr stockbridge said "but at this point no direct attack " mr hunt said he doesnt think british airways and virgin atlantic whose new york london business class fares tend to be higher than the gbp industry average can afford to get into a long term price war with his airline and maxjet "i would estimate that ba makes over half their profits on new york" to london business class travelers he said "so they cant afford to trash their pricing on new york " if they were inclined to do so he said he would be ready "if they come down to quid ill go down to quid if they come down to quid ill go down to quid and ive raised enough cash to sustain that " but he added "by the time they get to gbp theyre out of business on new york " a spokeswoman for british airways roseanne crossey declined to discuss financials for specific routes saying only that "the london new york route is very important for us " she did point out that ba flies "something like flights a week from london to new york and an equal number in the reverse direction which means our customers can have flexibility in their travel arrangements " taken together eos maxjet and silverjet currently offer about a third as many flights as british airways not to mention the other legacy carriers adding flight frequency and destinations would get the industry goliaths dander up even more but its also the only way for them to grow maxjet already offers a flight to washington dulles five days a week and a flight to las vegas twice weekly all departing from london eos while confirming that it is in the market for more aircraft that could be used on unspecified new routes currently offers two flights from london to new york and return on most days silverjet hopes to add two more daily flights to new york by years end and two daily flights from london to a second destination by the end of there are other obstacles eos and maxjet fly into londons stansted airport and silverjet into the luton airport which are more out of the way than heathrow and gatwick they aim to make up for the inconvenience with quicker check in and boarding processes and by emphasizing on time arrivals and departures the latter will be boosted by the fact that stansted and particularly luton have less traffic than londons larger airports meaning there are fewer external factors on whether flights are on time but thats also a negative factor for connecting passengers from luton for example one can fly direct to countries in or near europe but not to key cities such as brussels frankfurt milan and zurich stansted offers more connecting flights but the vast majority are with low cost carriers that often fly into secondary airports that doesnt mesh well with an all premium model particularly eoss upmarket version then again if this were a perfect idea it would have been exploited long ago investors will have their chance to weigh in as silverjet is already listed on the london stock exchanges aim and maxjet is mulling an ipo for later this year some wise men have long forsworn betting on airlines but there will always be someone willing to take a chance on flights of fancy or fortune mr wingfield is an editorial page writer based in brussels for the
