politics &amp economics biden seeks wider support for troop surge resolution washington the senate foreign relations committee approved a nonbinding resolution that challenges president bushs iraq policy and will provoke a major floor debate next week when democrats hope to get more republicans to buck the administration the committee vote gives chairman joseph biden d del a solid foothold from which to begin talks with republicans who share his concern about sending more u s troops to try to quell sectarian violence in baghdad chief among these is sen john warner r va former chairman of the senate armed services committee who last evening introduced an alternative resolution also challenging the increased commitment of troops merging the two to achieve a larger consensus is the democrats goal and the quickest route may be to embrace much of mr warners proposal with some changes "its pretty good but its not perfect " said majority leader harry reid d nev mr reid will play an increasing role with mr biden in trying to reach some common ground but he must walk a fine line the new senate majority is quickly learning what a rocky road it can be en route to building the bipartisan relationships it promised to nurture among the republicans on foreign relations only nebraska sen chuck hagel supported the committee resolution for example and the vote followed a roll call on the senate floor in which just five republican senators joined an effort to bring to a vote a house passed bill raising the federal minimum wage just as republicans appeared wary of challenging the president following his state of the union address democrats faced criticism for being too intent on having their way regarding the minimum wage bill for example republicans complained that mr reid was backtracking on promises to couple &# billion of tax breaks with the measure which would gradually raise the minimum wage &# an hour over the next two years yesterdays vote makes it almost certain such a bill will now emerge from the senate but minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky complained that it is "somewhat hypocritical" for democrats to argue "that we ought to have a bipartisan package and then vote to eliminate it " as for iraq the biden hagel alliance was crucial to jump starting the senate debate but the white house hopes to keep mr warner out of any talks that could lead to the strongest slap yet by congress of the presidents iraq policy "im a free man " virginias senior senator said in an interview yesterday but he is cautious about negotiations "at the moment i see no basis for me to alter it " he said and republican moderates will defer to his judgment "john warner is going to set the strategy " said sen susan collins r maine in an interview with cnn vice president cheney was dismissive of the senate debate saying mr bush "has made his decision we need to get the job done " mr cheneys attitude could compound democratic fears already that mr warners resolution is too deferential to the president in its tone and if the virginian becomes a one man standard of whats "bipartisan" he could insist on conditions that make it harder for mr reid to hold onto his liberal members nonetheless the republicans proposal actually goes further than mr biden on military matters even addressing the rules of engagement for u s troops in iraq and the administration also cant ignore the growing skepticism among foreign relations panelists who stood with the president yesterday indiana sen richard lugar the ranking republican said some of the assumptions in the presidents plan were "dubious " and on a vote the panel rejected an effort to add language committing the senate to never cut off funds for the war "it is an inverted political logic for people to basically say that we have to continue doing this for the good of the troops " said sen james webb d va "we are not continuing this war for the troops the troops are fighting this war on our behalf because we are continuing it "
