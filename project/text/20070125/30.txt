davos the world economic forum the daily davos updates from the world economic forum postmaster has parcel of business to discuss where are some of the key issues facing the u s postal service sorted out in davos switzerland of course the mail carriers chief executive and u s postmaster general john e potter attending his fifth consecutive world economic forum has key business to discuss at the mountaintop resort last night he was to meet with logistics and airline executives including fedex corp chairman frederick w smith and dhl express ceo john mullen to discuss the stalled "open skies" deal between the u s and the european union antiterrorism measures and other issues unfortunately for mr potter massachusetts democratic rep edward j markey a frequent davos goer isnt attending this year "markeys been pushing to pull u s mail off of commercial flights " mr potter said "i cornered him about it last year " in mr markeys absence mr potter might try having a stern chat with leaders from the organization of petroleum exporting countries attending this years summit "well see what opec has to say every time oil goes up one cent it costs us &# million " mr potter said shaking his head adam cohen prepared to take power the prize for most determined to get to davos has to go to serbias bozidar djelic who arrived at the world economic forums conference just a day after early results from elections on sunday set off what promises to be a fierce battle over whether mr djelic or his rival vojislav kostunica becomes the countrys next prime minister "theres a big value for me being in davos i can see european commissioner for enlargement olli rehn and hes a very important guy for serbia right now " said mr djelic a former serbian finance minister who recently resigned from credit agricole to run for office again under mr kostunicas outgoing government mr rehn last year halted european union association talks with serbia because mr kostunica failed to deliver gen ratko mladic indicted for war crimes in the yugoslav wars to the hague for trial how to handle mr mladic is the clearest difference separating mr djelic and his democratic party which roughly doubled its vote in sundays election from mr kostunicas democratic serbia party whose share of the vote declined sharply "our government would do the same for mladic as it did for former serbian strongman slobodan milosevic " said mr djelic who hopes serbia can now restart talks with the eu and secure candidate status by the end of the year he also aims to go forward with a range of privatizations already in the pipeline the largest would be the sale of to of nis serbias roughly &# billion state oil company russias oao lukoil has expressed interest in nis as have several central european energy companies and mr djelic said he hopes one or two western oil majors would join the bidding too marc champion crashing the party it isnt unusual to see falun gong setting up anti china protests in big cities such as new york in hong kong this unusual spiritual practice cum political movement acts out alleged chinese atrocities in the middle of busy commercial districts such as causeway bay their posters virtually dripping in blood leave little to the imagination and stop shoppers cold the group believes in levitation practices meditation and breathing exercise and is viewed as "an evil cult" by the chinese government which has banned the movement falun gong falls into that large group of organized activities that arent sanctioned by the central government and implicitly pose a threat to authoritarian control but what is it doing here in this fancy little ski burg where the narrow main drag is framed by rolex and fur caps and where a policeman needs to stop the two way traffic flow to let the municipal bus squeak by there they are posters and all decrying chinas crackdown on falun gong the governments alleged harvesting of human organs for profit and any number of other presumed offenses the demonstration near the world economic forums annual gathering represents a thorn in beijings side falun gong continues to grow outside of china using its affiliated newspaper web sites and satellite tv station to propagate its message it sues the government in foreign courts and it spars with chinese diplomats entangling them in public spats here in davos the tiny protest contrasts starkly with chinas large role in the proceedings the conference hall is filled with business people who see their profits increasingly entwined with china trade officials looking for market access to the behemoth and diplomats focused on chinas growing fleet of submarines and its recent missile test that stunningly knocked a satellite out of the sky the many panels about china discuss its awe inspiring growth its product innovation and its slow motion evolution into a super power the drawbacks of authoritarianism and abridgement of human rights arent high on the agenda john bussey bottled or tap every year since there have been two global gabfests designed to examine and improve the state of the world the long established world economic forum which gathers the global elite in switzerland and the newer world social forum held at shifting locations around the world their participants dont like each other but they do have some things in common this year for example several groups in davos are pushing initiatives designed to improve the delivery of clean water to the developing world meanwhile in nairobi kenya water focused nongovernmental organizations are pushing their own initiatives to the same end at the "other" event both sides cite the same shocking figures more than one billion people in the world have no access to clean water and of deaths from water related diseases in the developing world occur in children under years old that concern however is where the similarities end the safe water network a consortium of corporate leaders from pepsico inc chairman steve reinemund to actor businessman paul newman yesterday launched a month initiative in davos to field test new portable water purification technology that cleans about gallons of water a day roughly enough for a village of people the goal is that once tested the deka research &amp development device about the size of a small refrigerator can be rolled out in big numbers it requires small amounts of electricity but no filters and little maintenance the group says coca cola co meanwhile has an established program to deliver clean water to developing communities so far spending &# million in countries but these initiatives get little applause from nonprofits discussing the clean water crisis in nairobi wenonah hauter executive director of u s based nonprofit food and water watch calls the &# million "a drop in the bucket " "coke introduces this somewhere like davos as a way of putting a happy face on things they are doing like pushing sales of bottled water in these countries " she said in an interview ms hauters main goal is to get private companies out of the business of delivering water she argues that international monetary fund programs to encourage developing countries to privatize their water systems are damaging because they will raise the cost of water to poor people as companies seek profits "if someone said to me there would be a government infrastructure project to supply water to these one billion people on a reasonable time frame id sign up " said bill parrett global ceo of consultancy deloitte touche tomahatsu which is providing the safe water network with research muscle on the ground to identify locations to pilot the deka water purifiers "unfortunately it just isnt that simple " marc champion
