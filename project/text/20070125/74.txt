mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q can we run our old programs in the new windows vista can we use our old peripherals a vista should be compatible with most software that runs on windows xp i tested a handful of these programs including the firefox web browser microsoft office and and apples itunes and all worked fine however in any transition between operating system versions some programs get broken especially older ones you will likely need to buy new security programs for instance peripheral hardware is another matter it depends on having the right software drivers special small programs that control hardware for vista many hardware companies still are completing these drivers so some functionality may be missing for instance while vista was able to use my hewlett packard printer it didnt have the driver for my exact model so i couldnt get the printer to print on both sides of the page this driver update situation will likely persist for months q in your review of the new microsoft vista you said that "some regular users may need vista ultimate if their companies have particular network configurations that make it impossible to connect to the company network from home with home basic or home premium " can you elaborate a some companies require that employees logging in from home be able to do something called "joining a domain " this practice makes it easier for network administrators to control access to various items on the corporate network microsoft doesnt consider this capability to be consumer functionality so it isnt included in the new vista home basic or home premium editions just as it wasnt included in windows xps home edition to get this domain joining capability you could use windows vistas business edition but it may be hard to find a consumer personal computer with that edition installed and this edition lacks some consumer features that are in home premium so for many consumers in this position the best choice probably is the ultimate edition if you have the extra money it requires not all corporate networks require domain joining and even some that do include ways around it if you must often log into a company network from home a good rule of thumb is this if you are getting in with windows xp home then vista basic or premium should work fine if your company required you to use xp professional then you probably need vista business or ultimate to be certain ask your network administrator at work q will windows vista run on a macintosh a parallels inc the company that makes the parallels software for running windows on a mac says its product already can run vista apple which makes the free boot camp software for running windows on a mac hasnt said if boot camp can run vista or whether it plans to add vista capability either now or when it folds boot camp into its forthcoming leopard operating system this coming spring but i would be very surprised if boot camp wasnt updated at some point to run vista you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
