weighing options to fibroid surgery associated press women who had less invasive treatment for painful uterine fibroids did about as well as those who had surgery including hysterectomy suggests a new study that lays out the options for a troubling condition affecting millions of women uterine fibroids are common among women of child bearing age nearly develop these noncancerous growths in the uterus that often dont cause any symptoms while the most common treatment is surgery to remove tumors that cause extreme pain some women choose a gentler procedure that allows them to keep their uterus however the study found there were some trade offs to the popular procedure known as uterine artery embolization while embolization patients spent far less time in the hospital they also were more likely to need a repeat treatment although the study didnt address whether embolization can preserve fertility it adds to growing evidence that this less drastic approach is a safe alternative to hysterectomy "for some women retaining a uterus is much more important than avoiding repeat surgery particularly for younger women " said james spies a georgetown university radiologist who had no role in the new research fibroids are noncancerous growths of muscle fibers inside the uterus that can range from a quarter inch in size to as large as a cantaloupe for decades hysterectomy removal of the uterus was the only option of the roughly hysterectomies performed yearly in the u s about a third are due to fibroids since the s the popularity of uterine artery embolization has steadily grown an estimated to embolizations are done each year in the u s according to the society of interventional radiology the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists says that while embolization is an option for women with fibroids theres not enough evidence to show that its safe for women who want to get pregnant the procedure involves making a small nick in the groin and inserting a catheter in the artery using real time imaging doctors then blast tiny pellets into the uterine artery to cut off the blood supply that feeds the fibroids over time these tumors shrink and die the new study published in todays new england journal of medicine randomly assigned women to embolization and to surgery the patients were in hospitals across the united kingdom most in the surgery group had hysterectomies while a few had myomectomies surgical removal of the fibroids while leaving the uterus intact many women can get pregnant after having a myomectomy but theres a chance the fibroids might return both groups of patients rated pain levels mental health and recovery process among other factors after a year of follow up researchers found no significant difference in the quality of life for either group however the embolization group recovered faster with the median hospital stay one day compared with five days in the surgery group despite the faster recovery in the embolization group were re admitted to the hospital after a year including who needed a repeat procedure or hysterectomy because of recurrent symptoms
