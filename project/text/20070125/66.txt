possible musicians with their current audition system applicants generally have minutes to perform before a committee of musicians who then decide whether to send them to additional rounds musicians are questioning that system in a weeklong panel on polyphonic org a discussion site for orchestra players "we often overlook how different our hiring processes look than those in other high skill occupations " writes the moderator robert levine principal violist for the milwaukee symphony orchestra "surgeons are not hired after a minute demonstration of their surgical skills " among the concerns a brief solo bit doesnt demonstrate other skills such as personality and the ability to play well with others for most of the th century auditions were closed based on recommendations to the

republican army in ireland in the algerian revolution and fidel castro in cuba in for these reasons mr stoker is betting on the rise in u s troop levels to succeed in iraq with two major caveats the u s is dealing with sectarian strife along with an insurgency also insurgencies typically take eight to years to die out and the u s government might have squandered the goodwill it needs to keep the
