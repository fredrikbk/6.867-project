my country needs help today the french capital plays host to an international donor conference whose aim is lebanons long term economic stability the conference dubbed "paris iii " will be attended by representatives from approximately countries as well as from international financial institutions this is a critical moment for the international community to support the lebanese peoples choice for democracy peace and stability the friends of my country who will gather in paris know how much is at stake lebanon is truly at a crossroads the choices and actions lebanese government officials and their supporters in the international community make are critical for what my country will look like in the future this conference will be decisive for the future of lebanon as a democratic and moderate arab country with a liberal economy and as a beacon of coexistence and tolerance for the entire region there are two competing visions for lebanon today one is a vision of freedom peace prosperity democracy and independence from outside interference the other is a vision of conflict economic paralysis oppression and hegemony by lebanons neighbors the late pope john paul ii praised lebanon for the example it set for the world through the peaceful coexistence brotherhood and cooperation among its various religions and sects this view was shared by my father the late prime minister rafiq hariri who was assassinated in beirut on feb a despicable act which only served to unite the lebanese people who knew that my father dedicated his life to our countrys independence and sovereignty the lebanese people chose the vision of peace independence and unity when they rallied after the assassination of my father but while the people of lebanon are free today we are not free of foreign intervention unfortunately after the devastating israeli war last summer the lebanese people today face another critical challenge fueled by outside interference in our internal affairs outside powers are supporting a move by a coalition of lebanese parties to topple the elected government through street demonstrations and other activities ostensibly calling for more power sharing but the real goal is to prevent the establishment of the u n endorsed international tribunal which would try those individuals responsible for the assassination of prime minister hariri and which would finally put an end to a culture of impunity in lebanon which has witnessed so many horrific political assassinations that have gone unpunished the other goal of the opposition is to prevent the full implementation of u n security council resolution which demands that the lebanese government be in full control of the entire country including southern lebanon at paris iii today the lebanese government will present its reform program and hopes that an international consensus around lebanon will help put its economy back on the path to recovery so we can rebuild in the weeks prior to paris the government supported by the majority in parliament put forth a strategy to continue the countrys economic growth and job creation programs as a way forward despite the political standoff we currently face we intend to work with our friends in the international community at paris iii to offer the lebanese people an alternative to the chaos that others seek to sow in lebanon yet it will not be the first time the international community has come together to help rebuild lebanon three conferences were held previously the first was the friends of lebanon summit in washington in hosted by the u s state department it brought lebanon much needed economic aid and political support the next two conferences paris i and paris ii were hosted by frances president jacques chirac in and they brought economic aid in the form of grants and projects to help stabilize the lebanese economy and thus inject it with enough confidence to generate respectable economic growth and the return of significant international investment paris iii is a continuation of the last three conferences and of prime minister hariris legacy more importantly it is a testament to the tremendous work of the democratic lebanese government and the resilience of the lebanese people this resiliency will prevail and i predict lebanon once again will be able to extract itself from its difficulties and meet its challenges lebanons greatness lies in its people and its rich history and its values these are the treasures we are trying to preserve there is much at stake at paris iii for all of us we hope the international community fully understands the historic importance of the path which the lebanese people have chosen a path towards true sovereignty democracy pluralism and prosperity and we hope our friends will stand with us mr hariri is the majority leader of lebanons national parliament
