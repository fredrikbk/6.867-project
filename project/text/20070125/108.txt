soccer samba and outsourcing brazil hopes its strength in computers makes it the india of the americas sao paulo brazil robert lazarski a computer programmer from denver met a brazilian girl on a train in europe soon they married and moved to a beach city on brazils northern coast and mr lazarski was looking for work so he hung out a shingle on the internet outsourcing mr lazarski who is and sports shoulder length blond hair says his business writing software for small u s companies is doing well after a slow start and he enjoys brazils "better weather and a better quality of life everything has worked out quite well " outsourcing seems to be working out well for south americas most populous nation too with a spate of information technology deals brazil appears poised to be latin americas big winner in the global outsourcing boom last year gap inc moved computer work to brazil as part of a year &# billion contract with international business machines corp whirlpool corp manages corporate data here and some smaller companies are using brazil to try outsourcing for the first time with time zones and a culture closer to those of the u s than bangalore or beijing small operators such as mr lazarski and multinationals including accenture ltd and ibm are betting that brazil could quickly become latin americas major hub for inexpensive corporate support work and a top five location world wide brazilian owned firms which are tiny by global standards are also trying to get business in the u s two years ago politec ltda launched a "near shore initiative" to get work from u s corporations and says that so far it has several small contracts worth &# million each but expects to be a banner year brazils chances in the outsourcing market are a spillover of indias success while brazil isnt as cheap as india wages here are still substantially lower than in the u s major indian firms such as tata group made doing computer and office work for less abroad into a huge business now the &# billion market is ballooning at more than a year too fast for india to keep pace according to the everest group lp a dallas based consultancy that advises companies on how to outsource brazils major selling point is that its big cities are just one to three hours ahead of new york depending on the time of year that compares with or hours for india another pitch heard frequently is "shared values " a reference to cultural mismatches that have sometimes gummed up projects in asia "yes in brazil typically means yes in india it may mean no " says peter bendor samuel everests chief executive unlike india brazil already has a large domestic market for computers and services worth about &# billion a year according to estimates that means many big technology companies already have a brazilian presence now some are quickly redeploying to capture international jobs for instance in ibm began putting &# million into its brazil operations based principally in its former computer factory outside of sao paulo brazils commercial capital staffing has grown quickly since them ibm added people last year in brazil to bring its total to mostly to handle new work from clients such as whirlpool the appliance maker had been paying ibm to provide desktop support in portuguese for its brazilian division so when it decided in to outsource management of some of its u s computer operations that work also landed in brazil says brent glendening a whirlpool vice president for global information systems whirlpool didnt answer questions about u s layoffs associated with the deals outsourcing companies say their biggest stumbling block is that the only things many americans have heard about brazil are its soccer prowess and its samba music or its violent slums "the first question is is it safe the second is when do we go to rio " says james bergamini a former lucent technologies executive who recently started a software firm daitan labs outside of sao paulo to burnish brazils profile the government and a new trade organization brasscom paid consulting firm a t kearney inc to create a road map for brazils industry and launched a series of presentations at conferences and for companies last year in the u s now industry consultants are starting to talk up brazil and predict will be the year it gains recognition as an outsourcing destination ironically brazils technology sector got a big boost from its chaotic past during the s and s a ban on importing some business computers spurred domestic manufacturing and to cope with runaway inflation big banks had to develop sophisticated computer systems "the government would call on friday and say that on monday the currency will have three less digits " says ricardo saur executive director of brasscom as a result the country has more programming talent available than regional rivals skilled mexican workers tend to drain northward to the u s and chiles citizenry though well educated numbers only million compared with brazils million that leaves brazil as the top choice for staffing big "factories " industry lingo for the campus like centers where workers monitor computer systems write software or handle calls recently indian firms have started making moves in brazil as well in june wipro technologies a division of bangalores wipro ltd paid &# million for a portuguese software company taking on staffers in brazil sudip banerjee wipro technologies president for enterprise solutions says plans call for the brazilian foothold to rapidly grow to people brazil brings its own national quirks to the globalization game brazilian executives kiss and hug one another in the office in a video produced by ibm for visiting americans viewers are cautioned that brazilians are likely to be late to meetings make a lot of eye contact and dont try to make business points with "charts and data " the video advises mr lazarski who started his software company brazil outsourcing llc two and a half years ago says he did it as a way to earn u s dollars overseas he charges &# an hour to create web pages and database programs for several u s clients that is about twice what he could earn locally but less than half what a u s programmer would cost "i am making twice as much money and they are paying " says mr lazarski who lives near the beach in fortaleza brazil isnt as inexpensive as it once was however the value of the real the brazilian currency has climbed steeply against the dollar since as brazils economy has stabilized factor in rising wages and brazils punishing taxes and some companies think the picture is mixed "will it still be a competitive offshore destination over time i see that changing " says stephen heidt vice president of service delivery operations at electronic data systems corp a business service company with &# billion in revenue the plano texas company has people in brazil but is hedging its bets by expanding two centers it operates in argentina analysts who are bullish on brazil think the country can be highly competitive and can capture as much as &# billion in international outsourcing work by up from about half a billion today
