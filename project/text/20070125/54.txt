consultant low cost nail salons are a big part of the growth ms king says so we decided to test the services at different price levels to compare the experiences and see whether high end nails held up significantly better than their lower end counterparts we visited four salons and had one come for an at home treatment at each we asked for a basic manicure pedicure overall we were surprised at how little the services varied from one end of the spectrum to the other basic treatments always included a nail filing and cuticle trim a quick rub across rough spots on our feet with a pumice a brief hand and foot rub and polish the big difference lay in the ambience and comfort of the salons and in minor details such as how diligently the manicurist buffed away rough spots and how attentive they were we learned that the experience didnt necessarily improve as the cost rose we also learned in a hurry that if you peck away at a computer keyboard for a living its hard to keep fingernails looking
