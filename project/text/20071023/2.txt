a kurdish lesson a debate among u s military brass over whether to declare victory over al qaeda in iraq coincides with threats by turkey to strike terrorist camps in northern iraq belonging to the kurdistan workers party or pkk note the irony the pkk which in recent days has killed scores of turkish soldiers was itself declared dead as a terrorist group in there are excellent reasons to avoid pronouncements concerning aqis defeat one is to deny the group the chance to offer testaments in blood to its own resilience a second is to avoid another political embarrassment of the "mission accomplished" kind but the main reason is that the experience of terrorist organizations world wide shows that even in defeat they are rarely truly finished like douglas macarthurs old soldiers terrorist groups never die at best they just fade away some examples in its heyday in the s perus maoist shining path was every bit as brutal as al qaeda the capture of its charismatic leader former philosophy professor abimael guzman was supposed to have dealt a fatal blow to the groups capacity to operate as was the capture seven years later of his successor oscar ramirez yet as recently as last year the peruvian government was forced to declare a state of emergency in the huanuco region to deal with terrorist activities by the group or take the taliban in april american gen david barno told reporters he believed that with the exception of a few bitter enders the taliban would be a memory within two years the opposite happened in the rate of terrorist attacks in afghanistan soared and the bush administration was forced to deploy additional troops to recover territory lost to the taliban and turn back their anticipated spring offensive what about the pkk late in turkey massed troops on its border with syria with the declared intention of expelling the pkk and its leader abdullah ocalan from damascus if the syrians didnt do so themselves a banner headline in the turkish paper hurriyet declared "were going to say shalom to the israelis on the golan heights " the late syrian strongman hafez assad got the message and sent ocalan packing he was eventually captured by turkish intelligence in nairobi and sentenced to death by a turkish court commuted to a life sentence when turkey abolished the death penalty in ocalan has since apologized to the turkish people for the deaths he caused in the s and s and called for a peaceful solution to the kurdish issue the pkk itself declared a ceasefire that should have been the end of it as turkish analyst soner cagaptay of the washington institute for near east policy observes ocalan was a cult of personality figure in an organization that unlike the cellular structure of al qaeda was run along strictly hierarchical lines for the next few years the turkish government made real if limited strides in accommodating peaceful ethnic kurdish cultural demands in education and broadcasting what remained of the pkk or so fighters mainly retreated to northern iraq where their bases were attacked by turkish forces no fewer than times so might things have remained had the u s invasion of iraq not rearranged the strategic chessboard the turks did not help themselves by failing to support the war which caused strains with washington and prevented them from carrying out further cross border raids that in turn created an opening for iran which until then had been the pkks sole remaining state sponsor concerned about its isolation in the region and sensing an opportunity to make common cause with the moderately islamist government of recep tayyip erdogan tehran abruptly switched sides going so far as to shell pkk positions in northern iraq not surprisingly the turks began to take a more favorable view of iran the u s role is scarcely more creditable the ankara government has been pressing the bush administration to hit pkk bases for at least four years the administration has responded with a combination of empty promises of future action and excuses that u s forces are already overstretched in iraq for the turks who contribute more than troops to natos mission in afghanistan u s nonfeasance is a mystery if not an outright conspiracy "how is it that turkey fights americas terrorists but america does not fight turkeys terrorists " is how mr cagaptay sums up the prevailing mood yet the real mystery isnt u s behavior which was mainly dictated by a desire not to rock the boat in what was at least until this month the only relatively stable region of iraq it is the forbearance shown to the pkk by massoud barzani kurdistans president who has otherwise sought to cultivate better relations with ankara and kurdish moderates in turkey and who would have much to lose if an invading turkish army turned his province into a free fire zone one theory is that mr barzani wants to use the pkk as a diplomatic card to be exchanged for turkish concessions in some future negotiation but all that depends on his ability to rein in the pkk at the last minute and avert a turkish invasion yesterdays kidnapping or killing of another eight turkish troops puts that in doubt meanwhile the pkk has fully reconstituted itself as an effective fighting force under the leadership of murat karayilan who was canny enough to see congresss armenian genocide resolution as an opportunity to take scissors to the already frayed u s turkish relationship the resolution was turned back at the th hour but it remains to be seen whether it has already done its damage all the more reason then for the u s to pre empt the turks by taking the decisive action against the pkk it has promised for too long but the story of the pkks resurgence should also remind us of the dangers of premature declarations of victory against terrorist groups especially when such declarations foster the illusion that you can finally come home against this kind of enemy there are no final victories and no true homecomings and no real alternatives other than to keep on fighting
