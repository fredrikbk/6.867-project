mixed media news magnate baits beijing by pairing politics and sex hong kong publisher agitates for democracy allies fear a backlash hong kong late last month hong kong media magnate jimmy lais reporters were among the first in the world to sneak into tightly controlled myanmar to cover brutal crackdowns on antigovernment demonstrators his apple daily newspaper ran their stories and photos of bloodied monks on the front page for three days and pointed the finger at china to stop the violence the next week apples cover moved onto other priorities a british teenagers belly button ring had gotten lodged inside her body and apple had front page photos diagrams and interviews with local starlets about their own belly button rings mr lai long a combative agitator for press and political freedoms in china has remade hong kongs media landscape by pairing two unlikely subjects democracy and sex his next media inc publications frequently provoke beijing and have stoked antigovernment rallies in hong kong in political reports often interspersed with racy photos or consumer reviews of local strip clubs and saunas mr lais public battles illuminate the uncomfortable relationship between hong kong and the chinese government since the city was handed over from british control years ago mr lai himself has become an awkward liability to some democracy advocates and journalists who worry that his excesses will distract from their cause or spark a government backlash in hong kongs relative oasis of free speech last year a lai magazine cover featured a year old chinese pop star in a soaked through nightgown and sparked a child pornography charge by hong kongs prosecutor a court sided with mr lai but a government appeal is pending a cover photo last year of another pop star changing clothes forced mr lai to issue an apology after a private conversation with hong kongs roman catholic cardinal and a public march on mr lais office led by martial arts star jackie chan mr lai is "both a devil and a saint " says ying chan founder of the journalism and media studies program at hong kong university "does he stand for something good in hong kong yes does he stand for something bad yes " mr lais success has triggered his competitors including the top selling oriental daily news to adopt his publications risque celebrity centered style a conversion often described by local journalists as "apple ization " readers gobble up apple daily hong kongs no newspaper by readership and mr lais three top selling magazines even as many decry the paparazzi style journalism he has introduced to the chinese speaking world mr lai whose &# million stake in next media may make him the wealthiest media owner in greater china doesnt see any contradiction "just because we promote democracy doesnt mean we have to be puritan " he said in an interview in his backyard greenhouse on a hong kong hilltop surrounded by his collection of birds chirping in cages folding political coverage inside a titillating package is "the cross i have to carry " he said "were the bad boys on the block were the opposition media who cares what you write if nobody reads it " a spokesman in beijing for the hong kong and macau affairs office placed next media among "a few individual media companies that dont abide by the basic journalistic principle of truthfulness and even intentionally create fake news " the beijing official said the citys "basic law " or mini constitution guaranteeing press freedom doesnt need to be changed to address such companies but he added "we do not welcome them " unlike most other hong kong publications next medias staff arent allowed by beijing to officially open bureaus and operate in the mainland mr lai said his publications twice apologized in the s for publishing two false or misleading reports one claiming a tycoon had cancer and another in which apple daily set up a photo of a man with prostitutes suggesting a reason for his wifes recent suicide but mr lai challenged beijing to "show one piece of evidence" of false reports since then since the handover from british to chinese rule hong kongs press so far has avoided the clampdown on its freedom some feared but some dissenting voices have lowered most of the citys publications are owned by companies or families with ties to beijing or aspirations to expand their business in the booming mainland many journalists describe a creeping self censorship practiced by publications in order to curry favor with beijing and advertisers one recent survey by the hong kong journalists association found that of the citys reporters had "practiced self censorship" themselves or seen it done by their colleagues a situation the union called "worrying and alarming " one example according to the association few of the citys chinese language dailies prominently reported when ma lik chairman of a political party with ties to beijing told reporters in may that the deadly government crackdown on protestors in tiananmen square shouldnt be labeled a massacre by contrast apple daily covered mr mas comments with a giant front page headline reading "ma lik cold blooded " then on the june anniversary of tiananmen square page a of apple daily featured an essay by a man who was jailed because of the protest and another urging readers to attend a yearly candlelight vigil for democracy on the next spread that day apples daily quarter page picture of a foreign actress or model in a bikini a feature dubbed "windows on the world " mr lai years old was born in guangzhou near hong kong in southern china in to wealthy parents who were stripped of their assets with the communist partys takeover the next year too poor to go to school year old mr lai got a job carrying bags at a train station where he encountered travelers from outside communist china "the baggage smelled so well during the famine wow " he says "i was sure the outside world was better than the lies we were being fed by the communist government " his first encounter with a piece of chocolate offered to him by a well dressed hong kong man convinced him to flee china at age mr lai says he traveled to macau at the time a portuguese colony by boat and bus he says then smuggled himself in a fishing vessel to hong kong in the british colony he worked in garment factories then worked in new yorks garment industry as hong kong factories representative to retailers in new york he was exposed by friends to the ideas of economist friedrich hayek known for his defense of free market capitalism and critique of socialism today his company offices feature statues of mr hayek and of economist milton friedman whom he later got to know personally in mr lai launched a hong kong casual fashion chain reminiscent of gap stores in the u s he named it giordano after a new york pizzeria he kept a napkin from the restaurant because he liked the italian sound of the name he said giordano became one of asias largest retail chains by targeting younger members of a growing middle class the affairs of mainland china were a distant concern to him until the tiananmen square demonstrations mr lai says then he joined hong kong street protests in support of the student movement he hoisted banners in giordano outlets calling for chinese leader deng xiaoping to "step down " and sold t shirts echoing the same slogan the next year mr lai used some of his giordano fortune to found his first magazine next weekly "to participate in this moment of chinas opening up " he says "by delivering information you are delivering choice and choice is freedom " next weekly had political coverage but also emphasized consumer news and exposes on the rich and famous mr lai says he wanted to "put fragments of every magazine into one " in he launched a second magazine easy finder with a focus on celebrity news both quickly spawned copycats meanwhile mr lai was expanding giordano on the mainland but in the government abruptly closed a beijing store a move widely interpreted as payback for his criticism of the government he says he was relayed a message from beijing that he should divest himself of the company the ministry of commerce in beijing did not respond to a request to comment for this story mr lai gradually sold his stake reaping &# million the chain has since grown into a big mainland presence in he launched apple daily charging the equivalent of about cents at the newsstand when his rivals were charging about cents the paper emerged from a long price war as the second biggest seller mr lai also expanded his reach to taiwan launching taiwan next weekly in and taiwan apple daily in which both became no the islands staid news environment in which people largely chose their papers by their political affiliation was ambushed by mr lais colorful mix says serena chen the chairwoman of the association of taiwanese journalists "everyone thought party affiliation was most important until apple daily came along and said whatever the audience wants thats what well give them " ms chen says nexts taiwan publications cover politics but arent tied to any party on july apple daily rallied hong kong readers to protest because of unhappiness with beijing appointed chief executive tung chee hwa complaints included poor handling of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars and the local governments antitreason proposal that could limit the rights of journalists and others to criticize the government apple printed a pull out poster of mr tung with a pie in his face the message across the top in chinese said "we cant take it any more " the poster became a popular symbol of that protest which helped oust mr tung the antitreason measure was put on hold that year apple also broke the story that hong kongs financial secretary had bought a lexus just weeks before he raised the tax on new luxury vehicles in the scandal that ensued the official eventually resigned mr lai contends his political coverage has made next media the target of an advertising boycott by some of the citys biggest conglomerates many of which have close ties to beijing each year mr lai estimates ads lost to other publications cost his company about &# million "if you read apple daily you would almost think there are no real estate businesses in hong kong or supermarkets in hong kong " mr lai says some media buyers say there are companies that choose not to advertise in next media publications but they dont see evidence of an organized boycott mr lais problems escalated after the cover photo of the wet teen star was published in the summer of in easy finder hong kongs no magazine a court ruled in april that the image wasnt obscene because of testimony that the teen wasnt nude but wearing a flesh colored latex bra the hong kong public prosecutors office continues to pursue the case and declined to comment after the second photo of a singer backstage also ran in easy finder in august some celebrities led by film star mr chan protested at next medias headquarters womens and christian groups called for a law restricting paparazzi and hong kong chief executive donald tsang said the outcry sped up a government review of privacy and media laws a spokesman said a move to protect privacy shouldnt be viewed as an "attempt to regulate media content " outside of members of hong kongs democracy movement mr lai says he has few friends one of them is hong kong cardinal joseph zen who baptized mr lai into catholicism in and took him to visit pope benedict xvi in person last year in an interview mr zen praised mr lais stand on democracy and called any sensationalism in apple daily and its rivals the "ugly face of freedom and competition " yet he also pushed mr lai privately to apologize for the pop star photo he said martin lee a fellow catholic and founder of the hong kong democratic party also stands by mr lai arguing readers have no problem distinguishing between mr lais ideals and his more risque fare mr lee says he would "prefer" if mr lai didnt do "all of that " but adds "theres no such thing as perfection we need a newspaper like that right or wrong " increasingly the tabloid content of next media publications has overshadowed mr lais attempts to provide a credible voice in debates over chinas policies toward hong kong such as the timing to hold direct elections a recent poll by hong kong university found of respondents feel the hong kong news media overstretch and "abuse" press freedoms up from about in mr lais recent problems have made him something of an awkward liability for many of his allies "he doesnt speak for all of us " says emily lau a veteran legislator and democracy activist they also may have hurt next medias bottom line easy finder sales and ad revenue dropped in the year ended march and company profits dropped from the year earlier to about &# million mr lai noted that advertising and profits were battered across the sector but he eventually shuttered easy finder apologizing for the offending photos he replaced it with the similar looking face weekly in may "we wont use those cheap photos we wont make the same mistakes again " he said still an undertone of defiance remains a full page house ad in apple daily this spring portrayed mr lai cradling a copy of easy finder as a faceless mob hurls stones it read "let he who is without sin cast the first stone " sue feng in beijing contributed to this article
