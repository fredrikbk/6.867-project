business day sign up for the e mail here president bushs budget requests yesterday for military operations in iraq and afghanistan would bring the total cost of the wars to more than &# billion and all but assure iraq will overshadow the rest of the governments business in the coming months mr bush increased his supplemental war funding request by &# billion for a total of &# billion for the current fiscal year which ends next september most of the newly sought money &# billion would be channeled to the pentagon and fund plans essentially outlined by defense secretary robert gates in senate testimony last month government executive says much of that funding would buy armored vehicles designed to protect u s troops from mines and roadside bombs and pay for the higher operation costs due to the expanded size of the plus force currently in iraq the new york times adds the white house included items unrelated to afghanistan and the far costlier combat in iraq including &# million for a mostly undeployed u n peacekeeping mission to sudans darfur region and &# million backing u s commitments to a nuclear deal with north korea one of the smaller requests &# million for helicopters police equipment training and technical advice to help mexico fight drug cartels was also one of the most interesting it "could represent a seismic shift in relations between the two countries whose law enforcement agencies and policymakers have often bickered over the drug war as well as other hugely contentious issues such as immigration reform and trade " as the washington post notes but operations in iraq are at the heart of the bill which as the los angeles times says "appears certain to further inflame tensions between the president and his democratic critics on capitol hill who are locked in a rancorous debate over federal spending bills as well as the war " house speaker nancy pelosi was quick to compare the budget requests to mr bushs veto of a bill that would have spent &# billion for a popular health insurance program for children "demanding nearly &# billion for iraq while vetoing healthcare for million children exemplifies the bush administrations misplaced priorities " she said anticipating such criticism the president called his requests "urgent priorities of the united states" and called on congress to "fund them without delay " but the rising cost of the war in addition to jolting the iraq debate could make it harder for the white house to keep "republican moderates in line behind mr bush on domestic spending initiatives such as the child health bill " according to the wall street journal which reports that mr bush delayed yesterdays request until after the house upheld his veto of the child health care bill at the urging of house republican leaders house democrats reluctant to act on the requests unless the president changes direction on iraq have said they might pass a smaller "bridge" fund to pay for the militarys needs through the spring while mr bush wants the funding approved this year democrats say the military doesnt need it until february and dont expect to act on it until early next year the post notes and that means the debate may reach its climax just when the primaries are at the point of producing each partys presidential nomination u s critical of own contractor practices one issue likely to arise during the iraq funding debate is the role of private security companies in the wake of incidents in which blackwater usa forces killed iraqi civilians two investigations ordered by secretary of state condoleezza rice produced reports with "sharply critical judgments about the state departments performance in overseeing work done by the private companies that the government relies on increasingly in iraq and afghanistan to carry out delicate security work and other missions " the new york times reports a state department review slams the departments own security practices in iraq and describes "poor coordination communication oversight and accountability involving armed security companies like blackwater " the times says and a government audit set for release today says records of the work performed by dyncorp international another security contractor "are in such disarray that the department cannot say specifically what it received for most of the &# billion it has paid the company since to train the police officers in iraq " the times says u s resigned to possible turkish strike in iraq turkish helicopters today ferried commando units to the countrys frontier with iraq as the turkish military continued its buildup there and prepared for a possible attack against kurdish rebels across the border while foreign minister ali babacan flew to baghdad to raise pressure on iraqi officials to halt the rebels themselves the turkish daily hurriyet quoted prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as saying that u s secretary of state condoleezza rice discussed the possibility of joint u s turkish operations against the turkish kurds when they talked by phone on sunday the associated press reports within turkey news that turkish soldiers were kidnapped by militants from the kurdistan workers party known as the pkk during a weekend ambush produced more strident calls for a military incursion and cross border shelling persisted the times of london reports the turkish military says it has killed pkk rebels so far the u s too was calling on iraqi leaders to back their threats against turkish kurds with action but a senior american official tells the wall street journal the bush administration was increasingly resigned to the probability of at least a limited turkish strike in northern iraq even as a potential conflict there seemed to dominate diplomatic attention in the region "a chillingly similar battle has been under way on the iraqi border with iran " the new york times reports "kurdish guerrillas ambush and kill iranian forces and retreat to their hide outs in iraq " the u s offers iran little sympathy while tehran accuses washington of helping the iranian kurd guerrillas something the u s denies the times says european court overturns vw law the european court of justice today overturned a decades old german law that protected volkswagen from hostile takeovers and the decision opens europes biggest car maker to an almost certain takeover bid by rival german auto stalwart porsche which holds a stake in volkswagen the ruling "could have repercussions for many of europes other government protected corporate giants " dow jones newswires says since the so called vw laws sole aim is to thwart such acquisitions the law enacted after volkswagen was privatized in prevented any one shareholder from getting more than of voting rights in the company however big its stake and it let the german state of lower saxony home to volkswagens headquarters keep a controlling minority stake and seats on the companys board the
