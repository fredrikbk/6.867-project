the dollars got further to slide nearly every day in recent weeks seems to bring news that the dollar has fallen to record lows against the euro and other major currencies important factors include the feds bold but appropriate basis point cuts in the federal funds rate and the discount rate and the policies we are likely to see in coming months from the european central bank and the bank of england but to really understand the dollars future prospects we must view its recent decline in the broader context of events over the past decade as the nearby chart shows since there have three distinct phases of what i have called the dollar downdraft see accompanying table wsj oct from though the spring of there was a trend decline in the dollar against the currencies of other major countries this occurred during an initially sluggish u s recovery and an aggressive ease in fed policy that drove the fed funds rate down to and kept it there for a considerable period in as the u s expansion was robust productivity growth remained strong and the fed began hiking interest rates to normalize policy "at a measured pace " the dollar downdraft was put on hold during this period from june the first fed hike to august of the first fed pause the dollar was in a trading range neither trending up nor down a fact that surprised a market consensus going into that a dollar fall for that year was inevitable the fact that the dollar appreciated for most of illustrates that in a world of increasing global capital market integration in which the dollar remains the global reserve currency strong u s growth and rate hikes that keep u s inflation expectations anchored provide important support for the dollar also the dollar still serves as a safe haven in periods of global economic and financial stress as occurred in september and august to name just two examples since the august meeting at which the fed announced at least a pause if not an end to the interest rate hike cycle the dollar downdraft has resumed there are several reasons for this and these reasons suggest the dollar downdraft is likely to continue for some time to come first the u s economy in the second half of slipped into what has now been more than a year of below trend growth moreover this occurred in the context of buoyant global growth not only in the developing world but also in europe canada and asia this relative u s underperformance is likely to continue as the economy works through the headwinds of the housing contraction and consumer retrenchment in the face of tighter credit conditions and a soft labor market but a u s recession is not necessarily in the cards in large part because the fed will probably ease more in future months to provide insurance against an economic contraction the u s economy will be moving toward a narrower trade deficit for some time to come it appears as though the trade deficit has peaked and it starting to decline as a result of slower u s growth a robust global economy and a weaker dollar indeed all of the increase in the trade deficit between and was due to higher oil prices the non oil trade deficit has been more or less constant since and is now starting to show clear evidence of decline as the u s economy moves from being an engine of global growth to a path that is in line with the average of other major countries the trade deficit will narrow and a weaker dollar will be part of that adjustment this adjustment need not be inflationary currencies can depreciate because of bad monetary policy as was the case for the u s in the s but they can also depreciate with sound monetary policy if currency adjustment is called for as it is now to rebalance the domestic and global economies as the u s trade deficit shrinks the world financial system is undergoing an evolution as economies from asia to the middle east to europe allow more flexibility in their exchange rates and or peg them against a basket of currencies and not just the dollar reserve diversification will continue and sovereign wealth funds will likely invest across a broader range of assets than reserve managers do at present all of these developments will keep the dollar downdraft going for some time a u s inflation surge is not likely although the fed will face upward pressures on inflation from sources that were not so prominent until recent years a possible slowdown in productivity growth and booming commodity prices as well as the weaker dollar but ultimately the u s inflation rate will be up to the fed at present with core inflation measures within the fed comfort zone and payrolls contracting the fed is now rightly focused on cutting interest rates to preempt a u s recession mr clarida is professor of economics at columbia university and global strategic advisor at pimco from he served as assistant u s treasury secretary for economic policy
