the daily fix colts throttle jaguars to stay level with pats online edition on january the indianapolis colts trailed the new england patriots in the afc championship game before coming back to win and advance to the super bowl when they meet again on november it is likely neither team will have lost a game in the intervening nine and a half months last night the colts crushed the jacksonville jaguars to improve to the colts have outscored opponents by points per game and outgained them in yardage by per game thats better than every other nfl team except the pats whose respective numbers of dominance are points and yards that coupled with a tougher schedule thus far has given the pats a big lead in the inevitable annual "will they finish undefeated " idle speculation but the colts have those two additional wins last season including the super bowl against the chicago bears and columnists remember that this morning in beginning the hype for november the colts "did something the patriots have yet to do beat a formidable division rival on the road " michael wilbon writes in the washington post he adds "the colts dont seem to mind a street fight now in fact they seem to invite one as if the super bowl championship has emboldened them convinced them they can do even greater things bill belichick meanwhile seems to be challenging his patriots to play the perfect game every week " the colts appear to be even better than they were last year heading into the playoffs bob kravitz writes in the indianapolis star "theyre running the ball better theyre passing the ball better theyre better far better defending the run and the pass and theyre as good as ever on third down conversions " will the winner of the colts pats game go undefeated this season washington times columnist dan daly who thinks that game will be won by the pats says is a "likely" outcome barring injuries hes likely exaggerating for effect but he does offer the reasonable argument that several factors make an undefeated season easier than ever including the use of technology to mitigate the fluky effects of weather and officiating and the prize of home field advantage for the leagues best record and if the loser of the nov game keeps winning that will put pressure on the winner to do the same that game in january won by the colts was in the rca dome in indianapolis the miami dolphins the pats most recent victims are nine losses away from the nfls first record south florida sun sentinel columnist dave hyde thinks thats even harder to accomplish than but he also thinks the dolphins may be up to the challenge "you need years of mismanagement to lose every game in todays nfl as well as pockets of bad luck the dolphins might give it a run you would think they would be on the field one of these sundays when the other team just loses but after seven games the dolphins are winless on merit " with seconds remaining and lsu trailing auburn by one point saturday coach les miles eschewed the obvious rather than stop the clock and send out his field goal kicker for a yard attempt he directed his quarterback to loft the ball into the end zone had it not been caught the clock might have run to zero but demetrius byrd made the terrific catch lsu retained its one loss record and the baton rouge fans were quiet "when the rowdiest crowd in college football sits largely in stunned silence at one of the most memorable finishes in college football and one that could end up having a distinct impact on the national championship picture you know you have just witnessed something truly bizarre " russell levine writes on football outsiders "miles perfectly illogical call served as a metaphor for a college football season that has made a mockery of every script and blown up nearly all preconceived notions of those who follow the sport " with such madness now standard idle teams tend to benefit in the weekly rankings chris dufresne writes in the los angeles times in the polls undefeated arizona state "jumped over usc which cheapened itself with a crushing win over notre dame " mr dufresne writes "its come to this playing nobody is better than beating notre dame " the world series will dominate the fix for the next week and today we have the rockies ode to tide us over as well as an update to our postseason baseball contest but on todays final pre series off day the fix turns its attention to teams already contemplating their winter of discontent the hapless kansas city royals who could consider their losses this past season a sign of hope hired trey hillman as manager for once its a royals development that doesnt require extreme optimism to appreciate joe posnanski writes "this time the royals got the no guy " mr posnanski writes in the kansas city star "they got the hottest managing prospect around they got a year old man who has been chosen the yankees minor league manager of the year three times who has won a championship in japan and is on the cusp of another who has worked in scouting development coaching management you name it who has wowed just about everybody in the game " in cleveland poor kenny lofton is left to consider another near miss after his indians coughed up the series lead to the red sox in the alcs the dugouts jon bois considers the sad career of mr lofton in that inimitable dugout style as if the year old centerfielder was in a chat room with his self and san jose mercury news columnist mark purdy says all of baseball will have a rough winter once the sports investigation into doping reports its

adventure " "it seemed as if the summer holidays would never end and then overnight without a moment to prepare you are back at school and your favourite teacher has left and your best friend has a new best friend and the teacher you hated is in charge of your form and its raining and its tapioca and double maths " mr barnes writes hey half the fix likes maths the champions impressed will greenwood who played for england in its cup triumph "on the field they had the backbone to win under extreme pressure " mr greenwood writes "off it their shirt buttons were done up their ties on straight shoes polished they looked like a team who were proud of what they had achieved " though the victorious springboks are mostly white they were celebrated throughout its home nation "bars in soweto the sprawling black township south of johannesburg were packed on saturday with fans cheering the bok with the fervour of true believers " paul simao writes in south africas mail &amp guardian "eateries and bars in the giant indian community in durban also swayed with supporters " but for all that "south african rugby cant avoid the damning fact that in the years since rugbys separate race bodies were unified in the vision of a racially representative springbok team appears little closer " andy colquhoun writes in the daily telegraph as a result the team may be reshaped so might the sport after a cup derided by many journalists for stultifying play fixated on field position rather than flashy scoring the guardians richard williams calls the quality of play "dismal" and "terrible
