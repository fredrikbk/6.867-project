springsteen fans laudatory condemnatory i cant tell you how much i enjoyed reading steve stecklows "teaching my son to respect the boss" weekend journal oct you see i also have a son i dont think i am nearly as devoted a fan as mr stecklow i cant say that i mark my life with bruce springsteen releases and i have only been to three concerts still his column inspired me to commit to taking my son to a tour event ive managed to book three premium seats at a london show on dec the trip and the concert will be my christmas gift to the family this year i am stoked thanks for the inspiration gary n davis kuala lumpur malaysia i am years old and have been following bruce springsteen since my first concert during the "darkness on the edge of town" tour ive never missed a tour and his concerts inspire in me much of the same feelings described by mr stecklow i recently took my year old daughter and year old son to see a springsteen concert they both were reluctant to go but by the end of the show they wanted shirts my daughter proclaimed "wow that was better than the avril lavigne concert " im a big music fan and have been to many wonderful concerts still there is nothing quite like a bruce show the fun and energy are amazing taking my kids to something that was so meaningful in both my youth and adulthood was a real treat having them appreciate and enjoy it was a gift fred gruber marlton n j thank you for your article on bruce springsteen i too am a fan from way back and i even saw his legendary show at the bottom line in new york in however ive become quite disappointed in him in recent years by his overt endorsement of politicians it was always obvious to me that he was a man of the left and that was fine however once he started openly using his celebrity for political purposes he forfeited the right to be called an artist and he betrayed his calling as an artist for me it comes down to this mr springsteen wrote in one of his finest songs "land of hopes and dreams " that "this train carries saints and sinners this train carries losers and winners " but now this train is only for left wingers your article failed to take him to task for saying our soldiers are dying for a "mistake " that statement dishonors the sacrifice made by those brave men and women in iraq all of whom are volunteers i certainly can understand the desire for peace but its quite another thing to denigrate our soldiers which is what mr springsteen is doing in his song "last to die " he dishonors himself and his country by this act bruce springsteen has become a fraud its really a damn shame francis banecker philadelphia
