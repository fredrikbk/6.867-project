lenders curb new mortgages in weaker areas move may put added pressure on prices in hard hit states submarket collateral damage some lenders are now making it tougher for borrowers in softening housing markets to get a mortgage the policy is designed to keep lenders from holding the bag if home prices in those markets continue to fall and highly leveraged borrowers find themselves owing more than their home is worth but the tighter standards by discouraging home buyers could add to downward pressure on home values in already weak markets lenders such as j p morgan chase &amp co citigroup inc and wells fargo &amp co are cutting the maximum amount some borrowers can finance in counties or states where home prices are declining mortgage companies are also taking a tougher look at appraisals in housing markets with falling prices among the areas being hit by the tougher standards are parts of california florida and michigan lenders in the past have come under criticism for their failure to make loans in minority neighborhoods a practice known as "redlining " the latest round of tightening by contrast is broader and aimed at markets where home prices are falling the sharper focus on soft housing markets comes after mortgage lenders have tightened their standards for all borrowers amid a slowing housing market a widespread credit crunch and rising delinquencies

ability of even borrowers with good credit scores to buy a home if they dont have a significant down payment " says david stevens who runs the mortgage operation at long &amp foster real estate based in fairfax va last year more than one third of long &amp fosters customers put less than down mr stevens says with house prices falling lenders are looking to control their risk says doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association but "theres a little bit of a self fulfilling prophecy " he adds "if you tighten standards fewer people can qualify for a mortgage effective demand is going to be lower resulting in lower house prices " the tighter standards are already creating challenges for some borrowers james degeronimo jr a mortgage broker in cleveland says that charter one a unit of citizens financial group inc turned down one of his clients who was seeking to refinance a &# mortgage the lender didnt feel that it could get an accurate valuation of the property given the
