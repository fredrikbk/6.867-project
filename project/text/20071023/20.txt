business technology understanding what you know how business intelligence has come of age intuition is useful in business but tom davenport says it isnt enough a point reinforced recently by some big bets by giant software companies mr davenport of babson college in massachusetts is an expert on business intelligence a field that includes software that exploits data generated by other business programs to help companies monitor their operations make decisions and spot trends that could affect sales and profits he holds the title at babson of presidents distinguished professor in information technology and earlier this year co wrote "competing on analytics the new science of winning" with jeanne harris director of research for the accenture institute for high performance which has offices in new york and london the business intelligence field was attractive enough to inspire sap ag one of the companies whose programs are used to manage daily business operations this month to agree to pay &# billion for business objects sa a specialist in the area sap rival oracle corp in march agreed to pay &# billion for hyperion solutions corp another player in the market in a recent interview mr davenport discussed why the technology is attracting so much interest excerpts wsj what is business intelligence mr davenport its the systematic use of information about your business to understand report on and predict different aspects of performance historically it has had a number of names it was called decision support when i started my career its been called business intelligence for about a decade now wsj why is it so hot now mr davenport i think its some combination of the software and hardware for doing it keep getting better and there is a huge amount of data that most organizations have now you could argue that for to years organizations were just capturing and refining their data about their business and now they have finally decided maybe they can actually do something with this data to manage their business more effectively wsj what are the benefits mr davenport i define business intelligence into really two categories one is just reporting knowing what is going on in your business the benefits of that are that one you stay out of jail if you are a public company you have to report accurately on what is going on in your business two you get relatively early warning on how you are performing so you can fix the problem and you can educate mangers about your business analytics which is the other key category of business intelligence is more understanding oriented in terms of knowing what factors are really driving your business performance or prediction oriented looking forward instead of backward wsj can you give some examples of how specific kinds of businesses would use these tools in hospitality pricing and customer loyalty would be the two major areas pricing of rooms or pricing of airplane seats pricing of airplane seats was a very early use of this stuff in health care you are trying to figure out who is likely for example to get a certain disease who is likely to get diabetes a big issue going on in health care right now so you can do an analysis based on how active physically the person is how much they weigh their blood sugar levels are today and you can actually come up with a fairly good assessment of how likely a particular individual is to come down with diabetes in financial services its should i give this person a mortgage should i authorize this transaction on a credit card that has become a very analytical decision should i pay this insurance claim or is it fraudulent for retail its what price should i charge in the beginning how many of each clothing type should i have in each store and when should i mark it down and by how much wsj what technology does a company need to go down this path mr davenport the most important thing is good data now organizations still have lots and lots of it the key task is integrating it and making sure it doesnt have a lot of errors making sure its common that customer means the same thing across the entire organization so you are not comparing apples to oranges wsj is it all about technology mr davenport no not at all that was one of the things that i think was an interesting outcome of my research id say the number one factor is really a leadership dimension its how committed are a companys senior executives to fact based and analytical decision making and the whole idea of experimentation as a way to learn rather than doing it out of gut feel or intuition the easiest way is when you have a new ceo who is very quantitatively oriented and who has had experience with this people like jeff bezos at amazon com inc he was the founder but he is very mathematically inclined gary loveman is one of the best examples as the ceo of harrahs entertainment inc who has a ph d in quantitative economics from mit reed hastings at netflix inc was a high school math teacher sometimes its a struggle i remember some people at harrahs saying they did a hotel room price optimization system where the business intelligence system was recommending prices that would be charged for hotel rooms when customers would call and make reservations initially the hotel property managers would override the system because they didnt understand it and they thought their expertise and their experience was a better guide to what prices should be after some analysis they found out the system was doing a better job so they had to get a little heavy handing and say if you keep overriding these things you dont have a future at this company wsj what do you make of the sap deal to buy business objects i think its a good idea i believe that the emphasis in the world has shifted now from compiling data from transaction systems to using the data effectively sap had some capabilities for doing that but certainly i think most people would agree that they were not industry leading capabilities now with business objects i think they have a much better story about how you can use your data effectively to run your business i think its a statement that just having transaction systems is not enough and i think oracles purchase of hyperion is evidence of the same thing wsj will business intelligence and analytics software disappear as a separate category mr davenport well that is an interesting question i do believe that the goal of certainly sap and oracle to a slightly lesser degree is to start embedding business intelligence both reporting and analytics into the business process itself the world is a long way away from doing that but i believe that is the long term direction
