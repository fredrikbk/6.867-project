do you hear what i hear telling off a colleague silently bill seybolt a system administrator was recently helping one of his colleagues with a technical problem when another colleague issued a drive by insult putting down the planned upgrade to a new program "it really pierced me " mr seybolt says before responding he decided hed give himself the night to sleep on it but later he couldnt sleep coming back to the conversation "its like taking a shot of espresso " he says the conversation kept playing through his mind when he was walking his beagle mix millie "if you were here right now you know what i would tell you " he told his foe in his head ultimately his boss "talked me off the ledge " he says and he dropped the issue at work there are countless things you should and could and would have said but the tormenting fact is you didnt so hemmed in by forces such as the fragility of reputations your dependence on a paycheck or even just slow footedness you re enact one of the countless little workplace defeats in the confines of your head maybe if you think about all that conversations permutations you can right all the little workplace wrongs and then bend spoons with your mental powers the process of chewing over old conversations is referred in psychology circles as rumination its prevalent enough in the office that various leadership training programs administer personality tests asking how often you "replay an incident over and over" in your mind the idea is to probe whether someone is predisposed to festering in a cycle of anger that produces more bad thoughts that then create more anger says craig runde director of new program development at eckerd college leadership development institute st petersburg fla ruminating too much he says "keeps you stuck " that explains says mr runde why some festerers cant concentrate on the task at hand drip sarcasm and fly off the handle at the first mention of something that only to them sounds like the umpteenth time usually its when gary hauk a university vice president is in the shower or running that he spots a slight from a colleague that went over his head at the time of delivery a few weeks ago the self described grand master of the "too late retort" showed up to a roundtable discussion with an umbrella in hand due to the threat of rain "ok neville " his colleague said referring to the former u k prime minister chamberlain "why dont you put that umbrella down and take a seat " "it hit me five hours later that was a subtle dig " says mr hauk or was it "i get in the conundrum of trying to understand whether i should be angry with him " says mr hauk so he begins rescripting the conversation he would have retorted with the freudian reference to a cigar "sometimes an umbrella is just an umbrella " it would have been delivered in a playful way so his colleague could either take it as a joke or take offense "every time i shoot off one of these zingers im keeping someone awake at night " he imagines one can only hope there is hope for the ruminator in studies of buddhist monks richard davidson a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the university of wisconsin found that activity in areas of the brain associated with self focused rumination decreased among adept meditation practitioners the findings suggest that mental training can alter our propensity to second guess ourselves cognitive tasks can distract us from ourselves "thats why people do crossword puzzles and sudoku " says prof davidson mercifully you can also bore yourself out of it "its also possible that you become habituated to your own rumination " he says "and after a while it no longer has the same command it once did " still the odds are more favorable of winning arguments with people who arent there graig stettner manages money for clients he has to divine the future his clients on the other hand get to judge his decisions with the benefit of hindsight one client second guesses him so regularly that he and a colleague have dubbed him "captain hindsight " so mr stettner replays what he would have said to better defend himself against captain hindsights considerable powers to see into the recent past "we apply hindsight in our conversation about their hindsight " he says the replays have happier endings "naturally the conversations end with my clients feeble arguments being reduced to nothing " he says "i would just as soon vanquish them in my mind " he says advertising executive susan credle gets caught by her personal trainer redramatizing conversations with colleagues she doesnt see the point of actually talking about it she has already imagined all the possible responses and advice she says sometimes interactions that ms credle hasnt really had yet do get tired recently she was talking to her boss about an unpleasant chat she might need to have with one of her staffers he suggested she go talk to the person she says "i thought gosh ive already had that
