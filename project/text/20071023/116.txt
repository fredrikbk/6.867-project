the doctors office its hard to heed the experts when your kid has the cold the runny nose started in the morning by bedtime a cold had settled in my year old sons chest and a deep hacking cough could be heard throughout the house at a m my wife gave me the look that said "youre a doctor do something " that day she had heard that an expert panel recommended to the food and drug administration that cold medicines be banned for kids because they work no better than sugar pills and shouldnt be used in children younger than facing a sleepless night though we debated our options should we medicate him so we could get some shut eye or should we ride it out we opted for the safe but noisy course next thing you know hes in the bed between us coughing every two minutes with what seemed like all the muscles in his body at a m the racket woke the dog my wife took the boy downstairs to rock him in the recliner by dawn dr mom had reached her limit a dose of combination cough and cold medication was soon down the hatch after the recommendations against over the counter cold medicines came out we heeded them for less than hours in our house once my sick son took the medicine his sniffles and coughing abated a bit his symptoms returned later that day after we discontinued the treatment our experience showed that whatever mild benefits these medications offer they dont last long the risks with cough and cold medication are clear if you dont know your phenylephrine from your acetaminophen you can deliver more potency than you had intended by unknowingly combining products with similar ingredients and confusing chemical names overdoses of medication occur all too often the fda has linked over the counter medicines to pediatric deaths since most of the fatalities were in children younger than although experts say cold and cough medications dont work in kids the estimated &# billion in sales of these products each year suggests to me that at least a few people are finding some value in them but it may be for reasons you wouldnt think of right away parents often believe they are targeting cold symptoms with these medications when what they are really doing is sedating the child sedation and the potential to depress breathing represent dangerous sides of these medicines we all want safe and effective treatments for our kids but were finding out that our old way of doing things isnt as safe or effective as we thought it was back in we had to give up the old formula dimetapp elixir we used with our older kids because the phenylpropanolamine in it was linked to strokes in young women the reformulated product never seemed to dry up their noses as well as the original did pseudoephedrine sudafed is a brand name has been linked to strokes too but it is still on the market as a decongestant this medication is being replaced in products by phenylephrine which doesnt dry a runny nose up as well as pseudoephedrine does about cold and cough products are on the market and nearly all are combinations of the same handful of ingredients the main difference is the marketing nothing available is completely safe or particularly effective for kids mothers i have talked to were surprised to learn that their kids cold medications hadnt been tested extensively because the old medications are familiar we sometimes assume they are safer and more effective than they really are another problem is that the alternatives arent all that great if you have ever tried to clear an infants nose with a suction bulb you know what i mean the safety and effectiveness of nasal suctioning hasnt been studied any more than the cold medication someones kid is going to choke on too much nasal saline or have an allergic reaction to the latex in the bulb syringe using a cool mist vaporizer never seemed to help any of my kids although i see that recommended frequently some parents are fans of vicks vaporub and similar substances applied to the skin or put in a vaporizer in my practice i have seen such products trigger asthma attacks that is on par with or greater than the risk from over the counter cough suppressants as far as i am concerned the crackdown on cold medicines for kids may have an unintended benefit for me with infant cold medications off the market i wont miss the parents calling in the middle of the night for recommendations on how much to use i wont miss meticulously documenting how many tenths of a milliliter i advised a person to give or the liability risks associated with my advice my new answer is simple "its just a virus and unfortunately there is no safe and effective cold medication on the market that i can recommend to you " at my house though i have found that the advice to hold off on a kids cold medicine is much easier to give than it is to heed
