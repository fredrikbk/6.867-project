a cultural conversation with chazz palminteri the bronx boy reprises a trip down memory lane new york as a kid growing up in the bronx calogero lorenzo palminteri was the sole witness when the local capo gunned down a fellow whod caused him some displeasure it appeared to be one of those classic misunderstandings about a parking space and a baseball bat but when the police came around asking questions young master palminteri kept it zipped ratting wasnt the way to win friends and influence people on east th street and belmont avenue he was quiet about the incident for years in fact until when it became the centerpiece of his semiautobiographical one man show "a bronx tale " a coming of age story about an impressionable boy torn between the siren song of a stylish wise guy and the straight talk of his highly principled bus driver father "tale" opened in los angeles in where it caught the attention of hollywood poobahs eager to grab the movie rights later that year it had a run at an off broadway house where it caught the attention of robert de niro eager to expand his skill set the film version of "a bronx tale" put mr de niro in the directors chair more to the point it put mr palminteri on the map he followed up his performance of a hair trigger tempered mafioso with an oscar nominated turn in "bullets over broadway" and roles in "the usual suspects " "faithful" and "analyze this " among other movies and now in a limited run that has its official opening night on thursday barring a strike by the stagehands union hes on broadway to retell "a bronx tale " "a lot of people didnt see it the first time around and im so proud of it " said mr palminteri who was first nicknamed c then chazz by boyhood friends "and i thought im young enough but if im going to do it id better do it now i was doing a movie in vegas and mentioned my show to the producer and he said ok ill back you its like god is always there " mr palminteri is a man who believes strongly and unabashedly in divine intervention this is perhaps an understandable feeling for a fellow who met his wife in church who has survived throat cancer and who hit the jackpot when he was down to his last &# more about this in a minute "i love his spirituality i dont know how else to describe it " said jerry zaks who directed mr palminteri in the show "hes got this quiet faith that its all going to work out " a line here and there has changed from the original production of "a bronx tale" "i added a few funny things " said mr palminteri a far more substantial change from the initial go round his point of view "i wasnt married when i first did it i wasnt a father " said mr palminteri who has a year old son and a year old daughter "before when i did the show i was looking at it as a son to a father now i look at it as father to son its better it has more meaning to me im paying more attention to my words " chief among them words passed down to mr palminteri on an index card from his own father "the saddest thing in life is wasted talent " one key element has remained just as it was in the los angeles and new york productions of two decades ago "i continue to have this feeling every night of taking people back in their memories just like im going back " said mr palminteri sitting in a dressing room at the walter kerr theatre an hour before a preview performance "the show is inside my being " "hes a directors dream which is a cliche i know " said mr zaks "by that i mean hes willing to listen and to try things that are a little bit different from what hes been doing the middle child of three mr palminteri was the class clown and reliably the kid on a street corner telling stories "exaggerating things to get everybody to laugh " he recalled fixed on a show business career he began as a singer in a touring cover band known as razzmachazz one minute singing r &amp b the next crooning a standard "i did my way which i hated but its what the wise guys wanted to hear " he recalled referring to the sinatra classic back in new york mr palminteri worked as a nightclub gatekeeper his unruffled manner got him dubbed the perry como of bouncers to supplement his meager income from off off off broadway productions he hoped things would get better when he moved to l a but despite guest shots on tv shows like "hill street blues" and "matlock " mr palminteri wasnt able to find steady work his story of adversity and triumph has become the stuff of hollywood lore a source of endless inspiration to the down and out fired as a bouncer from a hot spot for failing to recognize and admit the redoubtable talent agent swifty lazar mr palminteri went back to his apartment in despair and arrears "i was crying and i said if they wont give me a great part ill write one myself so i got in my car went to thrifty drug store ive told this many times and got five tabs of yellow paper i came home and didnt know what to write and then i remembered the killing i saw " he also remembered the dual forces in his life dad and the don "i wanted to explore those two worlds through the eyes of a young boy " the reaction was immediate and ecstatic studios wanted the property and began bidding &# &# &# &# million but they wanted no part of mr palminteri in the movie a star was what they were after but despite his anorexic bank account chazz knew a little something about throwing dice no dice such was his reply until robert de niro offered &# million and the role of the wise guy "i look back and wonder how i held out i dont know " mr palminteri said "people were asking me are you out of your mind i just had a belief in god and the angels thats me im stubborn " while mr palminteri now lives in suburban splendor in westchester county he returns every month to his old stomping ground where hes known as the mayor of east th street and where the perks of the office include free cold cuts from mikes deli cannolis from ginos pastry shop and ravioli from borgattis "you just walk around and people give you food " marveled mr palminteri "theres a part of me that feels like i never left " he added "every time i turn the corner theres another memory " friends from the neighborhood will certainly be in the audience during mr palminteris run and hes also expecting actor buddies like mr de niro christopher walken and joe pesci but last week there was an extra special guest in the house his son dante "oh my god " gasped mr palminteri "afterwards he looked at me like i was a different person hes still talking about it he says to me dad im not going to waste my talent " sure like father like son ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
