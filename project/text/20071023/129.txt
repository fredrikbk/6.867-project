toyotas cautious green strategy prius maker takes tentative stance on new fuel sipping technologies toyota city japan toyota motor corp outlined a more cautious strategy than general motors corp for a new generation of fuel efficient cars signaling the differing approaches the worlds auto makers are taking to adjust to long term concerns over oil supplies and climate change the japanese auto giant also ceded a bit of ground to its detroit rival in its effort to become the worlds biggest auto maker toyota said its global sales in the july september period rose from a year earlier to million vehicles gm for decades the no auto maker by output sold million vehicles during the same period for the first nine months of the year gm sold million vehicles versus toyotas million toyota has taken a leading role in the auto industry with surging global sales growth and leading market position for more fuel efficient gasoline electric hybrid vehicles like the toyota prius but gm with its increasing emphasis on developing markets and its ambitious efforts around electric vehicles is making an effort to keep its historical role as industry leader gm has said it plans to bring an advanced hybrid vehicle called the chevrolet volt to the u s market by the volt would use lithium ion batteries to operate for as many as miles on electricity alone gm has promoted the volt concept and its aggressive timetable as part of a broader effort to burnish its image as a green technology leader gm executives have expressed frustration that toyota through the prius has overshadowed gm and diverted attention from toyotas substantial sales of sport utility vehicles and pickups that in many cases have lower mileage ratings than competing gm models toyota executives are mapping a far more conservative public strategy than gm regarding lithium ion batteries and plug in hybrids executives involved in toyotas advanced vehicle strategy yesterday made no apologies for doing so and poured cold water on some of gms claims for its volt technology "we have to expand the market for existing hybrid systems that we have now " said yoshitaka asakura project general manager in toyotas hybrid vehicle system engineering division mr asakura said toyota is concerned customers might not accept a plug in hybrid electric car that has to be recharged every day despite enthusiasm from environmental groups and electric vehicle enthusiasts bill reinert national manager for the advanced technologies group at toyotas u s sales arm said adapting a hybrid vehicle so it can run for miles on electricity alone could cost about &# with current technology "we are aware there is some market" at that cost level mr reinert said but toyota wants to understand at what price level it could sell the most vehicles referring to a price more than that of the prius which starts at &# he said "where is the fat spot in the market is it &# is it &# is it &# " toyota plans to ship to two california universities a small number of prius cars modified to work as plug in hybrids using nickel metal hydride batteries those vehicles will be evaluated starting this fall but mr asakura and yoshihiko masuda managing officer overseeing new engine development and fuel cell system engineering declined to say when toyota might offer plug in hybrids for sale to consumers they also wouldnt offer a timetable for producing hybrids using lithium ion batteries lithium ion batteries are commonly used now to power laptop computers and other small consumer appliances but overheating lithium ion laptop batteries have been blamed recently for a small number of fires auto industry executives have expressed concern about the tendency of lithium ion batteries to overheat "step by step we will take the needed time" to assure that lithium ion battery technology can meet toyotas reliability standards mr masuda said gm has said it is confident in the concept of the volt and is engineering the car while it evaluates competing lithium ion batteries the auto maker has told the united auto workers union it plans to build the volt at its hamtramck mich assembly plant starting in toyotas mr asakura expressed skepticism about the concept of a plug in hybrid car that would run only on battery power for miles the idea central to the chevrolet volt concept batteries powerful enough to achieve that would fill up the trunk of a car he said toyota is pursuing a different concept he said it is looking at using batteries to power the car on electricity for short bursts alternating with power from the gasoline engine he said toyota believes plug in hybrids could operate in electric only mode for about to miles
