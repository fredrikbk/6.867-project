turkeys rebel kurds still elusive ankara to give diplomacy more time in effort to avert threatened invasion of iraq as turkey moves troops toward the iraqi border and officials scramble to prevent an invasion the kurdish separatists at the center of the storm are again proving their ability to use a well oiled international support network to confound decades old turkish efforts to defeat them turkish officials pledged yesterday to give diplomacy more time in their quest to dislodge the kurdish fighters who have used the mountains of northern iraq as a base in a long running guerrilla war to carve out a kurdish ministate inside turkey tensions rose over the weekend as fighters from the kurdistan workers party or pkk killed turkish soldiers near the iraqi border and said they were holding eight more hostage turkish foreign minister ali babacan was expected in baghdad today for urgent talks with iraqi officials the turkish parliament has already given the government permission to send troops into northern iraq turkeys blue chip ise index tumbled yesterday "we will continue these diplomatic efforts with all good intentions to solve this problem caused by a terrorist organization " mr babacan told reporters in kuwait "but in the end if we do not reach any results there are other means we might have to use " in washington the bush administration and senior u s military commanders pressed turkish leaders to hold off on striking northern iraq promising unspecified assistance in rooting out pkk guerillas secretary of state condoleezza rice spoke sunday by phone with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and massoud barzani leader of iraqs largely autonomous kurdish section u s officials said ms rice asked mr erdogan for restraint and pushed mr barzani to crack down on the pkk and arrest some of its top officials steps the kurdish leader has so far refused to take in an indication of the mounting bush administration concern about a possible turkish strike president bush reached out to the leaders of turkey and iraq to urge the two governments to work together against the pkk in a conversation with turkish president abdullah gul mr bush "expressed his deep concern" about the recent attacks and derided the pkk fighters as "terrorists " according to white house spokesman gordon johndroe mr bush also told the turkish leader that the u s would work with turkey and iraq to crack down on the kurdish militants though a second white house official said the president was noncommittal about deploying american military personnel against the pkk white house officials said mr bush also was likely to contact iraqi kurdish leaders in coming days to push for a harder line against the pkk still a senior u s official said the administration was growing increasingly resigned to the likelihood of at least a limited turkish strike in northern iraq the official said the u s believes that turkey has so far acted with "great restraint all things considered" and faulted iraqi kurdish leaders for failing to prevent the pkk from carrying out new attacks on turkish forces over the past few years efforts to undercut the pkk have failed though designated a terrorist group by many countries the pkk has nonetheless managed to tap a vast network of supporters and fund raisers it has done so by exploiting enforcement loopholes setting up affiliates and hopping from country to country as the turkish pressure built up originally founded in turkey the pkk fled to syria and in the early s found a haven in northern iraq amid broadly sympathetic fellow kurds at the same time the groups political and media affiliates cropped up throughout western europe the kurdish diaspora provided funding and moral support while pkk operatives also made use of criminal rackets and extortion to fill their war chests according to u s and european investigators there are no reliable numbers but it is estimated that there are about pkk members inside northern iraq and about the same inside turkey under turkish and u s pressure the european union designated the pkk as a terrorist group in but the ban had little practical effect on the groups affiliates this international support network coupled with the wider chaos in iraq has allowed the pkk to entrench itself in the north of the country couriers carting money from abroad can come and go freely and iraqi kurdish officials havent moved to cut off those lines of communication turkey has pressed iraqi leaders in baghdad and in the kurdish regional government to cut off financing flows to the pkk but to no avail kurdish officials argue they cant control the pkk movements in the rugged mountains of northern iraq instead the iraqi authorities have hoped to appease turkey in different ways last year officials in baghdad and in northern iraq shut down several pkk offices a measure seen largely as window dressing by turkey ankaras other longstanding demand the arrest and extradition of senior pkk members has also gone unmet largely because iraqi kurdish leaders cant afford to be seen as betraying fellow kurds iraqi kurdish leaders have instead quietly pressed the pkk to declare occasional cease fires and have asked turkey to recognize the pkk as a political group and deal with it through an amnesty and a political settlement inside turkey iraqi president jalal talabani an ethnic kurd yesterday said the pkk was about to call another truce
