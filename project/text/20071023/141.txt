wsj putting superbugs on the defensive from the wall street journal by theo francis hospitals are prime breeding grounds for antibiotic resistant "superbugs" that kill tens of thousands of americans each year but most people have had no way of knowing how well their hospital keeps these bacteria and infections in general under control that is starting to change nineteen states have adopted laws in recent years requiring hospitals to report overall infection rates publicly with more likely to follow suit and thursday nearly two dozen federal lawmakers headed by pennsylvania rep tim murphy proposed legislation requiring nationwide public reporting so far just four states have published some infection rates for individual hospitals and only one state pennsylvania breaks out different types of infections but even where patients cant find state mandated infection reports they can increasingly get information from their local hospital about practices to prevent superbugs and other infections some hospitals have found a marketing opportunity in infection prevention they are pushing overall infection rates toward zero and advertising it they are trumpeting prevention efforts such as campaigns to improve hand washing and some are tracking patients who have been infected with superbugs such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa and monitoring them to prevent the spread "this is one of those cases where quality is also the best business case " says jonathan perlin chief medical officer at hospital chain hca inc which has enlisted staffers and visitors alike in its own campaign to keep germs away from patients while antibiotic resistant infections have gotten the attention of late hospitals have long struggled with infections of all kinds common bacteria including staphylococcus aureus can infect the bloodstream urinary tract lungs or surgical incisions of patients whose immune systems are already compromised over time some strains of these bacteria have developed powerful defenses against antibiotics leaving them harder to kill hospitals have long attempted to keep infection rates low but the spread of resistant strains has made the fight that much more urgent in recent years last week concerns came to a head with a new study showing that antibiotic resistant infections are probably far more extensive than previously thought the study published in jama the journal of the american medical association concluded that mrsa causes infections a year the study estimated that mrsa one of the biggest infection concerns in hospitals contributes to nearly deaths the vast majority were linked to health care including hospitals nursing homes dialysis and others at the same time recent student illnesses and deaths have prompted school closings in some states and starting next year medicare will no longer reimburse hospitals for some infections acquired after admission in an effort both to encourage vigilance and to save money among the four states that have published infection rates missouri and vermont let consumers learn the number of blood infections related to central lines tubes inserted into or near the heart often to give medications or fluids and how that compares with state or national averages pennsylvania provides multiple reports on different kinds of infections and lets consumers look up infection related mortality length of stay and cost data for several kinds of infections a web site from consumers union www stophospitalinfections org has links to reports from each state including florida according to lisa mcgiffert director of the stop hospital infections campaign information from florida is nearly two years old and missouris dates to december but the information released so far is an important start say public health experts since most of the hospital infection reports mandated by the new state laws wont be available before about "those states that have already released data are ahead of the curve " says john jernigan a medical epidemiologist with the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta so far infection reports available to the public arent consistent enough to allow consumers to compare hospitals across state lines and even comparing facilities within a state can be tricky some facilities may treat sicker patients for example who are more likely to become infected when exposed to mrsa or other resistant bugs indeed the data are probably too technical for most consumers says carlene muto medical director of infection control at the university of pittsburgh medical center still she is a strong supporter of the reporting requirements as a way to push hospitals to improve "clearly its a good idea just to measure adverse events " she says "you cant change what you do not measure because you wont know that its broken " in areas where patients cant learn actual infection rates they can watch for key signs that a hospital is on top of preventing both superbugs and infections generally national studies suggest for example that hospital personnel dont wash their hands nearly as often as they should nashville tenn based hca has been putting up posters exhorting doctors to wash their hands and is even distributing a card to visitors that explains the importance of hand washing when coming in contact with patients the company says its purchases of hand sanitizing alcohol gel available from dispensers throughout its hospitals have risen since early this year company officials say they didnt measure infection rates at the start of the campaign and so dont know how much infections have fallen other hospitals say they have pushed antibiotic resistant infection rates down sharply through a combination of techniques the university of pittsburgh medical center for example has cut mrsa infection rates in half at its main hospital since in part by screening all intensive care patients to see if they are carrying the bug it is now expanding use of the tests to reduce certain kinds of bloodstream infections the hospital system bundles sterile material needed to insert central lines and has stepped up training central line associated blood infection rates have fallen by since to fewer than one per thousand such procedures it also has taken steps to deal with the emergence of a different strain of bacteria that can cause potentially fatal diarrhea the hospital lets nurses order tests for the bug requires longer isolation periods for those infected with it gives their rooms an additional cleaning with bleach and requires physicians to get approval from an antibiotic management team when using certain high powered antimicrobials that could affect the bodys natural defenses against the bacteria upmcs infection rates for the organism clostridium difficile have fallen two thirds since a spike in intermountain healthcare a salt lake city based chain of hospitals keeps a database of every patient who has been infected with mrsa those who return to the hospital for some other reason are immediately monitored by an infection control nurse and tested to see if they are carrying the bacteria "those patients are at higher risk of potentially getting it again and at higher risk of spreading it to other patients " says the hospitals chief medical officer brent wallace together with a concerted campaign to improve hand washing the database has helped stop an increase in the number of mrsa infections at the hospital over the past year he says some states are also beginning to mandate broader testing specifically for mrsa since patients can carry the bug and spread it without showing signs of infection pennsylvania will soon require hospitals to test high risk patients including those admitted from nursing homes in august new jersey and illinois adopted legislation requiring hospitals to identify patients carrying mrsa and isolate them among other provisions don goldmann senior vice president of the institute for health care improvement and a harvard medical school pediatrics professor says that factors beyond infection rates should play into picking a hospital "there may be a lot of information to weigh " on their own some hospitals have been turning to a variety of new technologies to try to cut down on infections particularly superbugs ranging from antibiotic coated catheters to work surfaces made of copper which has antimicrobial properties as well as software for several years many hospitals have also participated in federally sponsored programs to reduce surgical complications including infections acquired in the hospital
