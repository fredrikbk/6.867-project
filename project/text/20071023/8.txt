a different take on health care a trip to lourdes marcel roeg dreams of regaining his sight insurer picks up the tab lourdes france in dutch teenager marcel roeg fell off his moped and into the darkness the smart aleck jock would never again play goalie ride a scooter or dance with his girlfriend marissa the accident left him brain damaged and blind since that day mr roeg has spent most of his time in a home for the handicapped harboring a dream in the dream he goes to lourdes to visit the famous place where in a year old peasant girl claimed to see the virgin mary there he is healed he rides a motorcycle again and he is no longer lonely last month mr roeg now years old actually made the trip to lourdes thanks to his insurance company vgz in an unusual scheme the dutch company spends about &# a year to fly of its sickest and most disabled clients to lourdes the company doesnt expect the virgin mary to intercede it hopes for a different sort of miracle "lourdes leads people to compassion and friendship " says johan rozendaal a vgz board member "they remember what its like to have somebody really care about them " mr roeg expected more than that his mother had made a pilgrimage to lourdes just a week before his fateful crash he figured the place owed him something when mr roeg had his accident doctors werent sure he would live when he awoke from a two month coma he was confused and afraid slowly he learned to talk and walk a doctor jan de lint was devoted to his rehabilitation he met regularly with the boy and counseled the family on how to deal with the accident "i couldnt have made it without him " says mr roeg who speaks four languages but has a hard time remembering what happened yesterday in he moved into meare the government financed institution in southern holland where he still lives he works in a drab recycling plant separating computer parts on friday nights he plays miniature golf or shuffleboard he just hits or throws it straight and hopes for the best his friends help his parents visit occasionally on weekends mr roeg has a self deprecating sense of humor that helps him cope when he meets somebody he often says "nice to see you " karin seijdell meares chaplain says "its possible hes more frustrated than he lets on " cracking jokes has always been easier than sharing his thoughts that was especially true about his dream but one day last summer he went to see mrs seijdell "i want to go to lourdes " he told her "then maybe i can see again " the chaplain was torn she was glad mr roeg was interested but worried about unrealistically high hopes she asked his social worker truus kassenaar to talk to him "we didnt want to hurt his feelings " says ms kassenaar "i told him mary might be on vacation that week " vgz accepted mr roegs application the company has been organizing the trips since although some dutch politicians and activists have been critical vgz says they attract more customers and improve the companys image in addition to genuinely helping people the bell rang at mr roegs house shortly after a m on sept he shuffled to the bus at the airport a man recognized him "marcel do you know who this is " the man asked mr roeg knew the voice "dr de lint is that you its nice to see you you look good " he laughed at his own joke now retired the year old dr de lint was on the trip as a volunteer doctor he never expected to see mr roeg "marcel was one of the few cases ill never forget " he said "he was such a brave spirit " both men said they began to wonder whether the reunion was just a coincidence in lourdes a town of at the foot of the pyrenees mr roeg and his fellow pilgrims settled into a routine of catholic mass prayer hotel dinners and shopping expeditions to bazaars selling religious beads and baubles while waiting for his miracle mr roeg was pleasantly surprised to find that other pilgrims enjoyed his company he pushed the wheelchair of henneke bevelander who cant walk because of muscular problems he sat down to talk with anja stoop a year old mentally handicapped woman when she was alone at lunch in return the women coached him during meals and brought him coffee "the foods on the left side of your plate " ms bevelander said on the third day dr de lint joined mr roegs group while it followed mrs seijdell the chaplain past stone carvings depicting the stages of jesuss crucifixion the stones stand across a river from the grotto that houses the famous statue of mary "every stone is different " she said handing pebbles to the members of her group "i have the smallest stone " she asked listeners to think about their own trials "i feel alone " said ms stoop "my grandfather is dead " said mr roeg later mrs seijdell asked her audience whether they had anything to be thankful for "i can walk and i can talk " said mr roeg "i should be grateful for that " the words spoken without a trace of irony or humor took everybody by surprise mrs seijdell and dr de lint fought back tears in the week after he returned from lourdes mr roeg bragged to others at his home about the trip he has become friends with ms bevelander his optimism isnt as forced as before says mrs seijdell "before he was always saying how happy he was " she says "but now when he says it he means it " the biggest change say those around him is that he no longer talks about getting his sight back "i know i wont be able to see again " he says one recent afternoon mr roeg got a call at work it was mrs seijdell calling to say that dr de lint wanted to come visit mr roeg at his home at it was and mr roeg still had a half hour before quitting time but he didnt want to be late "can i go home now " he shouted at his supervisor "i love that man " the boss let him go early over coffee dr de lint promised to see him every few months "you played an important part in my life and career " he told mr roeg "i remember the accident how everything was so sad and desperate and how hard you fought to recover " that evening at friday night shuffleboard mr roeg told the gang about seeing his old doctor "im very very lucky because he saved my life " he said "now hes my friend " see related
