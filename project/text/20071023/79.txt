more debtors use bankruptcy to keep homes chapter filings gain in popularity because they halt foreclosures with loan defaults rising along with many mortgage payments fast growing numbers of homeowners are gambling on bankruptcy filings to try to stay in their homes last month as the nations housing slump continued consumer bankruptcy filings increased almost from a year earlier representing nearly people according to the american bankruptcy institute a nonprofit research group whose members include bankruptcy attorneys judges and lenders overall consumer bankruptcy filings were up during the first nine months of this year in some areas where the real estate boom was especially heated the increase in filings has been even sharper especially for a type of bankruptcy that allows homeowners to halt foreclosures on their homes the surge in filings hasnt caught up with the flood of bankruptcy cases consumers launched in as they raced to beat a change in federal law that made it harder for individuals to declare bankruptcy even so it shows the rising sense of insecurity many americans feel as housing values fall lending standards get tighter and hundreds of thousands of mortgages with low introductory interest rates "reset" to higher rates boosting the homeowners monthly payments most consumers filing for bankruptcy continue to do so under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code under that provision a person must forfeit certain assets including in some cases a portion of home equity those assets are sold to pay off debts while chapter filings stop foreclosure proceedings the break is usually only temporary as a practical matter many homeowners who file under chapter lose their homes in recent months however an increasing number of homeowners have filed for bankruptcy under chapter which staves off foreclosure proceedings while the homeowner works out a plan to pay off mortgage debt and other obligations over time usually three to five years to qualify debtors must have a regular income and must stay current on their new bills about four in filers today are filing under chapter up from three in two years ago the change in bankruptcy laws was designed in part to shift more filers to chapter which forgives less debt than chapter in california one of the nations hottest markets during the recent real estate boom the number of nonbusiness chapter petitions in the second quarter of the year more than doubled from a year earlier according to records compiled by the administrative office of the u s courts in washington over the same period such filings increased nearly in the northern district of illinois which includes chicago and in massachusetts "its a mess " says william mcleod a boston bankruptcy attorney who says he is receiving twice as many calls from debtors as he did a year ago "this is fed right now by real estate and whats been this mortgage frenzy in the last several years " some bankruptcy attorneys are promoting chapter bankruptcy in press releases and commercials and are contacting borrowers whose homes are already in the foreclosure process but it isnt a strategy that works for everyone consumer advocates say the homeowners who are most likely to benefit from chapter are those facing foreclosure because of a temporary financial setback but who expect to be able to cover their mortgage payments in the future early this year year old briant titus saw sales start to lag at his familys vacuum cleaner sales business he missed several payments on the two story cape cod home in potterville mich that he purchased years ago for &# when he called his lender to find out why two recent checks hadnt been cashed a manager told him that foreclosure proceedings had begun "i was freaking out " says mr titus "all i was thinking about were my two little kids " who are and years old mr titus saw a tv commercial for a local bankruptcy attorney gene turnwald encouraged by the suggestion that he could save his home mr titus hired mr turnwald and filed a chapter petition about six months ago since then he has paid his regular monthly mortgage bill of &# as well as &# under his debt repayment plan half of which is applied to his past due mortgage payments and the other half to business creditors vacuum sales are still sluggish but he says he can make his payments by budgeting carefully "i think if people knew they had the chapter option a lot of people would save their house " mr titus says he says he cant recall what he paid in legal fees but says he thinks he spent a total of about &# to file his case of course there are pitfalls a chapter filing stays on a persons credit file for a decade wreaking havoc on his or her ability to get financing and the repayment plans leave borrowers with little room for maneuver indeed many chapter plans fail because of unforeseen problems such as an illness job loss or expenses for an emergency home repair moreover for thousands of debtors caught up in the sagging housing market a chapter plan can be unrealistic mr titus benefited from having a fixed rate mortgage but many homeowners are facing adjustable rate mortgages that are resetting to much higher monthly rates some cant even afford their new mortgage payments let alone repay mortgage arrears overdue credit card bills or other debts donna randles of chicago sought a chapter filing last year after her brother lost his job and she was unable to keep up with the monthly mortgage payments they had shared &# on a house and &# on a two unit apartment building she also had about &# in credit card debt the bankruptcy court petition gave her some breathing room ms randles says she has started a day care business to supplement her salary as a service worker for a utility company but her mortgage payments have increased more than in the past nine months with a monthly income of about &# she is paying &# a month on the house and &# on the apartment building along with &# on her chapter repayment plan her brother remains unemployed "as things progress im learning that my income doesnt increase but my mortgage does " says ms randles who is years old "its still a struggle to try to move money around " with congress scrambling to stem foreclosures a bipartisan group of lawmakers has suggested altering the bankruptcy code the code currently prevents mortgage lenders from changing loan terms on a filers primary residence but not on vacation homes investment properties family farms and businesses members of the house and senate have introduced competing bills that would to varying degrees allow bankruptcy courts to modify mortgage terms and extend the time frame for repayment "all the other markets with debt that can be modified in bankruptcy function fine its entirely consistent to have a functioning market and to have the ability of bankruptcy judges to modify loans when necessary " says eric stein senior vice president of the center for responsible lending a nonprofit consumer advocacy group based in durham n c he testified recently before congress in support of the proposed changes estimating that the moves could save homes from foreclosure bankruptcy attorneys are divided on the proposals some believe the changes would indeed ward off foreclosures others are more concerned that lenders would become even more reluctant to give mortgages to low income borrowers lenders also worry about ripple effects on the loan portfolios they have turned into securities and sold off to investors if the terms of the loans in those packages change it could change their value to investors steve bartlett president and chief executive of the financial services roundtable which represents financial services companies told a congressional subcommittee that if the law allows debtors to wipe out a portion of their mortgage debt in bankruptcy court lenders will increase interest rates on future borrowers "this will dry up credit for many americans who may not be able to afford these higher rates " he said
