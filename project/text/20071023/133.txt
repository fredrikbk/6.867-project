wash your hands and dont shave your legs advice to avoid infection as a virulent strain of antibiotic resistant bacteria spreads beyond hospital walls some communities are taking extreme measures such as closing schools for disinfection but getting adults and children to pay better attention to a few simple personal hygiene rules and taking precautionary measures such as getting a flu shot may be a far more effective weapon against the bugs new reports of deaths and infections across the country coincided with a report last week from the centers for disease control and prevention indicating that about people annually are infected with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa a form of the common staph bacteria that has become resistant to penicillin and related antibiotics while the cdc estimated that the majority of such infections occur in health care settings nearly were so called community acquired meaning that they struck otherwise healthy people who werent in a hospital indeed a number of the staph infections reported in recent weeks involved outbreaks among student athletes staph bacteria frequently live on the skin and in the nose without causing any health problems and at any time about a third of people are already "colonized " but if the bacteria enter the skin or bloodstream through a cut or lesion or a persons immune system is weakened by flu or other causes a staph infection can set in although the organism can be spread by patients who are colonized but not infected through casual contact or through contaminated objects such spread can occur more quickly from patients with active skin infections unless the appropriate precautions are taken staph infections can often be treated by simply cleaning and draining a wound even if the strain turns out to be mrsa antibiotics may not be necessary and severe cases may be treated with antibiotics such as vancomycin but such cases can also progress to severe invasive disease and death cdc officials stress that the number of such infections is still relatively low and children ages to years have the lowest rate of mrsa infection of any age group the overall physical environment moreover hasnt played a significant role in the transmission of mrsa transmission occurs with direct contact with an infected person or contaminated items such as sporting equipment or clothing so scrubbing down locker room walls as if they were a biohazard hot zone isnt going to protect kids as well as making sure that they keep their hands clean cover open wounds with clean dry bandages and avoid sharing personal items such as towels razors or uniforms says john jernigan an mrsa expert at the cdc "if we can hammer that message home we will go a long way towards preventing infections " in team sports it is also important to exclude players who have potentially infected skin lesions if their wounds cant be covered other measures include washing clothes especially uniforms and exercise gear in hot water and laundry detergent and drying them in a hot dryer for more information on infection prevention techniques check cdc gov such common sense measures apply to protecting yourself and your children from other kinds of infections as well in most places where people share facilities or water bacteria can spread that resort hot tub may look inviting but there is always a risk that the others sharing it dont have pristine personal hygiene so called recreational water illnesses can cause skin ear respiratory eye neurologic and wound infections if you are getting a salon pedicure dont shave your legs beforehand because any bacteria in a salons foot baths including mrsa can enter the skin or bloodstream through minor nicks ensure that the foot bath basin is thoroughly sanitized and bring your own equipment such as clippers proper hand washing techniques are critical says jason newland an infectious disease expert at childrens mercy hospital in kansas city mo because bacteria often are transmitted when people touch their mouth or nose the quick pass of the hands under a lukewarm or cool faucet many of us rely on wont do the trick it is important to wash hands for at least seconds in hot water and rub soap vigorously to create enough friction to rub off contaminants if using an antibacterial gel it is also important to create friction through rubbing and to make sure the gel dries completely with flu season at hand dr newland says a flu shot is advisable because the fever and symptoms like congestion runny nose and cough disrupt the area in the back of the throat and windpipe allowing bacteria such as mrsa to enter the bloodstream or lungs which could cause pneumonia infectious disease experts warn that the longer term danger is that mrsa bacteria from the community will come back into the hospital in an even more resistant form because overuse of antibiotics is the main culprit in antibiotic resistance consumers can help by adhering to the cdcs guidelines for antibiotic use which caution people to use the drugs only for bacterial infections not viruses such as cold or flu ask health care providers to wash their hands and lobby local and state authorities to monitor and enforce infection control in health care facilities email healthjournal wsj com
