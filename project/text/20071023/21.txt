campaigning in the face of terror i survived an assassination attempt last week but of my supporters and security didnt this mass murder was particularly sinister since it targeted not just me and my party leadership but the hundreds of thousands some estimate up to three million of our citizens who came out to welcome me and demonstrate their support for democracy and the democratic process their deaths weigh heavily on my heart oct underscores the critical situation we confront in pakistan today trying to campaign for free fair and transparent elections under the threat of terrorism it demonstrates the logistical strategic and moral challenge before us how do we bring the election campaign to the people under the very real threat of assassination and mass casualties of the innocent the attack on me was not totally unexpected i had received credible information that i was being targeted by elements that wanted to disrupt the democratic process specifically that baitul masood an afghan who leads the taliban forces in north waziristan hamza bin laden an arab and a red mosque militant had been sent to kill me i also feared that they were being used by their sympathizers who have infiltrated the security and administration of my country and who now fear that the return of democracy will thwart their plans we had tried to take precautions we requested permission to import a bulletproof vehicle we asked to be provided technology that would detect and disarm ieds we had demanded that i receive the level of security to which im entitled as a former prime minister now after the carnage the fact that the street lights around the assassination site shahra e faisal had been turned off allowing the suicide bombers to gain access near to my truck is very suspicious i am so discomfited that the bomb investigation has been assigned to deputy inspector general manzoor mughal who was present when my husband was almost murdered under torture some years back obviously i knew the risks i had been targeted twice before by al qaeda assassins including the infamous ramzi yousef knowing the modus operandi of these terrorists coming back to the same target again i e the world trade center certainly underscored the danger some in the pakistani government criticized my return to pakistan and my plan to visit the mausoleum of the tomb of the founder of my country mohammed ali jinnah but here was my dilemma i had been in exile for eight painful years pakistan is a country of mass grassroots people to people politics it is not california or new york where candidates can campaign through paid media and targeted direct mail that technology is not only logistically impossible but it is inconsistent with our political culture the people of pakistan whatever political party they may belong to want and expect to see and hear their party leaders and be directly part of the political process they expect mass rallies and caravans and to hear directly from their leaders through bullhorns and loud speakers under normal conditions it is challenging under the terrorist threat it is extraordinarily difficult my task is to make sure that it is not impossible we are consulting with top political strategists on the problem we want to be sensitive to the political culture of our nation give people the opportunity to participate in the democratic process after eight long years of dictatorship and educate the million voters of pakistan on the issues of the day but we do not want to be reckless we do not want to endanger our leadership unnecessarily and we certainly dont want to risk potential mass murder of my supporters if we dont campaign the terrorists have won and democracy is set back further if we do campaign we risk violence it is an extraordinary dilemma we are now focusing on hybrid techniques that combine individual and mass voter contact with sharp security constraints where people have telephones we can experiment with taped voice messages from me describing my issue positions and urging them to vote in rural areas we are contemplating taped messages from me played regularly on boom boxes set up in village centers instead of the traditional mass caravans of pakistani politics we are discussing the feasibility of "virtual caravans" and "virtual mass rallies" where i would deliver important campaign addresses to large audiences all over the four provinces of pakistan we are thinking of new voter education and get out the vote techniques that minimize my vulnerability and minimize the opportunity for successful terrorist attacks over the next critical weeks leading to our parliamentary elections the sanctity of the political process must not be allowed to be destroyed by the terrorists democracy and moderation must be restored to pakistan and the way to do that is through free and fair elections establishing a legitimate government with a popular mandate leaders supported by the people intimidation by murdering cowards will not be allowed to derail pakistans transition to democracy ms bhutto was prime minister of pakistan from and
