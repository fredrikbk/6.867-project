fannie more so determined are barney frank and chuck schumer to "do something" about subprime mortgages that they have come up with a proposal that is unnecessary will do little to help distressed borrowers and would increase the risk to taxpayers from fannie mae and freddie mac other than that its a fabulous idea their proposal is to temporarily lift the caps currently in place on the companies portfolios of mortgage backed securities by or about &# billion fannie and freddie are then supposed to use that head room to underwrite mortgage refinancings this is supposed to help distressed borrowers with of the cash or some &# billion going into subprime loans of course fannie and freddie dont need bigger portfolios to do this assuming they want to fan and fred dont make loans they are forbidden from doing so what they do instead is buy mortgages from banks bundle them into securities and resell those mortgage backed securities to investors this is supposed to drive mortgage interest rates down by adding liquidity to the market but just securitizing mortgages doesnt require fan or fred ever to hold a mortgage on the books for longer than it takes to package and resell it fan and fred hold mortgages in portfolio for an entirely different reason their ultra low government subsidized borrowing costs allow them to borrow money cheaply and use the proceeds to buy up mortgage backed securities to make money on the interest rate spread this has little or no effect on the mortgage market or interest rates but its great for fan and freds profits if the companies wanted to underwrite risky subprime loans they could do it today by adjusting their underwriting standards in consultation with their regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo they dont do that because those loans are well risky moreover they are barred by their charters from underwriting any loan with more than an loan to value ratio a fact that the schumer frank bill wouldnt change this alone would prevent them from riding to the rescue of the borrowers most at risk of foreclosure fannie and freddie have been pushing for an increase in the portfolio caps since the debt markets went haywire this summer but even they may be given pause by the terms proposed by messrs frank and schumer even if they had the appetite to refinance &# billion worth of subprime loans finding candidates for that much borrowing would prove difficult so the companies would probably smile accept the frank schumer terms for now and then lobby to have the subprime restrictions lifted once the mortgage crisis passes finally ordering ofheo to lift caps imposed in response to multibillion dollar accounting frauds at both firms doesnt exactly send a strong message about the need for the duo to clean up their acts at a time when mr frank claims to want to strengthen the regulators powers this bill would have the opposite effect by showing that ofheo can and will be pushed around by congress for purposes of political atmospherics well concede that in at least one respect this proposal is valuable it illustrates the kind of ill considered counterproductive lawmaking that is so typical when politicians are looking to "do something "
