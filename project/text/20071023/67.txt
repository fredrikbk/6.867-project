inside wal marts bid to slash state taxes ernst &amp young devises complex strategies california pushes back in may wal mart stores inc issued an appeal to big accounting firms find us creative new ways to cut our state tax bills ernst &amp young llp swung into action senior tax experts at the big accounting firm swapped ideas via email and in a series of meetings at least one gathering according to an internal ernst &amp young calendar took place in wal marts headquarters in the "tax shelter room " wal mart decided to hire ernst &amp young to help devise complex tax strategies to use in at least four big states the accounting firm for example helped wal mart take tax deductions in california for dividends it never actually paid and in texas ernst &amp young advised the giant retailer could exploit a wrinkle in the tax law involving limited partners from out of state a maneuver subsequently shut down by the states legislature big companies hardly ever discuss how outside accountants lawyers and investment bankers help them cut their tax bills but ernst &amp youngs contributions to wal marts state tax minimization project are outlined in a raft of documents filed in recent months in north carolina state court where the states attorney general is challenging a wal mart tax cutting structure involving real estate investment trusts the material which includes company emails and memos provides a rare window into accountants role in generating tax reduction ideas at one major company companies often assert that tax savings are simply happy byproducts of transactions pursued for other business reasons but documents from the north carolina case indicate that wal mart from the outset had one primary purpose cutting its state income taxes ernst &amp young worked to fulfill that goal in for example the accounting firm delivered a page proposal laying out a smorgasbord of potential tax strategies most tailored to a particular states tax code it described one of them as "a very aggressive strategy with considerable risk " lawmakers and law enforcement officials have taken a keen interest in tax advice provided by the big four accounting firms and other consultants in august u s senate investigators sent letters to at least companies asking for details of potentially aggressive tax arrangements including the names of tax professionals and law firms that advised on the deals in may four current and former ernst &amp young partners were indicted for their tax shelter work two years ago kpmg llp agreed to pay &# million to settle government charges that it promoted abusive shelters to individual taxpayers publicly traded companies reduced their federal income taxes by about &# billion in through potentially abusive tax transactions according to internal revenue service data some experts say companies save far more than that each year through elaborate tax cutting maneuvers a wal mart spokesman citing ongoing litigation declined to comment on any of the tax work by ernst &amp young which also set up the tax maneuver that north carolina has challenged in court papers bentonville ark based wal mart has said that some transactions implemented by ernst &amp young were intended to cut taxes but also to more efficiently manage its real estate and potentially help raise capital a spokesman for ernst &amp young says the tax deals for wal mart "occurred years ago when such tax structures were not uncommon " tax enforcement authorities often regard complex corporate transactions that serve no business purpose other than to reduce taxes to be improper tax shelters in recent years authorities have cracked down on cookie cutter tax shelters mass marketed by accounting and law firms but these days it is common for advisers to help large companies such as wal mart to develop individually tailored tax cutting strategies according to people who work on such deals wal marts letter to accounting firms got right to the point it began "wal mart is requesting your proposal s for professional tax advice and related implementation services in connection with minimization of state income taxes in the following states arizona california florida illinois indiana michigan minnesota and pennsylvania " state income tax rates for corporations average about and come on top of a federal statutory rate of tax rates vary from state to state and some states have no corporate tax at all on certain income that provides ample opportunity for so called tax arbitrage in which companies allocate expenses and revenues between states in order to minimize taxes owed that practice has been going on for decades some such strategies are perfectly legal the government considers others to be abusive states often try to crack down but the tax enforcement staffs of many states are smaller than the tax departments of some big companies wal mart set aside about &# million for state and local income taxes last year not including its substantial property tax bills according to the companys financial reports but its various state tax cutting strategies seem to have had an impact on average wal mart has paid taxes at a rate equal to about half of the average statutory state rate over the past decade according to an analysis of the companys regulatory filings by standard &amp poors compustat wal mart has switched state income tax strategies several times over the past years coming up with new approaches as states attack existing ones court records show in the early s it employed an "intangibles holding company " a unit operating in tax friendly delaware into which it transferred ownership of its brand names such as sams club it then made payments to that unit for use of those brands deducting them as expenses from its taxable income in other states according to court records that strategy fell out of favor after several states successfully challenged wal mart and other companies in court over the maneuver about a decade ago wal mart adopted another approach following advice from ernst &amp young wal mart transferred ownership of its stores to various in house real estate investment trusts reits pay no corporate income tax as long as they pay out at least of their income to shareholders as dividends which are usually taxed wal mart paid tax deductible rent to those reits for one four year period the setup saved the retailer an estimated &# million on its tax bill even though the rent payments never left the company that strategy was the focus of a wall street journal article in february since then at least six states including new york illinois maryland and rhode island have passed laws attempting to prohibit the maneuver which also has been used by banks and other retailers such as autozone inc the practice is being challenged by tax authorities in at least four other states court records show after wal mart hired the firm in to implement the reit strategy an ernst &amp young tax executive urged his team to be discreet according to a staff memo included in north carolina court records "we dont think there is much the state taxing authorities can do to mitigate these savings to wal mart however some states might attempt something if they had advance notification " he wrote "we think the best course of action is to keep the project relatively quiet there just seems to be too many opportunities for it to get out to the press or financial community and we all know they are difficult to control particularly when we are dealing with a client as well known as wal mart " david bullington wal marts vice president for tax policy said in a deposition that he began feeling pressure to lower the companys effective tax rate after the current chief financial officer thomas schoewe was hired in mr schoewe was familiar with "some very sophisticated and aggressive tax planning " mr bullington said according to a transcript of the deposition taken by the north carolina attorney generals office in july "and he ride herds sic on us all the time that we have the worlds highest tax rate of any major company " compared with many other large multinational companies wal mart has a small presence in foreign countries with low tax rates reducing opportunities to shift income overseas for tax purposes the may invitation to provide advice came from wal marts then senior director for income tax wyman atwell most of the states he named in the letter had provisions in their tax codes that prevented the reit strategy from easily providing tax benefits according to several people familiar with the matter in addition to advising wal mart on tax issues ernst &amp young served as its outside auditor which meant that its accountants had to pass judgment on advice rendered by colleagues who did the tax work thats permissible for accounting firms so long as tax consulting fees arent contingent on a clients tax savings rules instituted in prohibit accounting firms from pitching certain types of "aggressive" tax structures to audit clients an ernst &amp young spokesman said the work for wal mart "complied fully with the independence rules at the time regarding tax advice provided to audit clients " as ernst &amp young worked on its proposals one high ranking tax partner sent an email to a colleague addressing a concern often faced by companies how to describe a tax driven transaction in a way that wont create problems later on with tax authorities "you asked if we have a document that details how the tax savings will work how much they will save we really dont have anything like that except for the sales document partly because we have avoided calling this a tax project to show that we did not have a tax savings motivation rather it is a domestic restructuring project " he wrote that november ernst &amp young sent wal mart an "engagement letter" to confirm the scope of its work to cut the companys state tax burden the letter said the accounting firms fees would be at least &# million with potential additional fees to be determined later california was a key state for ernst &amp youngs project its tax system is among the most stringent in the country many states only tax income from operations within their own borders called the separate reporting method which makes it easier for companies to shift taxable income out of reach of tax authorities in those states but "combined reporting" states such as california total up all profits of a companys domestic or world wide operations regardless of what state theyre in then allocate a portion of those profits to their states ernst &amp young dreamed up a novel way to sidestep combined reporting requirements in california it used an unusual type of dividend to transfer income from one subsidiary to another in such a way that the second unit wouldnt be taxed heres how it worked when reits pay dividends to their shareholders they can deduct those payments from their taxable income the federal government permits reits to take deductions for dividends before theyre actually paid a provision intended to give them extra time to make payments such dividends are called "consent dividends" because the recipients must consent to record the unpaid dividends as taxable income ernst &amp young argued that california law permitted reits to deduct such consent dividends but that the state law didnt also require recipients of the consent dividends to count them as taxable income according to one person who worked on the transactions the accounting firm proposed a strategy in which the wal mart reit would claim a tax deduction for paying consent dividends to its parent but the unit receiving the dividends wouldnt record them as income for tax purposes the bottom line wal mart could reduce its taxable income in california by an amount equal to the total consent dividend payments it recorded thereby cutting its tax bill two years later californias franchise tax board the states income tax agency put the strategy on its list of "abusive tax shelters " wal marts mr bullington said in his deposition that california tax authorities have protested various tax benefits taken by the retailer since california also is in litigation with a big bank city national corp over a similar strategy in texas ernst &amp young helped wal mart set up a somewhat more common tax cutting vehicle under texas law at the time a limited partner from out of state was exempt from texass corporate franchise tax as a result scores of companies including wal mart reorganized their texas operations into limited partnerships the general partner which was subject to state taxation was typically a subsidiary based in texas but the limited partner often owning as much as of the entity would be based in delaware or another tax friendly state the result up to of the profits of the texas operation would flow to that out of state limited partner making that income tax free texass state legislature eliminated that option when it revamped its tax laws earlier this year wal mart also agreed to buy other complex tax shelters from ernst &amp young to cut taxes in arizona and michigan the court documents show one ernst &amp young document said wal mart would cut its state income taxes by about &# million although that document didnt make clear the time period or the states included in that figure in august ernst &amp young proffered the new list of additional tax cutting approaches it isnt clear if wal mart adopted any of them one of the proposals was accompanied by the following warning "note that in a post enron environment and amidst the focus on tax haven operations this strategy is expected to get more scrutiny by the irs as well as some states " as for wal marts "tax shelter room " north carolina officials asked mr bullington about the odd name in his deposition the wal mart vice president said the moniker was "a bit of a pun " stemming from the conference rooms use by tax department employees to conduct safety drills for natural disasters such as tornadoes wal mart he said no longer has a room by that name
