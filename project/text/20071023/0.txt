a congregation of customers shopping for god by james b twitchell simon &amp schuster pages &# in the early s the people for the american way ran a television commercial in which actors were made to say how they preferred their eggs e g scrambled poached or fried everyone should be free the ad implied to choose as he wishes thats the american way the punch line richard john neuhaus wrote in "the naked public square" was aimed at moral majoritarians "who allegedly would impose one way on everybody " but of course as mr neuhaus noted the matters over which the moral majority felt strongly e g abortion and the death penalty were not exactly comparable to breakfast fare the ad amounted to a "fatuous trivialization" of moral concerns in "shopping for god " james b twitchell resurrects the spirit of the egg analogy to make an even broader claim choosing a religion he argues is much like choosing any other product from breakfast food to beer he sets out to determine why the "spiritual marketplace" in the u s seems so hot right now and more pointedly why evangelical megachurches have become well so mega his theme can be summed up in one of the books smug chapter titles "christian consumers are consumers first " sociologists have long noted that religiously tolerant societies actually inspire greater religious allegiance than societies in which piety is imposed by government fiat but "shopping for god" adds a twist "in a highly competitive market suppliers have to stay on their toes coke sells more going up against pepsi mcdonalds needs burger king when markets are supplying interchangeable products selling can become frantic brand war the complacent get killed " the "complacent" are the mainline churches according to mr twitchell they have basically dropped out of the competition the evangelical churches by contrast are competing wildly and thriving even if like coke and pepsi they are are offering similar "products " but what is it about the evangelical "product" that makes it so desirable any number of scholars have noted that in recent years it has been the churches that demand the most of people tithing bowing to firm doctrines observing strict rules of conduct that have grown the fastest there seems to be something in our nature that requires from religion not just feel good spirituality but strong moral direction we are willing to make sacrifices to live by the dictates of a religiously grounded truth mr twitchell manages to reduce this profound idea to the dictates of basic consumer theory sacrifice he says not least tithing signifies value the more you sacrifice the more you visibly value the product for which you are giving something up and the more you show other people that you value it too "why do true believers sometimes puncture themselves walk on their knees until they bleed fast until they are skeletal or join a monastery and go mum " mr twitchell asks "brand allegiance " oddly this sacrificial principle doesnt easily apply to megachurches as mr twitchell acknowledges most dont have "high barriers to entry" that is they dont demand a lot of their congregants theyre often referred to as "seeker" churches because they appeal to nonbelievers and not always successfully its easy to get in but its also easy to get out so "pastorpreneurs " as mr twitchell calls them face a challenge how do you get more people to join than quit one way is by having current members proselytize the fastest growing denominations mr twitchell says are "selling selling selling " they are "foregrounding growth as a sign of value " as he explains "missionary zeal is at the heart of their attraction not only because showing the way to others is a source of jubilation but because it means that you yourself must have found your way the value of the next sale the convert proves the value of the previous sale yours " it all comes down to a kind of narcissism apparently like taking pride in your prius another key to product success mr twitchell argues is "innovations in supply " thus megachurches offer playgrounds coffee shops and a malls worth of services but megachurches have also crucially found ways of attracting men just as department stores put mens products near the entrance because they know that men are the hardest customers to draw into a retail space so megachurches mr twitchell says have catered to mens interests citing bill hybels the pastor of willow creek church in chicago mr twitchell explains "men are the crucial adopters in religion if they go over the tipping point women follow children in tow " so now megachurches sponsor sports ministries and groups whose members ride motorcycles together the language of prayers and sermons has moved away from a condescending lecture tone and taken up sports metaphors instead asking congregants for instance to step up to the plate and help the team in such a way are men induced to buy the megachurch product if you can find a way of seeing religion primarily as a form of consumerism skipping the how to put it faith and truth part of religious belief then mr twitchells analysis makes some sense and in fact there are churches out there self consciously engaged in marketing they hire consultants and public relations experts to "grow" their flock and they obey a market discipline mr twitchell notices a sign hanging in mr hybelss megachurch office that quotes peter drucker the business guru but consultants can only do so much and the point of church outreach surely has less to do with improving "brands" than with saving souls mr twitchell concludes by noting that "in the land of plentitude the customer is king " thus he asks "why should religion be different " the answer to that question comes from another book ms riley is the journals deputy taste page editor
