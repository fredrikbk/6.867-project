eyes on the road researchers seek engine of tomorrow sandia scientists work on cutting oil consumption some of the same institutions that brought you the hydrogen bomb are now working on a new mission figuring out how to build a hydrogen car sandia national laboratories in livermore calif is part of a complex of government funded institutions where during the cold war teams of scientists did heavy thinking about nuclear weaponry and other super secret military technologies the national laboratories still do a lot of that kind of work but at sandia about of the labs effort is now focused on a different security issue how to reduce oil consumption technologists at sandia are researching the basic science of a variety of alternative approaches to the gasoline fueled internal combustion engines some of this work is funded by auto makers and truck engine builders some of it is your tax dollars at work i got to spend a day at sandia earlier this month as a nonscientist it was difficult to grasp the fine points of much of the research but the underlying message was straightforward no ones found a magic bullet at least not yet consider ethanol the gasoline substitute thats most popular in washington and the midwest corn growing regions ethanol from corn is problematic in part because it cant be shipped in the existing fuel pipeline network meanwhile distilling cellulosic ethanol fuels from grasses or wood chips is all the rage in green technology circles but grant heffelfinger sandias biofuels program manager has some words of caution cellulosic ethanol has great promise he says so does creating ethanol by using algae grown in brackish water but the technology to do these is probably a decade away from being commercially viable plus making biofuels requires a lot of water an already scarce resource in much of the u s how about hydrogen sandia scientists are working on several of the hurdles to hydrogen powered cars storage is a significant problem with hydrogen in liquid form it must be kept super cold another approach is to store the hydrogen in a solid form bound to a sort of chemical sponge but refueling such a tank generates enough heat to boil gallons of water says robert carling director of the physical and engineering sciences center undeterred sandia scientists are experimenting with all sorts of tank systems and catalysts in hopes of overcoming these limitations "its not against the laws of nature we dont know if its possible " says lennie klebanoff who directs one of the centers researching hydrogen storage using metal hydrides in other parts of the sandia complex engineers and scientists are studying how to make petroleum burning engines more efficient one promising technology is hcci or homogenous charge compression ignition put simply this is an engine that burns gasoline without a spark plug and can achieve fuel efficiency thats up to better than a comparable conventional engine john dec an hcci researcher expresses enormous enthusiasm for the technology as he demonstrates a lab rig that allows him to see inside an engines combustion chamber but he reels off a list of reasons why every engine isnt hcci right now among them hcci engines tend to knock under heavy loads and burn fuel inefficiently at light loads hcci engines he says perform best when running at a constant speed thats why one use for hcci is in model airplane engines the good news is that the interest in researching these diverse technologies appears to be increasing over the past years or so the auto industry has usually responded to energy price spikes middle east conflict or surges in environmental sentiment by throwing open the doors of their r&amp d labs to show off the super efficient advanced technology prototypes hiding there but when the pressure eased as it did when gasoline prices fell during the s the prototypes tended to go back behind the curtains right now we have a trifecta an energy price spike a mideast war and a surge of green consciousness symbolized by al gores nobel peace prize at least on the surface it appears the auto industry is more serious about alternatives to the status quo than it has been since world war ii the trouble is old technology is cheap and for the mass market car business cheap isnt just good its essential at the same time scientists and auto makers are looking to improve efficiency and reduce pollution there is also a race to design cars priced around &# for emerging markets such as india its unlikely these vehicles will have lithium ion power packs or metal hydride hydrogen storage tanks on board if the millions who now get around on scooters bikes or shoe leather start buying &# cars it could create new pollution and oil consumption pressures according to the department of energys web site its proposing to spend about &# million in the fiscal year on various avenues of innovative vehicle technology research car makers will spend significant additional sums the manhattan project to produce the first atomic bombs had a budget of about &# billion in dollars through august according to research by the brookings institution the people at sandia are patriots dedicated to making america safer and stronger still the challenge theyve undertaken to help free mobility from petroleum isnt so straightforward maybe it makes sense to have a manhattan project to overcome the technical obstacles to wider use of clean fuel technology maybe it makes sense to redefine the problem which is the better fuel saving technology a car with a hydrogen fuel storage system that is right now beyond the abilities of some of the smartest people in america or the wi fi at the starbucks down the street that allows you to skip your commute altogether one or two days a week think about that with your next grande cappuccino
