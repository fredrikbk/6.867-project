the artist as deep thinker and showman san francisco the first work in an often spectacular display of olafur eliasson creations swings noisily just over your head the minute you enter the five story high atrium of the san francisco museum of modern art called "ventilator " it is made of an ordinary operating electric fan attached to the building by a foot long cord it sweeps continuously in giant arcs and circles its speed and trajectory determined by its own whirring blades and the changing temperature of the space it is the artists zingy way to call our attention to a few of his favorite concepts space speed heat sound and power mr eliasson age was born in copenhagen to icelandic parents and now operates out of berlin with a team of more than co workers he was elevated from celebrity to super celebrity status in the art world four years ago when he designed and installed one of the most popular museum exhibits of all time "the weather project" was the fourth annual commission awarded by tate modern britains national modern art museum which is housed in a remodeled power station on the south bank of the thames each of the artists chosen has somehow had to "fill" for six months the old power stations vast turbine hall an empty foyer feet long feet high and feet wide mr eliassons solution which ended up attracting million viewers was to cover the entire ceiling with mirrors thereby doubling the rooms apparent height and persuading all visitors to stare upward at themselves create an artificial sun feet in diameter at the far end of the hall made of mono frequency sodium yellow bulbs glowing eerily behind a semicircular screen completed by its reflection and then shoot fine jets of water vapor into the air creating the appearance of mist the san francisco show a four year long labor of love by senior curator madeleine grynsztejn will be here until february after which it will travel through to new york dallas and sydney australia with installations in square feet of gallery space it took workers a month to install this is by far the largest show mr eliasson has been given in this country and it is the most comprehensive survey of his work to date he is one of the most ingenious far sighted and productive artists working today motivated by complex philosophical and social theories and yet immensely popular with crowds there are two ways to ascend to the eliasson exhibition which occupies the whole fifth floor of sfmoma if you climb architect mario bottas fascinating set of stairs you end up facing a prismatic tunnel made of hundreds of acute angled triangles each formed from transparent mirrored or opaque acrylic and fitted precisely into a frame of identical accordion folded arches this work "one way colour tunnel" was created specifically to fit into mr bottas vertiginous foot long footbridge feet over the atrium floor the effect as you pass through the tunnel from the west is that of moving through one of the great windows of chartres shattered into triangular shards light from the museums elliptical skylight is broken into constantly changing jewel like colors alternating blue and magenta on the corrugated walls mostly oranges and pinks on the semi vaulted roof traversed in the opposite direction the tunnel is mostly dark although hazy hues leak through over your shoulder if you take an elevator up you exit into mr eliassons "room for one colour" the "colour" being yellow a dozen rows of single frequency lights on the ceiling the same kind of lights used to create the tate modern sun wash out every hue except a pale yellow with dark outlines not just walls and signs and elevator doors but your own hands other peoples faces and clothing turn pale yellow and gray black the effect is otherworldly and disconcerting in " degree room for all colours" a cylindrical room without a ceiling feet in diameter computer programmed fluorescent lights hidden behind the smooth high circular wall work their way through the spectrum with infinite slowness altering your mood and the look of people around you as they change just outside the cylindrical chamber a "model room" has been installed containing conceptual models of the furniture of mr eliassons imagination here are spheres and hemispheres of every sort mostly formed of triangles or hexagons like soccer balls or geodesic domes made of wood wire mirrors or cardboard in between are cylindrical tower models dirigible models cylinders domed on each end steps shells accordion folded shapes crumpled paper natural rocks a five foot diameter "inverted berlin sphere" hangs spinning in space a stainless steel and mirrored disco ball casting light across the room from inside its spiky triangulated surface these are examples of the ways mr eliasson and his associates think between commissions before they start refining their designs on computers to the right of the "model room " two interactive installations involving water as well as light "beauty" and "notion motion" arouse a magical fascination "multiple grotto" of which has been purchased by sfmoma is a kind of blow up of "berlin sphere " feet across one can walk inside it as one can in several of the artists larger sculptures from the outside it looks like a geometrical explosion of chromed steel spikes arrayed in bouquets of around kaleidoscopic hubs inside it turns into a geodesic igloo composed of about facets each reflecting both you and different views of a tan dodecahedron a sided shape which represents the gallery outside as transformed by the glazed spike ends and hubs in the end i stopped trying to figure it out and yielded to the disorienting experience in a brilliant stroke of installation design the exhibits floor plan evolved out of iterations ms grynsztejn placed this exploding silver sunburst in the middle of a large gallery at the rear of the exhibition the walls of this room are hung with six of mr eliassons geometrically organized suites of color photographs of different aspects of stark icelandic nature these primal images seem at once personal even autobiographical he returns to iceland where he spent his childhood every summer and an attempt to discover the essence of planet earth identically sized photos of the same general theme are framed without mats and hung close together in mathematical grids by by etc fifty of icelands waterfalls are shown many of them seen through color filters a river is followed from its mountain source to its mouth at the sea in compelling aerial images of oxbow bends and the dark canyons it has cut most powerful is a series of icelandic caves shot from outside or inside floored in water or rocks their rounded walls red with iron and rose with old mud i felt i was crawling through human intestines mr eliasson paints and sculpts with light air water from ice to steam earth grass and rocks he did a fire sculpture for the institute of contemporary art in boston in he is fond of complex geometries and makes use of genuine smoke and mirrors both to import and alter colors and to rearrange the visible as well as to make us see in new ways and then think about what we and how we are seeing like his rigid arrangements of photographs of wild nordic nature his dodecahedrons and concertina folded structures that break up sunlight seem to me attempts to contain the forces of nature within the limits of highly sophisticated human reason dont miss the separate second floor exhibit of mr eliassons transformation of a bmw experimental racing car into a giant armadillo covered with ice which is kept in a refrigerated chamber and hold on to the brochure map handed out at the entrance there are no wall labels since the walls are part of the art and some installations are not easy to find the shows catalog is heavy with philosophical references as well as tantalizing color pictures of these and many more of the artists works but for all his deep thinking olafur eliasson remains committed before all else to the viewers attention and experience which he captures and expands through his genius as a showman a magician a wizard of oz who has stepped out from behind the curtain if not on the epic scale of the tate modern installation this show should prove a popular hit like sfmomas other big crowd pleasers devoted to alexander calder and sol lewitt mr littlejohn writes for the journal about west coast cultural events
