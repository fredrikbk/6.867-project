mortgage process has become more complex with consumer information flowing through the hands of a menagerie of independent brokers itinerant loan officers investors and financial middlemen with the housing downturn forcing many of these firms to sack workers and shut branches some mortgage files are getting lost in the shuffle turning up in places like dumpsters that are easily accessed by scam artists "in times of organizational change or chaos were much more likely to see those kinds of leaks what i call inadvertent disclosures " dartmouth college management professor eric johnson says
