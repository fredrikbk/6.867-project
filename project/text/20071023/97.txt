politics &amp economics hus big challenge getting provinces on board chinas new leadership will assert more control at local level to ensure policies are carried out beijing chinese leader hu jintao has gathered a new group of top officials whose experience in local government could help beijing strengthen its authority over the local interests that have impeded his administration mr hu presented the new lineup of the communist partys top leadership the politburo and its decision making standing committee at the partys twice a decade congress yesterday as he begins his second five year term as party chief the party elite also ratified mr hus broad platform of policies one that heavily emphasizes domestic issues and the economy yet many of mr hus declared priorities narrower income gaps improved environmental protections and a stronger social safety net have so far been thwarted by local governments more concerned with keeping business flowing at any cost few local authorities have for instance proved willing to shut down polluting factories or spend heavily on new health care programs while china has risen to the worlds fourth largest national economy from its sixth largest during mr hus first term inequality has worsened the average urban household now earns more than three times in a year what its rural counterparts do "we will be firmly committed to development which is the partys top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country " mr hu said yesterday in brief remarks to reporters he committed to "putting people first" and making growth "comprehensive balanced and sustainable " a reference to concerns about environmental damage and inequality that is going to require the cooperation of local authorities many of chinas provinces are equivalent in geographic expanse and population to european nations and running them has always required the central government to allow a fair amount of flexibility but mr hus administration has increasingly displayed frustration with local officials reluctance to fully back its policies recently his government tightened central control over areas such as land sales and the environment where local actions were producing popular unrest more such changes are now likely to be in the works "on current trends the central government will try to take back powers from local governments rather than grant them more power " says chen yufeng a professor at zhejiang gongshang university a particular challenge mr chen says will be finding a better way to evaluate local government officials since the current system tends to reward those who generate fast economic growth rather than those who have other priorities the partys new leadership also reflects that concern with ensuring central policies are carried out at the local level of the members of the new politburo have experience running a provincial government four more than in the previous politburo they are roughly split between those who have worked in the poorer inland or northeastern provinces and those who have spent time in the wealthier coastal areas the new lineup wasnt decided by mr hu alone but is the result of months of bargaining behind closed doors by the entire party leadership yet it seems significant that two of the partys rising stars are provincial leaders who have distinguished themselves with local policies supporting mr hus priorities mr hu introduced two officials newly promoted to the politburo standing committee xi jinping and li keqiang as "relatively young comrades " they are the only members of the standing committee the nerve center of political power in china who are in their s the other seven men are all in their s that means they are the leaders now best placed to succeed mr hu and other current top leaders at the next party congress in mr xi years old has spent the past two decades working in various capacities in wealthy areas on the coast such as zhejiang province and for the past half year shanghai he has developed a reputation as an effective and business friendly administrator but one who doesnt neglect social issues "xi jinping doesnt only focus on growth but also on the quality of growth and attaches importance to protecting peoples rights " says ge licheng an economist at the zhejiang academy of social sciences mr xi made that shift in thinking earlier than many other local government officials he says mr li has had less provincial experience but his time spent running chinas relatively poorer regions fits into the top leaderships focus on the worse off for nine years mr li was a party official in central henan province and later liaoning a northeastern province that has long struggled to recover from the collapse of state owned industry he made a mark by among other things overseeing a program to provide permanent housing to more than one million laid off workers says zhang hongjun a historian at the liaoning academy of social sciences the emphasis on domestic problem solving in the current leadership has made foreign policy a lower priority the new politburo doesnt have any officials with experience in international relations aside from mr hu himself who handles them as chinas president some observers also have concerns about a lack of technical expertise at the highest level while many of the new politburo members are well educated several have graduate degrees only one has experience in the financial system wang qishan a former banker who is now mayor of beijing and the politburo still provides outsiders with few hints of its deliberations the new standing committee members were presented yesterday to reporters gathered in beijings great hall of the people one of the very few occasions when they appear in public together as mr hu introduced them the other eight men all dressed in dark suits and all but one wearing red ties stood stiffly on a podium covered in red cloth no one aside from mr hu spoke and he didnt take questions zhou yang and sue feng contributed to this article
