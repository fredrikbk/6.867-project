microsoft yields in eu antitrust battle brussels microsoft corp s decision to drop its nine year fight with european regulators could signal tougher regulation ahead for big global technology companies operating in europe the defeat also means microsoft will need to tread carefully in europe when it bundles products or features into its core operating system and will need to welcome competitors with fairly open arms if they come calling for ways to make their software work better with microsofts windows operating system the software giant said it wouldnt appeal a ruling by a top european union court last month that backed sweeping powers for eu antitrust regulators to tackle the abuse of a monopoly position by technology companies microsofts decision not to appeal leaves that ruling as settled law in a deal sealed yesterday the redmond wash company also agreed to license information that competitors need to make their software work better with certain versions of windows it had long resisted doing so saying the information comprised fruits of its intellectual labors that it should be able to keep secret the case touched two corners of the microsoft software empire operating systems for a single class of computer servers and software that plays audio and video files the eu had told microsoft to unbundle the media player software the company sells with windows and to give competitors the data they need to make their software work with windows given the global nature of technology and the global nature of most big tech customers the agreements are likely to mean that the interoperability information will spread to companies doing business outside of europe though the eu would technically have little legal recourse if microsoft didnt share the information with companies that dont operate inside the bloc the matter has been hard fought since the eu first penalized microsoft in in the case which followed a complaint it was watched closely by competitors for what it said about europes ability to regulate monopolies after the u s justice department settled its antitrust case against microsoft in according to bill whyman a technology analyst with international strategy and investment group a brokerage firm in new york "it was never just about these two issues media player software and interoperability but about an effort to keep microsoft under court jurisdiction and under regulatory supervision " mr whyman said "the u s wasnt a very friendly environment and europe was friendly " competitors have lodged other complaints in brussels against microsoft including one from a consortium backed by international business machines corp that challenges the dominance of microsofts office software eu antitrust czar neelie kroes yesterday didnt indicate how the eu would address those complaints eu regulators also now have other big u s technology companies in their sights among them intel corp which has been accused of selling computer microprocessors below cost and using rebates and other payments to induce customers not to buy chips from its smaller rival advanced micro devices inc also on the brussels docket is google inc whose proposed acquisition of internet advertising company doubleclick inc is being scrutinized googles proposed purchase of doubleclick has led to fears as promulgated by some competitors that the search giant would have too firm a lock on the personal data and browsing habits of web users that are central to selling targeted internet ads yesterday the eu said it had extended its review of the planned purchase until the middle of next month under a deal reached after negotiations over a recent dinner between mrs kroes and microsoft chief executive steve ballmer microsoft agreed to slash the cost it was charging to license the interoperability information needed to make software work well with windows the eu in return stopped the clock on record fines against microsoft which were accruing at million euros &# million a day a microsoft spokesman said the company wouldnt comment beyond a brief statement in which it said it would "continue to work closely with the commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and competitive environment for information technology " a spokesman for novell inc which distributes a variant of the open source linux operating system said the company would be looking closely at the proposed licensing scheme though he said it was too soon to say whether novell would take the licenses to the extent that the licensing encourages interoperability "that will be a positive for us as well as for the industry more broadly " said the spokesman bruce lowry "that has been our focus for basically a decade to try to get a level playing field " mr lowry said novell hasnt licensed interoperability information from microsoft though it did reach a deal last year in which the two companies agreed not to sue each others customers over patent issues and established technology and marketing arrangements to promote interoperability microsofts decision came after a ruling from the eus court of first instance last month that effectively endorsed broad authority for eu regulators to compel a dominant company to share its intellectual property in a decision that was the fruit of a six year probe the eu hit microsoft with a million euro fine demanded that it provide interoperability information to competitors and required it to sell a version of windows without a media player microsoft subsequently produced a media player free version of windows but it had bickered with the eu over exactly what information it should share and at what price the deal reached yesterday resolves that dispute the million euros which had been in an escrow account will be released to the eu legal experts said microsoft had little room to mount an appeal after a court decision that came down so strongly on the other side instead the company sought a deal mr ballmer and mrs kroes brokered the deal at a small restaurant in the eu antitrust chiefs home country of the netherlands according to mrs kroes it was sealed in a telephone call early yesterday morning under the agreement microsoft will license all of its intellectual property except patents necessary for competitors to work with a version of windows used on business servers competitors will now pay a one time fee of euros for the license rather than royalties if they believe they need to license patents from microsoft microsoft is required to give a license at the rate of of the competitors revenue from the product well below the rate the company had once wanted mrs kroes declared the u s software company was at least for now in europes good graces "as of today the major issues concerning compliance have been resolved " she said
