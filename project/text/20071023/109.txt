room to run for under armour maybe investors who have been cheering on under armour inc may want to wear the athletic apparel makers sweat wicking gear when it posts third quarter results next week revenue growth could falter and early indications are that the fourth quarter isnt off to a good start competition also is heating up as nike inc and adidas ag look to grab share in the market for compression undergarments which are meant to keep moisture away from a wearers body during athletic activities in warm and cool weather in addition the prospect of a slowing economy could hurt sales of under armours tight stretchy gear which is worn by everyone from football players to long distance runners and which are priced well above old fashioned cotton t shirts and shorts "back to school was definitely disappointing for active apparel and footwear but the rate of decline was more marked here for under armour " says matt powell chief retail analyst at sportscaninfo which tracks sports apparel sales and sells data to manufacturers retailers and workers in the sporting goods industry as well as to some in the financial community "after four or five years of huge growth its very hard to maintain big percentage increases year over year " but that is the challenge facing under armour which pioneered the compression gear market the companys shares trade at more than times projected per share earnings for making it a battleground stock for growth investors and short sellers in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange under armours shares rose cents or to &# giving the company a market value of about &# billion bulls justify the rich price by pointing to heady growth sales soared to &# million at the end of last year from &# million in and the promise of the companys expansion into europe and into other athletic lines such as footwear under armour is in a quiet period ahead of its oct earnings release but in a late september speech chief executive and founder kevin plank noted that the company has just a sliver of the &# billion u s footwear and apparel market "so when you think about the running room the market space the opportunity that we have in front of us theres frankly a lot of running room for our business and our brand in the u s alone " he says hedge funds have bet heavily against the stock and argue that it will be impossible for under armour to keep pace with its valuation these naysayers have pushed its short interest a measure of borrowed shares sold by investors expecting the stock to fall in value to about of shares outstanding so far the bulls have been winning the argument under armours stock has more than quadrupled since it went public at &# a share in november the shares have been especially hot since the start of july rising nearly yet it is during the july to september period that sales appear to have slowed according to sportscaninfo which says it tracks sales from outlets in the u s unseasonably warm weather and the lack of a new product introduction in the quarter hurt under armours sales sportsscaninfos mr powell says the data show that under armour generated retail apparel sales of about &# million during the third quarter that is up less than compared with the same period last year this suggests under armour may have a tough time meeting analysts consensus expectations for third quarter revenue of about &# million while sportscaninfo tracks retail sales under armour like other companies reports wholesale revenue figures rather the sportscaninfo data suggest that under armours sales growth could drop to between and compared with the prior years period that would be great for most companies but under armour posted revenue growth in the first quarter and in the second quarter there is a potential swing factor sales of under armour products by retailer dicks sporting goods inc which can account for as much as a quarter of the companys sales dicks doesnt report to sportscaninfo so the data provider estimates such sales using mathematical models such models can sometimes lead to problems for example in the second quarter the data indicated some weekly under armour sales growth was slower than in the year earlier period in fact under armour reported a increase in revenue in the second quarter and raised its revenue forecast for the year so dicks along with other outlets that arent picked up in the data providers numbers could help under armour confound the bears that said the prospect of slower growth already has rattled investors in late september ubs downgraded the company from "buy" to "neutral " saying warm weather had cut into sales of cold weather gear bulls shrugged it off "we continue to believe slower sales at retail is strictly a function of weather and where weather has cooled under armour product has sold through very well " analysts at wachovia corp said in a research note last week but the fourth quarter a key period for retailers appears to have started poorly under armours apparel sales during the first two weeks of october are down more than compared with a year ago according to sportscaninfo data christmas could make up for this but like other retailers under armour faces the head wind of what appears to be a slowing economy and weakening consumer spending adding to that pressure is mounting competition from nike and adidas nike which sells compression gear under the nike pro brand saw its share of this market increase to in the back to school period compared with a year earlier sportscaninfo said nike which has a global distribution network is "putting the full weight of the brand behind" this area says derek kent a nike spokesman adidas which owns the reebok brand is also making headway with its tech fit compression apparel line although it has a less than market share according to sportscaninfo "we have aggressive growth plans for compression apparel with product distribution and marketing support " says andrea corso a spokeswoman for adidas which is based in herzogenaurach germany
