ode to the rockies online edition special to the wall street journal online the daily fix asked readers who are fans of the rockies and red sox to write an ode to their club explaining why they root for them and what characteristics their team seems to have year in and year out even as the cast of characters changes heres jason sindler on the colorado rockies tomorrow mike bonafide on the boston red sox here in denver its strange to find a rockies fan who roots for the uniform after all the team is only years old and doesnt have generations of fans who grew up with it sharing memories part of the problem is the seasons prior to this one have yielded far more boos than cheers more dohs than woo hoos and more losing seasons than winning seasons four until this year the biggest home run in rockies history may have been eric youngs lead off shot in the first ever rockies home game in a city where it seems everyone is from somewhere else and brings their team loyalties with them what is a rockies fan but a baseball fan who lives in denver i am that fan i grew up in baltimore in a family that loves baseball and the orioles were the pride of the city and my entire reason for existence as a kid my dad and grandfather went to the all star game in baltimore in my father grew up with brooks i grew up with eddie and cal we shared moments and memories that brought our family together and made us root for the team its part of my dna to root for that uniform although with each passing year into the abyss that peter angelos has dug i am more partial to the cartoon bird worn by eddie cal and brooks than to the ornithologically correct bird of losing seasons and mismanaged rosters i have lived in colorado since like many of this transient population i went to rockies games and rooted for them unless my team was in town i endured rebuilding plans a b c and d and began to lose faith in the franchise and ownership but it wasnt until i watched "fever pitch" in and identified with the red sox crazy character played by jimmy fallon that i realized how much i missed caring about my team and how i wanted my kids to care as well i wanted to share the kind of memories with my kids that id shared growing up but sorry orioles i also knew my kids could only create those memories rooting for our home team their dads team wouldnt cut it and so a rockies fan a real rockies fan was born the rockies finished last year strong fifth best record after july and one could see the makings of a good team on the horizon lots of young homegrown talent who came up through the system together troy tulowitzki lit the competitive fire of the team and i at had a new favorite baseball player one who just turned the rockies overcame a disastrous road trip in june that featured four blown saves by brian fuentes tulowitzki may have secured the rookie of the year award on that trip in three of the blown saves tulo hit a home run for the lead in the th or extra innings aaron cook jason hirsh and rodrigo lopez three fifths of the rotation hit the dl in august but rookie callups ubaldo jimenez and franklin morales stepped up rookie manny corpas stepped fearlessly into the closer role and of course the middle "h" of the lineup matt holliday todd helton and brad hawpe were putting up big numbers the rockies had the mix of youth and veterans that blend well together and in some ways they embody the city todd helton is the rare native among newer younger players but the combination makes the team great "the streak" began on sunday sept the rockies beat the florida marlins in a win that included heltons th home run they were games out of the wild card with to go but all of the remaining games were against the teams in front of them the crowd that day was only the broncos were playing in this football town but within two weeks the team had captivated the city by the last homestand tickets were at a premium and the crowd was one of the loudest in baseball that streak filled the park but more importantly its given those fans the memories you need to root for the uniform clint hurdle put it best "this is one of those things where you get everybody back years down the road and you have a reunion gig " but the rockies are a great team not just a great story they are baseballs best defensive team the starting pitchers battle every night the bullpen features three current or former closers the lineup is one of the toughest in baseball and from tulo on down the chemistry is undeniable i love that i now sit in the car waiting to hear how the inning ends before heading inside i love watching the games on tv and knowing the rockies have a shot to win tonight and theyll fight even if they dont and i love that they play baseball the way i want my kids to play jason sindler works in corporate finance in denver and managed to get this article done during quarter end and budget season his father is happy for him but still feels the need to root for the american league while his kids have short enough memories to think the rockies win every game jason is working to convince his wife that their next child should be named "tulo " write to him here
