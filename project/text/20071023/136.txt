treating diabetes and understanding cultures with minorities at risk doctors work to make diet advice hit home with minorities accounting for nearly a third of the u s population medical professionals are beginning to bone up on so called cultural competency part of an effort to ensure that patients from disparate backgrounds get proper care nowhere is the challenge more acute than for those treating diabetics given the rising incidence of the disease its prevalence among minority groups and the changes in diet and lifestyle that treatment often entails consider huajun huang of nine patients he saw at new yorks elmhurst hospital clinic one morning this year four spoke only spanish three were chinese born two recently arrived from south asia and four were diabetic in treating such patients dr huang like counterparts across the u s is adapting dietary and other lifestyle advice to the needs of an ever more polyglot population with diabetes patients speaking scores of languages and eating similarly varied cuisines new yorks public hospitals have mounted a campaign to tailor treatment and counseling to their ethnicities tactics including multilingual handouts electronic data sharing and on site cooking lessons have helped doctors there and elsewhere make inroads against diabetes in communities with some of the highest rates of the disease all diabetes patients need to exercise and limit their intake of salt sugar and fat still "its not hard to imagine that if you choose a typical american diet and youre speaking to someone whos latino or chinese its not going to be very helpful " says rand david chief of ambulatory medicine at elmhurst hospital in queens to illustrate proper portion sizes to patients of different ethnic groups dr huang ordered in plates of lamb korma fried plantains and general tsos chicken from restaurants and put photographs of the meals in an online menu available in every exam room the hospital also has invested in a demonstration kitchen to teach patients to cook favorite foods in healthier ways such efforts arent intended to provide different medical care to patients based on ethnic or religious backgrounds the goal is to make health advice more accessible said jeannette south paul chairwoman of the family medicine department at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine "its imperative that you get this information across to patients and help them treat these ailments because they result in increased mortality " dr south paul said "if you can be creative in how you approach that population that is good " new yorks system is showing results at elmhurst which has tracked diabetes patients longer than most of the citys other hospitals about half of diabetic patients have blood sugar levels close to that of a healthy adult about five years ago did diabetes drastically increases the risk of heart attack stroke blindness kidney failure and amputation while one in eight new yorkers has diabetes rates are substantially higher within some ethnic groups and among lower income patients who tend to rely on public hospitals citywide nearly half of asian residents have diabetes or symptoms often labeled pre diabetes a state health department survey found about a third of african american and hispanic residents have one of the two conditions as do about of white residents most of the rates exceed national averages the citys hospitals start by communicating in patients native tongues handouts come in languages from albanian to spanish to urdu phone based translation services including a limited simultaneous service like the one used by the united nations allow doctors and nurses to communicate in dozens more languages losing even a few pounds can help patients bring diabetes under control so many hospital systems focus on food kings county hospital center in brooklyn recently installed a demonstration kitchen as part of a &# diabetes resource center at annelda goodings cooking classes for caribbean emigrants the dietitian suggests flavoring rice with fresh herbs and spices instead of pig snouts or tripe and she offers tips for cooking starchy yucca or fatty oxtail a popular meat for stew and soup gilian best hamilton a year old guyanese emigrant diagnosed with diabetes six years ago said the classes helped her change eating habits entrenched since childhood ms best hamilton says rice made up a big part of many meals in her family and most vegetables were fried "youre accustomed to eating one way all your life " she said "its hard to change " diabetes educators and dietitians found they had a lot to learn themselves particularly when dealing with patients from cultures different from their own patients "eat a lot of different foods we may not be familiar with " said jane giordano a clinical nutrition manager at elmhurst hospital among her references is a page online guide from the american association of physicians of indian origin which lists nutritional information for everything from roti an indian flat bread to dal bean or pea dishes to samosas deep fried stuffed pastry snacks her advice to diabetes patients who typically must limit the carbohydrates they eat "if you have the dal dont eat the roti " other hospitals and health centers nationwide are tackling many of the same problems with some of the same tools the cambridge health alliance in massachusetts tracks patients in a computerized diabetes registry and targets health tips to haitian and hispanic residents among others san diegos project dulce from the whittier institute for diabetes offers cooking tips and exercise groups for hispanics and filipino and vietnamese emigrants among others the minority population of the u s topped million this spring the census bureau reported as that population grows treatment efforts extend well beyond diabetes new jersey requires medical schools to provide "cultural competency training " and california requires continuing education for doctors to include "cultural and linguistic competency" offerings in new mexico a task force will recommend curriculum changes and other states are considering similar requirements the backbone of new yorks effort in many ways is the hospital chains electronic medical record system which lets doctors and nurses track patients blood sugar levels cholesterol and eye exams among other indicators during patient visits doctors can quickly spot when patients are due for foot or eye exams if patients miss appointments hospitals call and mail letters in the patients native languages they may even send telegrams much of the effort isnt directly reimbursed by medicare medicaid or private insurers the hospital system estimates it spends about &# million a year on language services from signs to translators and an additional &# million to &# million on clinical information technology over time the program should save the city money by reducing the amount of care diabetics require to treat complications especially because about of the systems million patients are uninsured said alan d aviles president of the hospital system "it doesnt take too many averted cardiac surgeries before you have the money needed to start a demonstration kitchen " he said
