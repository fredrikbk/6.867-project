legalizing the uneducated is potential political risk your oct editorial "messed up manhunt" was only partly right yes lets get the social security records straightened out and increase the h b visa cap for skilled foreign nationals we may need more farm workers but why should issuing "temporary" work permits for farm workers make them eligible for legal status most farm workers have little education and come to this country for work that they cant find at home as legal citizens with the right to vote in this country will they expect and support a government just like the one they left where corruption bribery and cronyism control government the exact opposite that we have or at least expect work for and vote for we dont need large numbers of new voters who left a country because their government failed them but who are not political refugees from that country rather they are the citizens responsible for voting that failed government into power i fear that legalizing large numbers of uneducated workers with little or no knowledge of this countrys history or what made this country such a great place to live and work could have a very damaging impact on our government and country john h james james cattle &amp land co fort worth texas
