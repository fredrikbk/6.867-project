due process for exxon it has been nearly two decades since the exxon valdez ran aground in alaska spilling barrels of crude oil the company long ago paid dearly for the catastrophic accident some &# billion in clean up costs natural resource damages claims payments fines and penalties now the ninth circuit court of appeals has ordered exxon mobil corp to pay &# billion in punitive damages the largest such award affirmed by a federal court in history the company has asked the supreme court to review the case the court will likely decide by oct whether to do so given the critical issues of law and justice at stake it should recent supreme court decisions have struck down some punitive damage verdicts because they are so "grossly excessive" that they violate constitutional due process these decisions also make clear that a defendant has a due process right to "fair notice" of the conduct that will subject him to liability for punitive damages in the first place the &# billion award in valdez raises obvious and important questions of excessiveness it is larger than the total of all punitive damage awards affirmed by all the federal appellate courts in history more important is the question whether federal maritime law and constitutional due process permit the infliction of any punitive damages exxon argues that at the time of the oil spill federal maritime law had long barred punitive damages against a shipowner if the owner did not ratify reckless conduct of the ships master the supreme court has held firm since the early s that misdeeds by the ships master cannot be blamed on the ships title holder unless it "directed" or "countenanced" the wrongful act the district court tossed all this overboard instructing the jury to consider any reckless acts by captain joseph hazelwood or his crew automatically to be reckless acts of exxon even though the company did not ratify the wrongful conduct that led to the spill indeed the ship master had violated clear company policies given the long legal tradition exxon could not possibly have had "fair notice" of its liability for punitive damages under these circumstances the ninth circuit upheld the district courts ruling putting it at odds with the majority of other federal appeals courts not to mention as ninth circuit judge alex kozinski observed in dissent that companies have "for centuries" relied on this understanding of the law in running their shipping businesses numerous federal courts have held that where congress has established statutory penalties for maritime infractions federal judges are prohibited from authorizing new remedies such as punitive damages not provided in those statutes the clean water act establishes a carefully calibrated statutory scheme of penalties for pollution pursuant to which exxon has already paid stiff multibillion dollar penalties the fair notice principle is fundamental to the rule of law criminal or civil and for obvious reasons of fairness many years ago the court said in grayned v city of rockford that "because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly " in the criminal sphere the court has declared that the "concept of fair notice is the bedrock of any constitutionally fair procedure " and because punitive damages "share key characteristics of criminal sanctions " the court has expressly recognized that "retroactive imposition of punitive damages" based on a change in the law after the conduct in question occurred "would raise a serious constitutional question " unfortunately federal and state courts frequently do allow juries to impose punitive damages against defendants based on newly adopted constantly changing and retrospectively applied legal standards for example in product liability litigation the source of some of the largest punitive damage verdicts in recent years courts routinely allow the jury to set a new safety "standard" in deciding if a particular product was defectively designed then permit the jury to impose punitive damages against the maker of the product for violating it the district court in valdez effectively changed the law in the midst of trial and then allowed the jury to impose a retroactive record setting punishment against exxon for violating rules that did not exist when the valdez ran aground this is a serious constitutional wrong which the supreme court should right mr boutrous is a partner in the law firm of gibson dunn &amp crutcher llp and frequently represents defendants challenging the constitutionality of punitive damages
