china s long march to the moon beijing heats up space race against japan this week communist party pride shanghai fifty years after the soviet union launched sputnik the worlds first man made satellite and jolted the u s into a race for space china is ramping up a new space contest with an eye on rival japan tomorrow evening the china national space administration is scheduled to fire a "long march" rocket from a launch site in the southwestern province of sichuan if all goes well it will propel a satellite into lunar orbit an important step toward chinas goal of beating japan to become the first asian nation to put a man on the moon chinas launch would follow a similar moon shot by japan last month that lofted a japanese satellite to a lunar orbit the japanese and chinese satellites are designed to collect information about the moon that could help prepare for future voyages by unmanned probes and eventually astronauts for either country putting a person on the lunar surface could take decades the missions by china and japan are part of a broader resurgence of interest in the moon by space agencies around the world the u s and india also are planning unmanned lunar exploration missions next year it is the biggest burst of such work since the s the last humans to stand on the moon were american astronauts from the apollo mission in the chinese space program is another indicator of chinas desire to build itself into a world power china has sent astronauts into orbit twice already only the third country to do so with its own rockets the push into space enjoys huge popular support here sales of astronomy books are booming fans have set up space program web sites and there is a growing number of magazines for space buffs flights to the space center in sichuan are booked solid for the days before this weeks launch ye mingsheng a year old trading company owner from chengdu plans to fly in to watch the satellite lift off he says that he and about of his friends have paid the equivalent of more than &# each for admission to watch the launch "moon exploration is such a big and important thing for china " says mr ye "we are very excited about it " nearly chinese citizens sent letters to the space agency to vote for which patriotic songs should be broadcast by the satellite as it approached the moon among the top picks according to the agency "love our china " "my motherland " and "walk into the new era " on the southern resort island of hainan where china is constructing its fourth space launch center officials are also planning to build a space exploration theme park with a grandstand for viewing rocket launches and shuttle buses that would ferry tourists around the rocket assembly plant launch tower and other facilities some companies are trying to tap into the public excitement for example china mengniu dairy co the countrys largest dairy company made the space program the cornerstone of nationalistic ads mengnius packages boast that it "is special milk for chinese astronauts " who are known as taikonauts taikong is the chinese word for space in addition to commercial interests national pride is driving the chinese program in a country where people fret that their nation is the only permanent member of the united nations security council that doesnt have an aircraft carrier even the appearance of falling behind can spark an outcry "its sad little japan has beaten china to the moon " said one angry post on an internet bulletin board after japans september satellite launch "china needs to wake up " japanese space officials are more circumspect tatsuo oshima a spokesman for the japan aerospace exploration agency says "pure scientific purposes" are what motivate his country "we are not in space development because we are competing with other nations " he says in the japanese space agency laid out a blueprint for space exploration that included plans for a human presence on the moon by but mr oshima says the agency currently has neither the budget nor the expertise to achieve these goals some chinese scientists think china might be able to put a man on the moon in to years in about five years china aims to have a probe on the moons surface followed by an unmanned spacecraft that will return to earth with soil samples for china the aim is explicitly political as well as scientific "lunar exploration reflects a countrys comprehensive national power " said ouyang ziyuan the chief scientist for chinas moon program in an interview with the official communist party newspaper peoples daily it will "raise our international prestige and strengthen the cohesion of our people " for chinas communist party space prowess is becoming an important source of legitimacy at home and abroad where it is trying to position china as a country whose nondemocratic model of development is worthy of emulation the space program for example uses "long march" rockets named after the communist forces famous civil war maneuver mao zedong cemented his place as the communists leader during the arduous journey a series of telecommunications and broadcasting satellites is named "the east is red " chinas space program has come a long way since mao complained in the early s that china couldnt even "launch a potato" into space its roots date back to the later years of that decade when the country with soviet support focused its technical firepower on developing ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads china launched its first satellite in but an early effort to start a manned space program was abandoned in amid the political chaos and economic troubles of the cultural revolution it wasnt until the s that china restarted sustained efforts to put astronauts into space and started developing spacecraft that could be sent into orbit and then return safely to earth in yang liwei became the first man sent into space by the china national space administration in two more astronauts orbited the earth for five days at last weeks party congress in beijing mr yang the astronaut said that the countrys astronaut corps all party members plan to start a chapter in space once the country establishes its own space station according to chinas state run xinhua news agency just as in the cold war chinas space exploration has serious military overtones chinas military leaders speak of the need to exploit space in order to win modern wars china is investing to set up a network of satellites like the u s already has that will allow its armed forces to conduct surveillance and navigate around the world one of the most spectacular accomplishments of chinas military space program so far has been the development of an anti satellite missile china used one to destroy an aging weather satellite in a test earlier this year alarming the pentagon and beijings asian neighbors china also hopes its missions will keep it from falling behind in efforts to exploit space based resources the moon is a potential source of a helium isotope known as helium that scientists believe could be a potent fuel for fusion reactions to produce energy on earth "china is a huge energy consuming country " says qiao xiaolin who is on an expert panel advising chinas lunar exploration program and is a professor at the harbin institute of technology one of chinas top universities "we have to go for the resource too " much of what china has been doing is reinventing the wheel essentially replicating decades old accomplishments by the u s soviet union and other nations but chinese scientists say they are making advancements of their own the moon orbiting satellite that is to lift off on wednesday is a prime example these scientists say the satellite named the change i after a female figure from chinese mythology who lives on the moon along with a white rabbit will trace a path around the moons poles it will orbit the moon for more than a year allowing it to map nearly every part of its terrain and overall structure last week china announced its space goals for the next five years which include the establishment of an orbiting "sky lab " the country also plans to send astronauts to the lunar surface but dr qiao and chinas space scientists and engineers are already thinking past the moon and looking forward to future missions to mars and beyond in the decades ahead ellen zhu and yuka hayashi contributed to this article
