business technology talking tech financial software makes move to web the web is slowly but relentlessly changing the way people use computers including the use of everyday pieces of software personal finance software such as quicken or money has long been a mainstay for home computers but its another example of something you can now do online at a web developers conference last month attendees selected mint com as best new company at the event mint lets users track items such as their credit card expenses online by using just a browser the service is free mint takes in revenue when users act on its suggestions for ways to save money aaron patzer mints founder talked about some of the differences between online and offline software q whats the advantage of a program living online rather than on your desktop a there are two big advantages one of them is that you can leverage the power of the web you can pull in data sources from everywhere the second is that you can continuously upgrade and improve your software desktop packages are usually put out once a year and if they have bugs they have bugs for an entire year or the software may patch itself but they dont put out new features except on an annual basis they are locked you never get any new features in the interim at mint we push out new features on a weekly basis minor features on a weekly basis and major features once a month q whats wrong with packaged software makers upgrading their products regularly a what they want to do for their business model is to get their customers to upgrade every year quicken and microsoft money sunset their products they actually force you to upgrade every three or so years to force an upgrade you have to justify it somehow so they end up in feature warfare where they put in endless amounts of trivial or pointless features but that diverts focus away from the core features you see that in some microsoft products word or excel or were just fine but in order to force the upgrade they add different features that no one ends up using instead you want to do your core features in an elegant simple user friendly way and i think the web is more geared for that you arent pressured into trying to sell boxed software once a year q google is making word processing and spreadsheet software that runs online even microsoft is moving in that direction what do you think the future holds a three or five years from now all your core applications will be online your finances your word processing your spreadsheets the only kind of software you would ever want on a desktop is something that requires a lot of processing power and bandwidth like video editing or gaming q personal finance software had been around almost as long as personal computers have what was it like designing a personal finance program new and from the ground up a it allowed us to think about what problems people have instead of being trapped in an old framework like an electronic checkbook we were able to allow people to get all the information about their finances in one place and it allowed us to question some fundamental assumptions such as do you really even need to balance your checkbook any more i dont think so i think software can do it for you and i dont think banks make the mistakes they would have or years ago at least for people like me the internet generation we are comfortable with doing things online
