virgin blues sale picture clouds despite fast growth ownership limits keep bidders at bay sydney australia this countrys second largest airline could be up for sale by year end but strikingly given that virgin blue holdings is among the worlds fastest growing and most profitable carriers potential buyers arent lining up a scarcity of interested airline parties tough financing conditions for leveraged buyout players and lack of a significant international network mean toll holdings may have no option but to retain its stake toll chief executive paul little said in september that the billion australian dollar us&# billion logistics company hopes to decide by the end of this year whether to hold reduce or totally sell its virgin blue shares amid mounting speculation mr little said two weeks ago a sale wasnt imminent as rival airlines have moved to distance themselves from the carrier while a partial selldown to either institutional or individual investors would unlock a tight share register and may help the airline narrow a share price gap with larger rival qantas airways by increasing liquidity market watchers believe this option is unlikely toll would need to exit from its stake at a discount to market prices since starting in with two aircraft flying between its brisbane base and sydney virgin blue now has more than boeing s servicing routes around australia and the south pacific with aspirations to fly farther afield including to the u s british billionaire founder richard branson head of the global virgin group holds just of the airline after selling a stake to australian stevedoring company patrick corp before floating the airline in late patrick secured control with a stake after a takeover bid in which it then surrendered to toll following an acrimonious but ultimately successful a&# billion takeover battle last year virgin blue originally pitching itself as a low cost carrier sought to undercut the then virtual duopoly of qantas which still commands two thirds of australias passenger traffic and ansett which collapsed under financial pressure in later virgin blue expanded services while maintaining its "user pays" model for example passengers who arent "gold member" frequent fliers can pay to use its airport lounges while partly to differentiate virgin blue from jetstar qantass discount arm that started in the strategy is aimed at luring higher yielding corporate and government business from qantas suggesting early success virgin blues net profit in the year ended june rose from the previous year to a record a&# million in its latest year qantas also had a record net profit a&# million as both airlines enjoyed strong passenger growth a comfortable domestic pricing duopoly and near full aircraft while qantas would be precluded from buying virgin blue on competition grounds and air new zealand said this month there is "no substance" to rumors its interested aviation analysts say the most likely buyer would be an international carrier that flies to australia "its probably going to be a trade player " says cassandra meagher an aviation analyst at brokerage commsec she sees emirates airline etihad airways and qatar airways as most likely to look at buying a tie up with a carrier offering european routes via the middle east would make virgin blue more attractive to business passengers but any foreign buyer that wants virgin blue in hopes it can fly to the u s wont be able to directly control the australian carrier in order to retain the australian governments endorsement for u s routes virgin blue must remain at least australian owned derek sadubin chief operating officer of the centre for asia pacific aviation a sydney consultancy says major global airlines are looking north of australia for expansion "virgin blue doesnt have that international network strength to be on the radar for the big international carriers theyve got even bigger fish to fry " he says turkish stocks decline on
