the game reputation is everything until it costs deal makers to breakers as street hits straits adopt hoo hoo model in the clubhouses of the year old international concatenated order of hoo hoo members have been known to crawl around like cats lapping up milk with their tongues inspired by egyptian folklore rituals like this bound together some of the leaders of the lumber industry though silly they have helped forge a fraternal bond minimizing the chances the members might mistreat one another in business for the hoo hoo relationships and reputation become one wall street is often likened to a small club not unlike the hoo hoo where character and relationships are the coin of the realm but it turns out that there are natural limits on how reputation the esteem with which one is held by others can affect behavior were seeing those limits now as the worlds credit crisis plays out before our eyes "reputation matters until you get to some serious pain " says edward rock co director at the institute of law &amp economics at the university of pennsylvania "it matters if the stakes are low somewhere between &# million and &# billion it shifts " how else to explain how banks private equity firms bond salesmen boards of directors and hedge funds are wheedling reneging on and resetting all sorts of business contracts and promises "i would love to say yes that reputation matters " said one top deal maker on friday "in principle it does still the line is not as bright as that implies " indeed the breadth of this current crisis has created what might best be described as a reputational free fire zone take ubs which promised to commit up to &# billion to finance shoe retailer finish lines purchase of rival genesco ubs has recently said it may not be able to complete the deal putting the whole ordeal in litigation similar noises came out of the august houses of goldman sachs group and kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co who doubled back on their own &# billion deal to purchase car radio maker harman international industries despite harmans objections the two sides agreed yesterday to a settlement in which kkr and goldman will invest &# million into the company "people can plead that im not a bad actor i havent broken my word if everyone else is doing it " says lisa bernstein a legal scholar at the university of chicago who has studied the role of reputation among tight communities such as cotton and diamond traders "its going to give quite a bit of cover " ms bernstein has found that reputation enforced business networks work best among tight knit groups once these networks expand business people are forced to rely on formal legal contracts the irony is that these contracts hundreds of pages thick are often no more effective than simple informal agreements based essentially on reputation thats reflected in the larger structural changes on wall street in it was j p morgan himself who helped calm a dangerous credit crisis putting his good name behind a rescue plan today j p morgan chase &amp co is an immense and largely faceless institution of people full of committees and project teams its reputation is harder to pin down because its difficult to assign responsibility in the first place its also easier to engage in reputation damaging behavior if there are few competitors looking to take away business by all indications it would be very hard for both corporations and private equity firms to lock out j p morgan and bank of america because they balked at funding the &# billion acquisition of student lender sallie mae the two banks simply have too much sway in the market still one can see how the private equity community is trying to threaten the banks back into reputation defense mode that became clear in yesterdays announced &# billion buyout of industrial firm goodman global by buyout shop hellman &amp friedman the deal was backed almost entirely by hedge funds cutting out the big wall street firms players in the markets say that these arrangements which leave out the middleman are getting increasing attention from buyout shops and what becomes of j c flowers &amp co the private equity firm that is leading the deal for slm corp or sallie mae and is now embroiled in litigation in a delaware court deal makers suggested that it might be slightly more difficult for flowers to seal its next transaction a targets board of directors for instance may want tighter contractual protections given that flowers tried to kill its promised sallie mae deal fund investors might also hesitate to ante up for the next flowers fund some of them are already preparing to withhold checks should flowers call on them to help pay a &# million breakup free to sallie mae said one investor in the deal given sallie maes changed business prospects "our reputations would be hurt if we did not try to renegotiate " said flowers operating partner ed grebow indeed none of this has yet stopped flowers latest pursuit which is a multibillion takeover of struggling british mortgage lender northern rock j p morgan is prepared to back that transaction too "theres too much tumult " says simpson thacher &amp bartlett partner john finley speaking generally about the market "its not as if only one firm has had problems with a deal its a little like crossing the street in a crowd " which is to say that
