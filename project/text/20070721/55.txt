an effort to appeal to the over crowd many jeans makers are trimming back the intimidating array of basic jeans choices that overwhelm some men theyre taking edgy and fashion forward shapes out of what they call their core lines to make it easier for older men to find comfortable jeans that dont make them look like theyre trying to dress like a teenager lee jeans for instance now has six basic fits including regular and relaxed down from eight a few years ago banana republic dropped its baggy so called utility fit reducing its core options to three and premium label paper denim &amp cloth

to improve overall sales which fell to &# billion in the months ended in may according to npd group the push for baby boomers has taken hold as sales of jeans to the over crowd are increasing while sales to younger men are falling jeans sales to men between and were up in the same month period while sales to men between aged to fell basic jeans options dont change throughout the year so many stores such as the gap keep them grouped together away from more seasonal ranges but that doesnt mean buying a new pair of jeans is easy while the range of basic fits is being reduced many companies are still courting younger guys with a proliferation of seasonal choices particularly variations on the popular skinny jean to add to the confusion after choosing a fit or shape shoppers still have to decide what kind of denim they like anything from stonewashed to sandblasted and the overall style of jean which could include where the pants sit on the waist some companies are still adding more choices levis red tab collection alone has fits including two a super skinny silhouette called the and a relaxed fit with a slim tailored bottom called the that were added in the last year wranglers mass market line now has fits up from nine last year and four five years ago all the choices overwhelm shoppers like jerry dallessio who assumed it would be easy to buy a pair of jeans last minute before heading out on vacation but when he arrived at a department store in paramus n j he was confronted with so many choices that he panicked "its like an explosion " he says rather than peruse all of the options the year old went to the core range and chose a regular fit that he had been buying for years to help men navigate the choices better several stores and jeansmakers are using hang tags and store displays to better explain the different styles paper denim &amp cloth whose hang tags used to focus on aesthetics like style and wash now uses the tags to describe its fits "we felt like design wise the old tags were hip but it really wasnt helpful to the consumer " says kim tuber vice president of sales earlier this year lucky brand installed signs in its stores that describe the fit rise and the width of its jeans leg openings in inches rather than just showing pictures of them the proliferation of mens jean fits washes and styles followed a similar pattern in the womens market

on by reports that some fashion forward young men had begun buying some of the new womens styles says james sullivan author of the book "jeans a cultural history of an american icon " men who want to freshen up the jeans in their closet without going overboard should reach for a basic "straight fit" jean in keeping with a broader trend in dressy as well as casual menswear toward more fitted clothing straight fit jeans are an emerging core category between trendy super skinny jeans and regular fit jeans straight fit jeans are closer to the body than regular fit and relaxed fit jeans but not as close as skinny jeans "its a more polished fit " says image consultant anna soo wildermuth the straight fit tends to come with a straight leg that falls right on the shoe rather than covering it in line with the more cleaned up look "it almost has the look of a slim khaki " she says darker washes meaning dark blue jeans are currently in style after a few seasons of bleached antiqued stonewashed and faded looks dark blue jeans also look dressier than lighter jeans and are easier to pair with a sport coat and dress shoes for the office or a night out style consultants say "i very rarely recommend that men wear light wash jeans for business casual or to the office because to me a light wash jean is a ballpark jean " says wardrobe consultant robin walker jeanspeak fit the shape
