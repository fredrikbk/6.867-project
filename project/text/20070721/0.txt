a man has a plan to harvest a forest in ghanaian lake volta boatmen dodge trees that tilapia seem to like dunns hardwood fortune dzemeni ghana from shore whats most striking about volta lake is not its size though it is one of the worlds largest man made reservoirs nor the wooden canoes long as tractor trailers that ply its waters carrying passengers and cargo whats most striking about volta lake is that it is full of trees in the shallows the treetops emerge from the water like the bristles of a brush the dead remnants of huge tropical forests submerged when ghana dammed the white and black volta rivers more than years ago to generate electric power for the newly independent nation the trees are a constant danger nearly people have died in boat tree collisions on volta lake "sometimes they cut the boat open " says ferryman enos agada his eyes bloodshot after a hour crossing but where mr agada sees a threat to life and livelihood wayne dunn sees sunken treasure a year old canadian who dropped out of high school to become a logger mr dunn has won approval from the ghanaian government for an audacious plan to harvest the forests of mahogany ebony and other hardwoods that are still rooted to the lake bottom feet below in some places hes betting that the timber is worth tens of millions of dollars if not more hes also discovering that cutting down dead trees underwater can be just as controversial as cutting down live ones on dry land "we believe its the largest and most valuable underwater timber concession in the world " says mr dunn who has a midcareer masters degree from the stanford graduate school of business though he didnt finish high school or attend college such investors as former canadian prime minister joe clark goldman sachs and british columbias salman partners inc have gambled &# million that he can both assuage environmental concerns and come up with the technology to pull the big hardwoods out of the water thats something that has never been done on a commercial scale according to mr dunn he stumbled on the idea in canada in while watching a television documentary about a remote controlled submarine used to cut pines in reservoirs in british columbia mr dunn is married to a ghanaian woman and he knew that the country had extensive hardwood forests he wondered whether some of those forestlands had been flooded when the akosombo dam created volta lake in mr dunn enlisted his father who has been a logger since the age of as well as former prime minister clark and another partner to form clark sustainable resource developments ltd based on vancouver island british columbia last year the company negotiated a two year pilot agreement with the ghanaian government under which it can explore the lake and a year follow up deal to harvest its choice of underwater acres the ghanaians were happy to sign partly out of a desire to reduce the number of deadly boating accidents and partly because the governments initial cut of the profit but first mr dunn had to figure out whether there actually are enough trees in the lake to make the project worthwhile to do so he hired year old nayon bilijo a former ghanaian deputy minister for lands and forestry mr bilijo sifted through forestry archives and found a tattered map that predated construction of the dam he pieced the map together on a board and the company digitized the information and superimposed the forests onto a map of volta lake showing that giant swaths of forest are now under water a blind long retired forestry official told mr bilijo that the forests were legally protected reserves right up until they along with the houses of villagers were swallowed by the rising waters last november mr bilijo took a powerboat a chain saw and a fish finder the portable sonar device that anglers use to locate schools of fish and spent several hours taking depth readings and wood samples he soon realized that he was seeing the tops of trees that in some cases were standing in feet of water lab work indicates that wood from the lake is still good despite decades in the water the company says the company claims the average tree will be worth &# to &# now the company is planning an extensive survey of the lakes tree population using more sophisticated sonar equipment it launched its first survey boat on tuesday at the same time company engineers are trying to figure out how to cut and recover trees that are waterlogged dont float and might weigh up to pounds each hardwoods can measure six feet in diameter the company hopes to patent its system which combines logging and deep sea oil drilling technologies its engineers say they plan to build specialized barges with equipment to find the trees identify the species and then use mechanical arms to reach into the water grasp each tree at top and bottom cut it and bring it to the surface the company is also wrestling with questions about whether its operations would disturb the lakes ecosystem or the livelihoods of those who live on its shores shortly after signing the agreement the company got a letter from okyeame ampadu agyei ghana director for conservation international a global environmental group raising concerns about the impact the logging might have on fish and fishermen an estimated two million people live on the lake with making a living directly from fishing though the lake is artificial tilapia and other fish now breed in the exposed tent like root systems of the hardwoods mr ampadu agyei argues "the removal of the submerged forest will pose significant risk to the biodiversity including the risk of species extinction if the unique habitat conditions that have evolved to harbor delicate and rare species over time are destroyed " he wrote the company says it is eager to ensure that both lake and locals emerge better off after the logging mr dunn has hired away a forestry expert from the nature conservancy who talks enthusiastically about a simultaneous commitment to financial social and environmental returns company executives for instance envision a wood processing plant that will create jobs for locals theyre donating money to a group that protects the lakes endangered west african manatees bulbous plant eaters that can no longer migrate to the ocean because the dam is in the way theres talk of donating life jackets to passengers on the big transport canoes and power to people who lost homes to the big hydroelectric dam but still dont have electrical service of their own "its a complex operation " says chris gordon a zoologist and research fellow at the university of ghanas volta basin research project "its not just a matter of going out with a saw and cutting them down "
