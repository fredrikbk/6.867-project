pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece his unladylike young ladies in picassos les demoiselles shattered convention anatomy of a classic les demoiselles at museum of modern art through aug pablo picasso hated discussing his art yet once he spoke frankly about "les demoiselles davignon " his greatest painting and a touchstone of th century art that is years old this summer on this occasion picasso did not address the subjects that transfix art historians the origin of cubism the supplanting of old avant gardes and the impact of non western art he cut through academic dissertations to offer one of his most heartfelt admissions about why he made art he spoke of artworks as "weapons against everything against unknown threatening spirits " and he affirmed that "les demoiselles davignon was my first exorcism painting yes absolutely " spoken years after picasso finished "les demoiselles" and while he was completing "guernica " his declaration resonates with outrage over the spanish civil war and the violence that was already beginning to rip europe apart in it shocks us into remembering what great art is really about nor was the painting easy to achieve picasso worked and reworked the nearly by foot canvas throughout the early months of into the spring and returned for a final attack in the summer the albums he filled with hundreds of sketches and the dozens of small canvases he painted while planning the big picture are the guides picasso used to mine deep into his consciousness the composition began rather prosaically as a brothel scene of two clothed men surrounded by five naked women the title an afterthought is generally believed to be a satirically coy reference to a sex district picasso even considered having one of the men hold a skull or book to load this essentially th century tableau vivant a la toulouse lautrec with blatant moralizing although he soon dropped these heavy handed props picassos practice of setting nearly every one of his ideas on paper was a tremendous gift because it offers us the chance to measure his ambitions and map the huge range of possibilities he considered as he reworked the design picasso turned the tables instead of representing a scene we might observe on stage from the comfort of a seat in the audience his painting forces us to be part of the action it creates a nearly inescapable confrontation with whoever passes before it most likely picasso borrowed this strategy from one of the great modernists edouard manet whose "olympia" not only displays a prostitutes naked body but turns her confrontational gaze directly on the viewer as if he a man presumably were a newly arrived customer manets picture works by convincing us that we might enter the space of the painting and join olympia on her bed picasso however short circuited manets theatrical drama and in the process repudiated a convention that had defined western art since the renaissance the conceit that the illusionistic space of a painting is a continuation of the real world picasso smashed that "rule" on his way to creating an even more compelling relationship between art and audience by dumping the men and their clunky props he had brought us up to the picture then he pushed his savage sensual whores into our faces drawing on another revered master paul cezanne picasso tightened his composition from an expansive horizontal scene into a nearly square block of compacted forms so densely packed that we cannot imagine entering the space the women are thrust forward to the edge dividing our world from their pictorial perch if that wasnt enough there are the women themselves ranging from pleasingly pliable in the center of the picture to brutally angular on the right most obviously there are the contorted masks whose garish colors contrast with the intense but less harsh pinks and blues of the majority of the painting although he sometimes tried to throw researchers off the track by denying he had seen african art before he painted "les demoiselles " picasso undoubtedly based these masks on african and oceanic art he studied in the parisian museum of ethnology during the summer of these encounters with art outside the western tradition inspired picasso to believe that art could plumb emotional depths beyond the range of most european art and sparked his final transformation of the painting his encounters also return us to the idea of art as "exorcism " when picasso spoke about art being a weapon he was specifically describing african "fetishes " he called them defensive weapons "theyre tools if we give spirits a form we become independent " in this sense the splintered spaces and awesome creatures of "les demoiselles" vividly embody looming malevolent and seductive forces and stop them in their tracks picassos painting pushes us to the edge of primal confrontation it projects human savagery only to trap it in the painted crust picassos collaborator in cubism george braque along with andre derain and most of the other artists who saw the painting in picassos studio were appalled he lent it to only one exhibition in and he refused to sell it until when a leading art collector and couturier jacques doucet offered him a relatively modest sum francs and an enticing commitment to will the painting to the louvre the deal wouldnt have happened without andre breton who was not only the founder of surrealism but doucets art adviser breton claimed "les demoiselles" as the great forerunner of surrealisms fascination with the unconscious and he helped attract the succession of artists from gorky de kooning and pollock to lichtenstein and johns among many others who measured their achievements against it doucet failed to offer the painting to the louvre and a few years after his death the year old museum of modern art acquired not only a masterpiece but international stature as the leading museum of contemporary art when it purchased the painting in since that date "les demoiselles" has been almost continuously on public view a current exhibition at the museum of modern art "picassos demoiselles davignon at " is up through aug and displays the painting with related works yet only in the past few years have we had the chance to see it almost as it looked when it left picassos studio in in moma undertook a full scale conservation effort and stripped the picture of layers of varnish that someone other than picasso had applied for generations the varnish masked the physical texture and mass of picassos brushwork under an anodyne sheen now we see the painting the way picasso left it a raw intensely fractured skin of ideas mr fitzgerald a professor of art history at trinity college organized the traveling exhibition "picasso and american art "
