the drink for bill clinton the pina colada in mr clinton was gearing up his campaign to become attorney general of arkansas one evening he and his wife hillary went to the house of her brother hugh rodham for dinner and talk of political strategy mr rodham "made us pina coladas that tasted like fruit juice but packed quite a punch " mr clinton recalled in his autobiography "my life " how much of a punch "after two or three i was so sleepy that i went outside and climbed into the back of my chevy el camino pickup truck " it was just the place "the back was covered in astroturf so i slept like a lamb " the pina colada has long had its detractors bruce feirstein in his philippic against the emasculation of america "real men dont eat quiche " took a dim view of the drink "where would the world be today if john wayne had saddled up to the bar in dodge city and said give me a stiff pina colada " there is also something comically lurid about the concoction the martini you can be sure never stooped to lend its bouquet to the makers of massage oils in last years excellent book "and a bottle of rum a history of the new world in ten cocktails " wayne curtis includes a recipe for the pina colada but he prefaces it with a grudging "if you must " his complaint about the drink is that it is little more than a sugary goop for masking the taste of third rate booze "pineapple and coconut are the linebackers of the taste world and can flatten the harshest of rums " for all the brickbats there is no denying that the pina colada is popular and popular because it tastes good typical is a friend i asked to come by to help sample various pina colada recipes for this column he responded "sure i love pina coladas " and then after a seconds hesitation "just dont tell anybody " the standard creation myth for the pina colada credits a bartender at the caribe hilton in san juan puerto rico with inventing the drink in and though that may indeed be where the drink came into its modern form pineapple juice cream of coconut rum and ice the pina colada had a long evolution from its true origins in havana "traveler ecstatic over cuban drink " raved a headline in the aug hartford courant "made of pineapple juice fluid is caressing to the esophagus " the drink in question was the pina fria colada which translates as "cold strained pineapple juice " an article in travel magazine that same year said the pina fria coladas of havana were made with pineapple juice lime sugar ice and rum but the drink the hartford courant describes was made with pineapple sugar ice and a little water a temperance refreshment "which might be copied in the united states where soft drinks are now legion " by the s the pina colada had indeed established itself as an american soft drink and more closely resembled the alcoholic drink that would surge in the s a reporter from the amarillo globe news visited new york in and wrote a brief travelogue of the densely packed "wonder city" for the folks back home "even the soft drink stands are crowded " he marveled "these juice joints offer papaya extract of a tropical fruit and pina colada a combination of pineapple and coconut milk " this is the sort of drink the hard charging bebop tenor saxophonist charlie ventura would have had in mind when he christened a tune "pina colada" in the recording features a brilliant bit of be yo ba dee bop gibberish scat sung in octaves a latin esque counterpoint to woody hermans bebop hit "lemon drop " with such a fine hymn to the hipster pleasures of the drink in place its a pity that years later the insipid rupert holmes ditty "escape" would shoulder its way into the popular consciousness as the "pina colada song " mr holmes does not have a pop music monopoly on references to the drink however "i saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at trader vics " warren zevon once famously sang "his hair was perfect " actually if a werewolf had been at trader vics chances are he would have been enjoying the house version of the drink a bahia or one of victor bergerons variations on the original cuban pina colada theme according to ted sauciers "bottoms up" a cocktail book almost as well known for its recipes as for its naughty "illustrations by eleven of americas most distinguished artists" trader vics in oakland was serving the pino pepe a cocktail nearly identical to the havana pina colada described in travel magazine years before i find the pino pepe to be a refreshing alternative to the standard pina colada instead of further sweetening the already quite sugary pineapple juice with even more sugary cream of coconut the pino pepe adds fresh lime juice and a small amount of maraschino liqueur but most people who like pina coladas are attracted by the very creaminess and suntan oil scent absent in the pino pepe that particular lush consistency is a function of the cream of coconut a gelatinous paste of smushed coconut meat and sugar developed by the coco lopez brand in puerto rico the pina colada may have had a following and even a brief vogue when it was made in wartime new york with pineapple juice and thin coconut milk but the drink came into its own when the coconut milk made way in the s for a newly available ingredient canned cream of coconut do be careful when enjoying this tropical treat one would hate to end up sleeping off one too many pina coladas in the
