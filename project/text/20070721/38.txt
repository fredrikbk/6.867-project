pursuits books electrical storm with demand skyrocketing wires fraying and political resolve flickering how long will the lights stay on the grid by phillip f schewe joseph henry press pages &# lights out by jason makansi wiley pages &# with summer heat blazing over much of the u s and millions of air conditioners set on high the country is having its annual flirtation with a massive brownout or blackout a major power failure of course would inspire much public hand wringing over the electricity supply but then most folks would go back to ignoring the subject until the next time the lights go out even without a dramatic accident however electricity is at the center of every discussion about a carbon tax renewable energy or the energy producers interest in building nuclear reactors there is much at stake as phillip schewe writes in "the grid " the nations electric infrastructure is "the most complex machine ever made " tying together hydroelectric dams and megawatt coal plants wending its way across thousands of miles of transmission lines carrying electricity at hundreds of thousands of volts through substations that step it up and down until it is finally brought across the last mile into your home at a tame volts the electrical grid is an astonishing balancing act that must match supply and demand minute by minute hour by hour year by year as jason makansi the author of "lights out " puts it "very few people on this planet truly appreciate how difficult it is to control the flow of electricity " of course it doesnt always work when a couple of trees brush against a transmission wire in ohio for instance most of the east coast may go dark as it did in the summer of experts agree that the long distance transmission system has been stretched to the breaking point mr makansi asks "how did a first world country end up with a third world grid " there is no one answer however nor is there a consensus on how to go about solving the problem mr schewe who has a doctorate in particle physics and serves as chief science writer at the american institute of physics seems like the ideal man to tackle the subject he gives us a lively history of the grid including an account of thomas edisons building of the pearl street station in new york city opened in it was the countrys first centralized electrical power generator mr schewe recounts nikola teslas invention of alternating current ac which allowed electrical transmission to travel more efficiently and over longer distances than the direct current dc power favored by edison tesla and edison became bitter opponents over the issue we also learn about samuel insulls strenuous efforts to electrify chicago sending pushcarts through the streets to give away electric irons and pump up demand mr schewe recounts david lilienthals efforts at the tennessee valley authority a massive government subsidized plan to bring electricity to the rural south in the s along with more recent urban tales such as con edisons struggles to deal with an increasingly obstreperous new york city customer base which doesnt want anyone to build power plants but goes on consuming more electricity anyway the grid" is enlightening but somewhere along the line mr schewe became enthralled with the literature doubting progress henry david thoreau henry adams and lewis mumford are his mentors each is cited bemoaning the corrupting effects of speed and technology and lamenting the loss of simpler relations between man and nature thus for every step forward in turbine technology mr schewe asks "is it all worth it " as he summarizes "the grid lights our homes preserves food brings us cheap aluminum it also brings us pollution overhead wires clockwork tedium and a massive contribution toward greenhouse warming and climate change " he confesses to feeling a "cheerful ambivalence toward all things electric " in the end mr schewe never really resolves the matter on nuclear power he simply informs us that some scientists are for it while environmentalists are almost uniformly against it a nuclear reactor cant blow up he notes but then it does contain a lot of fissionable material "take the capability of a era uranium bomb multiply it by and thats whats being loaded into indian point unit right now " he concludes the reader is left to draw the dire implications of a meltdown or terrorist attack mr makansi an industry consultant and founder of the newsletter common sense on energy and our environment is a chemical engineer by training at one point he admits to never really understanding the difference between direct and alternating current but he knows the industry backward and forward once he hits his stride he is informative and even a bit alarming try this the sites most vulnerable to attack on the grid are not nuclear reactors their foot thick concrete containment structures can withstand the impact of a jetliner while sustaining little more than a dent the real vulnerability says mr makansi is the handful of substations around the country where the northeast western canadian and texas grids interlink these isolated facilities whose locations remain undisclosed for obvious reasons are protected by little more than barbed wire taking them out which might be done with a few well placed bombs could shut down the entire country mr makansi identifies the aging and neglected long distance transmission lines as the grids achilles heel much of the jury rigged system has not been upgraded since the black and white television era even as it struggles to accommodate the growing demands of air conditioning and the information economy yet mr makansi doesnt quite diagnose the problem correctly like many engineers he is nostalgic for the days of regulated monopoly when the utilities built what the state approved at a guaranteed profit the s deregulation he charges is at fault but it is precisely because transmission lines are still not privatized serving instead as "common carriers" that this tragedy of the commons is occurring another impediment to upgrading the system the alarm over transmission lines supposedly causing cancer the claim has been convincingly refuted many times but protests have still succeeded in stalling construction in many places for more than a decade among utility executives there is now a saying its harder to build transmission lines than it is to site power plants but on other subjects mr makansi is insightful he tells of "thermotunnelling " which one day may turn the waste heat of power plants into electricity although not in the near future he demonstrates why backyard windmills and home fuel cells will not render utilities obsolete "the vast majority of customers dont want to bother with windmills and other forms of distributed power " he writes "they want electricity they dont have to think about " mr makansi also has a straightforward proposal for reducing carbon emissions reverse the current mix of coal powered and nuclear powered electricity generation in the u s right now of the countrys electricity comes from burning coal from nuclear power flipping those numbers would dramatically reduce carbon output and ought to delight global warming alarmists the only problem mr makansi says "is that many of the same social and political leaders who love the idea of solving global warming now happen to hate the only viable immediate and ready to roll solution available nuclear power " the conflict between edisons dc and teslas ac was eventually resolved by letting the best technology win politics did not prevail these books help to show that if politics is allowed to determine the outcome of todays electrical debates we may all be left short circuited mr tuckers "terrestrial energy rethinking nuclear power in the era of global warming" will be published next year by farrar straus &amp giroux
