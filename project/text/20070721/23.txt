from the web to court a real estate broker battles lennar stuart fla a dispute between a local real estate broker and one of the nations largest home builders has mushroomed into a legal battle reaching all the way to wall street at the heart of the fight is a web site started by mike morgan the real estate broker to collect complaints and dispense advice about what he considers shoddy workmanship on homes built by miami based lennar corp "people tell me i am the ralph nader of the housing industry " mr morgan said in an interview lennar sees it differently the company has filed two lawsuits against mr morgan in circuit court in martin county fla and in federal court in floridas southern district charging trademark infringement and defamation by spreading false information about the quality of its construction lennar says many of mr morgans complaints about its workmanship are false and that according to its federal complaint he was using his web site to extort money from the company the builder says mr morgan launched the site after lennar wouldnt pay him as much as &# in co commissions on homes that he sold but were later canceled previously companies might have felt free to ignore campaigns like these but theyre increasingly taking them more seriously as the internet makes it easier for campaigns to spread nationally still rarely do they spark such broad counterattacks from their targets "as a company with a year history of exemplary customer service and integrity we are left with no choice but to vigorously defend our company against those who attack our name and reputation with unfounded allegations " lennars chief executive stuart miller said in a statement on friday mr morgan was dealt a setback when a federal magistrate judge recommended a preliminary injunction preventing him among other things from using the word "lennar" in web site domain names the magistrate wrote that while the web site presents itself "for the sole purpose of advancing the public good it actually appears" that mr morgan sought to use the site for "private gain " the magistrate added that mr morgan "has a motive to harm lennar" because of the real estate dispute mr morgan says he is exercising his first amendment right to free speech in trying to help lennar customers mr morgan years old isnt a typical real estate broker in recent years he moonlighted as a consultant to hedge funds and wall street analysts seeking information about the important florida housing market he also runs a small internet marketing company and has used his internet savvy to attract hits to his web site from lennar home buyers across the country its not uncommon for homeowners to gripe about builders even in the best of times but this legal battle comes as u s builders face mounting lawsuits and complaints from buyers wanting out of their contracts due to the softening real estate market in recent years mr morgan had gained some measure of influence for his opinions on the florida housing market alex barron a former housing analyst at jmp securities in san francisco said in an interview that mr morgan led him and some of his hedge fund and mutual fund clients on an informational tour of florida real estate projects mr barron described himself as previously one of the "most bullish analysts on the street " but said mr morgan "was instrumental in changing my views " mr morgan says the legal battle has hurt this kind of consulting work in april ivy zelman formerly of credit suisse and a prominent housing stocks analyst on wall street stopped communicating with mr morgan about the florida market saying in a deposition in one of the lennar lawsuits that she had decided mr morgan was "using me as a pawn in his bigger scheme of whatever he was attempting to do " mr morgan says lennar pressured ms zelman to halt their discussions lennar denies that allegation the company "never pressured ivy zelman to terminate any relationship with mike morgan " says mark sustana lennars general counsel ms zelman and credit suisse declined to comment mr morgan moved to florida and became a real estate agent in hed worked previously in marketing at a group of resort hotels in pennsylvanias pocono mountains but left in a dispute after he added hours to the timecard of a mailroom employee who needed money mr morgan said in his deposition in an interview mr morgan said it was an unusual situation the workers normal hours had been cut and she needed the income so the employee agreed to make up the hours later mr morgan moved to stuart a quiet town north of palm beach obtained a real estate license and started selling homes about of his clients had signed up to purchase lennar homes in when the housing market was strong and prices were surging mr morgan himself bought a lennar home there but in the spring of the market was cooling and buyers started looking for ways to break their contracts lennar says mr morgan says his clients never asked him to help break their contracts nonetheless he says he felt obligated to raise with the builder and local officials omissions in the builders disclosures to buyers for instance lennar didnt disclose that a nature preserve next to some properties would allow limited public access mr sustana the lawyer for lennar says the company felt its contracts were entirely fair nevertheless lennar made an unusual gesture in june it offered to return deposits to all buyers with interest and rescind their contracts in total buyers accepted the offer canceling about &# million in sales according to mr sustana lennar didnt want to get into a fight with its customers "we would rather give them their money back " at the time the average selling price of those homes was &# since then lennar has closed a total of homes in the development with an average selling price of &# with his buyers released from their contracts mr morgan told lennar it still owed him commissions on the canceled homes arguing that lennars omissions from the contracts were the reason the deals fell apart lennar said it wasnt contractually obligated to pay him commissions in june mr morgan emailed lennar executives and unveiled a web site he created to highlight alleged construction defects in lennar homes in a june email contained in the circuit court file mr morgan wrote "seeing as though lennar has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue i have chosen to make a living on the other side of this through my website in marketing of the defect and code issues to potential buyers and current buyers " mr morgans site defective homes net encourages homeowners to write to lennars executives national and local news reporters and the companys board members with their complaints the lawsuit in the circuit court is entering its second year on may mr morgan wrote a letter to the judge larry schack stating that "i will not be filing any more documents nor will i be appearing for any hearings or court dates absent a subpoena ive had it " last month mr morgan filed a motion requesting judge schack recuse himself saying hes biased in favor of lennar and has "lost control of this case " the judge who declined to comment for this article denied mr morgans motion which he called "legally insufficient " in a case management order last month judge schack wrote that during his years on the bench "one could count on the fingers of a careless butcher the number of cases that have required this level of court monitoring and involvement " in an email to a wall street journal reporter last month mr morgan said he hopes the ultimate result of the fight will be that lennar addresses his criticisms "once that is done " mr morgan wrote its "on to the next builder "
