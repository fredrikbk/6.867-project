hot topic why the skies have gotten crowded data this past week validated what many fliers already suspected the number of delays and cancellations in june may have been the worst ever according to flightstats com flights were canceled in the u s more then double the number grounded in june among the largest u s air carriers more than of flights scheduled to land in the u s arrived late between january and may of this year about of flights arrived on time the lowest percentage since the bureau of transportation statistics started keeping this measure in earlier this year several airlines came under fire for forcing passengers to stay on planes for long stretches as carriers didnt want to jeopardize their slots in the takeoff queues by allowing patrons to disembark congress is now considering a "passenger bill of rights" and senators have introduced a bill mandating that fliers are let off parked planes after three hours and given food water and access to bathrooms while they are on the plane meanwhile the air transport association which represents airlines is pushing for a major upgrade of the u s air traffic control system to move more planes out of airports efficiently the plans would cost the federal government &# billion to &# billion and airlines about &# billion according to the ata for now delays and cancellations remain a harrowing part of the air travel experience heres a closer look why is this year so bad bad weather or any glitch strains an already stressed system many airports are using most of their takeoff and landing spots especially at peak times midday and airlines are flying more planes closer to full capacity load factors the percentage of seats filled on a flight reached last year the highest level since deregulation in many expect load factors to reach this summer the forty largest airlines flew more flights this june compared with last year according to flightstats given such load levels when bad weather labor problems or another issue cause flight cancellations or delays fewer later time slots are available for takeoffs and landings more people need to be rebooked and fewer seats on later flights are open why do airlines need to pack people in intense price competition started in the u s airline industry after congressionally mandated deregulation opened up competition among national carriers in before then the civil aeronautic board regulated all fares routes plane sizes and schedules so most airlines didnt compete head on for customers deregulation brought new airlines to the market and direct competition among airlines for routes driving down airfares the average price a passenger pays per mile on a domestic flight in the u s dropped between and when adjusted for inflation according to the air transport association since more than airlines companies have filed for bankruptcy about of those companies emerged from bankruptcy proceedings according to darin lee an economist at lecg llc who studies the airline industry in the early s some airlines begin to focus on grounding unprofitable flights flying more international flights which have higher margins and flying full planes at all costs the low prices have kept demand strong meaning packed flights is deregulation to blame some observers say yes others no deregulation opened up airlines to pricing pressure forcing them to squeeze operating costs to remain profitable while keeping prices low critics of deregulation say it created flying chaos by forcing airlines to squeeze every part of their operation to stay competitive and created bottlenecks at key airports that act as transfer points to long haul destinations they argue that more regulations such as a passenger bill of rights or more rules about who can fly where when would lift customer service standards and make it easier for airlines to stay in business but deregulations supporters say the problem is that some regulation still exists the federal government and banks have been willing to bail out unprofitable airlines keeping prices unnaturally low because there is still excess capacity they say "the worst thing that could happen in the world " for the airline industry "is if the government started regulated performance standards or conferring routes based on performance " meara mclaughlin vice president of development and marketing at flightstats says one fear is that such regulations would make it harder for airlines to get planes off the ground quickly while putting more pressure on carriers to do so creating a possible safety risk any signs customers will stop flying price seems to be the no factor determining passenger demand while some passengers seek to avoid hassles by flying only in the morning or on saturdays demand remains strong overall traffic declined after the sept attacks giving fliers a reprieve from mounting delays and cancellations but passenger traffic has been steadily rising for several years u s airlines carried million domestic passengers in april more than they did in april the largest year to year increase since september according to the u s department of transportations bureau of transportation statistics "we are surprised people arent complaining more " says john hansman a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at mit the department of transportation keeps a record of all customer complaints it receives about flight problems such as cancellations delays or flight deviations in recent years unhappy customers registered the most complaints in from january to may this year the dot has received flight problem complaints points of view crowding reflects the success of deregulation not its failure competition in the unregulated market has proved to the satisfaction of the carriers that most travelers are willing to sacrifice comfort for lower fares " alfred kahn the last chairman of the civil aeronautics board before deregulation "a great management in that business will not necessarily get a great result " warren buffett commenting on the airline industry at berkshire hathaways annual meeting facts airlines ranked below the irs in the university of michigans most recent survey of american customer satisfaction in turbine powered planes such as corporate jets numbered by that tally jumped to the faa predicts additional corporate jets will begin flying in the next years chicagos ohare airport had the lowest on time departure ranking from january to may of this year and last according to dot bureau of transportation statistics airlines receive federal subsidies of as much as &# a ticket to maintain service to about remote u s cities
