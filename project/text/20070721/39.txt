pursuits books five best these works indelibly portray the lives of artists says biographer meryle secrest  william morris by fiona maccarthy knopf artist poet lecturer businessman politician social reformer and environmentalist no single description could encompass william morris who dominated the art world in the victorian age it is difficult nowadays to imagine why morriss furious nostalgia for the medieval should have seemed so revolutionary but he was appalled by the flood of cheap ugly manufactured goods that followed the industrial revolution in britain and he campaigned to restore traditional crafts that had been a source of pride for generations the poet and mystic in him revered the beautiful the humanist worked selflessly for workers rights in fiona maccarthys wonderful book

savage messiah by h s ede literary guild this portrait of french sculptor henri gaudier brzeska begins in when he became infatuated with sophie brzeska a year old pole who had come to paris determined to kill herself she dropped that idea after meeting the year old artist from this maternal figure gaudier took not only a new last name but also a priceless confidence in his talent he and sophie soon moved to london where gaudier brzeskas sculpting increasingly took on an abstract quality that reflected his interest in primitive cultures and not incidentally helped pioneer modern art in britain in he was a signatory along with ezra pound wyndham lewis and others of the vorticist manifesto embracing the dynamism of modern life with the outbreak of world war i gaudier brzeska joined the french army he was killed in the trenches in june at age after sophie died a decade later in a mental asylum british art collector h s ede acquired much of the estate and went on to produce this fascinating account of a gifted artists tragically short life  augustus john by michael holroyd holt rinehart &amp winston michael holroyd a biographers biographer is particularly attuned to the problem of writing about the lives of artists they tend to "translate all their energies into their work " he writes leaving behind precious few clues about what they thought and felt then again some artists save a bit of energy as did augustus john for living the sort of life outside bourgeois morality that is often expected of them john was to be sure notoriously absent minded about money and careless about women the result was that over time the british painter as holroyd puts it was "simplified into a myth " holroyds accounting of johns life a subject he revisited in with "augustus john the new biography" reflects the authors relentless dedication to undoing this simplification with meticulous attention to the facts holroyd gives us an augustus john who spent much of his long career trying to come to terms with the rapturous reception and corresponding expectations that greeted his work as a young man the messy personal affairs are all here to be sure but so is johnss brilliant troubled life as an artist presented by holroyd with sublime intelligence  edward hopper by gail levin knopf there is something about the work of edward hopper that uncannily evokes a decade look at "nighthawks " his famous painting of a deserted street lit at night by a cafe its inhabitants frozen on their bar stools once again it is the early s it took years for hopper to refine his signature style which infused seemingly innocent images whether of small towns or of the cape cod landscapes he loved so much with an inner intensity who he was how he painted and why these matters are exhaustively explored by gail levin who has written widely about hopper and based her authoritative account of his life on the diary of his wife jo levins analyses of hoppers work are astute and telling but ultimately any study of such an introspective personality can take us only so far in the end we have to return to the evidence of the work itself and to its reflection of a universal truth that hopper understood that is the essential loneliness of the human spirit ms secrest who has written biographies of frank lloyd wright richard rodgers and salvador dali among others is the author of "shoot the widow adventures of a biographer in search of her subject" knopf
