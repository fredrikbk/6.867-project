u s banking regulators agree on basel ii capital standards washington federal bank and thrift regulators agreed friday on new capital standards for the countrys largest financial institutions the agreement attempts to more closely balance the amount of capital banks must hold to protect against losses with the risks in their business lines and it makes u s bank capital rules more consistent with capital standards in europe and asia the standards commonly referred to as basel ii will let banks use complex mathematical formulas and advanced risk management tools to determine the cushion they need to protect themselves from shocks in the financial markets the agreement included significant changes from a proposal last year in part because of disagreements among the regulators and loud complaints from large banks such as citigroup inc and j p morgan chase &amp co "we heard the comments loud and clear that we had deviated too far from the international standards " comptroller of the currency john dugan said among other things regulators agreed to scrap a proposed requirement that would have mandated that government officials revisit the entire basel ii process if capital levels across the top u s banks fell by more than after instead regulators agreed to conduct a study in analyzing basel iis impact on banks and the findings could lead regulators to retain a floor preventing capital levels from dropping more than at any bank mr dugan said there was no "magic number" that could lead regulators to determine basel ii needed to be adjusted critics argue that basel ii might allow bank capital levels to fall precipitously potentially putting large u s banks at risk regulators also agreed to allow financial institutions that arent required to adopt basel ii to use a more simplified version of the standard the final agreement is expected to be published in september starting in january u s banks including wells fargo &amp co wachovia corp bank of america corp and washington mutual inc will be required to use the new rules
