pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings in a performers shoes capturing the experience of what happens on stage and off new york to the layman the act of public performance is a profound mystery a carefully finished product that conceals far more than it reveals all you see usually is what youre meant to see the backstage frenzy is kept out of sight and so for the most part is the onstage experience how do you get to carnegie hall or the stage of a broadway theater and what does it feel like to step out of the wings and make art in front of a crowd having been both a professional musician and an amateur actor im struck by the fact that movies about artists convey so little of the elusive essence of the performers life "all about eve" is great fun but it tells you roughly as much about being an actor or a critic as "the big sleep" tells you about being a detective as for music the only film i know that even begins to suggest what it feels like to play jazz for money is steve klovess "the fabulous baker boys " which portrays with jolting precision the grubby exhausting life of the commercial musician except that i never ran into any singers who looked like michelle pfeiffer even so you wont find anything in "the fabulous baker boys" half so revealing as a casual comment that the jazz pianist dick wellstood once made to the jazz critic whitney balliett "audiences are rarely on the same wavelength as performers if audiences knew what humdrum daylight things most musicians think when they play theyd probably never come " the best books about the performers art are the ones that tell you things like that "winter season a dancers journal " toni bentleys memoir of her years with the new york city ballet is full of deceptively ordinary revelations that give you a close up view of the everyday life of a working artist have you ever wondered for example how those glamorous looking ballerinas stay so slender "winter season" has the inside skinny "i dont think that there is any dancer " ms bentley confesses "who does not harbor this dream of the future to eat three meals a day french toast with butter and syrup ice cream sodas and three course dinners with wine and not to have to grab a yogurt or coleslaw in a half hour break for dinner " no less revealing is "arguments with england " the autobiography of michael blakemore who was a hard working actor long before he became famous as the director of such plays as "a day in the death of joe egg " "noises off " "democracy" and most recently "deuce " time and again mr blakemore turns up the backstage lights and takes you by surprise "there are bad actors but very few lazy ones the prospect of exposure and possible humiliation on a public stage ensures that actors try they have little choice but to do their best and particularly at the early stages of rehearsal are as vulnerable as chicks pecking out of their shells " one of the most valuable things about "arguments with england" is mr blakemores oft repeated reminder that for the professional performer the making of art is first of all a way of making a living of course its far more than that or ought to be but no matter how personally fulfilling it may be art is also a job yet the most instructive book ive read in recent months about the act of performance is by an author who like me is a recovering musician glenn kurtz studied classical guitar at the new england conservatory of music then changed course and became a writer now hes published an absorbing book called "practicing a musicians return to music" knopf pages &# in which he writes with uncanny sensitivity about his brief career as a professional performer perhaps because he voluntarily gave up that life mr kurtz is especially good about the hard labor that goes into professional music making he quotes a remark by the great harpsichordist wanda landowska "if everyone knew how to work everyone would be a genius " probably not but theres no such thing as a genius who doesnt know how mr kurtz nails it "every artist must sometimes believe that art is the doorway to the divine perhaps it is but its dangerous for a musician to philosophize instead of practicing when i hold the guitar i may aspire to play perfect harmonies but first i have to play well " remember those words the next time you read a racy gossip column item about the misadventures of some actor or musician who got caught with his pants at half mast even the most privately reckless of performers spend good sized chunks of their lives banging their heads against the near impenetrable wall of art "im extremely humble about whatever gifts i may have but i am not modest about the work i do " the famously flamboyant leonard bernstein once told an interviewer "i work extremely hard and all the time " so he did yet we were the ones who profited most from bernsteins daily struggle to achieve the impossible mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings"
