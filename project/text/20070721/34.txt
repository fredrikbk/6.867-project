logging on tech sales surge but low pricing cuts into profits buyers spending spree helps propel stocks despite mixed earnings technology demand is showing an unexpected surge driven by rapidly falling prices for components such as computer chips and disk drives business spending and a rush by people around the world to get on the internet strong sales of computers and related products reflected in earnings reports from large tech companies this week came as a surprise in a quarter that is typically among the weakest "weve never seen the volumes go up in the second quarter like they have this year " said dean mccarron an analyst at mercury research who tracks the chip market "a lot of people myself included have egg on their faces for their forecasts " the news isnt all good for technology suppliers though fierce competition that is driving down prices for such key components as microprocessors and data storage chips has squeezed many suppliers profit margins especially those of hardware makers but suppliers revenues are at least getting support as attractive component prices drive new demand for products such as cellphones music players and other devices especially in emerging economies at the same time people around the world have never had more reason to buy the products and services needed to be active on the internet besides gathering information and shopping web access has become essential for new networks that people use to socialize and for such entertainment purposes as playing music and videos bill watkins chief executive officer of seagate technology the biggest maker of disk drives says the rush to the internet and the demand for products such as personal computers ipods and digital video recorders has for the first time pushed the total capacity of disk drives in homes beyond that of businesses "consumers are just gobbling it up " he says pricing issues have been a cloud over tech stocks for some time but many investors appear to be betting that prices and profit margins have bottomed though driving up share prices in recent sessions some apparently moved to take profits on friday after google inc and caterpillar inc failed to meet quarterly earnings expectations the dow jones industrial average fell to a day after closing above for the first time while the tech heavy nasdaq composite index lost or points to close at while consumer spending on technology has been strong for some time businesses now also are getting into the act total information technology spending should grow at or so this year about the same as last year estimates stephen minton an analyst at market researcher idc who follows the tech economy but spending within that sector is increasingly shifting to software based development projects and related services helping companies such as international business machines corp microsoft corp oracle corp and sap ag mr minton within a couple of weeks plans to publish a revised estimate of growth in the u s software market predicting growth for this year up from his previous projection of compared with growth last year when the market reached &# billion "people were a little anxious at the start of the year and some companies put projects on hold but now those are being released " mr minton says he said services spending also is "gathering momentum from where it was months ago " buell duncan vice president of marketing for ibms software group said a lot of the growth in services and software comes from customers "trying to connect disparate applications that were never meant to be connected " many companies want to let customers track orders or employees manage their own benefits which has required new software "weve outgrown the apps that we had " says geoff endris chief technology officer at capital assurance corp a closely held insurance company based in prospect ky "we are buying more sophisticated software so in that way we are spending more money on technology " customers also are increasingly focused on automating their data centers and the management of the computers they have chief information officers who have seen or more of their budgets consumed by paying their own staffers to manage and upgrade their existing systems are trying to automate the processes with software they are also trying to reduce outlays for buying and operating server systems by moving to inexpensive new models that consume less power and so called virtualization software that helps machines make greater use of their capacity in its quarterly earnings report on wednesday ibm said four of five major sectors boosted spending financial services the public sector and communications all grew by or better in the second quarter while the distribution sector grew only industrial customers spending didnt grow primarily due to auto companies woes in geographic areas ibm said the americas grew after rising just in the first quarter europe grew and asia the sharpest growth came in emerging markets which rose led by russia china and india on thursday microsoft chief financial officer chris liddell said the software giant doesnt see companies drastically increasing their total spending on technology rather he thinks microsoft is getting "a higher share of the wallet from some of our customers " he said specifically mr liddell cited strong renewals in the three months ending june of microsofts long term contracts with its largest customers those bookings were reflected in a surge of the companys deferred revenue which reached &# billion a increase from the previous quarter and slightly higher than many analysts had forecast solid economic conditions have helped the federal reserve in its semiannual report to congress this week was upbeat about the prospects for an improvement in business investment spending after a "relatively meager" gain in the first quarter "on the whole " the fed said "economic and financial conditions still appear to be favorable for capital spending corporate profits remain robust businesses have ample liquid assets at their disposal and conditions in financial markets remain supportive " toni sacconaghi an analyst with sanford c bernstein &amp co agreed that improving u s economic conditions played a role in higher technology spending in the second quarter yet downward pressure on prices means that makers of computers and data storage systems havent benefited as much as other suppliers "over multiple years hardware is a laggard and software grows faster " he said "hardware is the ugly sibling of technology " advanced micro devices inc can attest to the ugly side the chip maker a perennial minority player behind intel corp in the microprocessor chips that serve as calculating engines in computers has been suffering from an aggressive effort by intel to beat back amds recent inroads in the market amd amazed analysts by disclosing that unit chip shipments in the second quarter jumped in the second quarter from the first period driven partly by the companys gains in winning such new customers as toshiba corp and dell inc intel by contrast said its unit sales were up "slightly " but both companies reported that their average selling prices were down intels gross profit margins came in below its forecast of the result at amd compounded by costs of a recent merger was more dramatic a &# million net loss for the period ended in june the bright side customers are getting unprecedented computing power through microprocessors that cost well below &# and entire systems that cost a few hundred dollars "probably a bigger jump has happened there in the past six to nine months than has ever happened before " mr mccarron of mercury research says meanwhile a brutal war has been going on in memory chips particularly those called dynamic random access memories that act as a kind of scratch pad for frequently used data in pcs prices on popular varieties of drams dropped by in the second quarter analysts estimate micron technology inc the biggest u s supplier reported a loss of &# million for the fiscal quarter ended may but lower dram prices also are good for computer buyers the same holds true for another variety of data storage chip known as nand flash that is a key factor in the price and storage capacities of such devices as digital cameras and apple inc s popular ipod and iphone products the price drops have been at least as steep in disk drives seagate of scotts valley calif thursday reported that it sold million drives in the months ended in june up nearly from the preceding period mr watkins said the company had originally expected about growth at the same time he says rival disk drive makers eager to gain market share kept slashing prices throughout the year and seagate was forced to follow suit mr watkins estimates that if pricing had met his original assumptions for the year seagate would have made &# million more in profit "we just wiped out billions of dollars of profit in the industry " he says "people got stupid " whether suppliers can gain more control of pricing is an open question some like ibm have moved away from pcs and other commodity products subject to severe price competition intel and amd executives note that prices have held steady for some of their most advanced products mr watkins for one hopes to hold the line on prices amid strong demand in the current quarter yet he admits that if his competitors quote rock bottom prices to win big disk drive orders he may be forced to follow suit robert a guth david wessel
