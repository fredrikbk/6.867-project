hospital let us stay by our sons bedside i read with great interest your article "icus new message welcome families" page one july last year my adult son was in a very serious accident and was treated at new york citys bellevue hospital trauma unit and he subsequently was in the intensive care unit for three weeks we were allowed almost constant access to him and his room the hospital personnel and policies were very open to our presence and we felt welcome almost all the time there were life threatening injuries involved and important decisions to be made and considering that we lived almost minutes away we were loath to leave the hospital the staff only suggested that we take a break when they saw that we were too exhausted to function at those times friends relatives and clergy were allowed to stay with him the staff instructed us on how to read the monitors in the room and they allowed us to help with his basic care i can never adequately thank the hospital doctors and nursing staff who took care of our son first for saving his life and second for taking care of us while he was so gravely injured i applaud the city health and hospitals commission and the administration of bellevue for embracing this policy chava finkel englewood n j
