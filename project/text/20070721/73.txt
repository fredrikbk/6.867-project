the week ahead our take on coming events automobiles for the big three weak results may strengthen bargaining hand by joseph b white the three big detroit auto makers start reporting second quarter results during the week and for once lackluster results could be a plus thats because the detroit three are kicking off what promises to be a tough round of bargaining with the united auto workers to hammer out new master labor agreements for their money losing u s operations chryslers ritual handshake was friday general motors corp and ford motor co are scheduled to stage their opening day photo opportunities monday analysts expect ford which reports thursday to show a loss of about cents a share excluding restructuring and other items for the quarter over all reflecting continued red ink in

pretax operating loss for all of of about billion euros &# billion including restructuring charges managers at the big three want uaw president ron gettelfinger to agree to substantial new concessions on top of givebacks in retiree health benefits he negotiated in to narrow a roughly &# an hour gap between labor costs at uaw represented plants and nonunion u s factories run by japanese auto makers detroits auto makers have suffered hard times before as the economy has cycled up and down but this time is different senior executives say this isnt a cycle but instead a reordering of the industry in the u s and globally that is rendering detroits post world war ii business model obsolete among industry executives and the growing cadre of private equity investors looking to profit from restructuring the auto industry theres a consensus that without a fundamental transformation of the uaw labor and legacy cost equation one or more of the detroit giants might eventually be forced to seek bankruptcy court protection even so convincing uaw members that they should accept unprecedented rollbacks in health benefits lower compensation for new hires and other givebacks wont be easy for management longtime union members have heard forecasts of doom from the executive suite before only to see executives get bonuses when the economy rebounded or a new model became a hit the leaders of the detroit three including cerberus capital management lp which is expected to close soon its deal to buy of chrysler group from daimlerchrysler face a delicate balancing act in the coming weeks all

legacy labor cost burdens as advantageous as it will be for detroits auto makers to cry poverty in the short run they dont want to go too much longer giving investors and potential car buyers the

minimum wage economy not likely to flinch as many get raises by kris maher on tuesday about two million workers will get a raise as the first increase in the federal minimum wage since takes effect but for all the handwringing about how raising the federal minimum wage would hurt employers and boost inflation this weeks initial wage increase to &# an hour is expected to have little impact on the economy the price of a cheese pizza might rise but that could be blamed on higher dairy and gasoline prices as well as higher pay for cooks and cashiers generally though the effect on the economy will be small most states and the district of columbia already raised their minimum wage above the federal level and many big employers including retailers such as wal mart stores inc or chains such as starbucks corp frequently start workers off well above the federal minimum wage the increase will be felt more keenly in states where the federal minimum wage of &# an hour is currently in effect and in sectors that rely heavily on minimum wage workers such as restaurants hotels and retail groups such as the national restaurant association and some small businesses say job growth will slow and prices will rise a higher minimum wage combined with higher food costs "will ultimately drive higher prices within the pizza category " says a spokeswoman for dominos pizza inc who gets a fatter paycheck last year million people earned less than &# an hour according to the bureau of labor statistics that includes a sizable chunk of workers who earn tips and others exempt from the minimum wage people who earn the federal minimum wage tend to be young half were younger than and three out of four workers earning &# an hour or less last year worked in service jobs mostly in food preparation a bigger impact could be felt in states like alabama arkansas and oklahoma which had a high percentage of workers at or below &# an hour the cent an hour jump will be followed by an increase in each of the next two years bringing the minimum wage to &# in while labor unions applaud the higher wage some worker advocates are already warning that it will be difficult to enforce especially for low skilled workers including immigrants who might be afraid to alert officials that they arent being paid minimum wage paul decamp administrator of the labor departments wage and hour division says the division "has a very active enforcement program with respect to low wage industries where minimum wage violations are most likely to arise " the division retrieved &# million in minimum wage and overtime back wages for more than employees last year meanwhile some small business owners the group that is expected to be affected the most say raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do even if it hurts their bottom line helen norman co owner of a dairy queen in garnett kan will have to give six young employees a raise but she thinks the overall increase will help workers trying to raise a family "it probably will hurt some small businesses it may hurt mine too " says ms norman "but theres the other side of that story can people survive on that amount i mean i couldnt " telecom vodafone ceo ready for test by cassell bryan low vodafone group plc chief executive arun sarin is bracing for battle tuesday when he takes the stage at the companys annual meeting mr sarin faces a challenge from a group of shareholder activists though the activists ecs assets ppc own just of the cellphone giant they are making a big push to spin off vodafones stake in service provider verizon wireless among other proposals and shareholders will get the chance to vote on the strategies the fight highlights how even small activists can push for fundamental change in corporate strategy activists recently have targeted a number of other companies including food giant kraft foods inc dutch banking giant abn amro holding nv and british candy and beverage maker cadbury schweppes plc vodafone with a market value of about &# billion and operations spanning countries across europe asia africa and the u s is one of the largest companies to come under such pressure while some analysts dont expect shareholders to pass the ecs proposals ecs is forcing vodafone management to focus on the issue ecs is trying to force vodafone to change how it holds its stake in verizon wireless verizon communications inc a new york telecommunications company owns the rest ecs which stands for efficient capital structures argues that the true value of the asset currently is hidden spinning off the

trying to drum up support with vodafone investors and says he has met or spoken with about shareholders he says the reception has varied with some large institutions refusing even to meet with ecs and others offering positive feedback ecs also is proposing two resolutions to require vodafone to borrow more money to increase its leverage vodafones mr sarin has seen off investor challenges before and

been discussing the proposals with shareholders as part of regularly scheduled meetings in recent weeks mr sarin on a conference call with reporters on thursday said the company continually looks at ways to maximize value in its u s stake "we are very happy with our position in verizon wireless " mr sarin said adding that he expects it to continue showing double digit growth for "the foreseeable future " as for defeating ecs mr sarin said "the results will be known tuesday but we are feeling good "
