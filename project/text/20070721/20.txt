editorial board the un blairs london in month one of the gordon brown era british politics has taken a few surprising turns just by moving out of downing street tony blair carried with him much of the fatigue voters felt about the labour party his sidekick longtime rival and successor mr brown made good use of the opportunity showing himself to be a wily and tough operator the opposition tories and their fresh faced leader david cameron who had underestimated him watched their political honeymoon come to a jarring halt the new prime minister agendas is a familiar blair like hodgepodge the kind of post ideological politics that blurs distinctions between left and right as incumbents who have overseen one of the most enduring economic booms in british history labour doesnt have to make the case for changing course or look distinct from its opponents the tories do while sticking broadly to the status quo mr brown has been free to adjust at the edges the fresh faces in his cabinet give the impression of a new start as a sop to the labour left that was never comfortable with mr blairs activist foreign policy the new prime minister brought in opponents of the iraq war and critics of america while not changing his governments policy on the conflict he decreed that no british minister utter the phrase "war on terror" or modify terrorism as "muslim" or "islamic " "car bombs are going off we just need to find non threatening ways to describe them " writes the historian andrew roberts to outflank the tories on the right mr brown has embraced "british identity " he abolished an old rule that let government buildings fly the union jack only days a year in his first speech as labour leader he repeatedly pledged to defend "the british way of life" and he claimed the immigration issue for labour by promising to safeguard "british jobs for british people " he opposes tax hikes on the rich mr brown is also able to strike a contrast on personal style with his predecessor and mr cameron the conservative leader the so called tory blair is polished charismatic and a smooth talker often dour and disheveled on a good day mr brown comes off as principled substantive and brainy for a month now the days have been good the spectator a tory leaning weekly grouses that mr brown who was the second most powerful man in britain since labour took power in has pulled off the neat trick of looking like "the change candidate and mr cameron the inheritor of all that was least attractive about the blair era " for the first time since april labour has reclaimed and widened a lead now seven percentage points in opinion polls speculation is growing that mr brown will call elections perhaps as early as next spring to use his momentum to win a fresh five year mandate but a snap poll also carries risks and this prime minister is a notoriously cautious man this caution may just buy mr cameron time to find substance his glaring weakness according to a populus poll roughly half of british voters believe the tory leader is superficial and lacks clear convictions half also say they dont know what the conservatives under david cameron stand for until recently mr cameron was able to point to a tory comeback in polls to defend an approach focused on changing the partys stodgy image he won green points for cycling to work until it turned out that his car and chauffeur followed closely behind somewhat offsetting in the parlance of our times the environmental benefit he has sounded tepid on broadening choice in schools and health on tax cuts and on relations with america old tory bread and butter issues out of favor with the cameroons "i think that when some people talk about substance what they mean is they want the old policies back " he said at last falls party conference "well theyre not coming back were not going back " no wonder labour has taken and held the free market policy ground in spite of mr browns stealth taxes big government instincts and spotty record on reforming public services at the same time the new tories hark back to ancient tory elitism mr cameron is an etonian and has surrounded himself with fellow old boys "margaret thatcher made the tories a truly national party " the chairman of a publicly traded british company and a longtime conservative supporter told me referring to mr cameron "thats no longer true " the most remarkable aspect of britains confused politics however is that neither party is prepared to take a tough and principled stand on the issue thats foremost on many minds terrorism just after mr brown took over hundreds of people escaped unharmed when muslim sorry prime minister terrorists failed to set off car bombs in london and glasgow he was able to look strong in a crisis without having any blood on his hands but mr browns almost orwellian refusal not to call a spade a spade done out of pc opportunism an effort to curry muslim votes in swing districts a play to anti americanism or some combination of all of the above could end up hurting him if there is another attack an opposition party might see an opening here as on much else in a brown record though perhaps not these new tories mr kaminski is
