the weekend interview with shimon peres veteran jerusalem shimon peres had not even been sworn in as israels ninth president last sunday when he began making news while vowing to use his new post to "unify" his deeply polarized country and "speak to all israelis " mr peres told the associated press only hours before his induction that israel must "get rid of" the territories it has occupied for years and by implication the jewish settlements he helped create a majority of israelis agreed with him he asserted "even before entering his job he is doing everything to divide the nation and playing into the hands of his friends the murderers of the plo " said zvi hendel a knesset member who represents the influential settler movement when mr peres took the oath of office in israels parliament later that day a few outraged parliamentarians unlike most knesset members cabinet officials and guests at the nostalgic ceremony refused to stand much less applaud the provocative declaration was vintage mr peres in a single sentence the year old veteran of veterans he has held virtually every available possible cabinet job some of them twice signaled his determination to use what has traditionally been a ceremonial post to press for peace fight poverty and promote issues he has long seen as vital to israels national security "the jews have never been satisfied neither personally nor collectively " he told me "and they are right to be so when youre satisfied you become a bore " judging by its debut president peress tenure will not be boring during our minute interview and subsequent lunch at a hotel not far from the knesset mr peres seemed to revel in his role as presidential provocateur was he worried about an iranian atomic bomb i asked the man who led israels successful once secret effort to acquire nuclear weapons "terrorism and the warming of the earth are the two great threats to israel " he began global warming yes he insisted the warming of the "earths refrigerator" ranks second only to terrorism in terms of threat one day israeli homes factories and cars will run on solar energy "better to depend on the sun than the saudis " he said israels top threat however is nuclear terrorism now that president bush has "boldly and courageously" toppled saddam hussein he declined to give advice about whether how and when mr bush should bring american forces home the theocratic rulers in tehran are israels greatest challenge iran "wants to destroy all that is modern but it is a failed state " he said when the mullahs seized power after the revolution iran had million people today it has million "the regime cannot feed them " mr peres said there is corruption and drugs and persians are barely of the population " the regime like the soviet union will eventually fail but would it do so before acquiring atomic weapons "will the muslim world enter the modern age before iran and terrorists get the bomb " he said answering a question with a question no one knows he continued the prospect of nuclear arms controlled by fanatical mullahs and the terrorists they support threatens not only israel but all states "so the world will unite against them " he said if there is a united front against president mahmoud ahmadinejad "he will lose " europe including russia will apply financial pressure on tehran he predicted russian president vladimir putin with whom he had recently met "understands" the threat "he knows that chechnya has a muslim majority and that russia is losing population " according to mr peres meanwhile the election of angela merkel in germany nicolas sarkozy in france and the emergence of labors gordon brown in britain means "there is a different europe now " mr peres went on to say that using military force against iranian nuclear targets would be premature since it is possible that iran could still be deterred by peaceful means but military action is not off the table if peaceful deterrence fails "the red line" on force has to be set by a united front "it would be the greatest mistake for israel to draw that line " he warned is tehran not justified in seeking nuclear weapons given israels development of them mr peres bristled "pakistan did it before us and india " he asserted apparently referring to the nuclear tests of those two countries israel has never acknowledged testing a weapon his comment would seem to be a departure by the way from israels steadfast refusal to publicly confirm or deny its possession of what analysts estimate is a nuclear arsenal of some weapons and "dimona helped us achieve peace with egypt " he added referring to the site of the countrys largest nuclear reactor "sadat said it openly " its preposterous to compare israel and iran mr peres continued while israel is determined "not to be the first to introduce nuclear bombs in the middle east " he said returning to israels deliberate ambiguity regarding its nuclear capabilities a policy he helped formulate in as deputy defense minister and for which he was fiercely criticized "irans leadership says openly they want to wipe us out " while mr peres said he wanted tehran to worry about his countrys intentions and capabilities he added that israel might not be troubled by a nuclearized iran under non militant stewardship "we learned to live with pakistan " he said an iran ruled by moderates "would be a different thing altogether " the peace process itself or "peace processes " as he called them are to some extent leadership dependent mr peres doubted for instance that peace would be possible with a syria led by bashar assad as long as mr assad keeps encouraging radical shiite hezbollah and undermining lebanons integrity "president bush is right to resist direct negotiations " he said at the same time mr peres insisted there is now "a good opportunity to make peace with the palestinians" whose militant islamic party hamas has rejected the west bank based leadership and seized control of gaza the impoverished home of million palestinians "we must choose the plo or hamas " he said referring with little nostalgia to the party founded and led by the late yasser arafat who in finally torpedoed the oslo peace process that mr peres had secretly launched as yitzhak rabins deputy in the early s in the oslo accords of israel and the palestinians agreed to divide the land that both claimed precisely where was one of several key issues deliberately left to be clarified in "final status" talks that did not occur though mr rabin mr peress long time rival arafat and he won the nobel prize for what was then hailed prematurely as the end of the protracted arab israeli conflict oslo crashed and burned in in a resurgence of palestinian violence "let the gazans do whatever they want " mr peres said "we shouldnt stop delivering water or electricity and other basic necessities to them but if hamas fires at us they should not expect thank you notes we will strike back and we will negotiate with the west bank palestinian authority wherever they are " he said such negotiations would be no favor to the palestinians mr peres insisted mr peres left the labor party where he had spent most of his political life to join former prime minister ariel sharons new kadima faction he said only after mr sharon had accepted his argument that the land had to be divided israel had little choice he argued continued occupation of the territories would result either in a non jewish israeli state or a nondemocratic one or both "we cannot defeat or manage the territories " mr peres asserted as he discussed israels fateful choices and his own policy preferences mr peres sounded more like a ruling prime minister than a ceremonial president and with prime minister ehud olmerts approval ratings in the single digits mr peres is in fact likely to enjoy more political latitude than he would have under a strong popular leader does he think that mr olmerts government will survive the upcoming report by a commission investigating his disastrous stewardship of last summers lebanon war as well as the various corruption investigations against the prime minister "i wouldnt exclude it " mr peres replied hardly the ringing endorsement that mr olmert gave him in lobbying knesset members to support his presidency but mr olmerts embrace of mr peres was also coolly calculated aimed not only at strengthening his faltering kadima but eliminating a potential rival for israels top job even at his advanced age associates said mr peres had flirted with the notion of becoming prime minister again the post israelis had denied him after rabins assassination in despite israels mistakes and failings mr peres said its greatest days are ahead thanks to globalization israels once agriculture based economy has been "revolutionized by young people" who have replaced vegetables and fruit with high tech exports a once mocked peres "vision " "its the individual capacity to create that counts today " he said "its a jewish age " in a globalized world jews will excel mr peres went on to say his own son is but one example nehemia peres known as "chemi " the youngest of his three children heads a venture capital firm called pitango which is headquartered in one of the glass skyscrapers in herzliya a tel aviv suburb founded in pitango now employs people and has invested some &# billion in hi tech high growth start up companies owned by young israelis at home and abroad "my father is not just a dreamer hes a doer " said chemi peres the morning after his fathers swearing in "ive seen enough of his dreams come true dimona the development of an indigenous aircraft industry peace with egypt and jordan an economy of israeli billionaires" not exactly the dream of israels founders "in which &# billion a year is invested each year in over companies " and all despite the lack of peace with the palestinians the elder mr peres might have been elected president seven years ago but the knesset rejected him in favor of moshe katzav a lackluster former minister from the conservative likud party this was his fathers most frustrating and humiliating defeat chemi peres said but mt katzav like president ezer weizman before him was forced out of office by scandal on the day of mr peress induction mr katzav was reportedly closeted with his lawyers discussing a plea bargain in which he had acknowledged charges of forcible indecent assault and sexual harassment in lieu of graver accusations of having raped former female employees some israelis quietly fear that this presidency too may end in tears mr peres who will turn in august is the oldest person ever to hold the post he would be if he completes two three and a half year terms "im healthy " mr peres replied when i asked about this concern "i was pounds when born i nearly killed my mother " most israelis welcomed mr peress inauguration as president last week they may be hoping he can restore to the now tarnished office dignity and honor at home as well as its lost stature and moral authority abroad but it says something disturbing that despite the countrys impressive prosperity and scientific achievements there is no one younger on the political scene to play this role ms miller a contributing editor to the manhattan institutes city journal is a writer based in
