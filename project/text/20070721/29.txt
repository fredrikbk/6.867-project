hot topic gridlock in the air no one who has traveled by plane recently needs to be told that our commercial air travel system is overstretched statistics support the anecdotal evidence of crowded airspace taxiways and airports faa administrator marion blakey recently noted that was the worst year on record for delays and cancellations and that bids to be worse still on one day this past week fewer than half the planes at jfk in new york city were on time nationwide for the month of june more than of all flights were delayed its enough to make you think they should just add an hour to every departure time that wont work of course but were not sure that firing ms blakey which is chuck schumers brainstorm for addressing the problem would be any more effective ms blakey has been beseeching anyone who will listen to fix some of the problems with the air travel system since well before this summers delays put the overcrowding in the headlines and on politicians agendas she has also gotten tough with the air traffic controllers union which has placed her on the least favorite persons list of a number of democratic politicians including new yorks senator schumer specifically ms blakey last year fought and won a battle with the controllers union over a clinton era pay package that was eating up a vast portion of the faas budget the controllers ever increasing pay it rose between and left the faa with less and less money to spend on modernization projects that might actually alleviate some of the delays far from being "counterproductive " as mr schumer claimed ms blakeys victory over the union was a necessary step toward to getting the air travel system back on track if senator schumer really wants to do some good for new yorks airports though he might talk to his colleagues from connecticut the delays in new york and around the country are not intractable but they have a tendency to become tangled in the competing interests of nimbyism efficiency and of course money when you combine those with washington partisanship the result is gridlock in the air take as an example the three main new york area airports that mr schumer is so concerned about the airspace around new york including the flight paths for getting in and out of the area dates back decades when traffic was much lighter the faa has been trying for years to "redesign" it in its phrase to allow more planes more ways to get in and out but activists in connecticut dont want the planes going over their houses and neither it seems does anyone else so redesign becomes a political football and the planes sit on the taxiway the good news is that the faa is supposed to issue a redesign rule for new york by the end of august the bad news is that even if the new routes work as intended the result will just be fewer delays next on the list after the big apple is the airspace around las vegas and los angeles which ought to be just as fun meanwhile the new union contract that has mr schumer so incensed allows the faa to arrange work schedules for air traffic controllers to heres a radical idea match periods of peak air traffic naturally the democrats in congress want to use the faas reauthorization bill to roll back that contract how requiring the faa to set work schedules to suit controllers rather than travelers will help congestion is anybodys guess speaking of reauthorization the faa turns into a pumpkin on september if a bill is not signed into law by then on one hand that means no more federal aviation taxes tacked onto your tickets on the other it would mean the faa would no longer have much money to pay the controllers if congress decided instead to privatize the whole system as britain canada germany and other countries have done in whole or part wed hardly object but it seems more likely that our solons in washington will bring it down to the wire over union givebacks and the like if you want to know what ails the air travel system thats it in a nutshell for years the system has been beholden to a cluster of special interests most having little to do with the interests of travelers which is to get where youre going as efficiently as possible the faa has been taking steps recently to remedy some of the more glaring inefficiencies and anachronisms but its hardly surprising that it has been opposed every step of the way this web of interests wont go away as long as the government runs the air traffic control system but the least we might expect of mr schumer and his congressional colleagues is that they not make matters worse for their traveling constituents
