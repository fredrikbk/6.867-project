year old son jack are working on a piece jigsaw puzzle while year old daughter emma claire is drawing animals on a piece of paper returning from a five mile run presidential candidate john edwards

faces in a couple days to determine if her incurable cancer has spread further a concerned look crosses their daughters face "mommys getting a test " mrs edwards says reassuringly when jack asks at another point who will be his childrens grandma because shell be dead mrs edwards chokes up unable to answer mrs edwardss world these days is jam packed with incongruous experiences in public she says shes continuing to campaign for her husbands presidential bid because she doesnt want to let cancer win before it kills her she tells voters on the stump that her husbands campaign is a "calling" worthy of "my precious time " privately she is juggling the campaign with the fallout of her disease her decision and her day to day life mrs edwards says she doesnt see herself as a cancer victim and that she isnt letting it take over her life between campaign stops and monitoring political blogs she is working on a "dying letter" to her three children a "guide to life" she started before her diagnosis but which takes on more poignancy now her advice runs from balancing work and family to telling her children they should always wear solids instead of stripes or plaid otherwise she warns youll look back at old photos and cringe at what youre wearing she is sorting out her and her childrens possessions clothes papers photographs and boxing them to save after her death on the campaign trail the cancer diagnosis has meant a skyrocketing level of attention that also comes at a cost as crowds flock to see her at campaign stops people push greeting cards cancer remedies prayers and children on her last week she picked up a boy for a picture and then worried "maybe i shouldnt have done that " shes not supposed to do any lifting or actions that could break her bones where the cancer has spread "a lot of sad stories in a row that wears on you " she says "but its not a burden im part of a community that holds each other up and its been great to be held up too " still she has confided to her best friends "im so tired of hearing every day that im going to die " those close to her say mrs edwards is committed to living a life full of energy optimism and normality to spend time with the year old mrs edwards on vacation with her family at campaign stops aboard the campaign plane is to witness flashes of courage and humor awkward and exhausting moments and an unprecedented mingling of private trauma and public policy her sister nancy anania initially worried that the campaign would take too great a toll though she says she has now come to believe that "the campaign energizes her " mental health experts who specialize in children with dying parents are watching mrs edwards with great interest "is elizabeth edwards doing whats best for the kids thats hard to say " says lynnette wilhardt clinical director for kids konnected a support group for children who have parents with cancer "if the kids are missing a normal life with great memories its selfish if the kids are used to campaigns they would be stressed if their parents lives suddenly shut down " some in the edwards campaign fear that rival camps are using mrs edwards cancer to undercut fundraising they worry their rivals might be suggesting that money to mr edwards will be wasted should he pull out if his wifes condition worsens in series of interviews including an afternoon by the lake and rides through three states on the campaign mrs edwards acknowledges the criticisms "i worry if this is right but i dont have any good choices " she says the edwards are aware that historical statistics indicate that stage breast cancer patients have only a chance to survive beyond five years "that just doesnt apply to me " says mrs edwards "my job is to stay alive until the medicine and research catch up " when asked if he could envision winning the white house without elizabeth in it mr edwards shoots back "i reject that possibility " the couple will celebrate their th anniversary at the end of this month and plan on eating double cheeseburgers at wendys a tradition since their first anniversary and renewing their vows "john just cant face that elizabeth wont be around " says longtime friend hargrave mcelroy who lived near the edwards for many years and whose children played together "elizabeth is getting her ducks in a row and isnt tiptoeing around death " politically mrs edwards is using the focus on her to advocate her husbands policy positions particularly on health care and to challenge his critics shes telling her big crowds on the stump that her husband will be a better advocate for women than his rival hillary clinton earlier this week mrs edwards received a flurry of attention when she said mrs clinton is dodging womens issues because she is trying to "behave like a man" to show she can be "commander in chief " a new commercial began airing in new hampshire this week that highlights the couples year marriage and alludes to their reaction to dealing with her incurable cancer "john can stare the worst in the face and not blink " mrs edwards says in the ad elizabeth edwards first appeared on the national stage in when her husband became the running

adviser mrs edwards wanted to be open about the cancer recurrence but didnt want to give specific details on her treatment or prognosis "lets follow elizabeth as she goes through her cancer would be almost exploitive " she told them in boxes spread over a basketball court in the gym on their chapel hill estate mrs edwards is dividing clothes from each of her children into what should be kept and what can be given away otherwise "john would just throw all this out " mrs edwards says she especially wants the family to keep the halloween costumes she made for each of her four children when she

her cancer on the campaign trail mrs edwards shows no symptoms of the cancers recurrence or the treatment regime of a daily chemotherapy pill shes showing a slimmer version of herself not from being sick but from a year of calorie counting in her effort to stay healthy and lose weight the campaign vehicle is stocked with green peppers bananas raw almonds and bottled water for her down by pounds
