pursuits sports baseball extra innings the secret to winning after how baseballs oldest players stay on top to the untrained eye kenny rogerss pitching motion is a hurried sequence of stiff movements ending in an awkward two legged hop among devotees of the science of pitching its a blueprint for baseball longevity at age mr rogers a starting pitcher for the detroit tigers has learned how to take most of the strain out of baseballs most strenuous act hurling a ounce ball some miles an hour toward home plate staying in shape helps but for mr rogers the achievement involved years of computer analysis and film study to learn how to transfer energy to his throwing arm from his legs in the most efficient way some americans a day will turn this year and will face the challenge of mustering the same strength and vitality as their bodies age baseball is in the midst of a grand experiment on this front its ballooning roster of older players this weekend marks the th time this season that two over starting pitchers will face each other according to the elias sports bureau is a product of the growing science of athletic longevity these efforts tie together everything from statistical analysis to new age exercises aimed at getting the body into alignment foremost among them biomechanics the science of how animals including humans move these antiaging techniques are spreading to athletes of all ages as awareness grows about the toll that sports can take on youthful bodies children as young as are signing up with private coaches to learn pitching motions that place the least stress on their arms hospitals are getting into this too childrens memorial hospital in chicago has a service where parents of young pitchers can pay &# for a full analysis and recommendations on how to reduce the chance of injury even though some of these graying pitchers are among the highest paid players in the game they still make economic sense for a number of teams thats because they often can be signed to short term contracts rather than the three year to seven year deals that many younger pitchers demand "im much more apt to take on that risk knowing my hands arent tied going forward " says san diego padres general manager kevin towers who before this season signed pitchers greg maddux and david wells to one year deals sometime in the next few weeks major league baseballs graying brigade will notch another milestone at age new york mets pitcher tom glavine is two wins away from victories a feat only other pitchers have achieved reaching the mark is considered a guarantee for making the hall of fame one factor in mr glavines accomplishment is a former investment banker turned baseball stats wonk named craig marino the mets hired mr marino in to help coaches and talent evaluators make sense of all the data the team had access to this data turned out to be critical in helping prolong mr glavines winning years early in the summer of mr glavines career was teetering the approach that had been so effective for so long throwing the majority of his pitches off the outside half of home plate no longer was working mr glavine says he lost confidence and even entertained thoughts of retirement the pitcher hit a low point in a june loss to the mariners in seattle "i was like now what " mr glavine recalls "i was really down about it " rick peterson the mets pitching coach had tried repeatedly to convince mr glavine to mix in more inside pitches something mr glavine feared would ruin his game mr peterson says he talked about how fortune companies constantly are evolving to stay ahead of competitors "we had a lot of long talks about people who are successful " says mr peterson "i said dont you think its interesting that tiger woods won the masters and afterwards he changed his swing " he also had the video staff put together footage of of mr glavines inside pitches that resulted in outs the evidence that proved most persuasive came from mr marino and his stats team on mr petersons request they created a software program that sorted mr glavines pitches by location on a by quadrant grid and identified his bad tendencies the case for pitching inside was clear in his next start a week later mr glavine kept new york yankees hitters off balance during six innings giving up two runs and leading the visiting mets to a win "after that things started to click a little bit " he says a handful of the somethings still playing the game are non pitchers with the most prominent name being barry bonds the year old on the verge of setting the all time homerun record the houston astros craig biggio recently collected his th career hit but the bulk of the longevity research is focused on pitchers and it shows on the field new fitness routines that promise athletes longer careers have gotten lots of attention in recent years older hurlers like roger clemens and trevor hoffman have gotten nearly as much ink for their rigorous workout routines as they have for their accomplishments medicine also has played a key role in enhancing performance that includes a range of drugs from nutritional supplements and cortisone shots to the illegal steroids that have tainted the modern game and new shoulder procedures along with the elbow reconstruction known as tommy john surgery have turned injuries that used to end careers into mere interruptions but whats primarily driving the over crowd is less about repair and more about preventing such problems before they happen biomechanics is the most common link connecting the growing crop of something pitchers it involves the use of reflective sensors attached to the body and high speed cameras to monitor the physiological effects of motion it can show for example how a pitcher whose stride to the plate is too short puts extra strain on his elbow or shoulder the goal of biomechanics in sports is to determine why injuries occur and what changes an athlete can make to avoid them a top pitcher throwing a fastball gets his elbow moving fast enough to spin the shoulder full revolutions per second when cleveland indians all star c c sabathia had his delivery analyzed several years ago he says he wondered how each pitch didnt tear the skin off his elbow not everyone in the pitching world is a believer in biomechanics many pitchers see their delivery as part of their identity and as the primary reason for their success and view any attempt to change it as counterproductive "im not going to alter the way i do things on the mound " says jake peavy a san diego padres all star pitcher leo mazzone the pitching coach for the baltimore orioles who mentored several of the current somethings while he was with the atlanta braves says todays young pitchers get filled with too much information for their own good "it makes it damn near impossible to stay natural " says mr mazzone "i dont need a computer to tell me whether or not a guys mechanics are good " tom house is one of the pioneers of biomechanics in pitching mr house made biomechanics the focus of his unconventional approach to pitching while coaching the texas rangers in the s mr house a former relief pitcher with a ph d in psychology studied eastern european javelin throwers to better understand the transfer of weight while throwing an object he made his pitchers warm up by throwing a football on the theory that it mirrored the ideal pitching release cole hamels the all star lefty for the philadelphia phillies was a year old high school student in san diego when he first visited mr house at least once a week for the next three years or four years mr hamels perfected his delivery on a mound inside a small converted warehouse mr hamels repeated the same delivery thousands of times making sure to keep his stride length at least as long as his bony foot frame rotate his back shoulder after of his stride length and plant his right foot on the ground no more than seconds after his center of gravity shifted toward home plate he held a weighted white towel instead of a ball ending each delivery by slapping it into a target positioned the appropriate distance away during spring training this year mr hamels was getting hit hard worried that he may have unknowingly altered his delivery mr hamels called mr house who noticed the pitcher was opening his hips slightly too early in his delivery which forced his throwing shoulder to over rotate and his elbow to absorb too much stress mr hamels was able to fix the problem before the end of spring training "only a computer can see that " says mr hamels who is this season among the current something pitchers who have worked with mr house are randy johnson jamie moyer and mr rogers at the american sports medicine institute in birmingham ala experts have spent the last five years studying the characteristics shared by elite pitchers who avoid serious injuries in asmis lab subjects throw from a regulation mound with reflective plastic balls stuck to their major joints eight synchronized cameras track the location of the reflective markers at a rate of frames a second all that information feeds into a computer system that creates a stick figure of the pitcher by comparing the data with the baseline healthy models experts at asmi say they can identify any inefficiencies in whats known as the pitchers kinetic chain the transfer of energy from the pitchers legs to his trunk his trunk to his shoulder his shoulder to his elbow and his elbow to his hand in only one team the oakland athletics sent their young pitchers to asmi to have their delivery analyzed today at least eight teams including the boston red sox mets and indians send young pitching prospects to asmi in the offseason to get their mechanics analyzed the milwaukee brewers now even lug a biomechanics apparatus to spring training
