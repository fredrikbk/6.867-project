we stand by data on heart disease risk in estrogen drug study on behalf of the womens health initiative investigators we wish to address misperceptions in your article "how nih misread hormone study in " marketplace july first we want to clarify that the whi investigators and the national institutes of health which funds the whi are jointly responsible for all scientific articles arising from the study both parties stand by the original findings and conclusions specifically our conclusions in that the increased risk of heart disease due to estrogen plus progestin in women who had undergone natural menopause didnt depend on age or health status have been borne out in all subsequent re analyses of the data estrogen plus progestin increased this risk in both women with and without prior heart disease and the increased risk due to the drug at age was of the same magnitude as the increased risk in the overall age group of in addition this drug increased the risk of breast cancer stroke and blood clots overall womens risk of all of these diseases is typically low in the first few years after menopause so our conclusion that the short term use of hormone therapy is a reasonable option for relief of hot flashes and night sweats during menopause which was later reinforced by the fda also holds true the findings from the separate trial of estrogen alone without progestin in women who had previously had a hysterectomy were published in many of these women had undergone premature menopause these trials were similar in that they were both designed to test the effects of hormone therapy on several diseases in postmenopausal women aged both trials were designed to last eight years but both were stopped early because of increased health risks both forms of hormone therapy failed to prevent heart disease overall the key question being addressed and both drugs increased the risk of stroke and blood clots and in older women the risk of memory problems or dementia these serious adverse effects overshadow the benefit from hormone therapy in reducing the risk of fractures and clearly indicate that hormone therapy shouldnt be used long term to prevent chronic disease we have found some important differences between the two hormone therapy trials estrogen alone didnt increase the risk of heart disease overall and the results suggested that there might be a different effect of estrogen in younger vs older participants although the findings on the effects of age werent statistically significant they prompted us to conduct a sub study to measure the amount of calcium a marker of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries of women aged who had been in the estrogen alone trial the younger women who took estrogen alone had less coronary calcium than the women who didnt take the drug suggesting that estrogen alone might offer some benefit for heart disease in the short term but since there was no reduction in clinical heart disease in older women it would be unwise to presume that any benefit in younger women would persist into older ages if women continued to use estrogen there is no evidence that estrogen alone will continue to protect against the foreseeable age related deterioration of the arteries potential benefit may thus revert to potential harm as seen in older women it is important to note that the findings from the estrogen alone trial dont apply to women who go through menopause naturally estrogen alone is known to cause endometrial cancer and thus it is only used in women who have had a hysterectomy for women with a uterus hormone therapy includes progestin which prevents endometrial cancer combined with estrogen in our most recent analysis in we combined the data from the two trials to better understand some of the mechanisms at play this analysis included some data not available to us in we found that age didnt significantly modify the effect of hormones on heart disease or stroke risk however total deaths appeared to be reduced in the hormone group at age we couldnt identify any specific reason for this reduction but we found that years since menopause may modify hormone effects with no increased risk of heart attacks in women within years of menopause compared with the clearly increased risk in women more distant from menopause even in women close to menopause however the drugs increased the risk of stroke and blood clots and the risk of breast cancer on estrogen plus progestin the latest analyses add some further reassurance to women wishing to take hormone therapy in the short term for the relief of hot flashes and night sweats they dont provide evidence that even estrogen alone can help prevent heart attacks in the long term to lower the risk of heart disease more effective options are recommended including adopting healthy lifestyles and identifying and treating risk factors such as high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure jacques e rossouw m d chief whi branch national heart
