pursuits collecting art for less local fund raisers new approaches to art fairs with prices rising faster than ever savvy collectors are shifting their strategies for nabbing deals where to find the next bargains over three decades of collecting for herself and corporate clients art adviser lisa austin landed good deals by cultivating relationships with galleries "those days are over " she says with the art market booming dealers are flooded with buyers and bargains are often scarce lately ms austin devotes significant time to scouting fund raisers like a recent "smash and grab" event to benefit a miami nonprofit art group for an entry fee of &# every attendee was guaranteed one work if they could grab it before someone else to claim the piece she wanted a work made of glass mirrors by karen rifas ms austin literally sprinted past other collectors and dealers "of course i made a mad dash for the piece " says ms austin adding that ms rifass pieces typically go for thousands of dollars "i was getting something for nothing " the art market continues to expand at a breakneck pace sales for the two biggest auction houses christies and sothebys were up a combined last year to &# billion thats driving up prices and giving life to once obscure categories its also causing some veteran collectors to refine their tactics and tap new areas to find bargains in addition to fund raisers such as the one ms austin attended popular art fairs can still be a source of reasonably priced works if you know the trick to finding the deals be prepared to stay late as for emerging markets with buyers already wise to china some savvy collectors recommend searching even farther afield to places like scotland and south korea in markets already heating up one approach is to examine less popular categories peter nagy a former new york dealer who now operates the nature morte gallery in new delhi says indian photography is still overlooked while paintings by midcareer contemporary indian artists generally go for &# to &# and sometimes up to &# photography by these same artists can sell for &# "the untapped market here lies in more experimental work " he says the changing calculus for bargain hunters comes amid broader shifts in the art world with auction houses thriving the big companies in that industry are now expanding into the gallery business too meanwhile the world of art fairs continues to grow rapidly there are now close to "satellite" fairs that have popped up around art basel miami beach to take advantage of surging interest in that show with the hunt for bargains veering to less traveled parts of the market buyers say knowing how to conduct due diligence is critical unlike works sold by auction houses or blue chip galleries the art at local fund raisers or in some emerging markets may come without the imprimatur of an experienced curator placing the burden of researching the artist on the buyer experts suggest looking for artists who have taken part in group shows at small regional museums or galleries who have a graduate degree from a good art school or who have appeared in big name collections in cases where dealers have waiting lists or multiple buyers displaying knowledge about the artist and of course a clear intent to purchase can provide an advantage over the competition below a look at what collectors say are some key strategies for finding underpriced art the late bird gets the art deals buy late not early thats the new thinking about major art fairs like art basel miami beach and the frieze art fair in london for years people have clamored to get a ticket to the "private views " the exclusive showings that take place on the first day of fairs but more galleries now presell most of their art before the actual fair so much of what is on display during the private views has already been spoken for to compensate for this more galleries now bring along a second set of works to hang during the back half of the show its on the final day of the event when dealers are particularly eager to sell that they may pull something out of the closet that hasnt been displayed yet and because galleries are loathe to pay the steep price of shipping unsold items back home they will often give buyers a discount especially on bulky pieces sometimes throwing in the shipping or a frame for free collector paige west picked up a erwin olaf photograph at the pulse new york fair last year for &# that had been listed for about &# ms west says she thinks the gallery galerie magda danysz was willing to negotiate because it didnt want to ship the photograph back to its paris headquarters "its terrible to say but most galleries are interested in offloading " says ms west who herself owns a gallery in new york major finds at minor league fairs as a way to recruit new collectors affordable art fairs which often sell pieces for as little as &# are taking off but more serious collectors are turning up to scour their offerings last year securities trader and art collector mike hoeh who focuses on contemporary photography bought a large painting at pulse miami in the style of a polaroid picture by one of the fairs featured artists ellen harvey the piece cost &# ms harveys gallery galerie magnus muller in berlin says that comparable works from her now sell for at least &# for newer buyers to the affordable art circuit the key is showing up armed with names of some artists that have investment potential rather than using the fairs to window shop four or five hours of homework before visiting these fairs can make a huge difference heres what do look for artists who have participated in group shows at well regarded museums like the walker art center in minneapolis dallas contemporary the institute of contemporary art philadelphia the seattle art museum and the studio museum in harlem museum web sites have rosters of artists who have appeared in their shows mr hoeh also recommends subscribing to the museums email lists to keep tabs on emerging artists exhibiting at those places also keep an eye on group shows at galleries during the summer months that is when the elite of the art world go on extended vacation and newer artists get a shot to exhibit art blogs can also be a good source of information about emerging artists popular sites include artcal net artnet com edwardwinkleman blogspot com galleryhopper org and artsjournal com man art collecting com lists affordable art fairs by month and provides links to their web sites which show some of the art being displayed affordable art fairs range from more regional events like ann arbor street art fair in michigan which is taking place this weekend to the nada art fair in miami which is populated by some of the most successful younger dealers in the country getting schooled in student art last year a new york gallery put on a show of works by artists still in graduate programs at yale columbia and hunter college and sold more than before the show even opened student art has become one of the hottest areas for bargain hunters in recent years searching for these pieces can be more time intensive than some other strategies but theres a payoff access to potential star artists early in their careers one of the best ways to find student art is "open studios " once or twice a year events depending on the school where the public is invited to the students studios typically the students are set up in their studios the artist equivalent of an office with their art arrayed around them these are opportunities not so much to actually buy the art as to meet the creators a big advantage of this approach is the chance to see the full range of a students work far more than would be on display at a one off auction and take home a cd with samples if there are artists that seem promising in this initial visit the next step is to do some research on them and the obvious first place to look is their resumes good signs include previous sales not to relatives but to people in the art world including the school staff or apprenticeships with older reasonably well known artists if the artist passes this test too contact him or her directly to arrange another studio visit thats the time to ask if there are other works to see and discuss buying something many artists will be willing to part with works for well under &# but some of their best pieces may go for closer to &# or these days even up to &# mfa programs are typically two years and buyers have an incentive to act earlier in this cycle the closer students get to graduation the greater the likelihood that they will be represented by a dealer that can in most cases at least triple prices for their art donald cameron who graduated from the cranbrook academy of art in may sold a work this past april for &# at the student auction there now mr camerons oil paintings are selling at a chicago gallery for between &# and &# to find out about opportunities to buy student works go to the art schools web sites start with schools in your area according to some art advisers good schools that fly under the radar of the east coast centric collecting establishment include the cranbrook academy of art outside detroit california institute of the arts in valencia columbia college chicago and maryland institute college of art another place to do some research is ugallery com a scottsdale ariz based web site started last fall by three recent college graduates it offers works by more than artists from different schools including arizona state university savannah college of art and design and massachusetts college of art paintings sell for an average of &# and photographs for &# to find young international artists try collector charles saatchis site "stuart " which was started last year as an offshoot of his online gallery benefiting from small fund raisers major charity auctions often feature art but smaller local charities can be a better place to find under priced art and little or no competition from major collectors as the art market heats up small local charities as well as art galleries and museums are increasingly trying to tap artists sense of civic responsibility and asking them to donate original artworks for fund raisers these fund raisers come in several forms some are actually raffles attendees buy a ticket usually for several hundred dollars that guarantees them at least once piece of art the cost of the ticket includes the piece of art the smart strategy is to get to the event as early as possible look at the hundreds of donated works and jot down the numbers of a few that seem promising when an attendees ticket is picked from the hat he has to immediately declare the piece he wants by putting a red dot on it other fund raisers follow a live auction format where the bidding is done verbally just like its done at a place like christies or sothebys but theres one big difference unlike at a big auction house theres often no reserve price or minimum so a piece can sell for as little as a collector will offer point being bid low other fund raisers use silent auctions where buyers jot down their bids on paper some auctions let buyers preview the work the week beforehand and make initial bids every two years the museum of contemporary art los angeles has a silent auction of several hundred works from emerging artists both lower priced pieces and more expensive works normally only available to collectors whose names are at the top of long waiting lists at galleries at la mocas silent auction in a collage by elliott hundley sold for &# mr hundley who works with cut up magazines personal photographs and everyday objects like strings paper and feathers had just finished his masters of fine arts at ucla and his work was rare even then today a hundley collage sells for between &# and &# if you can get one the artists who donate the works to these fund raisers often have mixed feelings they want to support the causes but theres a cost their art often sells for much less than it would at retail another complaint they cant even deduct for tax purposes the fair market value of the work they donate only the cost of the materials used to produce it donald cameron a young artist in chicago says that while he doesnt like the practice of giving away work "its encouraged almost required i mean it helps you meet a lot of people that will make your career " he says buyers should avoid charity events where only a very limited number of pieces are sold and major collectors turn up in droves the metropolitan opera in new york for instance recently held an event where a john chamberlain sculpture was auctioned off for &# finding the right auctions before everyone else does can be a challenge particularly because some galleries that used to hold these benefits have stopped doing so or now dont publicize them as loudly regional museums often do mailings about these kinds of events potential collectors can also comb through local calendars for auctions some of which take place in wealthy vacation communities like the hamptons miami and parts of maine blazing a trail in emerging markets fifteen years ago jean pigozzi traveled to africa to buy work directly from artists now mr pigozzi a venture capitalist in switzerland owns the largest collection of contemporary african art in the world thanks to globalization and the increasing sophistication of the international art market more developing countries now have at least some art infrastructure whether its an art fair or a gallery guide to help steer potential collectors in mr pigozzis day he was walking from one artist studio to another without any assistance though dealers have already descended upon china and india its still possible to find works with a high chance of appreciation in these and other markets and buying directly allows a person to avoid the high markup that is part of going through a well known gallery in the u s emerging markets attracting attention include scotland australia south africa and south korea the caveat here of course is that these artists are chancier because less information is available about them some of the litmus tests that can be used to gauge an artist in the u s like where they went to art school dont apply in emerging markets and many of these markets dont have extensive lists of galleries or rich collecting cultures the best bet is to find a local gallery that seems trustworthy or a gallery in the u s thats knowledgeable about the region and use it to help navigate the terrain curators and administrators from major western museums are increasingly relocating to emerging markets to get a ringside seat virginia ibbott of the tate modern in london is moving to beijing this fall to help open a contemporary art museum she recommends that collectors look at the guangzhou photo biennial and the shanghai art fair art prep how one pro gets ready to buy lisa hunter began buying student art in college and today is one of the top collectors of affordable art over years she has amassed a stockpile of crafts prints paintings and photographs centered on theater and film never spending more than &# on an item we asked her to walk us through how she prepares for shows and spots likely bargains well before she walks in the door heres how she would prepare for the upcoming american craft show in san francisco one of the most important events for collectors of craft art lauren a e schuker  as far in advance as possible ms hunter reads targeted art publications to get more conversant about the particular genre for this fair she would scan magazines like american craft fiberarts and ceramics  a week before the fair she will check the web site http www craftcouncil org sf to see which art she likes on a purely aesthetic level bookmarking those pages so she can easily find them again in the case of the san francisco fair of the shows artists catch her eye  she takes that list of artists and begins looking into their professional backgrounds as well as viewing more of their work to get a better feel for their investment potential ms hunter quickly eliminates some of the artists when she sees that their other crafts including some decorated with bunnies and other animals are too cutesy and commercial  while researching she finds that one of the artists she likes andrea tucker hody who makes collages with handmade paper graduated from the pratt institute a top art school in the "crafts" sector a good sign but then ms hunter sees that ms tucker hody doesnt have her own web site and the only price ms hunter finds for her on the web &# seems much higher than those of many better known artists on a closer glance at the artists resume ms hunter also discovers that ms tucker hody hasnt exhibited at either of the three top fairs for craft art the smithsonian craft show and the two sofa fairs based on that information ms hunter concludes that ms tucker hody is more of a local artist to track than a national artist to buy immediately  at this point ms hunter has eliminated nine of her initial picks leaving her with a short list of three artists masuo ojima myra burg and elaine hyde to find more details on their pricing she goes to artnet com which lists auction results because most emerging artists havent sold at auction she browses the site for prices of artists who have similar backgrounds or are working in a comparable medium  after doing that ms hunter knows that all three artists are in her affordable range &# to &# and she can shoot off an email to them and their dealers announcing her interest and intention to buy at the fair she might also use the opportunity to ask if the artist has anything smaller or cheaper than the prices that she found online
