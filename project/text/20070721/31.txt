how much to invest overseas despite common wisdom trims may not be right lifted by a weak dollar and a boom in emerging markets international stocks have been hot over the past three years gaining ground much faster than their domestic counterparts as a result foreign holdings have become a bigger part of u s investors portfolios does that mean its time to trim back maybe not wall street common wisdom holds that when one sector has had a hot streak investors need to "rebalance " selling off some shares so that a single investment doesnt come to dominate their portfolios however the case for international stocks may be an exception some evidence suggests many americans might not be overinvested in foreign companies now for the simple reason that they were underinvested to begin with reasons for investing in foreign stocks include potentially higher returns though that certainly isnt guaranteed and diversification at times foreign markets will move out of sync with u s stocks which can lend overall stability to a portfolio that has a balance of both although there is no hard and fast answer for how much money to put abroad the size of overseas stock markets relative to the u s market suggests investors could reasonably stash far more into foreign stocks than anyone believes they do right now foreign stocks constitute more than half the market value of all equities based on this distribution u s investors could theoretically be justified in putting as much as of their stock investments in overseas companies says douglas schindewolf head of tactical asset allocation at citi global wealth management however when that citigroup inc unit makes recommendations to its clients and financial advisers it aims much lower and suggests putting roughly of stock investments abroad a level mr schindewolf thinks is more comfortable for investors "most investors have a home country bias we have to recognize that in providing advice " he says "i think its fair to say that actual investment exposure is below our recommended exposure " about of americans currently invest in international stocks and plan to do so over the next five years according to a recent study by schroders plc a london based asset management company at the same time about of assets in employee k plans is in international or emerging markets investments up from just three years ago according to a study of plans sponsored by customers of hewitt associates a human resources consulting firm by implication this figure suggests investors international exposure in k plans could be of what they have in stocks similarly data from the investment company institute a mutual fund trade group indicate that about of assets invested in all u s mutual funds are in "world" funds a category that includes international funds and those that mix u s and foreign investments the total is up from three years ago of course in addition to rapid appreciation international stocks have become a larger part of investors portfolios because new u s money has been pouring in as investors chase returns world mutual funds received larger inflows than domestic stock funds over the past three years according to the ici to be sure mutual fund investors have a long history of rushing headlong into recently successful fund strategies and buying just as these strategies reach their peak reaping losses as they fall back to earth emerging markets in particular warrant caution they are notoriously risky few portfolio managers or financial advisers recommend putting more than about of an equities portfolio into emerging markets so investors might want to think twice about loading up on more than that or even letting their investments grow beyond that point through appreciation in addition all international stocks do carry risks beyond those of domestic stocks while currency trends have lifted foreign stock values recently they could quickly reverse thomas zimmerman a financial planner in evanston ill aims to keep clients international exposure at while that figure crept into the mid s for some less conservative clients he recently decided to cut back citing concerns the dollar could rise in a certain sense u s investors already invest substantial amounts abroad when they their put money into u s corporations like general electric co and coca cola co that have big sales overseas as a result of expansions abroad the financial well being of such companies is tied more and more to the health of foreign economies says zachary karabell chief economist at fred alger management inc the result is that some u s stocks may start to rise and fall in concert with those of foreign companies rendering one advantage of investing abroad less potent "correlation " mr karabell says "is going to increase "
