rbs conditions imperil abn bid sale of lasalle bank unit emerges as sticking point battle is likely to drag on a bid by a consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc to acquire abn amro holding nvs u s unit was in trouble last night over the conditions it attached to its bid complicating its overall &# billion cash and stock offer for all of the dutch bank according to a person familiar with the matter the development coming after a weekend of negotiations and delays will likely continue the high stakes battle over control of abn the consortiums cash and stock bid was competing with a &# billion offer from barclays plc however the rbs consortium could still bid for the whole company the bid from the consortium came in two parts and arrived with conditions that took two days to negotiate people familiar with the matter said because of a side deal abn struck to sell lasalle the rbs team made a conditional offer for lasalle of &# billion that tops the &# billion price of abns previous agreement to sell the division to bank of america corp a pact reached when abn agreed to be taken over by barclays the rbs groups lasalle bid is contingent on abn also accepting the consortiums takeover proposal for all of abn the rbs group according to people familiar with the situation yielded on several conditions but abn remained wary one possible outcome being considered by abn late yesterday the bank could keep its recommendation for the barclays deal which includes bank of america buying lasalle but wait for the rbs team to announce its bid and put both bids to shareholders to decide people familiar with the matter said the problem with this scenario is the bids would move forward with a potentially multibillion dollar lawsuit from bank of america weighing on abn that suit was filed friday in a u s federal court seeking unspecified damages it also would mean abn couldnt talk to rbs until may because of other conditions included in its contract to sell lasalle the meeting last night included abns management board which makes day to day decisions and its supervisory board which is similar to a u s companys board of directors abn struggled to determine whether the conditions attached to the rbs groups proposals created too much uncertainty to make them practical according to people close to the matter the conditions of the consortiums offer which surprised abn led to a new round of negotiations yesterday between rbs based in edinburgh scotland and abn of amsterdam people close to the rbs group said that after many hours of negotiation its takeover proposal for abn had similar conditions to the one abn already agreed to with barclays also complicating the talks the consortiums financing for its bid for all of abn is contingent on two of the groups partners dutch belgian bank fortis nv and spains banco santander central hispano sa completing their fund raising that could raise questions for abn shareholders whether financing is secure representatives for fortis santander rbs and abn declined to comment a bank of america spokesman said the bank doesnt comment on speculation and reiterated that it has a binding contract and will take all steps to protect its legal rights the banks and their advisers began the weekend negotiations friday and raced toward a deadline of p m new york time yesterday the cutoff for any new lasalle bids under abns contract with bank of america in amsterdam friday rbs chief executive fred goodwin met with abn executives at dinner abn had been expecting mr goodwin to arrive with an offer but he didnt people familiar with the matter said the proposal for the full bid that the consortium submitted to abn saturday lacked details on the consortiums financing arrangements people close to the matter said however the rbs team pledged that the financing would be settled by yesterdays deadline other people involved in the situation said the three banks boards of directors already have approved the arrangements and the final documents are waiting for a takeover agreement with abn before they are signed the people familiar with the matter said either bid for abn would mark the worlds largest banking deal the rbs proposal includes dividing up abns various businesses a breakup of a bank on this scale has never been tried before the rbs consortium working in edinburgh and amsterdam delivered the proposal saturday it ran to about a dozen pages but it wasnt received well at abn because among the conditions the consortium sought its bid was contingent on no legal liability such as the bank of america lawsuit people familiar with the matter said after talks over the weekend the consortium appeared yesterday to concede that conditional request these people said by late last night the rbs consortium continued to pledge it had its financing in place as abn continued to seek more specifics on how the group would underwrite the equity issues the banks plan to use to finance their bids a sticking point going into the final hours was whether the consortium would agree to make a bid for lasalle without having it conditional on bidding for all of abn
