boss talk staying on target the retailers top three talk about creative risks painting bulls eyes on crabs if copying is the sincerest form of flattery target corp should feel great about itself these days rival retailers from payless shoesource inc and j c penney co to wal mart stores inc are borrowing a page from the minneapolis companys playbook upgrading design at a breakneck pace so far target has been able to stay innovative it keeps adding hot products such as smith &amp hawken accessories and is bringing in apparel by new designers from around the world still the retailer struggled last year with sales of pricey home furnishings and it just lowered its estimate for april comparable store sales target which recently posted &# billion in revenue is about the size wal mart was a decade ago though sales at existing stores are rising at twice wal marts rate founded by dayton co in the same year as wal mart and kmart target began to distinguish itself with cheap chic identity about years ago when bob ulrich became chief executive officer he credits targets team approach and urged the wall street journal to also talk to president gregg steinhafel who leads the merchandise teams and michael francis the chief marketing officer whose ads set the company apart excerpts the wall street journal how did the idea of an upscale discount retailer come about bob ulrich chairman and ceo there were a heck of a lot of people around years ago that were covering the same space the monster at the time was kmart but wal mart was also already emerging as an enormous power both had merchandise we didnt think was particularly inspiring and we didnt think it would benefit our guests targets word for customers to offer them the same with our department store heritage we had a bit more of an affluent guest and a more female oriented guest so we looked at how we could leverage all that as we pushed the parameters of the design and quality and trendiness of our merchandise it eventually became more acceptable for more upscale people not just in terms of income but taste level to shop at target we created the whole trend of designers making products for discounters starting with architect michael graves in who took his &# teapot and recreated it for us for &# these things keep evolving you cant just be unique in one category you cant be really mundane in small electrics if youre trying to be innovative in textiles you cant be really forward in linens and beat down in shoes so you have to start to get more consistency across the board wsj are you worried about everyone copying what formerly made you unique mr ulrich not really for another competitor to say theyre going to compete with us at our level of prices and design its hard if they dont have our guests who are on average about more affluent more highly educated come from more sophisticated areas those guests arent in their building looking for that kind of merchandise weve been at this for or years im not saying it cant happen over time saying that the yugo is going to turn into bmw in the next months is pretty silly wsj how do you keep coming up with cutting edge merchandise and marketing ideas such as color coded prescription bottles so family members dont mix up their medicines michael francis executive vice president marketing one way is through something we call the big idea contest i challenge my team to solve a problem or see things a new way weve done everything from whats the next consumable product that we would like to repackage to what product in your pantry frustrates you the most the winner gets a cash prize recognition and sometimes we create the product or campaign i have people who are brilliant all over the country and they feed in ideas on a regular basis i probably have about a dozen of them trend people movie people advertising people we pay them and we get monthly missives emails or letters i just got a whole package on sustainability ideas theyve become invaluable for me because its people who we trust who we know have the right taste level who understand our brand gregg steinhafel president we reward innovation we recognize it we talk about it a lot we look for innovation globally in every corner of the world in everything we do whether its architecture or marketing or merchandising or new technology systems we share ideas so that a good idea in one part of the company can translate to another we have the line simply shabby chic for instance and were able to say well you know that has application in pets now whod have thought that you could take print and pattern and what we do in dinnerware and put it on doggy bowls were structured in a way that fosters innovation wsj how so mr steinhafel to free up merchants to focus solely on product innovation and being first to market for example we created a centralized team that facilitates the major negotiations processes theyre the back office team that pulls together all the data researches the history sits down with the department and identifies the opportunity then we can quickly focus on design and innovation and creativity wsj how do you balance taking creative chances with minimizing risk mr steinhafel its important that we push the envelope and that we fail ive described on my conference calls a number of merchandising initiatives where we pushed too far too fast like domestics where we got a little out in front of ourselves with too high a thread count in sheets and too many top of bed products at high prices we recognize that when we do fail we make the course corrections and we dont penalize the teams that have made these calculated risks wsj give me an example of an idea that didnt work mr francis hermit crabs were a big trend in japan and we thought what if we took a thousand hermit crabs and painted bulls eyes on white shells as a way for target to brand the spirit awards a beach side film event in los angeles the week before the academy awards it worked sort of people said look at the cute little hermit crab then it would bite their little finger and wed wind up having our well branded hermit crab hanging off someones finger in a photograph but the beauty of it is for the next months wed get calls from mexico san diego from families who were on break whod find hermit crabs so we decided it was a great opportunity to send out target gift cards and turn it into something wed never planned on a find the hermit crab sweepstakes wsj why do you do so much buzz marketing from putting on vertical fashion shows in new york to sponsoring the worlds first digital art gallery in dallas mr francis i dont want to be on a billboard along some freeway in some dense metropolitan area i want to be where there is a smart sophisticated audience whos experiencing that venue for reasons other than brand awareness wsj does the buzz does translate into sales mr francis absolutely we measure it its a powerful powerful component of what we do buzz has had an astonishingly important ability to amplify our entire marketing message wsj what do you see as your next engine of growth mr ulrich we are still growing in the u s and some people think were a little silly for that but we are going to have stores by and eventually somewhere between and as for emerging markets what difference does it make if were there now or five or years from now one could argue that as india and china get more affluent they are much more ready for a target type strategy
