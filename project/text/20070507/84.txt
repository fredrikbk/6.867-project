small business link firm goes outside to keep its data safe its p m do you know where your information is more and more small business managers are storing important data on servers and systems that are increasingly vulnerable to attacks until about four years ago technology consulting firm compushare inc handled most of its it security internally but not hours a day while executives at the south coast metro calif company which is a technology management consultant to small banks and credit unions did want its systems to be monitored around the clock the task proved too costly for compushare to take on by itself so it decided to outsource the work "we didnt feel that it was a good allocation of our resources to have in house professionals managing something so critical " says aaron silva compushares director of corporate development "when you look at the value of this data we couldnt afford to manage this on the basis it needed to be managed " security routinely tops the list of small business owners technology concerns says gary chen a senior analyst covering it security issues at yankee group a market research firm in boston security tasks can be "pretty overwhelming " he says ranging from antivirus software to protecting servers and networks and small businesses tend to be reactive putting out fires when a security breach takes down desktop computers or a virus causes email to freeze rather than focusing on preventive measures but looking for an outsider to do security work for them can be just as daunting small businesses with limited funds often arent sure where to turn for help and some simply dont know they can pass the task on to a vendor whats more many are hesitant about giving outsiders access to their most sensitive company information "theres a certain amount of trust and education needed before you let someone on the outside do something for that issue " mr chen says only of companies with to employees outsource technology security according to ami partners a technology research and consulting firm in new york for companies that do look outside for security monitoring the benefits include added safety and awareness since its the job of the vendor to stay on top of the latest security threats and to know how to prevent and fix them and in many cases its actually more cost efficient than doing it themselves when compushare handled its own it security one employee checked a log each morning when he arrived at work to make sure hackers didnt break through the companys firewall during the night but with hackers gaining sophistication and attacks on the rise company executives decided it was time for around the clock protection it would have taken four full time staffers to constantly monitor the firms systems for security threats says romir bosu compushares president and chief executive officer but paying employees to do so wasnt an option for the small firm "four bodies and four salaries and you still dont know if youd be doing it as well as a company that specializes " he says "its better and cheaper than if we tried to do it ourselves " compushare which posted &# million in revenue last year now relies on outside help to make sure no one is breaking through its internet firewall and gaining access to customer information accounting records and trade secrets it also uses a different outside service for antispam and antivirus protection both security functions "that are by intensive " says mr bosu he says the firm performs many of its other tech tasks in house it hasnt been a totally smooth move however for the first three years or so compushare farmed out it security tasks to a vendor whose name mr bosu declined to disclose but during an annual review a little more than a year ago he says he noticed that the vendor had received funding from a venture capital firm but hadnt grown the business or enhanced its services he asked the vendor for information on how often it was updating crucial intrusion detection patches which make sure its systems catch the newest threats but wasnt comfortable with its response so compushare switched to perimeter esecurity of milford conn a company it says had strong industry references perimeter charges its clients between &# and &# per month on average depending on how many services a customer is using and how big the company is it sends daily weekly and monthly reports that show the number of hack in attempts mr bosu says hes paying perimeter "a fraction" of what it would cost to keep up to date on the latest patches and monitor systems around the clock with four bodies he adds that compushare has never experienced a security breach small companies considering following compushares lead and outsourcing it security should first take an overall assessment of their needs from hardware and software to the different passwords employees use and how they use them says russell morgan president of the information technology solution providers alliance in portland ore an organization for small and midsize businesses he says the security provider should offer some sort of insurance coverage in case it doesnt take appropriate steps to safeguard the data from attack if onsite support is important also make sure the company is locally available a side benefit to using an outside vendor says compushares mr silva is that as you open new offices employees simply plug into the internet and download the standardized security protections theres no need for engineers to go to each office to install and update software compushare has eight offices around the country mr silva says he puts potential vendors through exhaustive due diligence he says a vendor should be willing to reveal enough information like balance sheets or profit and loss statements to prove its financially healthy he also asks how much the company is investing in new technologies and if its a start up who its investors are brad miller perimeters chief executive officer says most of his customers tried to handle their own security before looking outside he says that after adding up the costs and work involved for firewalls intrusion protection and antispam software "at some point people say this is never going to end "
