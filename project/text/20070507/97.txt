the morning brief sarkozy gets his chance to maybe remake france online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here french president elect nicolas sarkozy claimed a mandate for change last night but his strong ballot box performance and the generational progression it brings belie the difficult hurdles that await his proposed reforms mr sarkozy years old said repeatedly during last weeks debate with vanquished socialist candidate segolene royal that he is a man of doing not talking and receiving just under of the votes cast amid historically high voter turnout among the highest in western democracies the tough talking former minister of the interior finance and budget portfolios suggested he will try to spend that political capital quickly he is set to succeed jacques chirac at the elysee palace on may and in doing so replaces as the official face of the french mainstream right a man who first sought the presidency in the mid s mr sarkozy is widely believed to have chosen former cabinet colleague francois fillon to serve as caretaker prime minister and lead the rights bid for control of parliament in legislative elections set for mid june as le figaro reports mr fillon said last night that the caretaker cabinet will include representatives of the political center and even the left with a care to balance the number of men and women as well le monde adds and mr sarkozys ambitious agenda for the first days means the new parliament will have to hold a special session in july as les echos explains mr sarkozys plans to break with french tradition on a host of labor fronts are well known as summed up by the new york times he aims to "remake france by among other things slashing unemployment cutting taxes keeping trains running during strikes making people work harder and longer shrinking the government bureaucracy reforming pension rules and making it easier to create new businesses " mr sarkozy also breaks with mr chirac and his predecessor socialist francois mitterrand over more than two and a half decades of harnessing antipathy toward u s policies or global dominance as means of rallying the french with unabashed admiration for america mr sarkozy has praised u s meritocracy as an economic model and asserted he has no need to apologize for "feeling an affinity with the greatest democracy in the world " as newsweek reports but there is a gallic tint in mr sarkozys translation of american red white and blue into frances blue white and red notably in ruthless willingness he showed as finance minister to thwart european corporate merger and acquisition ambitions if they undermined the french goal of creating national industrial champions and the key to success for his intended changes will be the streets though not the suburban ones that produced rioting among impoverished immigrant and second generation french communities during his interior ministry tenure and which as an issue he has offered no solution rather he will have to find a way to work with or marginalize french unions and grass roots groups that successfully derailed attempts at overhauling the system under mr chirac whose "bulldozer" reputation before the elysee wasnt significantly less brawny than mr sarkozys "mr sarkozy can use political credit to win over labor unions and push through some changes " nicolas sobczak an economist with goldman sachs tells the wall street journal "but there is a risk of another jacques chirac someone who pulls back in the face of social resistance or makes so many concessions that initial good ideas are watered down " for france the most important changes may actually have to come from yesterdays losers rather than the winner ms royals concession speech seemed far more rehearsed and ready than her victory speech after the first round of voting two weeks ago and her sometimes capricious campaign style seemed in part responsible for the rights victory despite the rather shaky year record mr chirac will leave behind but as the socialists mulled over their defeat last night former finance minister dominique strauss kahn a man whose reputation for pragmatism and an open mind on economics helped fuel suggestions he would have been her prime minister wasnt blaming the candidate but rather the ideas speaking on the television network tf he blamed the third presidential loss in a row on a failure by the socialists to modernize their thinking in the face of globalization "the left has never been so weak because the french left has still not renewed itself " he said and mr sarkozys ability to change the country as a whole may be helped if mr strauss kahn can bring philosophical change on the left rival suitors report new abn rejection the consortium of big european banks hoping to break up abn amro holdings sale to barclays said this morning that their bid for
