jack valenti redefined the power lunch i was not a close friend of his but when jack valenti died the other day i felt the pain of loss when i worked with him he was the head of the motion picture association of america the mpaa the trade association of hollywood film companies included columbia pictures of which i was the ceo for some years we worked together on industry issues and i got to watch this talented and complex personality assert his forceful ways on politicians and bureaucrats as well as on those of us who pretended to be his bosses i admired him because he had piloted a bomber on missions over europe during world war ii he was also president lyndon johnsons close friend and adviser a tiny man with a flashing smile sharp tongue and fine mind jack wound his way through the halls of hollywood and washington with sublime self confidence he was widely known to be the very close friend and protege of the legendary lew wasserman head of mca who in my time was the single most influential person in hollywood jack reminded the rest of us regularly that he consulted first with lew and that having obtained the blessing of that primus inter pares he was willing to hear the largely uninfluential opinions of the rest of us the rest of us included barry diller then head of paramount steve ross then head of warner and disneys michael eisner we were not an easy group to lead and yet jack managed to do so brilliantly for some years perhaps his greatest achievement was holding onto his job even as the industry went through so many enormous tectonic shifts including the acquisition of two major film companies by japanese giants sony and matsushita jack kept his cool and his standing and like most successful leaders managed to maintain the broad support of the various constituencies whose views mattered i still smile at the memories of jacks brilliant maneuvers one day i got a call from barry diller who was then running paramount pictures and is someone for whom i have genuine affection and hold in very high regard he told me that jack was being romanced by baseball team owners to become the next commissioner this was in the mid s when the position was open mr diller was very concerned he told me because we could ill afford to lose jack and he wanted me to approve a new contract with substantially greater financial terms in order to dissuade jack from going to baseball as i listened it became clear the new deal had already been approved by the big guys in the mpa namely messrs wasserman and diller and i was not being asked for my approval but rather to ratify what had been done so jack got a big new deal and soon enough peter ueberroth became baseball commissioner years later i found myself in the role of baseball commissioner during some idle chatter one day i asked bud selig then the owner of the milwaukee brewers and a longtime leader within the owners circle if they had ever approached jack to be the commissioner and here is where jacks brilliant move came to light mr selig told me they had never had any real interest in jack for baseball but he did recall being asked by edward bennett williams then the owner of the baltimore orioles to do him a favor mr williams asked mr selig to invite jack to lunch at the metropolitan club in washington mr williams the quintessential insider told mr selig he did not care what he talked about with jack he only wanted the two men to be seen together mr williams who was also jacks personal lawyer explained that he wanted to get jack a big new deal with the mpaa and that being seen with the baseball leader would provide him the necessary leverage of course i knew the other side of the story and could only marvel at the sheer beauty of the set of moves that produced jacks magnificent deal i also learned how things got done in the business big leagues good for jack mr vincent is the author of "the only game in town baseball stars of the s and s talk about the game they loved" the first in a multivolume oral history project
