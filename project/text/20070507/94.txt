from the houston astros to the new york yankees the announcement was made yesterday in dramatic fashion with the year old clemens addressing yankee stadium during the seventh inning stretch those in attendance also got a yankee win a beanball war and benches clearing not bad value for that ticket clemens contract meanwhile will be as dramatic as his announcement &# million prorated meaning hell likely earn some &# million and cost the yankees another &# million in luxury tax as with his last two astro seasons hell be allowed to fly home between starts and wont have to make road trips when he isnt scheduled to pitch is &# million a lot not when youre george steinbrenner and youve watched your team stumble behind starters who have been injured mike mussina chien ming wang jeff karstens phil hughes ineffective kei igawa chase wright unknown darrell rasner newcomer matt desalvo or carl pavano carl pavano "whether you love the rocket or cant stand his bloated ego one way or another there was no ignoring him during the seventh inning stretch " writes bob klapisch in the bergen record "there he stood in george steinbrenners box eclipsing kate smith and god bless america telling the world hell save the yankees " can he mr klapisch writes that "the bombers couldnt whip out the checkbook fast enough after all theyre not just paying for clemens plus fastball but his aura of invincibility too " in newsday ken davidoff offers talking points for clemens fans confronted by those who loathe the pitcher a sample "this idea that the yankees are going against brian cashmans vow to make the team younger i guess thats true in a technical sense but this is a one year contract for clemens the real problem came when the yankees committed three years to a year old randy johnson and four years to a pitcher who has the pain tolerance and maturity of a year old no hints " in returning to the yankees clemens rejected entreaties from the boston red sox his original team and his hometown team the astros in the houston chronicle richard justice channels the bitterness "he wanted a bigger stage brighter lights more buzz " he writes "in the end he wanted things our little one horse town couldnt provide well soldier on without roger clemens but the truth hurts especially this truth the fact of the matter is that clemens found us boring all the astros did for clemens was allow him to come and go and pretty much name his salary he was loved in a way only a few athletes in this city have been loved and it wasnt nearly enough " but mr justice then turns that around "we were blessed to have watched him pitch for three years hes an amazing competitor even though he no longer has overpowering stuff he gets by on guts and poise and smarts and astonishing control hell turn soon but thats just a number hell be as good as ever he wouldnt put on a uniform if he thought he might fail no matter how angry you are today youve been lucky to get an up close look at one of the best who ever lived " with and the queen of england watching jockey calvin borel maneuvered street sense through traffic at the kentucky derby saturday hugging the rail until he had room to burst through the field and overhaul hard sense in a thrilling win the win thrust mr borel nicknamed "bo rail" for sticking his mounts to the inside into the spotlight the year old cajun journeyman has raced horses since he was eight with broken bones for his troubles and is known in horse racing circles for rising to muck stalls at a m on saturday with street sense headed for the roses he raised his whip in exultation once then twice purest human joy made flesh "he was the happiest man in america " jeff jacobs writes in the hartford courant "and if there has been a happier jockey to win the kentucky derby well the camera never caught him you think you have seen joy in sports and then you see calvin borel and you know you have found it how long has he dreamed of winning this race always borel answered " "growing up in louisiana borels future wasnt coming out of books " writes wallace matthews in newsday "his career prospects were not going to depend on grades or sat scores his classroom was the back of a horse his homework was done in the pre dawn hours not with pencils and books but whips and saddles and rakes his lessons came not from a schoolteacher but from his older brother cecil for whom calvin has been mucking stalls and working horses for more than years we dont have much education and were not proud of it cecil borel said but we are proud of what weve done no harvard graduate has ever accomplished what calvin borel did yesterday armed with little more than a healthy dose of native intelligence and a notable lack of fear " mr matthews writes that "more erudite men might describe the brilliance of borels kentucky derby winning ride yesterday by invoking pythagoras algorithms or vectors borel merely shrugged and in the cajun twang that sometimes renders his speech nearly unintelligible to a city slicker said its just the shortest way around the racetrack " in the washington post andrew beyer praises mr borel and trainer carl nafziger for excellent preparation and tactics while offering a caution for the future "large derby fields usually produce a fast pace as jockeys hustle to get a good early position the pace often takes a toll on the leaders and helps the stretch runners " he writes "even so those stretch runners have to make their way through a mass of horseflesh without getting blocked borel made it look easy street senses performance was so dominating that casual viewers of the derby telecast might doubt that any of his rivals could stop street sense from sweeping the triple crown but when stretch runners benefit from a hot pace and a clean trip they can look deceptively impressive fusaichi pegasus was hailed as a superstar after his derby rally in but proved a bust thereafter monarchos rallied to win the second fastest derby in history in but never won another race " the group is called athletes for hope and the los angeles timess j a adande approached it with his cynicism in place and then things started to change "at first athletes for hope seemed to be another one of those concepts that sounded nice but probably wouldnt succeed " he recalls "its mission is to help athletes make better contributions to their communities and to match corporations and volunteers with civic minded athletes sure ok good luck with that then i saw the people involved names such as andre agassi andrea jaeger and warrick dunn they dont just talk they make things happen ask any of the students at the andre agassi college preparatory academy in las vegas or the children with cancer who have skied rafted or ridden horses at jaegers little star foundation or the single mothers who have new homes thanks to dunn " the group began when agassi got together with lance armstrong and mia hamm and discussed what could happen if athletes with successful foundations pooled their resources those big names attracted other big names muhammad ali jeff gordon tony hawk jackie joyner kersee mario lemieux alonzo mourning and cal ripken "they could in essence become role models for people who wanted to be role models " mr adande writes "successful athletes have high profiles and lucrative contracts but their careers also have a relatively short life span so why not make it easier and less time consuming for them to help out while theyre in their primes " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
