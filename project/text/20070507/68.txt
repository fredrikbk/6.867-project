monthly mutual funds review squaring off brokers liability for advice what kind of legal protection should investors get when seeking advice from securities brokers that issue is at the core of a controversy involving fee based brokerage accounts where investors had an estimated &# billion at year end the securities and exchange commission last year put a new rule in place that had the effect of encouraging the use of fee based accounts the sec was aiming to reduce stock brokers incentive to make unnecessary trades to generate commissions so the commission said that stockbrokers overseeing fee based accounts were now exempt from a "fiduciary duty" to clients when providing "incidental" advice tied to buying and selling securities a fiduciary duty requires acting at all times in a clients best interest in a nutshell that means brokers could give clients advice with less worry about later tangling with them in litigation but the denver based financial planning association which represents independent broker dealers and registered investment advisers cried foul the fpa argued that stockbrokers were raking in the same fees as financial advisers for similar advisory work without having to meet the stiff legal standard they do in march a federal appeals court struck down the sec rule the court said that the sec lacked authority to create the rule to exempt certain broker dealers from registering under the investment advisers act of if the sec doesnt file for a re hearing the ruling will go into effect on may the wall street journal invited fpa president nicholas a nicolette to discuss the issue with marc lackritz president and chief executive of the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma a new york trade group excerpts from their email discussion follows mr lackritz investors benefit when they can choose among a wide range of services offered by different types of investment professionals and when different methods are available to pay for these services if this ruling is allowed to stand american investors will see their choices for investment vehicles severely limited the securities industry fully supports the idea that financial services providers should have a fiduciary responsibility when offering financial planning but not everyone in the industry offers that type of service to every client investors in fee based brokerage accounts receive equally robust regulatory protection simply under different laws and regulations mr nicolette the courts ruling isnt about limiting consumer choices its about affording consumers protection and clarity under a tortuous patchwork quilt of securities regulation under the sec rule investors getting advice from a financial adviser enter a marketplace defined by confusing titles obscure promises and bewildering disclosures the court ruling places the client interest first which is exactly where it should be it also provides for disclosure of conflicts of interest work history qualifications and disciplinary history unlike the lower broker standards the consumer will benefit by having the freedom to choose any professional regardless of how they are compensated and where they might work and knowing they are all held to one standard mr lackritz providing investors only one choice is no choice at all the fpa makes one excellent point there are different rules for brokers and advisers while broker dealers are subject to the same fiduciary standards as fpa members when offering financial planning services in most cases broker dealers are actually subject to higher standards with respect to conflict disclosure qualifications and work and disciplinary history brokers but not advisers also face significant and numerous additional rules relating to client relationships these mandatory broker rules and regulations are administered and enforced not only by the sec but even more comprehensively by the national association of securities dealers and other regulators effective beginning to end supervision is the real key to investor protection yet there is no comparable layered regulatory supervision for independent financial planners instead the fpa is using the courts to force all investors to accept their particular narrow brand of legal protection which is available only after the wheels have come off yes their clients have the right to sue for breach of fiduciary responsibility if something goes wrong but many firms held to fiduciary standards are not as well capitalized as broker dealers which must keep certain levels of capital on hand investors who work with brokers have the right to sue too under suitability standards which are clear concise and the subject of extensive case law fiduciary standards are less so mr nicolette heres the simple legal reality the brokerage industry represented by sifma has a clear legal obligation to put the companys interest first its called the law of agency but a financial planner or investment adviser has a clear legal duty to put the clients interest first its called a fiduciary duty theres no denying that the difference is huge with the help of slick madison avenue advertising and lax sec rules wall street is allowed to promote its fee based programs as if these were subject to the same kind of fiduciary standards governing investment advisers attorneys and certified public accountants the fact is they are not with the term "financial adviser" appearing on brokers business cards and no longer "account representative" or "stockbroker " the public has the mistaken impression that the broker is on the same team as the client not the company yet what sifma doesnt want them to tell the public is that they do not legally place their clients interest first leaving the public in the dark or utterly confused wsj do you expect an sec appeal mr nicolette the commission should definitely not appeal we continue to urge the sec to give brokerage firms adequate time to give customers a real choice choose between a commission or fee based account only this time thanks to the court decision customers choosing the fee based account will get a full disclosure and an adviser with a fiduciary duty whether the adviser works for a large wire house or an independent firm mr lackritz we hope the sec would appeal this ruling on behalf of the nearly one million american investors who rely on fee based accounts these accounts are simply not the type of services that the advisers act was intended to address ending the availability of fee based accounts would dramatically increase the costs associated with investing without a rehearing these accounts could disappear from the landscape forcing customers into more expensive less desirable investment vehicles
