how to sink a newspaper one has to wonder how many of the newspaper industrys current problems are self inflicted take free news news has become ubiquitous free and as a result a commodity anytime you are trying to sell something that becomes a commodity you have lost much of the value in providing that product or service not many years ago if someone wanted to find out what was in the newspaper they had to buy one but not anymore now you can just go to the newspapers web site and get that same information for free the newspaper industry wonders why it is losing young readers those readers might be young but many of them are smart not to mention computer savvy why would they buy a newspaper when they can get the same information online for free newspapers initially created their web sites with the best of intentions after all newspapers are in the information business and rather than fight the new medium the internet why not embrace it wanting to be the leading information providers and thereby have the most popular web site in the community they posted all of their news online for free exacerbating the problem with free news was the decision by the newspaper industry which owns the associated press to sell ap copy to news aggregators like yahoo google and msn these aggregators created lucrative news portals where the world could get much of the news that was in newspapers so readers could now get free news not only on newspaper web sites but also from portals and aggregators that had a chance to monetize the content most of which was created and financed by the newspaper industry with local radio and television stations also creating web sites and posting their news for free newspapers soon realized that much of the news on the broadcast web sites had been created by the local newspaper so whereas before the newspapers were selling print ads while radio and tv were selling air time now they were all selling the same medium their web sites since newspapers share their content with the associated press so other members can use it radio and tv members are using much of that content to compete against the newspapers that created it newspapers have for years been frustrated by radio stations which merely read the stories which are printed in that mornings edition tv stations often get much of their news from the newspapers too but reading it on the air is clearly different from posting it online placing them in direct competition with newspapers web sites all of this would be fine if newspapers generated lots of additional revenues from offering free news but the fact is newspapers generate most of their online revenues from classified advertising not from news gordon borrell ceo of borrell associates estimated that newspaper web sites generated of their revenues from classifieds in it turns out that a web site is a very different medium from a newspaper while consumers often find pop up ads a distraction and banner ads as more clutter readers often seek out the advertising in newspapers the inland cost and revenue study shows that newspapers will generate between &# and &# in revenue per subscriber per year but a newspapers web site typically generates &# to &# per unique visitor per year it may be that newspaper web sites as an advertising medium and free news just cant generate the revenue to sustain a valued news operation in fact online revenues for the publicly traded newspaper companies in varied from at journal register co to at belo corp the only company higher was the washington post co at yet newspapers typically spend or more of their revenues on their news and editorial operations the wall street journal online now has paying subscribers more than the paying subscribers to all but three u s newspapers usa today the wall street journal and the new york times our newspaper the arkansas democrat gazette in little rock does not offer our news for free on the web site we offer free headlines on a few selected stories we offer a few free paragraphs designed to get people to read our paper we also offer free classifieds recently i had the opportunity to compare our web site policy with the free news policies of other papers for the six months ending march the newspaper industrys circulation was down daily and sunday by contrast the arkansas democrat gazettes circulation was up daily and up less than sunday i was able to make another interesting comparison too with the columbus ohio dispatch columbus and little rock are both state capitals columbus is a larger market and the columbus dispatchs circulation of compares with for the arkansas democrat gazette up until jan both our paper and the columbus dispatch offered news content only by subscription we even charged the same price &# for an online monthly subscription and both of us offered the same style electronic editions but columbus dropped its subscription model on jan and began offering most of its news for free its web traffic and revenues certainly increased but what happened to its paid circulation the six months ending sept was a good comparison since it compared six months in when the columbus dispatch had free news on its web site compared with six months in when it did not offer free news the columbus dispatchs daily circulation was down while sunday was down for the six month period this compared with our loss of less than daily and sunday when i looked at this comparison with columbus as well as the newspaper industrys larger losses it didnt encourage me to change our web policy to free news so what are we doing with our web site we have hired a videographer to complement our text coverage in the newspaper we have added photo galleries to increase the number of photographs beyond what we can publish we offer an electronic edition where you can search the entire edition by keywords something you cant do in the print edition and we offer breaking news email alerts something else you cant do in print in other words we are offering value on our web site that complements rather than cannibalizes our print edition collectively the american newspaper industry spends &# billion on news and editorial operations this includes everything from copy editor salaries to sports travel expenses in addition the associated press spent about &# million world wide in editing and creating news by offering this news for free and selling it to aggregators like google yahoo and msn for a small fraction of what it costs to create it newspaper readership and circulation have declined these declines are accelerating in and prior years industry circulation declines were usually less than since march these declines have been per year with declining readership comes declining ad revenues which are followed by layoffs the newsroom layoffs are most troubling as less news with less quality context and details results in more declines in readership and later declines in advertising if the &# billion spent covering news becomes &# billion and later &# billion it is not just the newspaper industry that gets hurt journalism will be diminished in america with less investigative and enterprise reporting indeed less reporting of state houses city halls school boards business and sports clearly a lot is at stake it is time for newspapers to reconsider the ultimate costs and consequences of free news mr hussman is publisher of the arkansas democrat gazette see related letters "letters to the editor newspapers are sinking themselves with poor business management"
