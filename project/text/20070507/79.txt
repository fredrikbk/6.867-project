politics &amp economics predatory lending hard to tame north carolina has mixed results protecting subprime borrower an eight year old north carolina statute has become a model for federal lawmakers who want to protect borrowers from predatory mortgage lenders but the states experience demonstrates the difficulties of protecting unwary consumers in a fast evolving marketplace the law is designed to prevent lenders from coaxing subprime borrowers those with spotty credit histories or high debt to income ratios into taking mortgages they cant afford among other things the statute places a duty known as a "suitability" requirement on subprime lenders akin to the one that requires stock brokers to recommend investments that are in clients best interest lenders must avoid issuing high interest mortgages generally defined as instances where points and fees paid by the borrower exceed of the total loan unless they "reasonably believe at the time the loan is consummated" that the borrower will be able to repay borrowers must receive independent counseling before taking a high interest loan and can sue lenders if they are steered into an inappropriate mortgage the law outlaws refinancing a mortgage unless it has a "reasonable tangible net benefit" to the borrower other states have followed north carolinas lead some in congress want to do so too democrats and republicans on the house financial services committee are negotiating legislation based on the north carolina law sen charles schumer a new york democrat last week introduced a bill that would place a fiduciary duty on mortgage brokers and mortgage originators to make loans that are suitable for borrowers efforts to curb predatory loans and reduce incentives for brokers and lenders to initiate them have intensified as the number of defaults on subprime mortgages has soared rising nationally in the first quarter from a year earlier according to foreclosure data service realtytrac a major challenge for lawmakers and regulators lies in eradicating shady practices that could contribute to another meltdown without choking off credit that makes home ownership a possibility for subprime borrowers north carolinas experience illustrates how tricky it is to strike that balance the laws suitability requirement hasnt spurred a rash of borrower lawsuits as critics suggested it might nor has it restricted credit as much as opponents feared "there was a hue and cry about us shutting down the market and people not doing business here " said joseph smith jr the state banking commissioner "its pretty clear it didnt really run anybody off " but neither has it shielded borrowers from unsavory practices as much as proponents hoped some practices and loan types vanished after the law was passed but lenders adapted and replaced them with other products some of which create similar problems for borrowers after the law took effect subprime mortgage originations in the state rose as they did nationally in subprime originations rose from the previous year in north carolina according to data provided by the banking commissioners office subprime lending flattened and then nearly doubled from to as the housing market surged north carolinas home ownership rate fell slightly following passage of the law but has leveled off to about slightly above the national average according to u s census bureau data a study by researchers at the university of north carolina at chapel hill found a decline in refinancing activity "the law is doing what it was intended to do eliminate abusive loans without restricting the supply of subprime mortgage capital for borrowers with blemished credit records " the researchers concluded but lenders quickly found ways to offer loans the law didnt anticipate some avoided north carolinas prohibitions through moves by federal regulators that pre empted state law from covering some federally regulated lenders other lenders rolled out adjustable rate mortgages that werent proscribed by the law one popular form was a year loan that offers an introductory "teaser" rate for two years but can reset to higher levels thereafter up to a given maximum by offering the low initial rate lenders could issue loans that stayed below the threshold set in north carolinas law arms can be ideal for people who may be on the verge of higher incomes but many subprime borrowers are having trouble making payments now that their monthly payments are moving higher "the mortgage market had not seen these exploding arms at the time the law was written " said mal maynard director of the financial protection law center a wilmington n c organization that represents borrowers facing foreclosure "this together with the pre emption phenomena has undermined the effectiveness of the north carolina legislation " in the first quarter there were foreclosure filings in the state a increase from a year earlier according to realtytrac available data dont tell precisely how many of those involved subprime borrowers nationally subprime loans account for of foreclosures estimated rick sharga vice president of marketing for realtytrac in north carolina regulators are implementing a law that requires all mortgage originators to be licensed by the state that is having a bigger impact in curbing predatory tactics than the original law said mr smith the banking commissioner the debate over what to do if anything is continuing in washington among the sticking points whether to give consumers the right to sue lenders over loan suitability and whether federal law should pre empt state statutes consumer advocates are pushing for a national suitability requirement on brokers and lenders some legislators talk about making investors who buy pools of mortgages responsible for loans that were inappropriately made industry groups say lenders already have an interest in ensuring that borrowers can repay loans the groups say suitability requirements drive up costs and reduce credit availability "even if the facts suggest that a lender is in compliance with both fair lending rules and a suitability requirement borrowers who go into default are likely to claim that the loan was unsuitable " the mortgage bankers association argued in a recent paper "a suitability standard would not provide benefits to consumers that outweigh these risks and costs to consumers lenders and other market participants " but house democrats plan to unveil a proposal that would go beyond north carolinas approach "i still think the north carolina law has worked pretty well " said rep brad miller a north carolina democrat who was a legislator in raleigh when the law passed "but you can find a way around it "
