asia taps thirst for risk new deals from firms tarnished by crisis lure eager foreigners jakarta indonesia several of asias onetime corporate basket cases are seeking new investors and foreigners are lining up to buy their stocks and bonds leading the way family owned conglomerates whose borrowing binges a decade ago gave them a starring role in the asian financial crisis of among the most recent is the family of indonesian tycoon eka tjipta widjaja in one of its companies asia pulp &amp paper co was responsible for the largest emerging market bond default in history &# billion investors are still trying to get their money back nevertheless last month another widjaja company raised &# million in a share placement on the singapore stock exchange after the placement the widjajas have a stake in singapore palm oil company golden agri resources ltd a spokesman for golden agri suwandy chen says the organization has learned to borrow within its limits "look we made our mistake and weve basically remedied it " golden agri is the latest in a parade of less than blue chip companies from developing countries that are tapping international markets again others include the salim family one of indonesias largest former debtors which in february raised &# million through a placement of shares in its palm oil plantation company indofood agri resources ltd in singapore the offering was times oversubscribed last year the riady familys lippo group which like the salims lost control of its bank after the crisis raised &# million through a real estate investment trust listed in singapore and that mainly owns hospitals in indonesia anthony salim salim groups chief executive officer and james riady lippo group ceo declined to comment the flood of investments is happening just as hedge funds and institutional investors many sitting on cash piles are scouring the globe for new ways to deploy their money their willingness to buy into risky deals such as these is one reason many emerging market stock indexes have soared to records last year indonesias stocks jumped making the market one of the worlds top performers according to deal tracking firm dealogic companies in emerging markets raised &# billion in new debt and stock offerings in up from so far this year such fund raising has continued apace even amid sometimes volatile u s and international markets southeast asias sprawling family run corporate dynasties are notoriously tangled making it nearly impossible sometimes to know who owns what in the case of the widjaja empire many analysts say little has changed in its opaque structure last year a report by moodys investors service said the widjaja groups "complicated family controlled organizational structure could give rise to the risk of funds being channeled to support affiliated companies " mr chen of golden agri says the company no longer is allowed to do business with other widjaja family owned entities in other southeast asian nations many major defaulters lost control of their companies but not in indonesia here many large business groups that defaulted on borrowings a decade ago have been able to take advantage of political connections and a weak legal system to hold on to their most valuable assets and repay only a fraction of the debts to foreign investors and the government jakarta spent &# billion after the crisis bailing out banks many of which were owned by indonesian conglomerates that had lent beyond legal limits to affiliated businesses until recently indonesias former defaulters had such poor reputations on international financial markets that they were forced to rely on internal funds or private deals mainly highly collateralized loans from u s and european investment banks and hedge funds but now they are taking advantage of "rising risk appetite" among foreign investors says rizal prasetijo of j p morgan in jakarta "its a very conducive environment" for them to issue stocks and bonds this time around some deals are being structured to improve the chances that investors get repaid for instance a &# million bond issued in january by giti tire an indonesian owned company that makes tires in china included a provision to capture revenues from the companys exports in a special offshore account that will be used to repay creditors singapore based giti tire is part of the business empire of sjamsul nursalim an indonesian business tycoon who now lives in singapore mr nursalims bank dagang nasional indonesia collapsed during the crisis causing huge losses for the state a spokesman for mr nursalim says the family has repaid those debts by handing stakes in companies to the government some of the indonesian companies doing new listings have made few efforts to improve corporate governance in the past years to justify investors snapping them up says james bryson of hb capital indonesia a jakarta based hedge fund some foreign investors are still trying to get their money back from apps &# billion default although the company struck a &# billion debt payback agreement with big creditors in others got nothing and are still pursuing their money in court indonesias courts have consistently found in favor of app in disputes with foreign lenders last year the supreme court ruled that an indonesian subsidiary of app didnt have to repay &# million in bonds to foreign creditors because the bonds were illegally structured under local law last month morgan stanley the arranger of the bond and japans mizuho bank the collateral agent filed for a judicial review of the supreme courts decision the bondholders including u s hedge funds oaktree capital management llc and gramercy advisors llc are also planning to appeal in april a new york appellate court ruled that app should turn over &# million to the bondholders but in the past rulings such as these have been impossible to enforce because most of apps assets are in indonesia and china despite such bitter experiences with widjaja family companies investors piled in to golden agris singapore share placement which was oversubscribed high prices for palm oil fueled by global demand for biofuel mean golden agris prospects look rosy says peter choy an analyst at moodys moodys has a ba "junk" rating on the firm three levels below investment grade reflecting its fear that money lent to golden agri could be diverted to other widjaja owned companies as they allegedly have been in the past "its not a first rate company " mr choy says
