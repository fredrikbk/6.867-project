provider of security guard services that had been left with &# million in unpaid bills when delta and northwest airlines corp filed for bankruptcy court protection in september as an adviser to delta one giuliani partners unit giuliani capital advisors would be in a position to recommend that the airline give command business and perhaps even suggest contract terms commands chances of being paid by delta however depended entirely on court approval of a reorganization plan worked out with a committee of creditors command says the companys ambition in the bankruptcy case wasnt to recoup owed payments but to "provide additional services" to delta under new contracts it had about that time hired another giuliani partners unit giuliani security &amp safety to drum up new business and by that

affiliated with giuliani partners giuliani security &amp safety is a separate entity from both giuliani capital and giuliani partners and as a result had no disclosure obligation " while giuliani security did business with giuliani capital mr oesterle said that was "immaterial " a spokeswoman for the giuliani campaign declined to comment commands mr galloway said he doesnt believe mr giulianis company interceded with delta on commands behalf and said he was unaware mr giulianis firm was serving as deltas restructuring adviser "delta does not consider this a conflict of interest " said a

bankruptcies says there is no way of knowing whether mr giulianis company did anything unethical "thats the purpose of disclosure to uncover conflicts of interest " mr lopucki said "we dont know the reason they didnt disclose and we dont know what they failed to disclose " failing to disclose relevant connections can lead to trouble bankruptcy judges can impose penalties on creditor advisers if
