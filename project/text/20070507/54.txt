more than twice the size of the entire frontier index for this reason they still make up a very small percentage of the holdings of most emerging markets funds but interest is expected to grow as

markets tend to zag did a recent study by the international monetary fund discover this to be true a yes theres only a weak correlation between u s stock prices and those in the emerging markets meaning they dont often move in the same direction b no theres a strong correlation meaning they do tend to move in the same direction c theres a strong correlation when prices are going up but a weak correlation when prices are going down d theres a strong correlation when prices are going down but a weak correlation when prices are going up answer d the imf found that when the u s stock market was going up the emerging markets tended not to follow think of the late s when the u s was experiencing a tech boom and asia and latin america were in turmoil when the u s market declined on the
