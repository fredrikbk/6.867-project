the afternoon report merger materials online edition sometimes the best defense is a good offense and playing defense may be just what the aluminum giant alcoa is doing by offering to acquire north american rival alcan but several hurdles stand in the way of a deal alcoa said this morning that it was launching a &# billion hostile offer for its longtime canadian rival after years of on again off again discussions between the two companies on a variety of potential business combinations including a round of board level merger negotiations last fall alcoa chairman and ceo alain j p belda said that his company was "very disappointed" that those talks had not resulted in an amiable deal "a conclusion we would have strongly preferred " but he said he was convinced of the "compelling strategic rationale" for joining forces and that alcoa had thus decided to bring its proposal directly to alcans shareholders alcoa intends to offer &# a share in cash and stock for alcan terms that it said would represent a premium against the closing price of alcan shares last friday when they settled at an all time closing peak alcan acknowledged receipt of the offer and said that its shareholders defer any decision on the proposal until after its board has had a chance to review it and make a recommendation but shareholders appeared to be voting with their buy orders in morning trading as alcan stock surged well above the bid price alcoa shares also got a boost jumping on the new york stock exchange just weeks ago alcoa was looking like takeover bait the company announced late last month that it wanted to unload some or part of its consumer packaging and auto components businesses and shower much more cash into the lucrative aerospace arena where aluminum is used for making things like the outer skins of jetliners but wall street observers remarked that throwing those weak units over the side also made alcoa a much more appealing target for a large mining company like the two australian behemoths rio tinto and bhp billiton whom have been said to be circling alcoa and alcan like a pair of hungry great white sharks hunting for a meal but other predators may soon be drawn into the fray as the aluminum sector has been experiencing a wave of consolidation among other deals russias rusal and sual had recently pulled off a three way merger with glencore that created united company rusal the worlds largest producer of primary aluminum by volume and hindalco industries has agreed to scoop out &# billion to buy novelis a former alcan unit those or other companies could be drawn to the pursuit of either alcoa or alcan a possibility investors seemed to expect based on the big gains in both alcoa and alcan this morning besides the threat of a major bidding war for either company political concerns could also break up any marriage of alcoa and alcan combining the two giant companies seems almost certain to raise antitrust questions mr belda said in a conference call that he believes that the merger will ultimately pass muster but antitrust attorney nate eimer told dow jones newswires that the bid "will get a lot of attention because of the concentration in north american aluminum" and that whether it goes through or not is a close call given that rival suitors could wait and see how the legal questions play out before floating an offer word of the bid was already stirring up a political backlash in canada meanwhile even as alcoa sought to assuage concerns about potential job losses members of the liberal opposition party in canadas parliament bellowed that a new tax policy had made alcan vulnerable to takeover the conservative governments federal budget proposed to end the practice of allowing companies to deduct interest on loans taken in canada to fund foreign acquisitions "its a bad day for canada " remarked john mccallum a liberal finance critic stocks still climbing stocks managed some modest gains as news of the alcoa offer spread through the market helping push stocks up once again in what is fast becoming one of the strongest periods for the equities market in years the dow jones industrial average climbed
