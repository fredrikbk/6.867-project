monthly mutual funds review checking out some spiffy new bond funds etf models proliferate with plusses minuses when to be wary bonds were late to the etf party but now theyre arriving en masse an exchange traded fund resembles an index tracking mutual fund but trades like a stock a new crop of bond etfs on the market are designed to track treasurys corporate bonds high yield bonds or mortgage backed securities barclays global investors which for the past few years has offered the only available u s bond etfs has added debt etfs to its lineup this year vanguard group inc launched its first bond etfs in april while ameristock corp plans to launch a group of treasury bond etfs in july state street corp and bear stearns cos also plan to launch bond etfs according to regulatory filings the new funds like all etfs offer investors relatively low fees and the flexibility to trade throughout the day but investors should take a close look at how these etfs operate and weigh them carefully against traditional mutual funds bond etfs that appear quite similar on the surface may employ very different strategies meaning different risks for investors and some of the bond products arent any cheaper than similar mutual funds whats more bond etfs lack some of the tax advantages that have helped make stock etfs so popular in addition some advisers believe that index tracking products such as etfs arent the best way to access the bond market where some active managers have a strong record of beating the indexes nearly of actively managed intermediate term bond funds beat the lehman brothers u s aggregate index in the five years ended april according to research firm morningstar inc expenses which eat into returns are a key consideration when choosing a bond fund bond funds returns often fall in a narrow range so a slightly lower fee can mean the difference between an above average fund and a laggard for example the new ishares iboxx &# high yield corporate bond fund charges expenses of of assets well below the average of for high yield bond mutual funds according to morningstar investors shouldnt assume though that a bond etf is always cheaper than a similar mutual fund the ishares lehman aggregate bond etf and the vanguard total bond market index mutual fund for instance track the same broad bond market index and both charge expenses of but vanguards recently launched etfs exchange traded classes of several of its bond funds including total bond market index are significantly cheaper with expenses of investors also should consider how often they will add money to a fund since they typically must pay brokerage commissions to trade an etf for long term investors "i generally favor bond index mutual funds mainly because you save the trading costs " says marvin appel chief executive of appel asset management corp in great neck n y and author of "investing with exchange traded funds made easy " while etfs are generally tax efficient the tax advantages of bond etfs arent as clear as those of stock etfs mutual funds must distribute their capital gains and income each year and investors holding the funds in taxable accounts must pay taxes on those distributions stock etfs rarely distribute capital gains thanks to their complex inner workings giving them a tax advantage over stock mutual funds but most distributions from bond funds come from income not capital gains this income is distributed and taxed the same way whether it comes from a mutual fund or an etf investment strategies are another key consideration different bond etfs may use very different strategies to pursue the same objective and present different risks to investors for instance the new vanguard etfs like the vanguard mutual funds themselves use hundreds or even thousands of bonds to track their indexes while the most diversified ishare bond etf holds about securities that detail could make a difference to investors holding a greater number of securities diversifies risk helping to minimize the impact of a blowup in any particular bond and a fund that holds a bigger slice of the securities in an index may be able to track the index more closely indeed while the ishares lehman aggregate bond etf and the vanguard total bond market index mutual fund both track the lehman brothers u s aggregate index and charge the same expense ratio the vanguard fund more closely tracked the index in each of the past three calendar years than the ishares etf with about bonds the vanguard fund holds roughly times as many securities as its ishares rival "if you hold fewer securities than an index youre going to have some tracking error " says matthew tucker head of the investment solutions group at barclays global investors the barclays plc unit that manages the ishares etfs yet barclays feels confident that its bond etfs hold enough securities to closely track their indexes he says most of the ishares bond etfs hold just a small slice of their benchmarks securities because they avoid the most thinly traded bonds this selective strategy helps keep the etfs"ask " or the price at which investors can buy shares close to their "bid " or the price where investors can sell shares that can help cut trading costs for investors with so many fund companies rushing into the etf market investors must consider each firms expertise in managing bond portfolios analysts say barclays and vanguard for example have managed bond index tracking funds for years but "i think you have to be much more wary" with a firm like ameristock which "really doesnt have a lot of experience running fixed income money " says dan culloton an analyst at morningstar ameristock president nicholas gerber says the firm has had success running stock funds "and i imagine a stock is even harder to analyze than a bond " investors also should weigh bond etfs against actively managed mutual funds some financial advisers believe that actively managed funds are a better way to access the bond market where many securities are thinly traded and pricing can be murky while all of the bond etfs now on the market track indexes both vanguard and bear stearns are hoping to launch actively managed fixed income etfs according to regulatory filings harold evensky a financial planner at evensky &amp katz in coral gables fla uses active managers for the bond portion of client portfolios partly because of the markets inefficiency and partly because bond etfs dont cover municipal bonds a key investment for many tax sensitive investors ms laise is a staff
