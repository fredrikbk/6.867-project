the evening wrap aluminum foil online edition aluminum giant alcoa made a move to swallow its estimable north american rival alcan but wall street seems to be wagering that some other predator will happen along and gobble up one or even both of the companies alcoa said this morning that it was launching a &# billion hostile offer for its longtime canadian rival after years of on again off again discussions between the two companies on a variety of potential business combinations including a round of board level merger talks last fall alcoa chairman and ceo alain j p belda said his company was "very disappointed" that those talks hadnt resulted in an amiable deal "a conclusion we would have strongly preferred " but alcoa is convinced of the "compelling strategic rationale" for a banding together mr belda says and alcoa had thus decided to bring its proposal directly to alcans shareholders alcoa intends to offer &# a share in cash and stock for alcan a premium against the closing price of alcan shares last friday when they settled at an all time closing peak the deal would give the combined company a share of aluminum production and reunite two companies that were split up years ago because of antitrust issues since the company was broken up the industry landscape has changed dramatically aluminum demand soared in recent years and prices have climbed higher leading to the emergence of a raft of new aluminum players from russia the middle east china and india against that backdrop alcoa and alcan have been struggling to maintain their place in the market and both companies had been floated as possible takeover bait both companies were thought to be appealing targets for acquirers such as the two australian mining behemoths rio tinto and bhp billiton whom have been said to be circling alcoa and alcan like two hungry sharks foraging for a meal and indeed alcoas approach doesnt do much to diminish the possibility that both alcoa and alcan could find themselves consumed in a feeding frenzy alcan shares surged by placing them well above alcoas bid and hinting that investors anticipate an even richer offer from a rival bidder alcoas shares also jumped sharply surging more than unusual for the acquiring company in such a big dollar deal lurking in the back of many investors brains surely was the furious deal war that broke out last year around canadian nickel miner inco which featured a cast of players including phelps dodge teck cominco and eventual winner co vale do rio doce that episode much like the emerging aluminum drama was driven along by surging commodities prices fanned by feverish growth in developing nations notably china besides the threat of a major bidding war for either company political concerns could also break up any potential marriage of alcoa and alcan regulators are sure to want to take a long hard look at any deal that will further consolidate a sector that is already dominated by a few big companies alcoa seems likely to argue that the deal should be looked at from a global perspective and in light of the recent wave of tie ups among other aluminum heavyweights but antitrust lawyer nate eimer told dow jones newswires that the takeover would receive "a lot of attention because of the concentration in north american aluminum " some experts said meanwhile that a review could take as much as six months meaning that the longer the deals drama takes to play out the less time alcoa might potentially have to pitch the takeover to a friendly administration should democrats win the white house in the merger could face a much tougher ride meanwhile political resistance was building up in canada members of the liberal opposition criticized a tax policy shift that they say made an alcan takeover easier to pull off one said that the news was a "bad day for canada " stocks still climbing stocks posted yet more gains as news of the alcoa alcan offer spread through the market

to no good with some unusual looking quarters espionage to be precise it seems according to the associated press that some army contractors traveling around canada were so befuddled by a canadian quarter featuring a red inlaid poppy flower a symbol of remembrance in canada that they decided to file espionage reports about them describing the so very mysterious coins as "filled with something man made that looked like nano technology " the supposed nano technology on the coin actually was a protective coating the royal canadian mint applied to prevent the poppys red color from rubbing off the mint produced nearly million such quarters in commemorating canadas war dead the reports apparently led to warnings from the defense department that mysterious coins with radio frequency transmitters were found planted on u s contractors with classified security clearances on at least three occasions between october and january as the contractors traveled through canada the claims were disavowed by the pentagon and the u s said it never substantiated them the defense security service never examined the suspicious coins spokeswoman cindy mcgovern said "we know where we made the mistake " she said "the information wasnt properly vetted while these coins aroused suspicion there ultimately was nothing there " write to tim annett at tim annett wsj com
