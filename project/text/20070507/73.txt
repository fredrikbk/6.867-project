president sarkozy voters yesterday handed nicolas sarkozy a mandate to revive france the next president of france is years old and of hungarian and greek jewish descent he can make history and carve out a new role for france in the world by moving fast to meet his countrymens expectations of a new direction the window of opportunity for any new leader to bring change never stays open long even before yesterdays runoff trade unions and the socialists threatened street violence and strikes at any hint of serious reform the biggest risk for mr sarkozy and france would be to hesitate fortunately patience and a reluctance to ruffle feathers arent his vices during the campaign mr sarkozy introduced to france the discourse of the possible many european countries denmark sweden ireland the u k have "full employment " he has noted why cant france the french used to work hard he says often but the hour workweek made them lazy and sent the best and brightest looking for a better life in new york or london the new presidents biggest challenge will be to focus his campaign motto to "rehabilitate work authority respect meritocracy" into a governing agenda to that end his plans to loosen labor regulations cut the size of the state and the tax burden and overhaul pensions would seem the more pressing task than his call for a new push on the kyoto treaty by proving that free market policies yield results mr sarkozy can reconcile the french to the idea that growth isnt an "anglo saxon" plot to destroy their comfy lives europe and the u s have a lot riding on the new presidents success without putting frances domestic house in better order mr sarkozy cant claim a strong leadership role in europe and create better relations with washington mr sarkozy a vocal anti anti american brings the promise of closer trans atlantic links speaking to americans in his victory speech last night he declared "you can count on our friendship " it was an unusual statement for a french victor frances new president isnt always ideologically consistent though friendly to business he proudly calls himself "a protectionist" on trade and industrial policy during the campaign he turned hedge funds turkey and immigrants into useful bogeymen perhaps as his aides suggest this is what it takes to win in france even so the french voters in their wisdom couldnt have come up with a more different man to replace president jacques chirac mr sarkozy brings energy youth and daring to the elysee better buckle up for the ride
