monthly mutual funds review fund fiend when up is down lessons from a rally in fund firm stocks big investors are gaga for shares of money management companies consequently mutual fund investors should take their return expectations down a notch money management stocks averaged a a year gain over the past three years according to researcher morningstar inc that compares with for the dow jones industrial average and about for the average u s stock mutual fund u s stocks and bonds are on pace for their fifth straight year of gains and u s bonds have an even longer streak going but "if past is prologue its reasonable to rethink what you should expect from the markets given the arc these money management stocks have been on " says jeff ptak a stock analyst at morningstar "the phrase buyer beware seems warranted " the reason history shows investors often get most excited about fund management stocks when a market rally is a little long in the tooth in an extreme example the group averaged a gain in just as the stock market was starting a three year dive mr ptak notes that broadly low valuations for money management stocks tend to coincide with attractive times to invest in stocks and vice versa today the vast majority of the money managers he and his colleagues cover trade above their estimates of fair value it would be wrong for mutual fund holders to assume this alone means were on the precipice of a steep drop but perhaps wrong to get greedy with expectations too there are of course other takeaways for small investors from the run up for the money management group some will no doubt raise the old adage that small investors might be better off buying shares of fund companies than the funds they offer after all the money management business model is remarkably clever in many cases it doesnt take that much more staff to manage &# million than it does to run &# billion so revenue tends to grow a lot faster than costs steady cash from savers plunking more money into their accounts each month no matter what the market does is another big plus but most of us opt for mutual funds because we dont have the time or talent to pick stocks and for all of their plusses money manager stocks are pretty volatile at times a more reasonable conclusion for fund investors is that many money managers are making a lot of money so fund directors should think about inching down fees overall mutual funds are a good deal but those at the high end of the fee scale could be a better one mr mcdonald is a staff reporter in the wall street journals london bureau he can be reached at ian mcdonald wsj com
