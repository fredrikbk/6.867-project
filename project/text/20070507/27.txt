jr a large shareholder warned that the proposed sale would imperil the "unique news quality and integrity" of the journal and other dow jones publications mr ottaway accused news corp of putting its business interests and political biases before editorial principle "when rupert murdochs business and news interests conflict his business interests usually prevail " mr ottaway wrote "rupert murdoch comes from a very different tradition of australian british media ownership and editorial practice in which he has for a long time expressed his personal political and business biases through his newspapers and television channels " he added "we see this every day here in america in his new york post which regularly runs biased news stories and headlines supporting his friends political candidates and public policies and attacks people he personally opposes " news corp rejected mr ottaways criticism "were disappointed in mr ottaways comments which unfortunately are based on tired misconceptions and cliches " a news corp spokesman said "the company would be happy to meet with mr ottaway to share with him how we will enhance the journalistic independence and integrity of dow jones while reinvesting in its properties to help it achieve its greatest potential " in an interview mr ottaway said he saw no point in meeting with him to discuss the matter he added that he would consider other offers if the bancroft family decided to sell to another bidder peter kann the former chief executive officer and chairman of dow jones who retired last month as chairman also said he supported the continued independence of the company "i admire so many of the bancroft family members and also the ottaway family for taking the position of maintaining dow jones as an independent public company " said mr kann "and thereby ensuring the continued integrity and independence of its journalism and the continued pursuit of its public service mission " mr kann a former pulitzer prize winning reporter who presided over the company from to is believed to hold influence over many family members who supported him for years when the companys stock price languished mr kann and his wife

passionate about journalistic issues serving on several organizations devoted to protecting press freedoms he said he decided to publicly voice his opposition because unlike many of the bancrofts and others with close ties to the company securities regulations dont prevent him from speaking "i can speak my mind freely as an individual shareholder who is very concerned " he said most of the independent directors on dow joness board would support pursuing mr murdochs offer if it came to the board according to a person who has been involved in board meetings not all directors are enthusiastic about a sale but "it is hard to say no to that kind of a premium if youre a director " this person said chief executive rich zannino spoke in a recent board meeting about the deals advantages and downsides said a person who attended mr zannino has instituted a number of dramatic changes since he took over as ceo of dow jones including replacing much of the companys top management redesigning the wall street journal and making acquisitions in the digital arena but those moves have done little for dow joness stock price as a result mr zannino sees little possibility of getting dow joness stock to &# through any measure other than a sale of the company this person said messrs zannino and murdoch met for breakfast shortly before the &# a share written offer was made by mr murdoch according to a person briefed on the discussions the two had met prior to that meeting this person said mr zannino declined to comment separately investor warren buffett suggested at the berkshire hathaway annual meeting in omaha neb yesterday that he didnt plan to buy any more newspapers he owns the buffalo news and that he thought dow jones might attract other offers from bidders who are interested in the prestige and clout conferred by owning the wall street journal and affiliated publications in his statement mr ottaway specifically questioned whether the journals critical coverage of china which has won two pulitzer prizes for the paper in recent years would be tolerated under ownership by news corp the media giant has extensive business holdings there but has moved to placate government interests in recent years in the s mr murdoch pulled the british broadcasting corp from his satellite service star tv making the channel more palatable to the beijing government he sold the south china morning post to a pro beijing businessman and at his behest news corp s harpercollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of hong kong
