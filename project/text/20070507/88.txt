sarkozy elected french president by solid margin conservative receives mandate for tough steps to revitalize economy paris french voters elected nicolas sarkozy as president yesterday giving france a leader who has pledged to force through economic and social changes in a country fast becoming the sick man of europe with a to victory over socialist rival segolene royal in the final tally the conservative mr sarkozy won a mandate for his proposals to slash frances bloated state bureaucracy keep immigration in check and free business from rigid labor laws he hopes to reduce a jobless rate of around among europes highest the new presidents ambitious agenda will pit him against deeply entrenched special interests in france though mr sarkozys ump party is likely to lead in parliamentary elections next month he will need every bit of political legitimacy he can muster to make good on his pledges mr sarkozys success or failure will have big implications for the european union and beyond frances reluctance to embrace an increasingly global economy has helped block major eu initiatives such as adopting a constitution it has also been an obstacle in the pursuit of a world trade deal the year old son of a hungarian immigrant mr sarkozy is one of a new generation of leaders sweeping to power across europe who werent embroiled in the bruising debate between the u s and its allies over the invasion of iraq the bad blood stemming from the split over the u s led invasion which has been a lingering obstacle to cooperation with the u s and within the eu has nearly dissipated just as the u s and europe face crucial decisions such as how to deal with irans nuclear ambitions british prime minister tony blair who supported the invasion is the eus last remaining major leader who took part in the rupture mr blair is expected to announce his resignation this week last night mr sarkozy was quick to signal that he would be as tough in the foreign affairs arena as on the domestic front "france will always be by the u s s side when it needs her " he said in his victory speech but in the same breath he also warned washington "not to block the fight against global warming " the new leaders social and economic prescription for france could stir up trouble particularly among unions and others who benefit the most from frances longstanding system of social entitlements and among the countrys restive immigrants who see mr sarkozy as part of their problems as frances interior minister mr sarkozy introduced stricter immigration laws that led to the deportation of tens of thousands of immigrants hours after mr sarkozys victory was announced and while thousands of supporters celebrated his election with music and dancing at a huge street party in central paris riot police fired tear gas to disperse a rowdy crowd of youths protesting his win on the other side of the city "mr sarkozy can use political credit to win over labor unions and push through some changes " said nicolas sobczak an economist with goldman sachs in paris "but there is a risk of another jacques chirac someone who pulls back in the face of social resistance or makes so many concessions that initial good ideas are watered down " mr sobczak added referring to frances outgoing president last year mr chirac retracted a law aimed at making it easier to hire and fire young people in france after students and unions took to the streets in protest frances poor largely muslim suburbs which erupted into violent rioting months ago are still simmering with tensions "sarkozy will turn people against each other " said antoine ahmed a second generation immigrant from morocco who runs a bar in northern paris and is a supporter of ms royal mr sarkozy with his penchant for blunt messages like "love france or leave it " and "stop with your excuses " hasnt done much to reduce the potential for friction even close aides warn him to be prudent "you will inherit a france made of crystal you need to handle it with care " said former conservative prime minister jean pierre raffarin in a recent book written in the form of a letter to mr sarkozy the eu is also in a fragile state after a period of dramatic initiatives including its enlargement to include new countries and the introduction of a common currency the blocs progress has been stalled since france a founding member vetoed adoption of an eu constitution in a may referendum frances rejection of the constitution was widely interpreted as a protest against eu measures that threaten to open it up to global competition including low cost immigrant labor from elsewhere in the expanding bloc france has also blocked negotiations for a new european budget as a substitute for the aborted constitution mr sarkozy wants to rally europe around a simplified eu treaty that would require among other things that the bloc have an elected president and foreign affairs minister he has promised to travel to berlin and brussels within two weeks of taking office to press his case "if he pulls that off with german chancellor angela merkel he will have pulled off quite a coup in terms of putting the heart back into europe and making it beat again " said francois heisbourg chairman of the international institute for strategic studies a london based think tank but mr sarkozy is likely to ask for steep concessions though he has toned down his attacks on the european central bank which sets monetary policy for the eu states including france that share the common currency mr sarkozy wants national finance ministers to have influence over exchange rates he also supports state intervention to keep frances champions of industry in french hands and he says the eu should be entitled to erect trade barriers if necessary to fend off cheap imports and protect some of its industries france with mr sarkozy in the forefront has also taken a lead in opposing turkeys prospective membership in the eu largely due to fears of giving more than million turks the right to work throughout europe expanding the bloc requires unanimous agreement mr sarkozys quest for frances highest office started more than years ago conservative lawmaker patrick balkany says mr sarkozy divulged his presidential ambitions in as the two men drove through paris in a peugeot sedan mr sarkozy was a year old law student at the time and would hold his first political rally the following year in he became mayor of a paris suburb and two decades later took over the center right rpr party now called ump on the campaign trail mr sarkozy has attacked the worker and student protests of claiming they bred a generation of laziness and dilapidated social values he has called for france to become a country of hard working homeowners where people get up early and children rise when teachers enter the classroom his opponent ms royal offered a vastly different vision of french society the year old mother of four ran on a platform of social issues including tougher penalties for domestic violence and better schools however largely due to the more left wing factions of her party ms royal failed to rally centrist voters ms royals defeat could plunge frances socialists into ideological and leadership limbo unlike its left leaning equivalents across europe the party hasnt morphed into a social democrat movement that balances the pursuit of a dynamic economy with generous social welfare entitlements french socialists are still driven by a strong anti free market current mr sarkozy aides say he will push through a raft of measures in the first six months of office according to mr sobczak the goldman sachs economist the president is likely to focus on boosting consumer spending and demand for real estate "this will help fuel frances economy for a few months until other more fundamental measures start to produce effects " he said a key measure of mr sarkozys is to loosen frances legislated hour workweek by giving tax breaks to companies who let their employees work longer hours at a higher salary the proposal has received mixed reviews from economists however who say the tax breaks could be too costly for the state mr sarkozy has also promised to provide more unemployment benefits for workers who have lost their jobs but he will take those advantages away from people who refuse a new job that comes their way the measure is aimed at making frances labor market more flexible patrick artus chief economist at ixis cib bank says that proposal added to tax breaks and higher education spending will inevitably jeopardize mr sarkozys plans to balance frances budget which has been in deficit since efforts to improve state finances could also come up against widespread popular resistance in particular a proposal to align the pensions of civil servants energy sector and railway workers on a less generous nationwide pay as you go scheme could lead to widespread strikes "most people go work for the railways because they want a guaranteed employment and a pension " said michel verges who has been working at frances state railway system for the past quarter century "if you take that away a clash is inevitable " marie valla and leila abboud contributed to this article
