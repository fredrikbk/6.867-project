in futures trade new york battles chicago in response to your april editorial "the future of futures " i support your contentions and note that the futures industry association fia in two recent blasts against a proposed merger between the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade does not speak for our industry as they claim to do letters to the editor april as the ceo of one of the nations largest retail futures brokerage firms it is my strong belief that the cme cbot merger would provide many benefits to the customers we serve from hundreds of offices in some countries and this merger is a necessity for chicago to remain competitive in a global market when the deal was first proposed last year i speculated in sfo magazine that the justice department might become a tool for those interested in scuttling this deal perhaps with an anti trust lawsuit i believed then and now that the biggest threat probably came from the new york investment banks whose representatives make up the great majority of the board of the fia these institutions have a history of trying to ward off competition from chicago the securities industry lobbied successfully against sensible rules for single stock futures rules that would make the new product attractive to trade by hampering its potential popularity they protected their markets from chicago exchanges competition now in its probe of the cme group merger justice seems to be reacting to the fias lobbying as the fia decries that by concentrating significant power in chicago the combination of the worlds two largest and most successful futures exchanges might reduce competition or raise the barrier to entry for new competitors the fia does not represent the best interests of the futures industry with this stand nor in general the association purports to be an advocate for all futures firms but its board is dominated by the big new york investment banks and the global wire houses the organization had its roots in new york where it was founded in and it has always given short shrift to chicago the home of the u s futures industry it has been unwilling to include retail brokerage firms and ctas in its strategic planning and in setting its agenda a powerful merged exchange in chicago will be an enormous threat to the fias supremacy as a lobbying power in washington and as a player in the industry the new york investment banks have held sway over government for many years and the chicago exchanges have had to fight tooth and nail to keep these banks from stepping on their toes the cme cbot merger presents enormous benefits for futures customers and in turn the firms with whom they trade customers will have access to a wide range of products on one trading platform this is increasingly necessary as more and more individual traders branch out in adding more products to their portfolios even fia acknowledges the merger could bring cost savings and operational efficiencies to firms and their customers i disagree that the merger will "substantially" lessen competition between u s exchanges any disadvantage to smaller or newer exchanges will probably be about the same under a merged cme entity separately the two exchanges held relative monopolies in the products they traded because each exchange was home to the liquidity in those products i do not believe an exchange can be a monopoly but that it can control virtually all of the trading in a given product if it provides the liquidity it is a well known fact that it is quite difficult for any exchange or a copycat product to compete with established liquidity the cme cbot merger will increase international competition in derivatives markets and make the u s a stronger participant in that competition russell r wasendorf chairman and ceo peregrine financial group chicago
