small business link shopping out it gets more complex costs and competency of in house operations often are the deciding factors for small companies what technology should you outsource thats a question small companies increasingly face as information technology becomes more complex and crucial and in house expertise falls further and further behind "that one it person cannot be an expert in business applications security storage and backup " says sanjeev aggarwal vice president of it infrastructure solutions for ami partners a new york based technology research and consulting firm what gets shopped out often depends on what it functions a company is both willing and able to handle on its own and what is most cost effective according to ami partners small businesses use outsourcing primarily for virus protection email messaging accounting financials payroll and online data storage backup atlantic bay mortgage group llc a virginia beach va mortgage lender offers a vivid example of how outsourcing decisions rest primarily on costs and competency when atlantic bay was founded in by brian holland the mortgage broker sought outside tech help on an as needed basis using local it contractors hired by the hour to install printers that strategy worked for a while but the firm soon discovered that doing most it functions internally couldnt keep pace with the evolving paperless mortgage industry and the companys own fast growth between and today atlantic bay has grown from one employee and one branch to employees and branches its web site has gone from being a static information page to an e commerce site that processes loan applications so when doug turpin took over as information and technology director for the firm in he focused on certain areas that he felt needed to be outsourced web hosting and development software development the maintenance of secure networks between branches and the management of internet connections he began doing research online at web forums and news sites and attended a few it conferences to learn about the latest and best software and vendors "its easy for any company to get into the mind set to bring a person in as a dedicated it employee and you put them to work at that " says mr turpin but "atlantic bay is a mortgage banker were not a web developer or a software developer " in the broadest sense mr turpin says deciding what it tasks to outsource and what to keep in house comes down to whether the work lies within the it staffs main areas of strength such as desktop support and installation and whether that it function is needed on a regular basis "if its not in our core competency " he says "then that function can be outsourced " for example installing secure links between office branches usually occurs only once every three or six months when new branches are brought into the system so mr turpin says its easier to just shop out those functions similarly when the firm rolled out an update to its loan processing software last year it relied on an outside vendor byte software of kirkland wash a unit of cbcinnovis co to install the new system and train staff at atlantic bays different branches the company decided on this approach because the vendor had more knowledge and experience with the application than its it staff had of course cost also is a factor in determining what to shop out "in a lot of cases " mr turpin says "outsourcing is budget determined " for example the company looked to nettek llc a technology firm in norfolk va for programming work when it needed a specialized application created to transfer customer loan information securely over the web hiring a software developer with the skill level necessary to complete the project would have meant a yearly salary of about &# instead mr turpin used an outsourcing payment arrangement called block hours in which he bought hours of nettek time for a rate of &# an hour he met with netteks project manager and developer for about an hour mr turpin says he knew exactly what he wanted the application to look like and the functions he wanted it to do other than that the software developer had free rein to design the application the project took just a couple of weeks to complete and cost &# another outsourcing vendor atlantic bay has hired is planet com internet services inc a houston based web hosting data center that caters to small and midsize businesses mr turpin says it made sense to outsource its web hosting because atlantic bay doesnt have the infrastructure or resources to build its own hour data center and acquiring them would be cost prohibitive while atlantic bay has figured out a strategy that works for the mortgage company it acknowledges that outsourcing can be a moving target when the company was updating its main loan processing software back in a vendor handled training the companys sales staff mr turpin figured the vendor had a better handle on the application and how to teach it but atlantic bays salespeople told him that some of the more general training lessons were a waste of time when they didnt relate to what they do day to day so after about five months with the software mr turpin split the training the vendor would cover the basics mostly for new sales employees and advanced training would be taken in house taught by his it staff in smaller sessions once or twice a month the result he says has made salespeople more efficient and better able to serve customers not every it function is up for discussion when it comes to outsourcing however mr turpin says he refuses to outsource desktop support because his four person it staff knows the hardware and software the mortgage industry and how its sales staff uses the technology most tech problems can be solved in less than five minutes he says
