monthly mutual funds review a changing story how funds vote your shares running the ballot box becomes prestige job wall of shame photos her reaction wasnt unusual back then the general sentiment was that voting in corporate elections for things such as directors or bylaw changes was something of an empty ritual with little impact on a companys financial performance or stock price while most investment firms cast ballots because it was their fiduciary duty fund managers routinely voted according to managements recommendations and many didnt think it was even worthwhile to read the bulky proxy statement companies dispatched before annual meetings fast forward to the proxy voting committee which sets t rowes policies on corporate voting on behalf of mutual fund shareholders has become one of the firms highest profile assignments as co chairman since ms dopkin plays a key role in deciding how t rowe price which manages &# billion casts votes each spring at the thousands of companies in which it invests the journey of ms dopkin whose main job at t rowe is co director of equity research shows how proxy voting in the mutual fund world has morphed from a mundane administrative task to a tool increasingly used to challenge management traditionally passive mutual funds are increasingly wielding their power as shareholders to force changes they think could bolster financial results this year for example t rowe for the first time since publicly opposed merger and acquisition plans at two companies where it has significant ownership "six or seven years ago it wasnt considered a prime assignment and it was hard to convince people to be part of the formal process " says bill stromberg t rowes head of equities and a former chairman of the proxy voting committee "now everyone views this as front and center and important for the firm " in a group of three people handled t rowes voting ensuring that proxy ballots were filed on time and that on the rare occasion a portfolio manager wanted to oppose a management recommendation he justified his stance in writing today a highly structured committee of employees from around the globe sets t rowes voting policies at more than companies internationally fund managers still have a say in how votes are cast but the voting policy set by the committee annually is the default position one measure of how t rowe prices proxy voting system has changed can be seen in a binder that ms dopkin and darrell n braman associate counsel in the legal department and the committees other co chairman presented to the panel in early january it summarized proxy issues and measured inches thick as recently as the binder was less than half that size which indicates that the number and complexity of the issues being considered has grown substantially data show that t rowe supports shareholder resolutions more often than many of its peers last year the firm voted in favor of shareholder resolutions of the time compared with the industry average of according to data collected by corporate library a research firm in portland ore ms dopkin is low key preferring to highlight the role other people in the organization have played in revamping t rowes proxy voting but she is opinionated about what makes a company a good investment lessons she learned while managing a financial services specialty stock fund and a broader stock fund for t rowe she dislikes rock star executives for example because she believes they put their own interests ahead of the companys she has created a "wall of shame" in her office in which she displays pictures of fallen executives such as jailed former tyco international ltd chief executive officer l dennis kozlowski who was convicted in of looting the conglomerate he is appealing in general ms dopkin says the executives who merit space on her wall are "motivated by something that just seems so personal as opposed to the best interest of the corporation " in that vein ms dopkin will advocate withholding votes for directors responsible for pay packages she considers excessive last year contrary to many other mutual funds t rowe withheld votes for most of the directors of retailer home depot inc to protest ceo robert nardellis compensation package which included forgiveness of a &# million loan and an employment contract that provided for guaranteed annual bonuses mr nardelli resigned in january the process for this springs proxy voting season began in december when ms dopkin years old and mr braman met with proxy advisory firm institutional shareholder services of rockville md to discuss what new issues might emerge iss told the duo they likely would see more proposals asking that stockholders be given an advisory vote on executive compensation such proposals often dubbed "say on pay " were submitted at a handful of companies last year and they garnered as much as of the votes cast at some firms due in large part to that success shareholders submitted similar proposals at dozens of companies this year including citigroup inc coca cola co and time warner inc among the other proxy issues iss indicated might crop up this year were disclosure of political contributions and ties between company executives and consultants that advise boards on executive pay after the meeting ms dopkin and mr braman analyzed about matters and presented a recommendation to the full committee a handful of new items came up after the committee meeting and they assessed those too ms dopkin and mr braman recommended t rowe should support shareholders say on pay resolutions the committee agreed and t rowes policy was amended to support such proposals "were not in favor of allowing shareholders to set the compensation but we are in favor of letting shareholders have a voice " says mr braman "if they feel executive comp is too high they should be able to express that to the board " responsibility for casting the votes remains with the portfolio managers aided by research analysts portfolio managers are allowed to override the firms voting policy fewer than did so last year when issues crop up that arent covered by the policy such as whether to support proposals asking companies to reduce global warming portfolio managers look to iss for a recommendation any votes opposite t rowes policy have to be justified in writing and approved by ms dopkin and mr braman in the past any votes cast opposite the recommendations of company managers had to be justified in writing ms dopkin also is credited with playing a role in getting the firms research analysts more involved in the voting "she emails me on proxies all the time asking what do you think about this should we approve this options plan or not " says josh spencer a semiconductor analyst "she raises the consciousness so its not an automatic checking the box for management " among issues most important to ms dopkin corporate disclosure she says she has seen repeated instances in which companies that pulled back on the information they provided to investors subsequently suffered financial or other setbacks she generally supports shareholder proposals asking for greater disclosure and recommended to the committee that t rowe follow isss case by case voting guidelines on proposals requesting companies disclose their political contributions mainstream mutual funds tend to shun the issue because it has little to do with improving financial performance for ms dopkin though the logic is simple "ive never seen a case where less disclosure has been better for shareholders " ms whitehouse is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she can be reached at kaja whitehouse dowjones com
