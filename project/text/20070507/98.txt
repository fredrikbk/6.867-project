takeover boom drives stocks hurts bonds while the stock markets winning streak marches on some corporate debt investors are getting a little antsy about the outlook the dow jones industrial average hit a high almost every day last week and the standard &amp poors stock index of large stocks is closing in on a record in recent weeks however prices of some corporate bonds have been edging lower pushing their yields higher that is a sign that bond investors might be getting concerned about the economic outlook and the growing levels of debt that companies are taking on to finance buyouts and share repurchases "mergers and buybacks have given life to stocks but companies are stretching their balance sheets to push up valuations at the expense of debt investors " says edward marrinan a managing director of credit strategy at j p morgan chase in new york yields on most investment grade bonds now average which is percentage points higher than average treasury yields the gap between the yield on a corporate bond and a treasury bond is known as the spread such spreads are up from percentage point above treasury bonds in late february which means bond investors are demanding a little more for the risk of holding corporate debt corporate bond spreads have been hovering near historical lows for months investors have been so hungry to hold bonds that they have been willing to accept little additional yield compared with virtually riskless treasurys "whats good for stocks may not be good for bonds " says jeffrey rosenberg head of credit strategy at banc of america securities in new york stock prices have been moving higher in part because investors expect more takeovers share buybacks and dividend increases at many companies because these activities are often financed with corporate debt they could make bonds vulnerable to future defaults so far the rise in bond spreads has been small and appears to be limited to investment grade corporate bonds spreads on junk bonds have actually edged lower since early march and across the spectrum of corporate debt spreads are still close to their historical lows helped by low default rates and robust corporate profits these trends have left stocks relatively inexpensive when compared with bonds s&amp p stocks trade at around times the estimated next months of earnings a price earnings ratio that is comparable to levels last seen during the mid s there are many factors that should help stocks extend their gains corporations are beating quarterly profit forecasts and are buying back more shares recent employment and manufacturing data indicate the economy keeps growing albeit at a modest pace first quarter earnings are up on average for the companies in the s&amp p index that have reported their results so far according to thomson financial that exceeds the rise that analysts forecast in early april though it is off the pace of earnings growth during last week the broad based s&amp p climbed above the mark for the first time since september it rose for the week to and it is just points shy of its record close of in march it is up so far this year the dow jones industrial average set more records ending last week up to it has gained in the year to date the tech stock heavy nasdaq composite index rose for the week to while the russell index of small stocks rose to "the stock market keeps going up yet its earnings multiple keeps going down so in some sense stocks are getting cheaper " says james paulsen chief investment strategist at wells capital management as stocks are still viewed as relatively inexpensive the trend of mergers leveraged buyouts and stock repurchases is widely expected to continue takeover offers last week for cablevision systems and dow jones the publisher of the wall street journal were at significant premiums to their market values underscoring the view that other stocks could move higher when companies take on more debt to pay for acquisitions or share buybacks holders of investment grade corporate bonds have often been on the losing end because the deals are financed with more debt such bonds were traditionally seen as safe investments they are typically issued by large and financially strong firms with clean balance sheets these days companies that have little debt such as first data and harman international industries are often targets for private equity firms that are looking to buy companies that can handle higher debt loads to pre empt takeovers and to placate their shareholders a number of companies nowadays are taking on debt or are doling out cash to their shareholders in order to boost stock values these moves tend to push down bond prices because larger debt loads make the bonds more prone to default many investment grade bonds have seen their ratings cut to "junk" as a result of such activities leading other holders of such bonds to take on a more cautious stance gregory peters a strategist at morgan stanley says the shift in bond investors sentiment is notable but it isnt suggesting a credit downturn is near its more likely a reflection "that the cycle may have peaked " he says
