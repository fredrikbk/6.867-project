scrambling to find ways that they are like harry truman says newsweeks evan thomas while mr truman left the presidency in under the twin clouds of corruption scandals and stalemate in the korean war he has since become the archetype of a plain spoken politician who "made the tough calls often courageously and history has rewarded him for it " his policy of containing the spread of communism unpopular at the time was borne out by history regarded as a "machine pol and a hack" before he became president once he arrived in the oval office he showed he was willing to risk his political career in order to do the right thing "buffeted by war unhappy with president bush many americans democratic republican independent seem hungry for a trumanesque figure a truth telling bare knuckled president who will give it to us straight " writes mr thomas thus while pushing a new health care plan barack obama invokes mr trumans boldness that made him the first u s politician to call for universal health care rudy giuliani praises him for standing up to the soviets in the late s hillary clinton invokes mr trumans catchphrase "the buck stops here" while calling for better treatment of wounded veterans how do the candidates measure up to mr trumans gold standard of modern political courage all of them have taken personal and political risks says mr thomas but it is almost impossible for voters to distinguish between genuine political courage and poll driven posturing until the candidate takes power of course mr thomas points out that political courage is only worthwhile if it

right balance " writes mr surowiecki "insuring that entrepreneurs and investors get sufficient rewards while also maximizing the well being of consumers " the balance struck by the u s isnt necessarily the right one for developing countries josh lerner a professor at harvard business school found in a historical survey of patent laws that stronger ones had less impact on innovation in developing countries than in developed ones furthermore developing countries have more to gain than richer countries from shorter patent laws which would accelerate "the spread of new technology and the diffusion of ideas " says mr surowiecki given the different challenges that developing and developed countries face he adds "a diverse range of intellectual property rules makes more sense " the u s government cites these kinds of benefits when arguing that free trade requires countries to tolerate each others differing labor regulations but when it comes to intellectual property the u s takes the opposite approach it insists "on a one size fits all approach stronger rules are better " by contrast in its early days the u s benefited from a lax intellectual property regime with the textile
