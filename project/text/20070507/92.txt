thai flu moves south patents are only worth the paper theyre printed on unless governments protect them so when thailand browbeat abbott laboratories into dropping its prices for an hiv aids drug last month by threatening to break its patent with nearly no international repercussions we were alarmed now theres reason to be downright worried on friday brazil declared it would seize the patent for mercks hiv aids drug efavirenz its the first time brazil has seized a patent and its a slap in the face of the world trade organization and the market system for drug innovation wto rules allow countries to seize drug patents in times of "national emergency" or for "public non commercial use " but president lula da silva announced the patent expropriation on friday after price negotiations broke down did brazils hiv aids problem suddenly turn into an epidemic overnight or did lula just not like mercks terms a discount off the market price perhaps he was thinking instead of brazils huge generic drug industry which could commercially benefit from a free invention and a big domestic market for selling it this is a dangerous game pharmaceutical companies cant afford to develop new drugs if they cant charge market prices for their existing products drug innovation is a risky business and companies wont be willing to sink hundreds of millions of dollars into research and development especially on diseases that affect the poor and sick in developing countries if they fear their intellectual property will be stolen the strongest pushback that washington has mustered so far is to put thailand on its watchlist for intellectual property violations the world health organizations margaret chan has tiptoed around the topic without vigorous resistance at next weeks who meeting in geneva more countries could soon follow the thai and brazilian examples that would be bad for intellectual property rights world wide and it would be a disaster for the worlds poor see related letter "letters to the editor thailands compulsory drug licensing" wsj may
