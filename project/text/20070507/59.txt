monthly mutual funds review mixing it up ratcheting down small stock exposure bets on semiconductor and biotechnology industries japans economy and rapidly expanding u s companies these are parts of a strategy recommended by accredited investors inc a fee only financial planning firm for wealthy individuals in this column we ask prominent financial advisers who use mutual funds and exchange traded funds to share their model asset allocations for certain kinds of investors accredited investors based in edina minn was founded in by ross levin who is a past chairman of what is now the financial planning association one of the nations biggest membership groups for financial advisers the firm has about &# million under management accredited investors investment philosophy is based on the belief that over long periods of time most asset classes will perform similarly so if a particular class of investments is too cheap the firm will bet on it because it eventually must revert back to mean mr levin says the firms moderate risk portfolio for an investor with a three to five year horizon aims to earn at least percentage points above the inflation rate at a risk level that is lower than that of a portfolio split between the big company standard &amp poors stock index and the broad lehman brothers u s aggregate bond index the firm doesnt disclose a return history for its model portfolios mr levin says the firm chooses not to advertise its performance and published performance numbers would be considered advertising the firms advisers may replace up to a fourth of the funds in the portfolio in a year one reason is quarterly rebalancing which could result in a fund or asset class being removed or added if the team feels it is too expensive or has become cheap "if a category has performed very well well peel back from that category into the one that hasnt done well " mr levin says another reason is tax management the advisers often sell funds that have lost money to harvest a tax loss which can be used to reduce future capital gains exposure mr levin and his team create financial plans that take into account any investments that clients have when they sign up so different clients may have different portfolios here is the strategy u s stocks accredited investors advises holding about of the portfolio in u s stocks divided among small midsize and large companies the advisers often use index based funds or exchange traded funds which are similar to mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks themselves to execute their strategies they like funds that mimic indexes because they have lower expenses and dont carry the risk of manager underperformance if using a fund run by a stock picker they usually buy cheaper institutional share classes toward the end of the firm added to clients large stock fund exposure and cut back on funds focused on small stocks which the firms analysts think are becoming more expensive by the end of the firm removed all allocation to micro cap funds those targeting shares of companies whose market capitalization is less than &# million due to what they considered a lack of good buys after a strong run for the category in the large stock area analysts are skewing toward funds that invest in "growth" stocks which they believe are cheap growth stocks are those of companies whose earnings are expanding rapidly the portfolio has a allocation to midsize stock funds which is in large part a bet on two sectors that the advisers feel are mispriced biotechnology and semiconductors to place the bets they advise buying ishares nasdaq biotechnology etf and spdr s&amp p semiconductor etf international stocks the portfolios allocation to international stocks ranges from to the firm recently reduced the allocation to about from last year as a lot of mutual fund money went into international funds concern mounted that "this stuffs going to get overheated " accredited investors analyst jacob wolkowitz says they were particularly worried about asia excluding japan and reduced the recommended allocation to t rowe price asia fund by half over the past two years accredited investors however is making a long term bet on japan it has put clients including those in the moderate risk camp in a japan focused fund since the advisers believe the japanese economy will benefit from continuing structural reforms interest rate policies and overall growth in asia bonds given uncertainty about the direction of u s interest rates coupled with the meager risk premium in the bond markets "we just think its a really hard market to figure out " mr levin says the moderate risk clients are holding about in cash and certificates of deposits of one to two year maturities they have been buying the cds since the second quarter of last year the remaining of the moderate risk portfolio is in bond funds the advisers sold out of funds that specialize in riskier high yield or junk bonds in because they felt the asset class wasnt giving adequate returns to compensate for the risks "if were not being paid for the risk " mr wolkowitz says "why take it " they believe the u s dollar is likely to fall further and since last year have invested clients money in a bond fund that has exposure to foreign bonds and currencies pimco foreign bond fund unhedged the core bond holding loomis sayles bond fund has some exposure to junk bonds and developing market bonds other assets the advisers believe commodities can provide diversification but are steering clear of the sector for now because they feel that some of the indexes are too concentrated on the energy sector the portfolio has held funds that invest in gold and real estate in the past but not in the past two years "we think theyre just not good value "
