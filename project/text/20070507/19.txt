boomers good life tied to better life for immigrants the quality of life for some million graying baby boomers in the u s may depend in large part on the fortunes of another high profile demographic group millions of mostly hispanic immigrants and their children with a major part of the nations population entering its retirement years and birth rates falling domestically the shortfall in the work force will be filled by immigrants and their offspring experts say how that group fares economically in the years ahead could have a big impact on everything from the kind of medical services baby boomers receive to the prices they can get for their homes immigrants and baby boomers are two groups whose destinies are converging in the next years " says dowell myers a demographer at the university of southern california "baby boomers will surrender their economic role to this generation of immigrants and their children " who will evolve into a critical pool of laborers and taxpayers he says prof myers author of the recent book "immigrants and boomers forging a new social contract for the future of america " is among a crop of academics studying the link between the giant generation born between and and newcomers to the u s mainly latin american immigrants the u s is undergoing a seismic demographic change that will kick in over the next decade or so in california for example there were million baby boomers between the ages of and in who accounted for of the prime working age population by they will be to years old with most boomers on the brink of retirement or about to plunge into it the weight of this aging population will swell relative to the pool of working age people the ratio of senior citizens to prime working age people to years old will jump in the decade between and and an additional in the following decade according to prof myers all told the ratio of seniors to working age residents including immigrants will grow from seniors per working age people in to per in he calculates this hefty burden will be hard for the economy to absorb and will require some difficult choices those may include tax increases benefit cuts for seniors increases in the taxable income of working age residents as well as efforts to attract more immigrants to fill out the work force at a hearing on new yorks ellis island last month prof myers told congressional leaders that the current influx of immigrants about million annually is softening the impact of the bulging population of seniors relative to working age adults by about a quarter from what it would be without immigration boosting immigration would relieve more pressure he and other experts say but given the nations polarizing debate over illegal immigration the u s is unlikely to implement policies to attract many newcomers in the near future that suggests that one of the countrys most pressing tasks may be improving the earnings prospects of its youngsters especially latino youth who will have to carry much of the financial burden for the supersize boomer generation one of the challenges is that americans dont seem to be aware of the vital role the next generation will play the predominantly white senior citizens and boomers who account for the majority of the nations decision makers often vote against measures to boost services or raise taxes for schools increasingly populated by hispanics thats a problem because better education is the ticket to prosperity for those on whose tax dollars boomers will rely ron crouch director of kentuckys state data center at the university of louisville makes about presentations a year to groups including educators high tech industry leaders and government officials to paint a picture of what the u s will look like as an aging white population converges with a growing population of immigrants and minority youth "if im an old white person i better be interested in how these young hispanic kids are doing " mr crouch told an audience attending the national school board association conference in san francisco last month between and blacks and hispanics including immigrants accounted for of all population growth in the u s they accounted for all the population growth among those and younger according to the census bureau that represents both the younger end of the current work force and the nations future labor pool this maturing younger population will need to be ready for opportunities far beyond the fields construction sites and nursing homes that employed many of their parents mr crouch says they will also need to be "architects business owners doctors and scientists " he says more broadly the u s economy needs enough skilled workers to stay competitive but current statistics bode ill for the future of the countrys youth and the aging generation whose fate is tied to theirs in georgia for example minorities accounted for two thirds of the population growth between and between and they represented of that growth yet only of black fourth grade students and of hispanic fourth graders are proficient in reading compared with of whites according to a report by the center for american progress a public policy think tank in california already a majority minority state of african american and of hispanic fourth graders are proficient in reading compared with of their white peers the achievement gap seen in elementary school is unlikely to close by the time most students enter high school down the road only slightly more than half of all blacks and hispanics graduate from high school in four years compared with of whites for baby boomers the economic status of the new generation will affect more than the kind of quality of services the government available it will also affect the value of a major asset for many boomers their homes prof myerss studies show a pattern of upward mobility into homeownership by immigrants and their children by four of the top surnames among home buyers nationwide were spanish up from only two in but young latinos will become the largest market for the homes of white boomers as the latter seek to downsize or cash out in the near future a less advantaged younger generation is less likely to be able to afford to pay top dollar for retirees homes "we need to cultivate new home buyers it requires moving more latino kids through high school and college " says prof myers "its not for the good of latinos its for the good of the nation "
