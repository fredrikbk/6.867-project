monthly mutual funds review a close race a surprising finish against sleek etf rivals top index mutual funds use ultra low costs to gain performance edge exchange traded funds are all the rage these days new funds are being offered at a rate that outpaces regular mutual funds total assets have more than doubled to some &# billion in less than three years but do etfs produce better returns for small investors than regular index funds newly crunched data show it is a close race but ultra low cost conventional index funds outperform etfs a lot more often than not a decade ago etfs were a speck on the investment landscape primarily a tool used by traders for institutional accounts now they are finding their way into the portfolios of mom and pop investors the two largest etf vendors barclays global investors a unit of britains barclays plc and boston based state street global advisors a unit of state street corp estimate that individual accounts hold roughly one half or more of u s etf investments under their management etfs are akin to index funds both aim to track the performance of various market indexes the most obvious difference etfs trade like regular shares on a stock exchange whereas mutual funds are priced just once a day when markets close at p m eastern time marketing materials claim another difference as well that etfs fees and expenses tend to be low and that they get hit by taxes less than conventional mutual funds do thanks to etfs complicated inner workings we decided to see how those advantages stood up in a head to head contest comparing returns of etfs with those of conventional index funds we asked research firm morningstar inc to crunch performance data back to for some of the biggest and best known etfs and index funds in each of four categories the standard &amp poors stock index the total u s stock market international stock markets and a broad based u s bond index these are the core areas for small investors trying to build a diversified portfolio we also examined after tax performance data that fund companies are required to disclose the conclusion big low cost index funds from boston based fidelity investments and vanguard group inc malvern pa outperformed the etfs in most of the comparisons we set up for the time periods studied the mutual funds prevailed in including a sweep of the one three and year after tax categories to their credit etfs sold by barclays and state street almost always beat the average performance of index mutual funds in their respective categories but so did the big low cost index funds average returns for each category were calculated by looking at all of the index funds in morningstars database not just those considered in this contest the results of our comparison seem surprising because of the etfs heavily promoted tax advantages just one etf vanguard total stock market etf made it into our after tax winners circle in a tie with two index funds for the best five year annualized result index mutual funds remained dominant even when returns were calculated without an index funds elite share classes which carry lower fees than non elite shares conventional funds still took about three quarters of the contests the margins of victory for the top performers in each of the four categories may seem small at first glance about percentage point in many years but compounded over time they are significant take an investor who has a nest egg of &# if that money is put into one of the lowest cost s&amp p funds the sum would turn into &# in years assuming a gross return each year in line with the broader markets historical average on the other hand if the fund returns a year the investor would end up with &# about &# less "little bits of performance make a big difference over time " says john bacci a linthicum md financial planner who uses sector etfs "thats the name of the game " the analysis also didnt take into account the commissions that etf investors have to pay to securities firms whenever they buy or sell fund shares a small amount but a cost nevertheless mutual fund investors who can frequently buy funds directly from fund companies dont need to pay such fees the lesson for small investors whatever structural differences etfs may have in the way of tax advantages other factors such as a funds expense ratio and management philosophy can be equally important in determining performance in the competitive index tracking business etfs do have low costs when judged against mutual funds across the board many of which have higher expenses because they employ a staff of analysts to pick stocks but a better comparison is with conventional index funds as we have done in this study while etfs are attractively priced top offerings from firms like vanguard and fidelity are often just as cheap if not more so in addition tactical moves by index fund managers can boost results while an index fund should in theory trail its benchmark by at least the amount of its expense ratio fund managers can reduce at least some of the cost through techniques such as lending out the funds underlying stocks for payments and buying stocks ahead of anticipated additions to their index the tax related advantages of etfs stem from their unique structure etfs are created when securities brokerages or specialists assemble baskets of stocks that match an etfs underlying index and exchange them with the fund for etf shares that the brokerages can either hold or sell to small investors these etf shares can be bought and sold any number of times without the underlying stocks they represent being touched when the brokerages opt to take etf shares off the market the fund hands over stock rather than cash this allows the etfs to avoid selling their underlying stocks to accomodate investor traffic by contrast conventional mutual fund managers frequently need to raise cash to pay departing investors those stock sales can lead to capital gains distributions and a tax bill for remaining fund investors still the tax advantage held by the etfs often proves less important than the way a fund is run "its not about the etf structure its the management " says jim wiandt editor of the journal of indexes an index investment industry publication mr wiandt calls the issue "an elephant in the room " given etfs growing popularity mr wiandt flagged the issue of etfs performance relative to low cost conventional funds in a study he published last year while it is impossible to tell which funds will outperform in the future his analysis concludes that discriminating investors should consider a funds "philosophy and execution" more than whether the fund is an etf while results boosting tactics are also available to managers of etfs conventional mutual funds may have a greater incentive to try to earn back a portion of their expenses etfs are owned by a broader range of investors than traditional mutual funds and are especially popular with traders at institutional accounts big investors often use them to make bearish "short selling" bets aiming to profit if an index falls or to hedge against other bets hence to the manager of an etf outperformance of all other index funds can take a backseat to predictability of the return barclays spokeswoman christine hudacko says her firms ishares customers both small investors and traders at institutional accounts expect an investment return in line with the respective indexs return minus fees and that is what the company aims to deliver "outperforming the index is not going to do any good for short sellers " she adds james ross senior managing director at state street global advisors which sells the s&amp p tracking etf standard &amp poors depositary receipts or spdr adds that index fund managers who aim to beat their benchmarks even by a little bit can be taking on additional risk while tactical moves may improve results one year they can just as easily backfire the next here are the results of our data crunching s&amp p funds the s&amp p is the main event of index fund comparisons both the &# billion vanguard index fund the largest index fund available to small investors and the &# billion spdr the largest etf track this big company benchmark the perennial winner in our contest vanguard it delivered the winning annual return dating back to with the exception of when spdr took the lead by posting the narrowest loss in the category vanguard s admiral share class which features a lower expense ratio than non elite vanguard shares outperformed all comers from to in it tied for first with the similar elite advantage class of fidelity spartan index each returned holders of vanguards admiral shares available to investors with more than &# in their vanguard fund account or who have held the account for years and have at least a &# balance benefited from the funds expense ratio of of assets the same as the spdr and ishares s&amp p index etf that is well below the average expense ratio that research firm lipper inc calculates for s&amp p index funds holders of vanguard investor class shares meanwhile generally investors with less than &# in their accounts had less to cheer about the investor class shares levy annual expenses of twice as much as the two etfs in our contest spdrs expense ratio of is down from in while that of vanguard investor shares hasnt budged in the vanguard investor class shares returned below both etfs for the third straight year in addition to compiling annual pretax returns we made fund comparisons on an after tax basis using data from the fund companies themselves the securities and exchange commission requires the companies to calculate and publish after tax returns for their funds assuming investors pay the highest applicable tax rate on dividend and capital gains distributions the upshot the s&amp p etfs still did worse overall etf tax advantages pertain by and large to capital gains not dividend distributions and as noted etfs almost never sell their funds underlying securities so capital gains taxes are rare but s&amp p index mutual funds are pretty efficient too they dont trade holdings as often as mutual funds run by stock pickers so they rarely distribute capital gains either over the past five years vanguard admiral shares have averaged a annual after tax return ahead of spdrs average annual return over years investor shares of the vanguard fund edged spdr although by only the thinnest of margins to total market funds funds tracking u s indexes broader than the s&amp p have gained popularity in recent years a problem in comparing them is that the biggest and best known dont all track the same indexes for instance fidelity spartan total stock market index tracks the dow jones wilshire while the ishares etf in this category tracks the russell that means the fidelity fund could at least in theory hold about names not included in the ishares offering with these shortcomings in mind heres the closest the category offers to a winner the fidelity spartan fund its investor share class outperformed peers on a pretax basis in four of the past nine years and was ahead in the first quarter of vanguard offers both a conventional index fund and an etf in this category between the two vanguard total stock market etf seems to have the upper hand outperforming both the investor and admiral class shares of the vanguard total stock market index in four of the five full years the etf has been on the market the vanguard etf returned on a pretax basis in the etf sports a lower expense ratio than its vanguard siblings compared with and for the index funds two share classes in after tax returns joining the vanguard etf in the three way tie for the best five year performance fidelity spartan total market index fund and the admiral shares of the vanguard index fund international funds the runaway winner in this category at first glance appeared to be vanguard total international stock index it beat the rivals in our data run from to topping the biggest etf in the category by more than two percentage points in up compared with ishares msci eafe indexs return but this is another apples to oranges comparison in that the vanguard index fund includes emerging markets stocks which have been on a tear over the past few years while the other leading funds in the category track the msci eafe index a benchmark of developed country stocks of these a share class of fidelity spartan international index claimed the winning spot in while a second vanguard fund vanguard developed markets index took top honors in and on the other hand ishares msci eafe index etf lost less than either of those two funds in the bear market of the average return of for the entire international category in beat the returns of all our eafe tracking entrants that year which may reflect that many among the larger group of funds used by morningstar to calculate the average follow benchmarks with emerging markets exposure u s bond funds barclays vanguard and fidelity all have funds that follow the lehman brothers u s aggregate index of bonds on an after tax basis fidelity u s bond index has the best average return for the past three years in its three year life ishares lehman aggregate bond etf has outperformed the morningstar category average twice but it trailed in the first quarter of it beat the vanguard offering during the first quarter but has failed to beat either vanguard total bond market index or fidelity u s bond index in any full year since its inception mr salisbury is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at ian salisbury dowjones com
