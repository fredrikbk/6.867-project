ask dow jones q how long do i need to save my income tax records l h glen allen va a i am a notorious pack rat just ask anyone who sits around me here at the wall street journals office in new york but even i agree you dont need to save all your tax returns and records forever here are a few guidelines in general be sure to save your federal returns and all supporting documents for at least three years from the returns original due date includingextensions to be on the safe side though i suggest saving everything for at least six or seven years why im ultraconservative when it comes to conserving but there are other reasons for example if you fail to report a substantial amount of taxable income the usual three year time limit on the irs wont apply check with your state tax department to see if it has any special rules if a federal return is "false or fraudulent with intent to evade tax " or if you dont file a return at all an action can generally be brought against you "at any time " the irs points out there are some documents you should keep for much longer periods of time be sure not to throw away any records showing what you paid for investments such as stocks bonds mutual funds or works of art that you still own you will need those records as evidence of what you paid when you eventually sell those items the same general rule applies to records on your home and other real estate keep good records on what you paid plus improvements if you pay someone else to do your taxes its probably a good idea to make copies of all your records and ask your professional to keep them for you that way youre covered in case you lose your records or they get destroyed in a fire or flood i realize its a nuisance to organize and store all this paper but if youre audited those papers will quickly become close friends tom hermans "tax report" appears wednesdays in the wall street journal send questions on finances investments or taxes to askdowjones sunday wsj com and include your name address and a daytime telephone number questions may be edited we regret that we cannot answer every letter
