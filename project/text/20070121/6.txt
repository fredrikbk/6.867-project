marketwatch cash out refinancing on the rise people looking to extract equity from their homes have increasingly been turning to cash out refinancing industry observers say a big reason that people are tapping their equity through refinancing comes down to dollars and cents according to amy crews cutts deputy chief economist with freddie mac because home equity loans and lines of credit are most often tied to the prime rate now at those options have gotten more expensive even as long term mortgage rates have remained relatively low with the year loan averaging about "its all about the prime rate " says michael kodsi chief executive officer of choice mortgage bank in boca raton fla a good number of his clients would rather take cash out through refinancing where their mortgage rate will be fixed as opposed to taking out a loan tied to the prime rate which has the potential to fluctuate and thereby "could go higher down the road " he says freddie mac says of the loans it owns that were refinanced in the third quarter of had amounts at least higher than the original mortgage balances the threshold for considering a loan a cash out refinancing its the highest share of cash out refinance loans reported since consumers cashed out a total of &# billion during the quarter down somewhat from &# billion in the second quarter according to freddie mac banks are seeing results of the cash out trend too according to the american bankers association the dollar amount of home equity loans including loans made through home equity lines of credit has increased by an annualized for the first three quarters of compared with all of thats down from a increase in and a increase in the "easy money" in was an effect of a prime rate at about says keith leggett senior economist for the american bankers association but as the fed raised rates thereby raising the prime rate that easy money dried up "youre starting to see the impact of higher interest rates " he says "as interest rates rose that translated into basically a slowing in the rate of growth in home equity lines and home equity loans " some homeowners arent refinancing only to get at their equity instead there are "passive" cash outs taken by those who are refinancing for a better rate perhaps in response to an adjustable rate mortgage reset that has adjusted higher ms cutts says in fact people who are facing arm resets seem to be the driving force behind an upswing in refinancing that started late last year says mike fratantoni senior economist at the mortgage bankers association while locking in a good rate some homeowners are using the opportunity to pull equity out of their homes while they have a chance a move that perhaps helps them clean up credit card debt at the same time says keith gumbinger vice president of hsh associates a financial publisher of mortgage and consumer loan information so is refinancing to take cash out everyones best bet hardly it depends on an individual says jim svinth chief economist for lendingtree com "i always counsel folks to look at all of their alternatives " he says "if you refinanced two years ago and you have a or rate on the first mortgage youre not going to want to refinance in todays environment " he says of course if the spread between the mortgage rate you have and the one you can get isnt as big or if you can refinance to a better rate it may be a decent option above all people need to ask themselves "what is the cheapest way to borrow this money " says bob walters chief economist with quicken loans "you need to minimize the interest payments that you make " after all a home equity line of credit still will offer a better interest rate than most credit cards and interest on these loans is generally tax deductible another point to remember banks also will sometimes offer a fixed rate for chunks of debt taken out on a home equity line there are also costs and fees to consider so those refinancing should make sure that the move is definitely going to pay off given the expense their timeline for repayment is another consideration if the debt can be paid back in less than a year a second mortgage or home equity line of credit may be a better choice experts says finally borrowers also should know exactly what theyll use the funds for "if you look historically at what people do with the cash out funds they fall into one of three buckets " mr fratantoni says one is debt consolidation another is to make an investment and another is to spend he says home improvement is often cited as a prudent reason for extracting equity given that the value of the home and your future equity should rise as a result overall borrowers need to be honest with themselves before tapping their home equity especially if the reason for the cash out isnt a one time cost says jennifer wheary a senior fellow at demos a nonpartisan public policy research and advocacy organization she recently completed a report on the issue of home equity extraction "in the short term they will feel a sense of relief " she says referring to those who use the cash to catch up with such things as credit card payments or medical expenses but the relief will be fleeting if they find themselves in the same situation and this time without the cushion of home equity to fall back on she says amy hoak writes for marketwatch www marketwatch
