as in war it pays to know your enemy unlike conventional investors who buy stocks with hopes that share prices will rise short sellers sell borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference as profit thats obviously not popular with bullish investors or corporate executives that tension is evident in several lawsuits filed against short sellers
