eyes on the road cheap gas worries auto makers efforts to develop and sell efficient and lower polluting vehicles may be sabotaged by oil price slide summer seems a long way off and its not just because its finally snowing in michigan the price of regular unleaded gasoline is suddenly back below &# a gallon around the motor city and that has general motors corp chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner worried "with the price of oil at its lowest level in months we run the risk of reverting back to our traditional energy policy " mr wagoner said in a speech at the automotive news world congress in dearborn mich last week "that is relying on the lowest cost energy available on world markets including imported oil without providing adequate support for developing alternative sources " when the head of the worlds largest car maker and the leading marketer of large sport utility vehicles in america complains that oil is too cheap you know the u s energy debate is headed in a new direction since the oil shocks of the s the energy arguments in the u s have centered mainly on the pros and cons of relying on "imported oil " when mideast tensions actually disrupted the flow of oil to americas gas stations the government took rapid and dramatic steps such as enacting "corporate average fuel economy" standards that pushed auto makers to more than double the average fuel economy of their cars from the mid s base when supply concerns eased however that curbed the nations appetite for tough new measures to discourage petroleum consumption political and industry leaders contented themselves with what john decicco an automotive policy expert with the environmental defense fund calls "talk and spend" approaches thered be talk about developing high mileage alternative power cars and some government spending on projects such as the ill fated clinton era partnership for a new generation vehicle but otherwise the industrys focus was on selling what americans wanted which in the late s was v powered suvs but now the energy debate is being reframed as a battle to do something about climate change and the potential long term threat carbon dioxide poses to the livability of the planet "i see a real shift in the tenor of the debate " says mr decicco who watches the industry from his home near ann arbor mich "the key is climate " the impulse to do something about co and climate change increasingly transcends traditional ideological categories the leadership of the sierra club california gov arnold schwarzenegger and arizona sen john mccain define three points along a wide left to right spectrum but all three agree that the u s needs to take climate change much more seriously gov schwarzenegger last week signed an executive order requiring a reduction in the co emissions from transportation fuels by an action his office says is a world wide first www gov ca gov exactly how this reduction equivalent to taking three million cars off the road will be achieved is going to be left to market forces according to a summary of the order in other words auto makers and fuel producers could decide whether to reduce carbon output by blending gasoline with ethanol or buying carbon credits from utilities that have cut their own output meanwhile a number of bills designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions are vying in congress and president bush is expected to outline a plan to substantially increase the use of ethanol fuels in his state of the union address theres just one problem the signal motorists are getting from the gas pump is "what me worry " for mr wagoner this is a problem if fuel prices are too low particularly relative to the incomes of new car buyers theres less economic rationale for paying a premium to own a high tech fuel saving car gms north american auto business is fighting to break even as it is mr wagoner hardly needs to lose more money pushing expensive alternative technology vehicles such as a production version of the plug in hybrid chevrolet volt that anchored gms publicity blitz earlier this month at the north american international auto show in detroit mr wagoners rivals at toyota and honda have an advantage in that they are profitable and have a lead in engineering and marketing hybrids and smaller fuel efficient gasoline powered cars but that doesnt mean theyre not concerned too after all toyotas next big u s vehicle launch is a v powered large pickup truck a sustained period of low gasoline prices could blunt demand for subcompacts such as the honda fit and make it harder to sell hybrids the auto industry and particularly the detroit three of gm ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group is at a critical moment as lawmakers at the federal and state level scramble to do something in the face of public concern about melting ice caps and weird violent weather the auto industry presents a tempting target just as in the s the easiest thing may be to demand that auto makers actually build the high mileage concept cars they hype at auto shows thats what happened in the early s after gm touted its electric vehicle technology california regulators concluded electric vehicles were feasible and demanded they be offered for sale the result was an expensive drive down what was then a technological dead end the edfs mr decicco says the industry should seize this opportunity to make the case for gradual doable change that works with consumer desires instead of against them recent sales trends suggest that a meaningful slice of american car buyers are recalibrating their values no longer equating status with sheer size but instead giving more weight to technical sophistication smart packaging and somewhat better fuel economy filtering out moon shot mile per gallon show cars the displays at the detroit auto show demonstrated that most mainstream auto makers already are moving away from the late s "super size" trend that brought us goliaths like the hummer h or the mercedes g class instead mr decicco says theres a greater emphasis on appealing mid sized cars and lighter crossover suvs if a significant number of mainstream consumers choose vehicles that average miles per gallon instead of or miles per gallon the potential fuel savings could be dramatic he says moreover he says that kind of shift is something the industry can handle within the constraints of normal product development budgets "done correctly and in sync with broader trends we are not talking about a costly proposition " mr decicco says "and that would make an enormous difference " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
