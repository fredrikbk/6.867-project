real time will the digital era change writing rock albums have given way to songs will fiction face a similar fragmentation not long ago i found myself having a familiar debate ok its familiar if youre a music geek is the truest expression of rock n roll the song or the album its an old argument between song guys and album guys the hatfields and mccoys of rock fans and at this level of geekery most of the combatants are guys im a songs guy myself to me music is best enjoyed three or four minutes at a time not as part of some larger artistic statement stretched out over a dozen or more songs to the album guys that kind of thinking practically makes me a pre teen mall rat i wrapped up my argument with the claim that itunes and other a la carte music services had ended the albums reign breaking albums into single songs to be bought and assembled as their buyers wished with unwanted songs left to sit in the ether my debate partner nodded politely then had a question how did i feel about the prospect of something similar happening to writing whoa not the same thing i said but the words came out a bit shaky because the more i thought about it the less certain i was to me a novel or a long nonfiction book feels indivisible not something to be chopped up and partitioned out but i knew there were artists and music fans who felt the same way about albums and the more i thought about it the more examples came to mind of books that could be sliced and diced album guys know the tide is running against them restricting songs to people who buy a whole album or not allowing single song downloads guarantees a lot of moaning from itunes users who want "just that one song " and sends them running to peer to peer services but thats another column "just that one song" has long been part of the problem the rise of digital music has been fueled by a lot of things the joy of making mixes on the fly the convenience of taking hundreds or thousands of albums with you and the ability to explore music and buy it at your leisure in your own home but its also been fueled by the perception that albums increasingly contain one or two good songs and a lot of filler whether fair or not that belief turned some music fans against the album even before digital music let them cherry pick songs legally at the same time an avalanche of new musical choices seems to have made fans more fickle once a top selling artists next release or two came with a guaranteed audience now to borrow the language of investing past performance is no guarantee of future returns artists seem to be starting over every time its in their own interests to escape the musical crop rotation of album tour recharge by parceling out singles eps and full albums to stay on fans radar ryan adams and ben folds are two artists who exemplify the trend there are artists experimenting with the album as a unified suite of songs green days "american idiot" comes to mind but fewer and fewer of them personally i like it better this way many musicians have a sublime song or two in them not nearly as many can pull off a great album and in the cd era albums have become too long when i was a kid an lp that lasted more than minutes was rare and truth be told somewhat annoying it took up more than one side of a minute cassette tape meaning you had to cut a song cds are great for reissuing old albums with additional tracks but with new albums they seem to encourage bloat songs that once would have been left in the studio now clutter up the works your mileage may vary of course like i said im a song guy so back to the question that flummoxed me could books be headed for a similar digital age fragmentation with fans taking bits of them to be collected mixed up with other material or repurposed id like to say no of course not novels may have chapters but nobody buys an audiobook of just chapter or leaves the bookstore with three out of eight chapters because she didnt like the way the other chapters started but not all books are novels short story collections are very much like music albums and individual stories are frequently anthologized "out of context " what about recipes in cookbooks the chapter about paris in a travel guide to france bible verses books of quotations how about when you underline or highlight a passage in something youre reading youre selecting a small part of a book not the whole thing though i did buy a few used books in college that were about highlighted and speaking of college what about those immense course packets youd have to buy at the copy shop what were those but professors mixes of articles and book chapters including bits of novels i still remember realizing with a start that i could go out and buy the bharati mukherjee novel id enjoyed a small piece of in a course packet sometimes you do wind up with just a chapter after all what would you do with digital bits and pieces of books plenty of things i have to admit you could mix them with scholarly annotation or footnoted links beyond what will comfortably fit on a page you could use them to explore different authors takes on subjects or the same authors changing style you could do things nobodys thought of which is the whole wonder of the web after all who imagined mash ups or mp blogs ok i accept it something along those lines undoubtedly will happen to books as the barriers between books and the web come down but im not conceding defeat as products novels and long form nonfiction are in better shape than albums when the digital age arrived there was already widespread dissatisfaction with the album it was fairly normal for consumers of music to decry the album its comparatively rare to hear readers grouse that todays novels have one or two good chapters and lousy ones though weve all read books like that and for all the honor accorded it by rock fans who grew up after say "sgt peppers " the idea of the album as a unified work is a relatively recent phenomenon in music the name "album" is derived from books used to hold s in the s and has hung around through a blizzard of changing formats and lengths wikipedia has an interesting overview of this the novel may not be immutable but its now entering its fifth century then theres the nature of the novel itself its immersive not in the videogame sense but in the sense of demanding close attention it requires that you keep your eyes focused on the world it creates rather than the room or train or beach around you novels can draw on other novels on history on other influences but theyre self contained narratives where the web demands connections and associations the novel insists that you shut out distractions instead of following the paths they suggest even in digital form in the linked in world we now inhabit heres betting or at least hoping that endures are there books of whatever type youd want to buy only a part of any thoughts on how the digital world will change writing any album fans want to take me to task write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
