getting going getting more of what the markets give the markets give but investors often dont receive it is one of the great financial puzzles most years the stock and bond markets generate impressive results and yet many folks carp about their portfolios performance the blame lies partly with taxes and investment costs which together can take a big chunk out of our returns the biggest culprit however is often staring at us in the mirror we are i regret our own worst enemy frequently buying and selling stocks bonds and mutual funds at just the wrong time heres a look at the problem and how we can improve our results investors make all kinds of mistakes but possibly our biggest error is assuming the future will look like the immediate past "we have evidence that individual investors tend to extrapolate past returns " says meir statman a finance professor at santa clara university in california "and we have evidence that when individual investors become bullish the market that follows tends to be bearish people arent always getting out at the bottom and getting in at the top but theyre getting pretty close " this tendency to extrapolate recent returns is exacerbated by our overconfidence as the markets climb not only do we assume they will keep on climbing but also our confidence grows and we make riskier investment bets soon enough we are rolling the dice on hot stocks and narrowly focused sector mutual funds overconfidence can also play a role in market declines instead of accepting that short term performance is unpredictable we turn into amateur market strategists some of us sit tight refusing to sell at a loss but others bail out convinced that further losses lie ahead and that invariably is when the markets start to rally how much damage do we end up doing to get a sense check out the new "investor returns" from chicago researchers morningstar to compute a funds investor return morningstar finds out the funds assets at the beginning and end of say a five year period as well as how much shareholders invested or withdrew each month it then calculates what return best explains the funds asset growth this investor return can then be compared with a funds total return which simply reflects the change in the funds share price plus the reinvestment of fund distributions if a funds investor return is below its total return that suggests investors suffer from poor timing selling after stretches of weak performance and buying after healthy gains so which funds have the biggest gap between their investor return and their total return according to morningstars new data shareholders often fare worst in those funds that are most volatile to see how your own funds stack up head to morningstar com type a funds name or symbol into the "quotes" box in the upper left hand corner of the screen once you have pulled up a fund click on the "total returns" tab from there look for the label marked "investor returns " all this raises an obvious question what can we do to capture more of the markets gains tim decker an investment adviser in lancaster pa notes people frequently say their home is the best investment they ever made "if you look at all the costs it isnt that great an investment " he says "but in terms of real life returns theyre probably right " why does a home often turn out to be a good investment until we sell its hard to know what our house is really worth that makes us less antsy but even if we could get daily pricing its a lot harder to sell a house in a panic than it is to sell a mutual fund as an added bonus a home involves forced savings as we gradually pay down our mortgage i am not arguing folks should dump their stocks bonds and funds and buy real estate instead but clearly we need to re think how we invest in the financial markets "theres too much emphasis on investment returns rather than on our returns as investors " mr decker says "its not whether mutual fund a beats mutual fund b over the next years i would rather have investors in an underperforming fund that they stick with " one way to bring more discipline to our investing is to hire a good financial adviser that however is easier said than done i would look for an experienced adviser with some professional credentials notably the certified financial planner designation i would also favor fee only advisers such as those who charge a percentage of a portfolios value an hourly fee or a fixed annual retainer but investors with modest portfolios will likely have a tough time finding a fee only adviser who will take them on moreover when handling our employers k or b plan often our biggest investment we are typically on our own anyway employers of course are well aware of this and theyre designing their k plans accordingly not only do the best plans automatically enroll new employees but also they use lifecycle funds as the default investment option lifecycle funds combine a host of stock and bond market sectors in a single portfolio thus offering one stop investment shopping whats so great about all this automatic enrollment pushes folks to participate once enrolled inertia kicks in and employees tend to continue saving meanwhile lifecycle funds take much of the angst out of investing we dont see all the turmoil thats afflicting the various sectors held within our lifecycle fund instead all we see is a single share price which performs relatively sedately when investing outside of our employers plan we can mimic these benefits most mutual funds offer automatic investment plans where money is pulled out of our bank account every month and invested directly in the funds we choose and when choosing funds we can favor those that are broadly diversified such as balanced funds and lifecycle funds lifecycle funds are offered by major no load fund companies like american century investments fidelity investments t rowe price group and vanguard group jonathan clements also writes the
