business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog scalpel clamp sutures iphone business uses for device multiply apple inc s iphone cant do brain surgery but it sure can help according to one doctor reinforcing the business technology blogs belief that creative iphone owners will unlock hundreds of business uses even as corporate it directors try to keep the device out of their networks for professionals of all kinds the biggest advantage of the iphone over research in motion ltd s blackberry isnt the ability to play music or its lack of buttons or its several degrees of cool its the iphones web browser which makes the phone function more like a laptop than a handheld device robert singer is already taking advantage of that iphone feature by his own admission a tech geek the nashville tenn neurovascular surgeon initially bought an iphone because he thought it would be fun "i was one of the june ers " he says referring to the day the iphone went on sale but he quickly saw that the browser made it an ideal workplace tool dr singer who says he performs about surgeries a year uses his iphone to access his practices electronic medical records system thanks to the iphones browser hes able to review patients x rays angiograms and medical histories while in the operating room he was never able to do this with his blackberry he says instead he would review a patients file in his office the night before a surgery not only does the iphone let him go into surgery fresher he also can see updated information last month for instance he changed the way he performed a back operation after reviewing notes from an old surgery that had been added to a patients electronic record shortly before he made his first cut early security most data breaches and other security problems are preventable unfortunately by the time most companies start thinking about security its too late "security isnt typically part of developing a business process " says jeffrey miller director of information systems and assurance at electronic evidence discovery inc which makes software that helps companies find documents during litigation "its usually treated as an adjunct " something companies try to fit onto a process after everything else has already been done but this approach is fundamentally flawed mr miller says instead security has to be considered when a process is being designed thats because you can never make something secure since theres no way to think of every possible security threat that might arise during the upfront design the trick is to account for this uncertainty upfront by designing security procedures that are flexible and adaptable "you dont establish security directly " mr miller says "you do it by developing business processes that can be improved " take a rather innocuous example people entering and leaving an office a seemingly acceptable security policy would be to require everyone to have a company id before entering but what about contractors janitors and other people who have a legitimate need to get into the office if the security policy isnt adaptable enough to find a way for these people to get in securely other people will end up holding the door open for them similarly people will share passwords to a computer system if the process of setting up a new user is too cumbersome "they end up subverting the security policy because they know that a business need has to be met " mr miller says when push comes to shove business always comes before security and the only way around that is by making flexible security part of the business process tech terms we hate what group of professionals other than those in information technology calls its customers "users" offhand this blogger can think of only one drug dealers thats not to say the two are anything alike but the word implies that the "users" are utterly dependent on the provider josh bernoff an analyst at forrester research inc hates the term he says in his blog that it served a purpose back when few people used software "it helped us to keep in mind that there was a poor slob on the other end of what we were building " he writes but those days are long over today all the term does is emphasize technology at the expense of the task someone is trying to perform to an it person you arent writing a message youre using email to see how ridiculous this is try applying "user" to some routine activities someone who is grocery shopping becomes a supermarket user a driver becomes a vehicle user mr bernoff writes that refusing to call people users "focuses you on the relationships which will always be around not the technologies which are always changing " the business technology blog also hates the term "users " and we grit our teeth every time we resort to it three times yesterday once the day before we also hate the term "solution " it people often say that they have a customer relationship solution or a supply chain solution the word "solution" not only doesnt tell you what it does but also doesnt tell you what it is a supply chain solution might be software but it might be a storage rack in a pickup truck or it might be a cardboard box this blog also hates "end to end" and "scalable " which vaguely suggest that something is much more versatile than it probably is and also "agile " as in "this solution will make your company more agile " and "space " as in "the aging golfer social networking space " as if some fallow market awaits there by dint of calling it a space and there are others many others
