new york aug technology a call for a social network that is less proprietary the web is crying out for an alternative to social networking sites such as facebook and myspace one that would allow individuals personal information to flow to their friends without a corporate intermediary writes wired blogger scott gilbertson sites like facebook and myspace built their success on allowing people to easily store a wide variety of personal information in a single place and share it with friends the problem he says is that these sites prevent other programs from using that information someone has to become a member of facebook to see a friends photos posted there for myspace and facebook keeping the information locked into their sites makes financial sense mr gilbertson says it drives up the sites membership and discourages users from switching to a rival site since they would have to go through the painstaking task of transferring their data to a new service but it would be more in the spirit of the internet if those blogs photos and calendars on myspace pages could be exported easily to other programs and web sites says mr gilbertson to that effect he calls on web programmers to come up with a simple free way to add social networking features to any site on the internet there already are some steps being taken in this direction mr gilbertson applauds online address book provider plaxo inc for launching a facebook style service called pulse that allows any data made public to be used by other programs for the most part though web users still lack the tools to put information about their networks to good use such as automatically pulling in calendar events from friends web sites mr gilbertson says "while weve largely outgrown the limitations of closed platforms
