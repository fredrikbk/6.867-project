dont panic about the credit market equity markets have recently lost over &# trillion in the u s and even more globally many times the likely amount of mortgage and corporate debt losses in the foreseeable future this is in part a correction from the sharp global equity run up through mid july current prices still signal growth ahead another aspect of the market disruption is a dramatic stand off between bond buyers and sellers buyers in both housing and debt markets are using the market discontinuity to claw prices and terms back to earth the slowdown talk weighing on equities also reflects the wall street view that debt mortgage and takeover businesses have replaced general motors as the economys bellwether according to the bears as goes the credit market so goes the economy fortunately main street is not that fickle housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the u s economy or of job creation its more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months and perhaps years unlike the seizure in credit markets to which many are now drawing comparisons reservoirs of global liquidity are full to overflowing not empty as they were that year the deep asian crisis has been replaced with an all cylinder boom unemployment rates are falling all around the world while chinas equities have continued hitting new highs yet the hyperventilation over the coming u s economic slowdown matches the aftermath of hurricane katrina as if the recent widening of credit spreads from record lows to more normal levels and the hiatus in takeover activity are as bad as that real world catastrophe to assess the debt problem many may be double counting the losses by adding the real economic costs of the mortgage defaults to the financial division of the losses among investors when a customer breaks a china plate in a shop for example the loss can be realized by the customer or by the store but not both there is only one loss after katrina talk tv demanded that the fed cut interest rates or risk dire consequences instead it hiked rates each meeting as strong growth continued today we are hearing the same demands but the primary effect of the rate cut talk is to further submerge the dollar driving liquidity toward foreign economies their currencies and gold u s growth has endured other waves of equally loud pessimism over high gasoline prices low pre revision estimates of job growth a supposedly negative personal savings rate revised to positive on july by the commerce department and even the tax cut on labor and capital remember the argument that tax cuts would put the economy on a path toward fiscal collapse and recession now the u s deficit is set to fall below &# billion by washingtons september fiscal year end thanks to strong tax receipts while its frowned upon to look for a silver lining when markets tumble and painful losses accumulate the housing and debt market corrections will probably add to the length of the u s economic expansion overly low interest rates in channeled economic activity into housing and debt financing corporate bond yields fell relative to treasurys causing leveraged investments this artificial allocation of u s capital now looks like it will be corrected before inflation kicks in cpi will likely top later this year and higher tax rates bite the massive increase scheduled for when the bush tax cuts expire the bearish view is that americans live breathe and spend their houses and mortgages yet the july consumer confidence survey by the conference board jumped to the highest in the six year expansion data and theory show clearly that houses are not the be all and end all of the economy jobs matter more for many the value of future employment is much greater than their home equity the low jobless claims and unemployment rate clear signs of a strong labor environment raise confidence and likely future wages this outweighs changes in wealth whether from declines in house prices or the stock market especially for lower income workers neither the economy nor job growth has been dependent on housing residential construction declined to of gdp in the second quarter right on the s average having boomed excessively in and and subtracted heavily from gdp in but strength in commercial construction more than offset the weakness in residential construction allowing overall construction to add to gdp for the first time in a year concerns about high inventories of unsold homes are exaggerated at per the commerce department the june inventory equals months of s average sales this is only a bit above the months average inventory from the leaner inventories in the "sellers market" resulted in part from the super low interest and mortgage rates earlier this decade and the cut in the capital gains tax on houses those overstating housings impact on jobs often use dates spanning the recession as in the widely quoted calculation that of the net new jobs were in housing that was true only between march and september because housing jobs grew in the recession while other jobs shrank a fairer picture of the role of housing in the expansion is to start counting from any month after the recession from the end of through present jobs from residential construction plus real estate and mortgage brokers created only of the net new jobs if all credit intermediation jobs are also included nor has consumer spending been dependent on "cashing in" on the housing boom the increase in mortgage equity withdrawals in and funded big net additions to household financial assets while consumption growth remained steady mortgage equity withdrawals slumped throughout yet consumption growth was particularly fast in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of why havent swings in the mortgage market had much effect on consumption fed data shows that the surge in mortgage growth in and was accompanied by an equal surge in household additions to net financial assets inexpensive home financing helped households increase their treasury and equity purchases and their checking accounts while slowing the growth in auto and credit card debt rather than hitting consumption the mortgage slowdown has caused these other household balance sheet practices to return to normal in the long list of worries about consumption the threat of mortgage rate resets is providing the latest fixation it shouldnt payments on some &# billion of adjustable rate mortgages are scheduled to go up in if the mortgage rate is adjusted upward by an average two percentage points thats &# billion in added payments to put this in perspective wages for nonsupervisory workers increased by &# billion over the last months the july revision alone added &# billion to the last years total u s personal income raising it to &# trillion reflecting the hard to track dynamism of the u s economy the constant warnings of a housing related collapse in domestic consumption overstates the importance of housing in the economy while understating the importance of jobs and economic growth both of which have been solid of course sellers of both houses and bonds would like more froth in their markets but buyers and likely the economy as a whole will probably benefit over time from the wrenching return to more normal market conditions mr malpass is chief economist at bear stearns
