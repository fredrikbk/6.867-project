the middle seat tallying this summers travel woes dot says delays worsened in june july not as bad the first half of has been the worst for air travel delays since the department of transportation started keeping detailed statistics years ago the government said yesterday and preliminary numbers show july wont do much to reverse travel woes either june was the second worst june on record for flight delays with only of flights arriving on time as a result of more jets in the sky and particularly bad weather at key airport hubs like dallas fort worth international last year in june of flights arrived on time only june was worse than this year at on time when surging travel demand and airline labor battles clogged air transportation the bureau of transportation statistics said flights in june sat waiting to take off for more than three hours after departing the gate and were stuck for more than five hours continental airlines flight from newark n j to denver on june had the longest tarmac delay of the month at minutes more than six hours that day a federal aviation administration computer failed and left planes grounded across the east coast then thunderstorms popped up in the newark area in the afternoon continental says flight was serviced several times during its wait by catering lavatory and fuel trucks and passengers were given the option of deplaning a spokesman said passengers got to denver that day because the airline opted not to cancel the flight yesterday the dot delivered a fuller accounting of travel misery this summer with its june statistics mishandled baggage reports shot up in june bags either lost late or misrouted more passengers were involuntarily bumped from flights and the number of complaints filed by customers to the dot increased a whopping in june compared with last year atlantic southeast airlines a regional feeder for delta air lines inc had the worst on time performance of any u s airline in june according to the dot nearly half of all asa flights arrived late which the dot defines as reaching the gate minutes or more past scheduled arrival time among major airlines amr corp s american airlines hard hit by huge rains on dallas had the worst on time performance southwest airlines co was the best among majors the dot wont release july delay numbers for another month but a tally from flightstats com a flight tracking service used by airlines airports and consumers shows that last month was better for airline travelers than june but still worse than last year the airlines tracked by flightstats posted a collective on time percentage of in july compared with in july last year the biggest airlines didnt run quite as smoothly with an on time rate in july of worse than the the same airlines achieved a year ago long delays increased for those major airlines too with the number of flights delayed minutes or more up in july compared with a year earlier and planes in july were chock full of passengers with several airlines reporting record load factors filling nearly of their seats full planes can add to delays simply by taking longer to load and unload aircraft whats more with few empty seats to accommodate passengers with canceled flights or missed connections airlines are pressured to wait more often for delayed connecting customers leaving them behind might mean stranding them overnight or even for several days before an empty seat can be found going to their destination carriers with many of their operations in the new york area seem to have hurt the most in july more than of flights at american jetblue airways corp delta and continental arrived late in july among jetblues delayed flights the average wait was nearly two hours according to flightstats the three big new york airports were the worst in the u s for on time ratings in both june and july only of flights at new yorks kennedy international airport arrived on time in july according to flightstats newark liberty international wasnt much better at on time and one third of the flights at laguardia airport were late airlines such as delta jetblue and american have beefed up service at jfk pumping more flights into the regions crowded airspace takeoffs and landings are up about this year but like a highway at rush hour the airport jams back up traffic across the country flight cancellations in july soared and not just at northwest airlines corp which has been canceling flights liberally all summer because of a shortage of available pilots flightstats counted canceled northwest flights in july compared with flights northwest canceled in july american jetblue delta and continental all saw large percentage increases in cancellations too and regional airlines that feed passengers to larger mainline carriers had heavy cancellations in july regional carriers flying for american canceled more than flights in july as did deltas regional airlines when airlines have to thin out schedules at hub airports affected by bad weather they often cancel flights with smaller regional airplanes to make room for bigger jets so fewer passengers are inconvenienced in all flights were canceled in july up from july flightstats counts different airlines instead of just the that the dot tallies and counts all arrivals in the u s including international arrivals the dot just measures domestic flights july a thursday with storms stretching from iowa to ohio including chicago and thunderstorms in new york was the worst day of the month for air travel illustrating how vulnerable the overcrowded air travel system is to storms that happen to hit key flight corridors delta continental jetblue and airtran airways all saw more than half of their flights arrive late on july according to flightstats ual corp s united airlines wasnt much better at arriving on time in all only of u s arrivals got to the gate on time that day
