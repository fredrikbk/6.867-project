the myth of convenience why instant foods dont save time most people use prepackaged convenience foods to save time but new research shows these fat and sodium laden foods arent the time savers you think they are while its true that a frozen lasagna dish is usually faster to make than homemade lasagna researchers from the university of california los angeles wanted to find out how convenience foods are used in the real world after they videotaped family cooking habits the researchers saw that convenience foods werent used as a time saving substitute for the same dish made from scratch instead packaged foods offered a way for families to eat more elaborate meals than they would normally have time to prepare when families did cook from scratch they ate simpler fare like one pot meals or stir fry in the end dinner took about a half hour to an hour to prepare whether it was made from scratch or with convenience foods according to the research which was published in the july issue of the british food journal and funded by the alfred p sloan foundation a nonprofit group that funds science economic and other research says anthropology researcher margaret beck from the center on everyday lives of families at ucla "when people use convenience foods they are ramping up expectations for how elaborate a dinner should be " the study is important because convenience foods tend to be high in preservatives unhealthy fats and sodium nutritionists say parents often justify using the less healthful convenience foods because they feel the time saved in cooking can be used to help kids with homework or play at the end of a busy day but the discovery that a high use of convenience foods doesnt really put dinner on the table any faster should persuade families to opt for simpler healthier fare say health experts "the best piece of advice i give for eating healthy is to plan get the ingredients in your house that will help you build something very simple " says new orleans physician timothy harlan a former chef and creator of www drgourmet com a list of "cupboard essentials" needed to whip up a quick healthful meal can be found at www drgourmet com ingredients index shtml the ucla researchers videotaped the cooking habits of middle class los angeles families with two working parents the parents knew they were part of a study but they didnt know use of convenience foods would be monitored the study showed that meals with little or no convenience foods took to minutes to prepare meals that used a lot of convenience foods took to minutes to prepare while convenience foods were time savers on very elaborate meals overall there was no statistically significant difference in total preparation time one difference that emerged was "hands on" time the amount of time people spent slicing dicing and stirring foods using convenience foods shaved about minutes of hands on time but it didnt make any difference in how quickly the food got to the table the study authors noted that the biggest time savings of convenience foods may be at the grocery store where its faster to grab a frozen entree than to collect six separate ingredients to make the same dish from scratch grocery shopping time wasnt measured in the study the average american spends about minutes in the grocery store and shops about twice a week according to the food marketing institute convenience foods also helped cooks offer a greater variety of dishes cooks who made dinner from scratch offered three or fewer dishes one family made a simple meal of sandwiches and edamame using bread cheese greens and salmon and tomatoes that meal took about a half hour to prepare another family had a six dish convenience food meal of microwave barbecued ribs macaroni and cheese prebagged salad bagged dinner rolls and a cookies and ice cream dessert that meal also took a half hour "people should give themselves a break " says dr beck "its ok to put a simple meal on the table " email healthjournal wsj com
