cui bono more than just public benefits is behind taxing hedge fund managers steve forbess editorial page commentary "private equity public benefits" july misses the boat mr forbes acknowledges that "risk taking" is the basis for capital gain treatment however the carried interest is earned for taking risks with other peoples money as a tax attorney i would like to think that some of my ideas help companies operate more efficiently yet i get taxed at ordinary income rates for dispensing advice as do business consultants and engineers ensuring hedge fund managers pay tax on this earned income would hardly "single them out" for unfair treatment rather it would require them to pay the same rate as everyone else who works for a living as they do i can assure mr forbes that my wife a second grade teacher would have no objection to hedge fund managers paying their fair share of taxes kent l schwarz morristown n j kudos to mr forbes for so eloquently describing how the main beneficiaries of private equity are charitable foundations academic institutions and pension funds however the u s taxpayer is an enormous beneficiary as well in addition to spawning next generation industries with venture capital private equitys subset of turnaround specialists have replaced the u s government as the buyer of last resort when chrysler exhausted all its options in taxpayers bailed it out when it needed another lifeline in private equity stepped up to the plate when the savings and loan crisis struck in the s the taxpayer was left holding the bag when the mortgage meltdown plays out over the next months well have the private equity buyers to thank for keeping congress from reaching into our wallets again for its latest rescue plan our country has enough fiscal problems already lets not invite more by killing the golden goose quint barker harrison n y in arguing the "public benefits" of private equity mr forbes implies that closing tax loopholes for wealthy private equity fund managers would discourage investment in long term economic growth ultimately hurting charitable foundations and the beneficiaries of large corporate pensions i think mr forbes does the public a disservice in making this argument because the private equity business like all others is governed by the forces of supply and demand the current glut of private equity capital is in fact more likely to decrease returns for the very charities and pensions that most rely on them appropriate taxation of private equity managers on the other hand would limit the supply of private funds thereby increasing returns in that light its difficult to see mr forbess position as anything but an apology for private interests ken lee london make no mistake about it the current tax policy regarding the carried interest of private equity firms is a tax subsidy thats why it was particularly confusing to understand the logic behind mr forbess impassioned plea to congress to maintain such a clear case of corporate welfare repeatedly referring to the proposed legislation as a tax hike further obfuscates the matter in reality it simply levels the playing field for all wage earners as warren buffett argues why should the government tax his secretary at a higher rate than himself due simply to the content of their jobs to boil it down private equity managers like all managers are paid to deliver returns to their investors the fact that these returns come in the form of capital gains from the sale of a company that has typically been improved should be irrelevant mr forbes is on a very slippery slope here in selectively choosing which occupations create a "public benefit" and thus deserve special tax treatment why not exempt teachers from paying taxes they provide benefits to the public at large there is no question that private equity firms are beneficial to the long term health of our economy but to provide tax subsidies to them especially at a time when there is no fiscal restraint in washington is foolish tax policy for all americans jeff wood mount pleasant s c
