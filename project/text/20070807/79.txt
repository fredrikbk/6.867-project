politics &amp economics clearing emergency radio waves fcc presses sprint on cellphone static hindering police spectrum public safety officials have been complaining for years about static from cellphones that disrupts emergency radio communications now the federal communications commission is stepping up the pressure on sprint nextel corp the company whose signals are causing the most interference to address the problem with talk of a renewed threat of a terrorist attack the middle of the hurricane season approaching and the minneapolis bridge collapse some lawmakers are urging the fcc to take more control of the process "the fcc needs to ensure that our police firefighters and other first responders can use the spectrum without interference " says sen frank lautenberg d n j "communication on these frequencies is essential for public safety " fcc chairman kevin martin warns that he wants to see progress soon or the fcc will dictate a remedy sprint nextel concedes it is taking longer than anticipated to solve the problem and attributes the delay to its efforts to do it as economically as possible the static is more than a nuisance in pennsylvanias upper uwchlan township police officers handling accidents on busy route regularly lose contact with dispatchers chief john de marco says interference cut off a call he made during a traffic stop involving a fugitive another time it happened when he was responding to a bank alarm school bus drivers prison systems and utility workers have had calls interrupted by cellphone interference the problem has been intensifying with growing use of sprint nextels network the nextel portion of which was created using a slice of the airwaves interwoven with the one used for emergency communications interference wasnt much of a problem when the spectrum was used as originally designated by construction crews taxi drivers and other workers who needed souped up walkie talkies for short conversations in as use of nextel service grew and static more frequently interrupted public safety communications the company the fcc and safety groups agreed on a solution nextel would pay to move its service and public safety agencies to separate channels as an incentive the fcc would give the company an additional megahertz of coveted spectrum the company began negotiating with local public safety agencies about the exact network upgrades they needed and how much the company would pay for them the following year sprint corp acquired nextel communications inc making it necessary to mesh those two networks as well from the beginning sen lautenberg has questioned the legality of the deal he says he remains concerned about the protracted process in which hundreds of separate negotiations have ended up in mediation the fix was never expected to be easy or inexpensive as part of its agreement with the fcc nextel promised to pay at least &# billion and complete the job in three years but many of the negotiations between sprint nextel and local authorities have landed in protracted mediation while interference has continued "theres no way were going to meet the month end date and theres very little sense of how much this could ultimately cost " says robert gurss a lawyer with fletcher heald &amp hildreth plc and director of legal and government affairs for the association of public safety communications officials international while switching channels might sound easy it isnt wireless network equipment used by thousands of public service agencies across the country needs to be modified as does every mobile phone or other radio device the agencies use as a measure of how much ground still must be covered motorola inc a provider of equipment to the public safety community estimates it has shipped only of the new phones and other equipment needed to complete the overhaul ed atkins director of emergency services for chester county pa which includes upper uwchlan has been negotiating for three years with sprint to pin down the cost of preliminary studies to upgrade the police fire and ambulance communications he puts the initial costs at about &# substantially more than sprints &# offer mr atkins sees the price of the entire conversion ranging from as little as &# million to as much as &# million depending on how many radios need replacing and how much of the countys communications infrastructure needs to be overhauled "i was told we were going to have our costs for this exercise covered " mr atkins says "i believe what people tell me they say they are going to pay me i believe they are going to pay me its very frustrating " sprint nextel says by the end of this year it will have spent about &# billion it acknowledges it has taken a tough stand in negotiations with public safety officials but cites that the original agreement specified that it spend at least &# billion if the full project costs less the difference goes to the treasury if it costs more the reston va company is responsible for the costs "every dollar we spend is a dollar that doesnt go to the u s treasury " says lawrence krevor sprints senior vice president government affairs "we dont have a lot of discretion in fact we have very little discretion as to how we act here " some competitors may have been less than happy with the fccs agreement to hand over coveted spectrum to sprint at&amp t inc filed a complaint with the fcc in april in which it urged the agency to consider taking enforcement action including possibly taking back the spectrum the company says every time there is an incident of interference in areas in which it operates it has to ensure it is not its signal which is causing the disruption incurring costs in the process the fcc said sprint should focus on getting the job done not saving money for the treasury that statement "was a reflection of the commissions frustration with the current pace and a desire to motivate all the parties so that we really move forward in an expeditious manner " mr martin says all sides acknowledge they hadnt anticipated just how difficult making changes would be public safety networks unlike commercial networks cant be taken offline for repairs "peoples lives are hanging on this " said steve proctor executive director of the utah communications agency network which is supervising the channel switch in his state "youre having to redesign and rebuild the airplane while its still flying "
