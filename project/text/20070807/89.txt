the afternoon report credit due online edition as the investment community wonders whether the feds see saw of worry is tilting toward growth concerns versus inflation fighting wall street waits to see if bernankes brain trust will make mention of its chief concern creaky credit markets new stats out this morning provide another scrap of information on inflation for the federal open market committee to mull during its meeting today the labor department said nonfarm productivity rose at a annualized rate between april and june thats up from its first quarter rate which was revised downward from but its also below the that wall street economists had expected rising productivity is a key component of economic growth helping to keep inflation in check and wages rising also unit labor costs a gauge of inflationary pressures climbed during the last quarter slower than the upwardly revised increase seen during the preceding three months from a year ago unit labor costs were up the fastest jump since the third quarter of labor is a prime ingredient in the costs of goods and services and if productivity doesnt match growth in labor costs companies pass them along to consumers if possible if not they have to take a hit to the bottom line as such rising albeit slower labor costs and slower than expected productivity numbers could still raise eyebrows for a fed which has clearly said inflation continues to be enemy number one still the latest department of labor stats dont change the predominant view on wall street that the fed wont touch rates today as isi group economists wrote in a recent research note "no one that we are aware of expects a rate cut " a livelier debate exists among wall street thinkers over whether the fed will deign to acknowledge credit market conditions in its must read statement following the meeting for those unfamiliar with the kabuki theater by which the fed telegraphs its thinking to the markets a mention of such problems can serve as a kind of unofficial half step toward a possible change in fed policy down the road and while theyre just words on paper investors traders and wall street institutions are clamoring for a pinch of that dry bureaucratic prose to assuage their pain thats because a fed statement could hearten investors by offering the hope of a nearer term rate cut if credit conditions stay sour giving investors a touch more confidence and providing a bit of lubrication to the creaky markets on the other hand some say a fed mention of credit issues wont necessarily be helpful thats one of the reasons why bnp paribas economists doubt the fed statement will even mention the story thats dominated headlines in the financial press recently saying the fed "would not want to draw additional attention to it nor convey a sense that it is worried about it " chris johnson chief investment strategist at johnson research group in cincinnati concurs saying in this mornings wall street journal that "theres always the chance that if the fed does say something it could only make things worse " that said some even see ben bernankes brigade of dismal scientists taking the even stronger step of saying theyre now equally worried about inflation and slowing economic growth in a recent note goldman sachs economists said "the recent economic news has persuaded us that the federal open market committee is likely to shift its balance of risks assessment toward a neutral posture of course we are not sure that the committee really will take this relatively large step " the fed issues its
