from fans whirlwind researchers reap data to brace homes miami a florida university and an insurer that incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in losses during recent hurricanes are teaming up to find ways to help buildings survive massive storms their tool giant fans the wall of wind as its been dubbed looms over a field at florida international university six fans stacked feet high with each hooked up to a powerful motor create gusts of well over miles per hour the wind is strong enough to tear shingles off the roof of a model home rattle the front window in its frame and turn a decorative wind chime into a missile the wind lab is part of an effort to find the least expensive ways to reinforce millions of homes and commercial structures that went up before stricter building codes were adopted researchers at florida international and an affiliate of renaissancere holdings ltd a leading catastrophe insurer are exploring how hurricane winds attack vulnerable parts of a building such as where the roof meets the walls and testing devices that may help protect them "weve got to find a way to retrofit existing buildings " says stephen leatherman director of the international hurricane research center at the university which is public in the u s losses caused by hurricanes in and were likely well over &# billion with about &# billion covered by insurance companies research could eventually help cut property losses by says william riker president of renaissancere a bermuda based firm thats a major seller of reinsurance essentially insurance for insurance companies that want to spread the risk of claims from major disasters renaissancere posted a net loss of &# million for largely because of payments related to hurricanes katrina rita and wilma insurance markets have been in turmoil in hurricane prone states insurers have been raising rates and limiting the number of policies they sell in coastal communities state lawmakers meanwhile are pushing insurers to give better deals to consumers who take steps to reduce their vulnerability to hurricanes louisiana recently passed a law requiring insurers to offer savings to customers who make changes such as reinforcing their roofs in may connecticut mandated lower premiums for policyholders who install storm shutters or impact resistant glass data on whether inexpensive retrofits can significantly reduce storm losses is still limited in part thats because the science of understanding how hurricanes wreak their havoc is in its infancy "youre never quite sure what failed first " mr riker says "nobody stands outside in a hurricane and watches how a building falls apart " the wall of wind which started with a two fan machine in late is designed to make something close to that possible the six fan unit went into operation in may most research into wind damage from hurricanes is conducted on miniature structures in small wind tunnels the university of western ontario is planning next year to start testing full scale structures using suction pressure rather than mimicking wind james cook university in australia has a cyclone testing facility insurers are convinced of the value of such tests similar experiments on car collisions have led to changes that have cut the number of deaths and reduced property damage says robert hartwig president of the insurance information institute a trade group "we would expect to see similar benefits in home design " he says such research could also help insurance companies better predict hurricane losses renaissancere has committed &# million to help build the wind lab in florida which tests structures the height of single story buildings at full strength it generates winds of miles per hour tightly aimed at the test building category hurricanes have winds above miles per hour though the actual wind speed is typically lower at ground level florida international plans to expand the unit to fans soon moving it into a large metal building being constructed on campus with two ends that open like an airplane hangar it will be able to test two story structures the state of florida is contributing &# million to the effort research is just beginning to produce results one focus for researchers at the wind lab are the destructive vortexes that hurricane winds create at the corners of buildings the swirl along roof edges can tear off a roof leading to significantly more damage to a structure and its contents on a recent test run as observers watched atop a nearby trailer technicians cranked up the fans until winds of about miles per hour were punishing a modest structure a wind chime flew away but only a couple of clay tiles at the roof line came off the kind of minor damage that might lead homeowners in the path of a massive hurricane to count their blessings "not what i would have expected " said craig tillman president of weatherpredict consulting inc which is indirectly owned by renaissancere the fans were turned off and workers loosened some tiles re creating the effect of shoddy construction or average wear and tear when the fans were turned on again the difference was dramatic a few tiles flew off quickly and more followed in a few minutes a section of the roof looked severely damaged "we learned something today " mr tillman said "workmanship matters " later workers using a crane positioned a structure with a graveled flat roof similar to those on many commercial buildings in front of the fans hurricane winds sweeping over a buildings edge can wipe away the gravel and expose the waterproof membrane underneath if that is torn off and water gets inside losses escalate sharply researchers at the wall are examining ways to minimize that effect jason lin an engineer and weatherpredict executive has patented a metal grate a few inches high that essentially pulls wind up from the roof edge letting it flow through small holes in this test when the grate was attached and the fans were turned on the gravel barely moved researchers also hope to look at ways to protect air conditioning units on the roofs of commercial buildings which can be vulnerable in hurricanes and at different types of inexpensive trusses that might help bolster a slanted roof "this is not going to make homes survive category winds " says mr tillman "but if you can get structures to withstand a category event youve actually accomplished quite a bit "
