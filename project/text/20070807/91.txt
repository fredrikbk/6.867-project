the evening wrap after the statement online edition investors and economists picked apart the federal reserves statement today agreeing that chairman ben bernankes attention is clearly fixed on inflation worries for the moment in a unanimous decision the feds policy committee kept the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at where it has been since june in the statement accompanying its rate announcement fed officials gave the nod that many on wall street had hoped for by acknowledging the turmoil in financial and credit markets in recent weeks still fed officials noted the underlying soundness of economic conditions saying "the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy " some on wall street had thought the fed might even go further than the mere mention of market trouble and switch to a neutral outlook and away from its long established bias toward inflation fighting they were wrong as mr bernankes colleagues reaffirmed that inflation remains its "predominant policy concern " economists dug into different phrases of the fed statement in the hopes of uncovering some overlooked nuggets of information economic research firm global insight pointed to the feds reference to tighter credit conditions for "households" and "businesses " as evidence the fed "recognized that the problems in the sub prime mortgage market have spread as contagion to other major areas of the credit markets the overall statement clearly indicates that the fed is being flexible and it is keeping a very close eye on the pulse of credit markets and the economy overall should financial stresses continue to mount or real growth falter materially the fomc would step in and lower rates accordingly " steven wood chief economist at insight economics wasnt quite as sanguine in his analysis saying "the fed threw the markets a bone commenting on recent financial market volatility and tighter credit conditions however they gave no hint that they would act anytime soon " analysts from janney montgomery scott zeroed in on the statements final sentence which acknowledged downside risks to growth and reaffirmed inflation as mr bernankes biggest bugaboo "this is again the inflation bias lite and slow walk towards policy neutrality weve seen for several months now " janney analysts wrote after the feds statement was released the odds of a rate cut this fall fell on financial futures markets with the odds of a quarter point cut in september at just
