go irish now heres some european tax "harmonization" we can support to boost a long suffering economy northern irelands new government wants its corporate tax rate slashed to the levied down south in the fast growing republic of ireland lets hope british prime minister gordon brown seizes this opportunity to add economic dash to ulsters newfound political stability the idea has picked up momentum in recent weeks more than politicians and business leaders addressed a letter in support to sir david varney whom mr brown appointed to review northern irelands tax regime the push for a low island wide business levy surfaced before catholics and protestants agreed to a power sharing deal in march even the socialists of sinn fein acknowledge that tax cuts have played a major role in irelands economic success and could have the same effect in the north mr brown is said to be hesitant to allow tax differentiation within the u k where corporate rates are set to fall to from next spring yet using fiscal policy to create growth rather than continue to restrain it would be a more effective and less expensive way of helping northern ireland and scotland and wales for that matter than pumping more state money into those economically laggard regions a study last year by the center for economics and business research found that public spending accounted for more than half of scotlands gdp nearly two thirds of waless and some three quarters of northern irelands thats far above the for all of britain and money wasted by westminster mr brown wasnt a renowned tax cutter in his decade at the british treasury but with catholics and protestants governing side by side in belfast these days maybe one more change of heart is possible
