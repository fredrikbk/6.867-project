business technology sun develops more potent chip for a new business sun microsystems inc has a plan to leapfrog competitors and build a new business all hanging by a kind of thread the silicon valley computer maker today unveils a microprocessor that is unusually efficient at executing "threads " which are sequences of programming instructions carried out simultaneously where most chips typically handle one to four threads at a time sun says its new offering can execute as many as at once suns new chip formally called ultrasparc t but known by the code name niagara doubles the maximum capacity of a chip based on a similar approach the santa clara calif company expects the new model to provide big performance advantages to the companys server systems sun chief executive jonathan schwartz predicted niagara will jump start sales of sun designed chips to companies including makers of such varied products as networking devices tv set top boxes and cars "its great to have the fastest microprocessor on earth " he said sun said niagara also conserves electricity a big issue in computer rooms another trend is to put the equivalent of more computing engines on each chip such so called multicore chips can run into bottlenecks waiting for data to be fetched from memory chips by adding circuitry sun allows them to execute additional threads while they wait says marc tremblay chief technology officer of suns microelectronics unit suns first niagara chip introduced in late has eight cores that each handle as many as four threads the eight cores in niagara can handle eight threads each one problem is that many programs cant easily be broken into threads for use by such chips thats one reason rival international business machines corp is putting more effort into improving each core by increasing its clock speed a measure of internal pulses that set the tempo for a microprocessor ibm says its new power chip with a record setting clock speed of gigahertz really deserves the title of the worlds fastest microprocessor scott handy an ibm vice president of marketing and strategy dismissed suns niagara as a "niche" product suited for a narrow set of problems sun says its operating system solaris is good at breaking tasks into threads as is other sun software based on its java programming language warren l habib chief technology officer of the photo sharing site fotolog is an enthusiastic customer of the first niagara chip between using the niagara chip and converting software to java "the performance efficiencies just went through the roof " he said fotolog which had been using about servers to run its operations before the conversion now needs only about niagara based machines and it gets better performance on those mr habib added he said he is likely to eventually consider servers based on niagara but he is getting so much benefit now that he wont be in the computer market for some time niagara joins a product family known as sparc the chips are designed by sun and manufactured by texas instruments inc sun partner fujitsu ltd also has compatible chips sun tried in the early s to sell sparc chips to other companies but later reversed that decision under its latest version of that strategy mr schwartz is most optimistic about selling chips to makers of products such as networking devices although the company would be willing to sell to competing computer makers too nathan brookwood an analyst at market research company insight praised the niagara s performance but he suspects competitors wont buy it "to get another system supplier to endorse your architecture is virtually impossible " he said
