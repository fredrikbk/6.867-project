in the work force but most young adults dont have health insurance because they dont think they need it says sam gibbs a senior vice president at ehealthinsurance "by far the largest reason is a sense of invincibility im young and healthy " he says not having insurance carries serious risks though certainly one is having a life threatening medical emergency without the resources to pay for care and there is the risk that if you have a lapse in coverage and develop a serious illness it could be much more difficult and costly to get health coverage later mr gibbs says insurance for recent graduates often is priced reasonably "if the everyday person spent some time doing research people would be surprised how affordable insurance can be " he says purchasing short term health insurance

hospitals network discounts can save you money and you want to be sure doctors and hospitals are in the network no matter where you move or visit it also is a good idea to find out whether you can
