looking to federally backed mortgage agencies to inject liquidity while others hope the federal reserve will offer a sign of relief as investors shy away from mortgage backed securities in the wake of recent trouble in the subprime market lenders are becoming more hesitant to issue mortgages of any stripe because they arent sure what rattled investors will pay for them the wall street journal writes this has caused the rates on even so called jumbo loans to rise which is unusual because rates on year treasurys have been declining and mortgage rates usually move in tandem with treasurys the journal notes doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association tells the paper that investors are fleeing from almost any loan that isnt guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac the government sponsored entities that provide funding for home loans fannie mae could potentially help alleviate some of the problems the largest source of money for u s home loans has asked its regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight for permission to increase the amount of mortgage assets it holds a person with knowledge of the request tells bloomberg another possibility is to lift the cap on the size of mortgages that fannie mae and freddie mac are allowed to buy they are currently restricted to &# for a single family home in most states the news agency writes jumbo loans which account for around of the total mortgage market exceed that limit and are prevalent in areas where the cost of buying a home is high such as new york city washington d c and california the journal says meanwhile high yield bonds and even european corporate debt are suffering from the new york times calls "the virtual seizing up of nearly the entire spectrum of the credit markets " debt instruments have had billions of dollars wiped out in a matter of weeks the times says with some analysts estimating that the high yield market alone has lost about &# billion in value since early june while losses in mortgage and asset backed securities markets could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the corporate sector concerns are rising over the big loans banks and brokerage houses have guaranteed to buyout firms to complete acquisitions the times writes while big firms such as citigroup or j p morgan have sizeable balance sheets to help them shoulder the weight of keeping such loans on their books smaller investment banks may face challenges the paper adds another area where the impact of tighter credit may be seen is company share buybacks standard &amp poors estimates that companies repurchased a record &# billion of stock in the second quarter alone but with troubles in the bond market "fewer companies may be buying back shares in the months to come " the journal says while corporate borrowing costs are still low companies are cutting back on debt issuance the paper adds noting that in july firms issued &# billion of corporate bonds a sharp decline from the &# billion issued in june against this backdrop wall street will be anxiously listening for what the federal reserve has to say at the end of its monetary policy meeting today "the sudden change in the financial atmosphere is emerging as the toughest test yet for ben bernanke as chairman of the federal reserve " the times writes and while the fed is expected to keep rates steady mr bernanke is under pressure to follow the lead of alan greenspan and open the door to a rate cut some time in the future others argue that markets should be left to sort out their own mess mark zandi chief economist at moodys economy com tells the associated press "the fed has argued for some time that risks were improperly priced to bail investors out at the first sign of losses would be a mistake that would just engender more risk taking in the future " judge orders release of surveillance documents new york city was ordered to release thousands of pages of raw intelligence documents relating to the new york police departments surveillance of protest groups before the republican convention in a case that pitted concerns over free speech against the police departments methods of maintaining public order u s magistrate judge james c francis iv ordered the disclosure of reports by undercover officers who compiled dossiers on protesters but he also agreed to the deletion of sensitive information from the documents in order to protect the identities of those officers as well as confidential informants more than a year before the convention undercover officers traveled across the u s and even to canada and europe to conduct surveillance on groups ranging from antiwar activists and environmentalists to church groups and street theater companies the new york times writes the main dispute in the case was whether the city was required to disclose the names of the groups that police had monitored but judge francis found that protesters had a "substantial need" for the information according to the new york law journal the judge also observed that turning over redacted documents would reveal little about police surveillance tactics more than people were arrested at the convention and court documents have shown that arrested protesters were held before their initial court appearances "up to six times longer than those arrested on charges unrelated to the convention " the associated press says the new york civil liberties union which filed the lawsuit on behalf of some of those detained argued that the delays were aimed at keeping protesters off the streets but the police say the delays were few and were due to the large number of people arrested within a short time the ap notes the city will determine whether to appeal after reviewing the information the judge has ordered produced "to determine whether the disclosure will compromise the programs or personnel of the n y p d intelligence division " peter farrell the citys senior lawyer in the case tells the times also of note wall street journal the bush administration let stand a u s international trade commission ruling that bans imports of new models of cellphones containing
