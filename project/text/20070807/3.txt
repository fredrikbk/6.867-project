after the ravages of war a rescue plan the most noble adventure by greg behrman free press pages &# every american generation very much including our own believes it lives in uniquely dangerous times that call for better and stronger leadership but with the exception of the era of the founding fathers and the period of the civil war it is hard to think of a more challenging period in u s history than the years immediately following world war ii or of a more maligned president than harry truman within the space of a few years truman had to confront a hostile soviet union becoming a nuclear power the triumph of communism in china a prolonged and bloody war in korea the blockading of berlin by the soviets and insurgencies threatening greece and turkey all this against the backdrop of a postwar europe economically devastated and politically divided perhaps the most important and constructive american initiative in these years was the marshall plan which set western europe on its feet economically the initiative is the centerpiece of greg behrmans "the most noble adventure " the books appearance coincides with the th anniversary of the plan named for secretary of state george marshall given the growing american impatience with u s efforts to help pacify and reconstruct iraq it is reassuring to read that the marshall plan so widely hailed now by both democrats and republicans for saving western europe from communism was bitterly contested at its creation republicans accused their democratic opponents in the truman administration of squandering american tax dollars to support "european socialism " political figures on both sides of the aisle argued in a refrain heard often today though mostly from democrats that america should spend its money on needs at home not abroad the press was less negative in those days than now nonetheless many writers criticized marshall for not working closely enough with the republicans in congress unbeknownst to reporters marshall had made sen arthur vandenberg a michigan republican and the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee a full partner in every major aspect of shaping the plan without vandenberg there likely wouldnt have been a marshall plan as for the american publics views according to mr behrman only of americans at the time were even aware of the marshall plan compared with who had heard about flying saucer sightings something of a fad back then of those who knew about it supported higher taxes to fund it and were opposed to it altogether fortunately harry truman not unlike george w bush wasnt easily dispirited by approval ratings that sank to in public opinion polls truman was fond of saying "i wonder how far moses would have gone if hed taken a poll in egypt " mr behrman who is a fellow at the aspen institute acknowledges that numerous histories and in depth analyses have been written about the marshall plan what he seeks to do is to write a narrative history that "profiles the personalities and examines the main themes and currents shaping the enterprise start to finish " while the writing doesnt sing the book is a readable blend of the politics and people who brought about what the historian thomas bailey called "the greatest act of statesmanship in the nations history " under the bipartisan leadership of marshall and vandenberg americans who had just fought world war ii to save europe from adolf hitler provided europe with &# billion between june and december in todays dollars mr behrman says the amount would be &# billion when calculated as a comparable share of u s gross domestic product the total would exceed &# billion and this for reconstruction rather than war the major players in mr behrmans tale include not only vandenberg but paul hoffman the chief executive of studebaker who oversaw the plans disbursements diplomat averell harriman economic architect richard bissell undersecretary of state and plan evangelist will clayton and of course george marshall that rare washington figure who is described as "free of vanity " indeed when franklin roosevelt named marshall chief of staff of the u s army in with the task of mobilizing america for war marshall accepted on the condition he could always say what he thought to maintain this independent posture and remain free of roosevelts fabled charm marshall never visited the presidents hyde park estate when roosevelt once called him "george " marshall responded that he was "george" only to his wife marshall was so low key that at a june luncheon speech at harvard when he outlined europes dire condition and unveiled his determination to lend economic help the talk was largely ignored by the leading american newspapers and wire services government officials have since learned the art of pre speech publicity to ensure that important statements dont go unnoticed but british foreign secretary ernest bevin lying in his bed in london and listening to marshall on bbc radio immediately grasped the significance of what the american was proposing "it was like a lifeline to sinking men " he said mr behrman captures the drama of europes postwar desperation some million europeans lived on fewer than calories a day and he emphasizes the conviction of marshall planners that europe should take the lead in its own recovery "only the europeans can save europe " averell harriman declared paul hoffman echoed that view "i had a strong belief that no plan imposed by a group of planners in washington could possibly be effective the essence of genuine leadership is to share power with people rather than display power over people " would that ambassador paul bremer who styled himself as viceroy of iraq as he led the coalition provisional authority in had held similar views the determination to work with european countries and yet insist that europeans mitigate their nationalism and integrate their many small economies into a larger and more vital one had a salutary effect in four short years western europes industrial production rose above prewar levels and a long slow process began that would culminate decades later in the establishment of the european union by europe had turned the corner at the outset marshall gauged americans tolerance for the enormous undertaking he had in mind "the country wont stand for this for long " he was right with the advent of the korean war in washington shifted focus from stopping a european slide into communism to combating communism in asia the decline in defense spending that had helped to free up funds for the marshall plan was no longer possible america quickly sent troops to korea though they proved to be poorly trained and equipped meanwhile leading republicans accused the truman administration of having concentrated too much on europe while "losing" china to the communists george marshall once a hero for mobilizing americas military might to win world war ii and americas economic might to save europe after the war was now excoriated as a "cats paw and pawn" for truman administration "traitors " indianas republican sen william jenner lambasted marshall as an "errand boy a stooge or a conspirator for this administrations crazy assortment of collectivist cutthroat crackpots and communist fellow traveling appeasers " some things in washington never change though today it is the democrats leveling vicious charges at a republican administration and that is one of the uplifting lessons of "the most noble adventure " somehow over time ordinary americans have the good sense despite all the exaggerated rhetoric in washington to elect leaders who understand the need for american global leadership and who have the courage as harry truman did then and george w bush has now to defy polls and the vicissitudes of popularity ratings in pursuit of principle ms house a former journal publisher won a pulitzer prize for reporting on the middle east
