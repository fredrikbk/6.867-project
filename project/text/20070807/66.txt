northern exposure republicans faced a time for choosing last week when senate democrats brought to the floor an ethics "reform" bill that may make it easier for congress to dole out pork barrel spending in the words of gop sen tom coburn the bill "not only failed to drain the swamp but gave the alligators new rights " rather than block the legislation and insist on better reforms image sensitive republicans largely backed the bill have they learned anything they lost control of congress last year in no small measure because the gop had become identified with the culture of pork barrel spending frittering away the american peoples former confidence in them on fiscal issues if senate republicans had united and voted against the bill democrats would have been forced to draw up more meaningful reforms they might even have forced senate majority leader harry reid to accept the very "sunshine" provisions the senate unanimously adopted in january so at least the public would know who is doling out pork but when it came down to it only voted for prolonging debate on the bill the bill the rest voted for had been gutted disclosing an earmark is now voluntary not mandatory protecting an earmark requires only votes instead of and the power to determine whether a spending provision inserted by a senator is officially considered an earmark will now be up to mr reid the latest wall street journal nbc news poll finds democrats lead republicans by points on controlling government spending and by nine points on taxes the republicans have their work cut out for them if they want to win back public confidence but their behavior on the ethics bill shows they still dont get it and then came one of those coincidences that can sometimes become a turning point in politics at nearly the same time the earmark reforms were voted on in the senate the fbi was in alaska raiding the home of sen ted stevens a senior republican looking for evidence of whether he diverted earmarks to benefit his son and business partners if you thought jack abramoff was a symbol of washington sleaze just wait to see what happens if mr stevens is further embroiled in scandal theres no question that mr stevens is an aggressive pork barreler the main airport in anchorage is named after him and in he championed funds to build the now infamous "bridge to nowhere" actually it was to build a &# million bridge to an island with people on it he became the butt of jokes and stories surfaced about his ties to bill allen then ceo of the oil services giant veco an fbi probe of veco led to several indictments and a raid last year of the offices of ben stevens mr stevenss son who was at the time president of the alaska state senate meanwhile don young alaskas only member of the u s house of representatives and former chairman of the transportation committee is under federal investigation for his own ties to veco mr allen recently pleaded guilty to bribing state legislators and is cooperating with authorities the raid on mr stevenss house is linked to more than &# of renovation work done on that dwelling that was overseen by mr allen mr stevens insists "we paid every bill that was given to us with our own money " privately many republican senators believe mr stevens may be forced to retire next year "the suspicions are great " one gop senator told me "hes toast you start out thinking you are representing your state and you take one step after another until suddenly youre primarily representing your friends in the state " thats a path many others in congress have trod which is why real earmark reform is necessary now of course its not just the senate over in the house several republicans face investigations over earmarks including former appropriations chairman jerry lewis of california but if pork remains part of the gop governing model its one that voters are starting to reject in exit polls last year those who actually showed up to vote reported that political corruption was a more important issue than the war in iraq in alaska where they have seen incumbent republican arrogance up close voters last year sent gop gov frank murkowski packing upstart sarah palin defeated him in a primary by a wide margin and then won in the fall her approval ratings now top her secret is that she won over voters by campaigning against corruption within her own party much as nicolas sarkozy was able to do in france last week republican senators misread the stevens scandal as a signal they had to back a symbolic but in truth a sham ethics bill president bush who has the advantage of not facing voters again has called its earmark provisions "worthless " he should veto the bill he may be overridden but he will do republicans a favor by forcing them to rethink their attachment to an earmark culture that is both destructive of honest budgeting and politically dangerous because of the inherent corruption it creates mr fund is a columnist for opinionjournal com
