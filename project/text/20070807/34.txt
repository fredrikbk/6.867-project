enterprise how small firms can weather a credit crunch financial documents collateral will give borrowers an edge a credit crunch could be on the way for small businesses and it is crucial that they prepare themselves for the possibility banks nervous about the prospect of more borrowers defaulting on loans have been tightening their purse strings when it comes to lending money to consumers and major corporations and industry experts say lending jitters may soon extend to small firms as well making it harder for them to find loans in recent years credit has been relatively easy to come by as banks aggressively pursued entrepreneurs offering larger loans at cheap rates to untested companies most bank executives say that for now they have neither toughened lending standards nor raised interest rates on loans to small businesses "the small business market despite all we hear and see is still really vibrant " says bob ash wachovia corp s national sales manager for small business "i dont think anybodys letting off the pedal at this point " but banks say some businesses that received loans in recent years are falling behind on payments and default rates are expected to accelerate as a result experts say some lenders are already tightening their lending criteria and they expect more to follow suit so small companies may want to think about ways to insulate themselves from the possibility of a credit crunch basic steps including picking a bank that caters to their situation keeping detailed financial records and being prepared to put up personal assets like homes as collateral can make a big difference for young companies seeking funding if business owners think they may need a credit line or loan in the near future "i would get on this now because it could be much harder in two or three months " says seamus mcmahon a vice president in new york for booz allen hamilton inc a mclean va based consulting firm one of the most important decisions small businesses face as they hunt for loans is which bank to turn to business owners should keep in mind how different types of banks evaluate loan applications big institutions that promise speedy approvals or rejections of applications generally rely on sophisticated credit scoring models based in large part on the business owners personal credit history by contrast community banks credit unions and other smaller lenders often lean more heavily on their knowledge of the local economy and the would be borrowers business model and track record of running or launching businesses small businesses should "figure out if they fit better with the point scoring model or if playing golf with the loan officer would help " says bill dunkelberg chief economist at the national federation of independent businesses and chairman of a small bank in cherry hill n j under this theory an entrepreneur with a sterling credit history but plans for a risky venture may be better served by seeking a loan from a major bank someone with scuffed credit but a successful business background probably should visit a local lender small businesses also can turn to credit unions which are nonprofit institutions owned by their depositors credit unions tend to make smaller loans than banks and have been making a big push to attract more small business customers says mike schenk senior economist at the credit union national association a trade group based in madison wis "we are willing to make loans that for profit institutions generally arent willing to make " he says in addition entrepreneurs should look for lenders with programs aimed at specific types of small businesses some small banks cater to certain industries and several large banks including pnc financial services group inc and keycorp are targeting women who run small businesses pittsburgh based pnc has vowed to lend &# billion over five years to women owned businesses which are starting up at roughly twice the pace of small businesses owned by men according to karen larrimer pncs executive vice president for business banking when applying for loans it also helps to have an existing relationship with the bank "if youve been working with a banker who knows your business you come out better in the long run " says gay abbott executive vice president for commercial banking at suntrust banks inc in atlanta the banker "becomes a partner with the business much like an accountant or an attorney " she says while some banks have been hawking loans that dont require business owners to provide much financial documentation beyond recent tax returns thats starting to change says marilyn landis the next chairwoman of the national small business association a washington based advocacy group when applying for loans small businesses should be ready to produce cash flow statements and balance sheets even if the lender doesnt demand that kind of documentation having it on hand is likely to impress bankers and could tip the scales in favor of getting a loan approved young businesses often arent accustomed to maintaining such detailed records ms landis says but many banks now offer generally for a monthly or annual fee cash flow management and other record keeping services designed to help small businesses keep tabs on their finances entrepreneurs in search of funding also need to be prepared to put their personal assets like a home on the line but experts say that with home values stalling or falling in many parts of the country business owners shouldnt count on that as the only collateral as banks get more skittish steven rogers director of the levy entrepreneur institute at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management in evanston ill says while small business owners often are uncomfortable with putting their homes up as collateral banks often demand it because its a "testament to your conviction that this is something you really believe in "
