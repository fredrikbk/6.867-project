debt bomb inside the subprime mortgage debacle seeds of excess how credit got so easy and why its tightening responses to s&amp l mess asian crisis tech bust all fed into the boom fourth in a series an extraordinary credit boom that created many first time homeowners and financed a wave of corporate takeovers seems to be waning home buyers with poor credit are having trouble borrowing institutional investors from milwaukee to dusseldorf to sydney are reporting losses banks are stuck with corporate debt that investors wont buy stocks are on a roller coaster with financial powerhouses like bear stearns cos and blackstone group coming under intense pressure the origins of the boom and this unfolding reversal predate last years mistakes they trace to changes in the banking system provoked by the collapse of the savings and loan industry in the s the reaction of governments to the asian financial crisis of the late s and the federal reserves response to the bursting of the tech stock bubble when the fed cut interest rates to the lowest level in a generation to avoid a severe downturn then chairman alan greenspan anticipated that making short term credit so cheap would have unintended consequences "i dont know what it is but were doing some damage because this is not the way credit markets should operate " he and a colleague recall him saying at the time now the consequences of moves the fed and others made are becoming clearer low interest rates engineered by central banks and reinforced by a tidal wave of overseas savings fueled home prices and leveraged buyouts pension funds and endowments unhappy with skimpy returns shoved cash at hedge funds and private equity firms which borrowed heavily to make big bets the investments of choice were opaque financial instruments that shifted default risk from lenders to global investors the question now when the dust settles will the world be better off "these adverse periods are very painful but theyre inevitable if we choose to maintain a system in which people are free to take risks a necessary condition for maximum sustainable economic growth " mr greenspan says today the evolving financial architecture is distributing risks away from highly leveraged banks toward investors better able to handle them keeping the banks and economy more stable than in the past he says economic growth particularly outside the u s is strong and even in the u s unemployment remains low the financial system has absorbed the latest shock so far but credit problems once seen as isolated to a few subprime mortgage lenders are beginning to propagate across markets and borders in unpredicted ways and degrees a system designed to distribute and absorb risk might instead have bred it by making it so easy for investors to buy complex securities they didnt fully understand and the interconnectedness of markets could mean that a sudden change in sentiment by investors in all sorts of markets could destabilize the financial system and hurt economic growth when a technology stock and investment plunge and the sept terrorist attacks pushed the economy into recession in the fed slashed interest rates but even by mid job creation and business investment were still anemic and the inflation rate was slipping toward the fed began to study japans unhappy bout with deflation generally declining prices which made it harder to repay debts and left the central bank seemingly powerless to stimulate growth "even though we perceive the risks of deflation as minor the potential consequences are very substantial and could be quite negative " mr greenspan said in may a month later the fed cut the target for its key federal funds interest rate a benchmark for all short term rates to it said the rate would stay there as long as necessary figuring low rates would bolster housing and consumer spending until business investment and exports recovered the rate stayed at for a year mr greenspan raised vague fears with colleagues over the possibility this policy could create distortions in the economy but he says today that such risks were an acceptable price for insuring against deflation "central banks cannot avoid taking risks such trade offs are an integral part of policy we were always confronted with choices " fed officials who were there at the time generally maintain their policy was right even in hindsight the economy has grown steadily avoiding both deflation and serious inflation yet some say they may have planted seeds of excess in the housing and subprime loan markets robert eisenbeis retired research director at the federal reserve bank of atlanta says the fed overreacted to the threat of deflation and kept rates low for too long as a result it "overstimulated the housing market and now were dealing with the consequences " edward gramlich a fed governor in washington from to says he failed to realize at the time that low rates were making it so easy for lenders to market subprime mortgages with low introductory rates the fed and other regulators could have prevented some of the resulting pain with more rigorous supervision of mortgage lenders besides banks he says "we didnt have that and were paying for it now " in june the fed began to raise the short term target rate eventually taking it to where it has been for the past year such a boost usually leads to a rise as well in long term rates which are important to rates on year conventional mortgages and corporate bonds this time it didnt mr greenspan expressed concern that investors were willing to accept low returns for taking on risk "what they perceive as newly abundant liquidity can readily disappear " he said in august six months before retiring "history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums " looking back he says today "we tried in to move long term rates higher in order to get mortgage interest rates up and take some of the fizz out of the housing market but we failed " something besides fed policy was at work both mr greenspan and his successor ben bernanke point to an unanticipated surge in capital pouring into the u s from overseas in june u s treasury officials made a plea to china that they would be reminded of repeatedly in the following years thailand had devalued its currency in touching off a crisis in the region that led other countries to devalue and in some cases default on foreign debt the yen was sliding chinese officials who pegged their currency to the u s dollar "let it be known that if things kept going this way theyd have no choice but to devalue " recalls ted truman a treasury official at the time the u s fearing such a move would trigger another round of devaluations urged the chinese to hold their peg and praised them when they did so but times changed as recessions and depressed currencies held down imports and goosed exports in other asian countries the countries ran trade surpluses that replenished foreign exchange reserves determined never to be so tied to the onerous conditions of the international monetary fund they have kept those policies in place thai reserves effectively exhausted in now stand at &# billion long after the crisis passed chinas economic fundamentals suggested its currency should rise against the dollar china let it rise only slowly continuing to juice exports and produce trade surpluses that pushed chinas foreign exchange reserves above &# trillion when the u s pressed china to let its currency float china reminded the u s of the fixed exchange rates stabilizing role in china put much of its cash part of what mr bernanke has called a "global saving glut" into u s treasurys helping hold down long term u s

been in the mortgage business since the late s for most of that time a borrower had to fully document his income lenders offered the first no documentation loans in the mid s but for no more than of the value of the house being purchased a few years back he says that began to change as wall street investment banks and wholesalers demanded ever more mortgages from even the least creditworthy or "subprime" customers "all of us felt the suction from wall street one day you would get an email saying we will buy no doc loans at loan to value and an old timer like me had never seen one " says mr barnes "it wasnt long before the no doc emails said " until the late s the subprime market was dominated by home equity lines used by borrowers to consolidate debt and by loans on mobile homes but when the fed held rates down after lenders could offer borrowers with sketchy credit histories adjustable rate mortgages with introductory rates that seemed affordable mr barnes says customers were asking about " " subprime loans these offered a low starter rate for two years then adjusted for the remaining to a rate that was often three percentage points higher than a prime customer normally paid customers he says seldom appreciated how high that rate could be once the fed returned rates to normal levels demand from consumers on one side and wall street and its customers on the other side prompted lenders to make more and more subprime loans originations rose to &# billion or more in both and from &# billion in according to inside mortgage finance an industry publication at first delinquencies were surprisingly low as a result the credit ratings for bonds backed by the mortgages assumed a modest default rate standards for getting a mortgage fell about of all subprime loans in went to borrowers who didnt fully document their income making it easier for them to overstate their creditworthiness the delinquency rate was a mirage it was low mainly because home prices were rising so much that borrowers who fell behind could easily refinance when home prices stopped rising in and fell in some regions that game ended borrowers with subprime loans made in fell behind on monthly payments much more quickly than mortgages made a year or two earlier when banks get in trouble federal deposit insurance encourages depositors not to flee and in extremis banks can borrow directly from the fed but banks are no longer the dominant lenders after the s&amp l crisis in the s and early s regulators insisted banks and thrifts hold more capital against risky loans this tipped the playing field in favor of unregulated lenders they financed themselves not by deposits but by wall street credit lines and by "securitization" of their loans in effect the sale of the loans to investors the consequences proved painful new century financial corp founded in by three former s&amp l executives was the nations second largest subprime lender by when its borrowers began falling behind wall street cut off its lines of credit and forced it to buy back some of its poorly performing loans new century couldnt fall back on deposit insurance or the fed it filed for bankruptcy

they might not be able to borrow as much as they needed "we were coming out of a pretty bad credit cycle " says daniel toscano managing director at deutsche bank which helped to manage the fund raising instead they tapped into a gusher within a year dex media inc as the business became known was back in the market it borrowed &# million to pay a dividend to carlyle and welsh carson and then &# million more to pay another dividend in just months the private equity buyers made back most of their investment and still owned the company by the volume of such leveraged buyouts was smashing records from the s generous credit markets enabled private equity firms to do larger deals and pay themselves bigger dividends they boosted returns and attracted more investors which enabled even bigger deals as in subprime mortgages lenders began to ease borrowing requirements they agreed for instance to "covenant lite debt " which dropped once standard performance requirements and "pik toggle" notes which allowed borrowers to toggle interest payments on and off like a faucet bankers began marketing debt deals for companies that unlike yellow pages didnt have comfortable cash flow there was chrysler burning cash rather than producing it and there was first data corp whose post takeover cash flow would barely cover interest payments and capital spending according to standard

role managers of pension and endowment funds long had divided their assets among domestic stocks bonds and cash the funds saw their performance suffer when the stock market and then bond yields

interest rates made many investors willing to buy exotic securities in an effort to boost returns wall street had just the vehicle securitization or turning loans that once sat quietly on banks books into securities that can be sold in global markets securitization long common in conventional mortgages had been supercharged in the early s when the federal resolution trust corp took over s&amp ls that held more than &# billion of assets though some thought it would take the rtc a century to unload them it took only a few years the agency successfully securitized new classes of assets such as delinquent home loans or commercial loans in the late s wall street went a step further packaging bigger pools of securities into collateralized debt obligations or cdos and carving them into "tranches " each with a different level of risk and return riskier tranches suffered the first losses if some underlying loans defaulted other tranches offered lower returns because riskier tranches would take the first hits if the business went sour because of the way they were structured some cdo tranches got triple a ratings from moodys investors service and standard &amp poors even though they contained subprime loans that lured traditionally conservative investors such as commercial banks insurance companies and pension funds the upside was evident many borrowers got loans they wouldnt otherwise have had the taxpayer backed deposit fund was less likely to bear the cost of sloppy lending practices banks shifted risks to investors more willing to bear them leaving the banks able to make more loans investors could pick either more risky or less risky slices and wall street middlemen made handsome profits now the downside too is painfully evident final investors were so many steps removed from the original loans that it became hard for them to know the true value and risk of securities they bought some were satisfied with a triple a rating on a cdo seemingly as safe as a u s treasury bond but with more yield yet as defaults ate through the cushion of lower rated tranches with unexpected speed rating agencies were forced to rethink their models and lower the ratings on many of these investments some structures were so opaque that markets couldnt value them but ratings cuts sometimes forced an acknowledgment that securities owned werent worth as much as

distribute risk can end up multiplying it instead in ways neither regulators nor investors fully understand mr grantham the boston money manager says his portfolios are behaving in ways he hadnt expected fed officials believe that even if their policies led to housing and debt bubbles the strength of the overall economy shows that the policy was on balance the right one of course that assumes the current problems dont culminate in a recession market veterans predict the most egregious underwriting practices and products will disappear but the benefits of innovation will continue lessons have been learned the hard way "the structures are here to stay " says glenn reynolds chief executive of research firm creditsights "but you have to run it like a prudent risk taking venture not like its casino night and youre on a bender "
