democrats raise heat on mortgage overhaul washington as a wave of mortgage foreclosures buffets financial markets and feeds voter economic anxiety democratic presidential candidates are jockeying to get ahead of the emerging issue the latest democratic front runner hillary rodham clinton is scheduled to unveil today a plan to combat "mortgage lending abuse" another example of the democratic partys increasing willingness to explore new regulations on business and markets the u s senator from new york is proposing a package of measures that would impose new disclosure requirements on mortgage brokers and curb their ability to dictate lending terms specifically mrs clinton is planning to say today that she would force brokers to state their fees in plain language require a full disclosure of monthly tax and insurance costs for subprime loans and ban prepayment penalties on all home mortgages this latter proposal could shake up the industry one analyst said thomas lawler a consultant who used to work for government sponsored mortgage lender fannie mae said the mortgage industry will resist the package arguing that it will further dry up credit for many americans he said mrs clintons proposal could also make mortgages more expensive for conventional borrowers with good credit scores mrs clinton is part of an increasing number of democratic politicians who advocate new rules for the mortgage industry as the subprime meltdown of recent months has weighed on financial markets world wide one rival former sen john edwards of north carolina has proposed setting up bailout pools to assist homeowners facing foreclosure and easing bankruptcy rules for people in danger of losing their houses another democratic contender sen chris dodd of connecticut chairman of the senate banking committee has held hearings about predatory lending his may "housing summit" involving industry officials and consumer advocates suggested changes to current lending practices that lenders would eventually agree to voluntarily in lieu of future legislation housing isnt the only issue where candidates are moving away from the partys s shift to the economic center in iowa yesterday mr edwards blasted free trade agreements and proposed a ban on future pacts unless they include strong labor and environmental components he also proposed giving the treasury department more tools to counter countries such as china that "manipulate" their currencies in order to give themselves a trade advantage so far such economic topics remain largely the focus of democrats in the presidential race few if any of the nine republican candidates have mentioned housing perhaps the closest to acknowledging problems in the industry is republican mitt romney who signed an antipredatory lending law in as governor of massachusetts what may be the most significant of mrs clintons mortgage proposals is her call for an end to prepayment penalty riders on all mortgage products advocates of such riders which prevent borrowers from paying off mortgages early say they make mortgages easier to resell on secondary markets by guaranteeing a fixed rate of return to an investor the tradeoff advocates say is that consumers often get a lower rate of interest when they agree to a prepayment penalty but overhaul advocates say the riders are often used by subprime lenders to prevent holders of subprime adjustable mortgages from refinancing their loans at a lower rate with a rival lender mrs clintons other proposals deal with transparency one would require mortgage brokers to disclose to borrowers that they make bigger commissions if the loans they sell carry higher interest rates or are larded with upfront fees this disclosure of the so called yield spread premium that brokers receive is technically disclosed already in loan documents but is so loaded with jargon that few understand what it says the third main plank in mrs clintons policy would require lenders to include in the monthly payment estimate taxes and insurance on all higher risk mortgages deborah solomon contributed to this article
