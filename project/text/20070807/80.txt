propaganda redux during last weeks two day summit british prime minister gordon brown thanked president bush for leading the global war on terror mr brown acknowledged "the debt the world owes to the u s for its leadership in this fight against international terrorism" and vowed to follow winston churchills lead and make britains ties with america even stronger mr browns statements elicited anger from many of mr bushs domestic detractors who claim the president concocted the war on terror for personal gain but as someone who escaped from communist romania with two death sentences on his head in order to become a citizen of this great country i have a hard time understanding why some of our top political leaders can dare in a time of war to call our commander in chief a "liar " a "deceiver" and a "fraud " i spent decades scrutinizing the u s from europe and i learned that international respect for america is directly proportional to americas own respect for its president my father spent most of his life working for general motors in romania and had a picture of president truman in our house in bucharest while "america" was a vague place somewhere thousands of miles away he was her tangible symbol for us it was he who had helped save civilization from the nazi barbarians and it was he who helped restore our freedom after the war if only for a brief while we learned that america loved truman and we loved america it was as simple as that later when i headed romanias intelligence station in west germany everyone there admired america too people would often tell me that the "amis" meant the difference between night and day in their lives by "night" they meant east germany where their former compatriots were scraping along under economic privation and stasi brutality that was then but in september a german cabinet minister herta dauebler gmelin had the nerve to compare mr bush to hitler in one post iraq war poll of canadas teenagers called the u s "evil " and even before the fall of saddam of greeks answered "neither" when asked which country was more democratic the u s or iraq sowing the seeds of anti americanism by discrediting the american president was one of the main tasks of the soviet bloc intelligence community during the years i worked at its top levels this same strategy is at work today but it is regarded as bad manners to point out the soviet parallels for communists only the leader counted no matter the country friend or foe at home they deified their own ruler as to a certain extent still holds true in russia abroad they asserted that a fish starts smelling from the head and they did everything in their power to make the head of the free world stink the communist effort to generate hatred for the american president began soon after president truman set up nato and propelled the three western occupation forces to unite their zones to form a new west german nation we were tasked to take advantage of the reawakened patriotic feelings stirring in the european countries that had been subjugated by the nazis in order to shift their hatred for hitler over into hatred for truman the leader of the new "occupation power " western europe was still grateful to the u s for having restored its freedom but it had strong leftist movements that we secretly financed they were like putty in our hands the european leftists like any totalitarians needed a tangible enemy and we gave them one in no time they began beating their drums decrying president truman as the "butcher of hiroshima " we went on to spend many years and many billions of dollars disparaging subsequent presidents eisenhower as a war mongering "shark" run by the military industrial complex johnson as a mafia boss who had bumped off his predecessor nixon as a petty tyrant ford as a dimwitted football player and jimmy carter as a bumbling peanut farmer in when i left romania for good the bloc intelligence community had already collected million signatures on a "yankees go home" petition at the same time launching the slogan "europe for the europeans " during the vietnam war we spread vitriolic stories around the world pretending that americas presidents sent genghis khan style barbarian soldiers to vietnam who raped at random taped electrical wires to human genitals cut off limbs blew up bodies and razed entire villages those werent facts they were our tales but some seven million americans ended up being convinced their own president not communism was the enemy as yuri andropov who conceived this dezinformatsiya war against the u s used to tell me people are more willing to believe smut than holiness the final goal of our anti american offensive was to discourage the u s from protecting the world against communist terrorism and expansion sadly we succeeded after u s forces precipitously pulled out of vietnam the victorious communists massacred some two million people in vietnam laos and cambodia another million tried to escape but many died in the attempt this tragedy also created a credibility gap between america and the rest of the world damaged the cohesion of american foreign policy and poisoned domestic debate in the u s unfortunately partisans today have taken a page from the old soviet playbook at the democratic national convention for example bush critics continued our mud slinging at americas commander in chief one speaker martin omalley now governor of maryland had earlier in the summer stated he was more worried about the actions of the bush administration than about al qaeda on another occasion retired four star general wesley clark gave michael moore a platform to denounce the american commander in chief as a "deserter " and visitors to the national chairman of the democratic party had to step across a doormat depicting the american president surrounded by the words "give bush the boot " competition is indeed the engine that has driven the american dream forward but unity in time of war has made america the leader of the world during world war ii americans died to defeat nazism but their country of immigrants remained sturdily united the u s held national elections during the war but those running for office entertained no thought of damaging americas international prestige in their quest for personal victory republican challenger thomas dewey declined to criticize president roosevelts war policy at the end of that war a united america rebuilt its vanquished enemies it took seven years to turn nazi germany and imperial japan into democracies but that effort generated an unprecedented technological explosion and years of unmatched prosperity for us all now we are again at war it is not the presidents war it is americas war authorized by house members and senators i do not intend to join the armchair experts on the iraq war i do not know how we should handle this war and they dont know either but i do know that if americas political leaders democrat and republican join together as they did during world war ii america will win otherwise terrorism will win abu musab al zarqawi predicted just before being killed "we fight today in iraq tomorrow in the land of the holy places and after there in the west " on july i celebrated years since president carter signed off on my request for political asylum and i am still tremendously proud that the leader of the free world granted me my freedom during these years i have lived here under five presidents some better than others but i have always felt that i was living in paradise my american citizenship has given me a feeling of pride hope and security that is surpassed only by the joy of simply being alive there are millions of other immigrants who are equally proud that they restarted their lives from scratch in order to be in this magnanimous country i appeal to them to help keep our beloved america united and honorable we may not be able to change the habits of our current political representatives but we may be able to introduce healthy new blood into the u s congress for once the communists got it right it is americas leader that counts lets return to the traditions of presidents who accepted nothing short of unconditional surrender from our deadly enemies lets vote next year for people who believe in americas future not for the ones who live in the cold war past lt gen pacepa is the highest ranking intelligence official ever to have defected from the soviet bloc his new book "programmed to kill lee harvey oswald the
