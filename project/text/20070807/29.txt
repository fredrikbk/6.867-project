chryslers new era begins under nardelli cost cuts uaw pact are early priorities hints about asset sales robert nardelli presented a congenial image of himself in his first appearance as head of chrysler llc but analysts predict the hard charging former home depot inc chief executive soon will crank up pressure to cut costs and increase revenue on behalf of chryslers new majority owner cerberus capital management lp "we have the ability to move with speed we have the ability to move with flexibility " said mr nardelli chryslers new chairman and chief executive during a news conference yesterday at chrysler headquarters in auburn hills mich the company may be able to move quickly to "monetize some assets" that may not be fully valued mr nardelli said in a possible reference to asset sales he didnt elaborate mr nardelli comes to detroit carrying baggage from a messy exit this year from home depot where he left after failing to reignite its slowing sales and sagging stock price he also came under attack for his &# million exit package a chrysler turnaround could redeem his reputation people familiar with the matter say mr nardelli lobbied cerberus aggressively for the ceo job mr nardelli will receive a nominal salary of &# a year according to people familiar with the matter he will receive equity to ensure he is compensated only if the company improves these people said though they wouldnt disclose further terms mr nardelli spent much of his first day on the job reaching out to reassure constituents who could make or break his tenure among them united auto workers president ron gettelfinger a group of chrysler dealers and chrysler employees starting with chrysler vice chairman and president tom lasorda whom mr nardelli will succeed as ceo during the news conference mr nardelli often put a hand on mr lasordas shoulder deferring to him to answer questions from reporters but people who know how cerberus and mr nardelli operate say they expect mr nardelli will soon push for further cost cutting and additional efforts to streamline operations while looking for new revenue opportunities for the ailing company "chrysler is a huge investment for cerberus and it didnt want to take any chances " a person familiar with the matter said chrysler spokesman mike aberlich said mr nardellis aggressive style is an asset for chrysler "being a disciplinarian is a good thing because we have a plan but we really have to execute it and thats what bob brings to the table " he said jeffrey sonnenfeld a senior associate dean at yale universitys school of management said mr nardelli "works and expects that of his people " in stressing execution "he goes for obedience and loyalty " mr sonnenfeld added mr nardelli said yesterday he has no plans to launch a new strategy at the ailing auto maker but will focus instead on executing a restructuring plan already in place he also said it would be premature to discuss cutting costs further and added that the focus wont just be on "head count but also on head content " and part of his job will be to make sure that employees are utilized to their fullest potential chryslers restructuring plan put together by mr lasorda who retains his title as chrysler president calls for eliminating jobs and making a &# billion investment in engine systems with improved fuel economy the company also plans to close its newark del factory and will eliminate shifts at other plants some analysts are skeptical that mr nardelli really intends to do nothing more than execute his predecessors plan effectively erich merkle an auto analyst with auto industry research firm irn said he expected mr nardelli was brought in to "slash and burn" at chrysler cutting costs and streamlining operations the results from that effort and crucial products such as chrysler minivans and a redesigned dodge ram pickup truck that is slated to hit showrooms next year should produce profit for chrysler he said mr merkle said he expects the new owners to prepare chrysler for a quick sale to another buyer since the sale of an stake in chrysler was announced in may cerberus has said it will be a long term investor and mr nardelli said he has no plans to leave chrysler the biggest and most immediate problem facing chrysler the smallest of the three unionized detroit auto makers is the uaw chrysler ford motor co and general motors corp recently began talks with the uaw toward a new national agreement in september the auto makers want to restructure more than &# billion in health care debts owed to uaw retirees messrs nardelli and lasorda spoke to mr gettelfinger the uaw president for two hours about the management change during that meeting mr nardelli said the union leader brought up his home depot exit package which angered shareholders in the home improvement retailer who felt the compensation was undeserved given the performance of the company mr gettelfinger spoke briefly to employees after the news conference saying "we want to add our welcome to mr nardelli as chairman and ceo " mr nardelli said he hoped he could establish a relationship with the uaw based on mutual trust and emphasized that mr lasorda will continue to lead the negotiations with the uaw this summer mr nardelli also said he hoped the controversy surrounding his exit package wouldnt be an issue or a stumbling block especially when it comes to the uaw talks "the last thing i would want to be is a distraction " mr nardelli said also on mr nardellis list of meetings yesterday was a group of chrysler dealers chrysler executives have acknowledged the company has far too many dealers for its diminished share of the u s market and it has begun taking steps to cull low performing stores but state franchise laws which protect dealers hinder any effort by chrysler to quickly narrow its retail network "he has to fix the retail supply chain " said mike jackson chief executive of autonation inc the nations biggest auto retailer by locations and sales in addition to narrowing the number of chrysler dealerships mr jackson said the "next step is produce and configure vehicles the way the marketplace wants them " invigorating chryslers lineup includes developing fresher looking vehicles as well as updating aging technology and fixing quality problems that have undermined the companys brand image chrysler badly needs to devise a better strategy for designing vehicles that "people will buy at full price " said james e schrager an auto industry specialist and a professor of strategic management at the university of chicagos graduate school of business but "thats where nardelli has the longest shot " see related letter "letters to the editor nardelli a new era indeed" wsj
