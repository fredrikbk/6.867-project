politics &amp economics french beaches reflect divide between affluent immigrants la courneuve france five years ago paris inaugurated a city beach with imported sand swimming pools and cafes along the seine river the citys socialist mayor dreamed up "paris plage" to offer beach time to low income families who couldnt afford real holidays particularly those in the housing projects of the citys poor suburbs or banlieues luring them to the urban beach it was thought would also bridge the chasm that has opened along racial and religious lines between pariss tony center and its seedier outskirts it hasnt worked out that way instead many suburbs are rolling out their own beaches and rather than bridging differences the competing plages have deepened the social and economic divide between affluent central paris and its mostly immigrant outskirts for many of the mostly arab and african immigrants living on the outer edges of the city paris plage hasnt been the welcoming oasis it was supposed to be banlieue families some of whom wore muslim headscarves and brought along cheap picnics complain they get cold stares from beach goers and organizers at paris plage the cost and hassle of commuting to the center of paris also keeps them away "paris plage is chic and they arent happy to see people from the banlieues " says farid benamar years old manning the entrance to la courneuve plage in one of frances most depressed suburbs "la courneuve has a bad image but nobody discriminates against us here " located in a middle school playground la courneuve plage is a vastly different experience from the beach in central paris the site is only a block away from the place where violent riots erupted at the end of when suburban youths anger at frances failure to better integrate its immigrant population spilled into the streets in place of the picture perfect paris plage setting where fine sand stretches along the banks of the river la courneuve plage is a gritty jumble of immigrant culture while women in paris sun themselves in skimpy bikinis along the seine in this suburb mothers some wearing veils seek shade under picnic umbrellas vendors sell merguez sausages instead of croissants and nicoise salads on offer at the paris plage cafes music from the african island nation of the comoros greeted visitors on the opening day of la courneuve plage last month whereas traditional french songs play in paris but this year la courneuve plage has been so popular that it had to turn away kids coming in by bus from neighboring towns "its more working class but its more friendly " says salim chekhab a year old wealth manager at hsbc plc who grew up in la courneuve and brings his three kids back during the summer most french people head to the coast or the mountains in july and august yet for many residents of the modern banlieues around paris such as la courneuve summer vacation isnt a given unemployment runs high at least in this suburb and families live crammed into crumbling housing projects "everyone cant wait for the holidays but a lot of people here are not able go on vacation " says ziani sana who used to spend the summer at the beach in her native morocco before moving to la courneuve six years ago she and her husband a technician cant afford to take their two kids on vacation this summer but many dont feel welcome at paris plage either "theres a lack of friendliness " says eugene henri more the communist deputy mayor of la courneuve who was born in france to cameroonian parents moreover for many families in la courneuve the euros &# round trip train ticket to paris is a burden says mr more pariss city hall estimates the percentage of paris plage visitors coming from the suburbs has fallen since its inauguration in part because it has become more popular with tourists so two years ago mr more decided to organize his own plage the city council set aside part of its budget to import sand palm trees and lawn chairs to recreate a beach like atmosphere the objective was two fold entertain locals and put a couple dozen of them to work patrolling the beach la courneuve didnt have the deep pockets of paris for the first edition of the banlieue beach in mr more had to persuade the local fire department to come twice a day to change the water in the swimming pool to prevent it from becoming unsanitary with a budget of euros or about &# mr more could only afford to open the plage for two weeks but the crowds came on sunny days the beach attracted more than people last year in its second edition la courneuve plage stretched over four weeks and drew visitors this year the city was again strapped for funds but the popularity of the plage made it easier to solicit donations mr more and his team convinced building companies to donate the sand while a local electrical company wired the park with light free local cultural associations offer free judo and boxing classes mr more calculates this years plage will cost euros compared with million euros for paris plage despite its big budget paris plage isnt very kid friendly and caters more to elderly men playing petanque an outdoor bowling game mr more this year added more attractions for children four large trampolines and a sand pit for beach volleyball were set up in the shadow of a high rise housing project mr more is happy with the success of la courneuve plage but he worries the segregation of banlieue residents from parisian mainstream life keeps deepening "the beach is just a drop in the bucket for people who live with discrimination i would like for there to be no need for la courneuve plage "
