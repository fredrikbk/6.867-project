a cultural conversation with kevin long long ball yankees new hitting coach has a rod and team back in top form ted williams and new york yankees coach kevin long have much in common both are ranked among the great students of the art of hitting a baseball both are considered great teachers in that art and both except for mr long were great hitters the late great boston red sox outfielder and hall of famer compiled a lifetime batting average and in batted the last man in major league baseball to top kevin long never played a game in the major leagues mr long who replaced don mattingly this year as the yankees hitting coach did spend eight years in the kansas city royals minor league system "he was a hustler " according to yankees outfielder johnny damon mr longs former minor league roommate and now his pupil "he wasnt very big or fast " says mr damon "but he was a tough heads up player who always tried to take advantage of every situation i loved to see him make that head first slide " just before the season mr long told the royals farm director that he was packing it in as a player "i knew what i wanted to do " he says lounging in the yankees clubhouse before a game with the tampa bay devil rays "i wanted to coach i felt my real talent was helping guys get better i really feel fulfilled when i see someone reach his potential " beginning early in july many yankees have been reaching their potential with dramatic suddenness through the first games of the season the yankees were just and suffering from a sluggish offense that was producing just runs per game starting july however the yankees caught fire winning of their next games as of sunday averaging an explosive runs per nine innings whats made the difference ask johnny damon bobby abreu robinson cano andy phillips and other yankee hitters who have been pounding the ball with amazing consistency theyll tell you that theyve all started listening to kevin long the most celebrated of mr longs students is alex rodriguez the major leagues leader in home runs runs batted in runs scored and slugging percentage and who on saturday became the youngest player in baseball history to hit home runs mr rodriguez of course wasnt exactly a slap hitter before he began working with mr long having led the american league in home runs four times but many saw a sharp decline in a rods hitting last year despite a batting average of home runs and rbis working with mr long this season as we go to press mr rodriguez has exceeded last years home run total and his slugging percentage is over points higher than in "hes amazing " the yankees third baseman and a leading mvp contender says of mr long "hes a great coach a great teacher and a great communicator " how did mr long work his miracle with a rod "its no miracle " he says calmly sipping a bottle of water "what were talking here is maybe improving a hitters success rate by just a tiny fraction but in baseball terms its a fraction that makes a huge difference after all the difference between being a good hitter at say and a great hitter at say is just five hits out of every hundred at bats the batter who can make all the little things work better and get those five extra hits is probably going to the hall of fame " the little things that mr long helped mr rodriguez with have restored a rods reputation as the games greatest slugger a firm believer in using technology to study hitters mr long pored over dvds of mr rodriguez after his prolonged slump last season during one stretch he struck out times in at bats and noticed that a rods famous leg kick was too high "not only too high but he was starting it a split second too late his knee was at his waist and there was a mph fastball coming at him it was tough for alex to get his leg down and turn his hips in time to hit an inside fastball and the result was thats what a lot of pitchers were attacking him with it was basically a question of getting him into a better position faster if you have to worry about getting your knee down before you hit the ball youre giving yourself too much to do in this instance it was a case of subtracting in order to gain " did mr long approach a rod and suggest a change "it was more of a mutual understanding we talked about things he could do the mechanics of his swing we spent four days in miami before the season in a batting cage at his house working on that leg lift and how to make his swing more compact more powerful " he taught a rod his "net drill " which he describes thusly "you take a stance parallel to a net only a bat length away from you you hold the knob of the bat to your stomach to measure the distance then your coach flips balls to you and you hit them without the bat touching the net thats how you know your swing is more compact the drill forces you to pull your hands towards your body as you swing it gets you in the proper position to turn on those inside pitches " that certainly addresses some mechanical problems but as another great student of hitting once phrased it "half the game is mental " "i dont know if yogi got the proportions exactly right " says mr long with a laugh "but hes certainly right about having the correct mindset i talk to hitters i work with about controlling the at bats hitting is reactive so its often assumed that the pitcher controls everything that happens that shouldnt be so " but wasnt yogi berra also correct when he said "you cant think and hit at the same time " "essentially yes the batter shouldnt be standing there in the box thinking about what the pitcher might throw he shouldnt be guessing i think hes much better off to always anticipate a fastball that way if hes wrong he still has a fraction of a second to react to any slower pitch if you go up there guessing breaking ball or change of pace and you get a fastball theres no time to react " mr long says one thing that separates mr long from other hitting gurus is that hes not an ideologue "hes not trying to sell you a theory of hitting " says new york mets slugger carlos beltran whom mr long worked with in kansas city "hes just trying to take the tools and talent that you have and make you the best hitter you can be " unlike ted williams mr long isnt trying to turn others into clones of himself "every body type and every temperament is unique " he says "i work with each hitter according to his individual style and needs " one such player is tampa bay first baseman carlos pena "i was just about out of the game last august when the yankees released me kevin worked with me smoothed out my swing and got me into the best groove of my career " one of mr longs techniques for working with mr pena was to have the slugger take batting practice from a cage rather than on the field "some guys like carlos if they take bp on the field all they see are those seats they end up thinking about nothing but home runs their focus is much better in the cage where they simply concentrate on meeting the ball " when mr long saw mr pena in the tunnel between the two teams locker rooms last weekend he called out "you still taking bp in the cage " mr pena replied with an emphatic "yeah " mr pena a player who was nearly out of baseball a year ago has been among the american leagues top four home run hitters nearly all of this season so if one had to make a short list of kevin longs recommendations where to begin "well id say practice a compact swing then go up to the plate with a clear idea of what youre going to do dont let the pitcher control your at bat assume hes going to throw you a fastball and be as ready as you can for that then youll be ready for anything else next incorporate the lower half of your body into your swing make it a kinetic link start swinging from the ground up and work it into the bat " and then "and then once youve found something that works once youve found the right mechanics maintain them dont lapse into bad habits and dont let anyone try to fix something that isnt broken have confidence in yourself if you hit a bad stretch dont experiment try going back to the basics that worked before " is that the secret to hitting like alex rodriguez "no but it might be the secret to being a little better than you are " mr barra writes about sports for the journal
