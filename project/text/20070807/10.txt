boss talk no longer just plumbers aiming to rival sony apple john chambers takes cisco beyond routers and switches john chambers wants to be more than a plumber the chief executive officer of cisco systems inc who has characterized the companys main business of making routers and switches for electronic networks as plumbing wants to turn cisco into a consumer tech company that will be mentioned in the same breath as apple inc and sony corp under the year old mr chambers ciscos ceo since the san jose calif company has spent more than &# billion in the past few years to acquire consumer tech companies such as scientific atlanta inc which makes set top boxes and five across inc a platform for social networking later this year cisco plans to release a box that will allow consumers to download content from the internet and distribute that content to other computers or televisions within the home the device will also allow consumers to watch cable television mr chambers recently discussed ciscos consumer push with the wall street journal excerpts follow wsj how challenging will it be to make the transition from a purely corporate technology company to one that also provides consumer tech mr chambers many companies have trouble moving beyond one product or one customer segment so when a company of ciscos size says it wants to move into totally new product areas i can see how some degree of skepticism could arise but if you watch the major movements we made while at times it may have taken us a little longer than we wanted we always accomplished them we were an enterprise company that moved into selling equipment to phone and cable companies we went from there into selling equipment to small and medium businesses and now were moving into consumer our issue is which markets do we go into do we truly have a sustainable differentiation does it fit into the network strategy that we have can we execute and can we prioritize so its a good problem to have and were going to try to do it on a very rapid scale wsj what do you see as ciscos biggest obstacles in becoming more of a consumer company mr chambers the most important challenge any company faces in moving into new markets is catching market transitions we clearly caught a market transition in terms of wireless into the home with our linksys acquisition a wireless home networking company that cisco purchased in and we also understood the important role video and entertainment would play within the home with our acquisitions of scientific atlanta arroyo video solutions a video on demand software company bought in and kiss technology a wireless dvd manufacturer purchased in next were focused on our vision for the connected life which is about connecting life experiences in the home with experiences at work especially as those boundaries continue to blur weve been preparing for several years to capture this market transition and to extend our presence into the home wsj how have you prepared for that mr chambers we see how the network will enable telephone and cable companies to deliver services to consumers in the workplace at home or on the go so we are working to evolve our partnerships with these companies there are significant opportunities to create new services within this environment to take advantage of this new transition we also have to change how products work together and youve got to change how easy they are to use so through internal innovation and our acquisitions i think were making significant steps at achieving our vision wsj how much will this consumer strategy actually help cisco grow the company is already huge with employees and &# billion in annual sales and its up against maturing demand in the main product lines and more competition in new growth areas mr chambers if you look at the numbers most people are projecting the routing and switching market will grow much faster than what people said three or four years ago so our traditional business is growing in the mid teens percentagewise and nobody thought that was sustainable and now theyre saying maybe its conservative weve shown the ability like no other company to move in not just one product area but a dozen and become the no player we have always faced mature players that are big in the market or start ups and if you dont have good competition you probably arent in an exciting market wsj why has cisco kept the linksys and scientific atlanta brands in place rather than putting the cisco brand on the products mr chambers over this next year youll see them evolve into a single cisco brand we kept the linksys brand for a period of time because very candidly linksys had a better recognition in the consumer and retail distribution market than cisco did so the last thing you want to do is to acquire an asset with significant value and change what you bought but you will see us evolve this over the next year scientific atlanta does business through our service provider partners so as a consumer brand it is somewhat less important you will see this brand change over the next year as well wsj how do you intend to roll out new devices and services that allow consumers to interact online and purchase online media without running into companies like microsoft and creating problems with telephone and cable customers mr chambers i think the market has already decided its going to be an internet based world the network is becoming a platform we deliver all forms of communication over the network so by definition two things happened cisco by a little bit of good fortune and by execution is positioned in the sweet spot again for the market wsj what is your relationship like with microsoft these days mr chambers our customers want us to work together whether its in the home in the office or working with cable and phone companies they are leaning on us both very heavily saying its fine to compete but you must interoperate and there are many areas you both would get more revenue and more profits by working together in the area of unified communication a system that integrates communication including voice data video and mobility well compete and were going to do our best to win and we probably will there will be many other areas we will partner its in microsoft ceo steve ballmers best interest as well as john chamberss to accomplish what our customers want wsj will cisco work with apple on services and products mr chambers apple is a company we greatly respect i like their leadership the creativity they brought to the market has been tremendous especially over the last three to five years we never had much of a relationship with apple we had a small bump along the way over the iphone but it was just a small bump thats all it was earlier this year cisco sued apple for trademark infringement after apple unveiled its iphone a name used by cisco for its consumer phones the two companies quickly agreed to resolve the dispute i like apple ceo steve jobs i think his implementation has been excellent in terms of his products and architecture our customers want us to interoperate i think its in both companies interest traditionally apple hasnt been a company that partners and im a believer in partnering im cautiously optimistic wsj how have you managed to remain one of silicon valleys longest serving ceos at a time when many ceos increasingly have shorter tenures mr chambers first theres no substitute for being in the right market at the right time even though there were some bumps along the way second the internet has kept my attention it truly has changed our lives third weve evolved and learned how to really do innovation not just one product but many products fourth i love it i really do i just committed to the board another three to five years because were about to make some major moves into new markets most of what i do will have real impact three to five years from now and beyond
