thefunded now see gushing messages about mr hartenbaums intellect and generosity including write ups titled "howards the man " and "howard gets startups " mr hartenbaum who stresses he only asked entrepreneurs for honest feedback and not necessarily positive comments says the site also has prompted him to change the way he gives critical feedback at meetings he has begun asking fledgling chief executives if they want "direct" comments about the flaws in a business instead of giving a harsh assessment whether they like it or not "i thought i was a nice guy " says mr hartenbaum years old "nobody likes to be thought of as an a " for years entrepreneurs in silicon valley have been at the mercy of venture capitalists the high powered financiers who hold the purse strings when it comes to

read thefunded " says david stern a venture partner at clearstone venture partners in menlo park though mr stern is described on the site as a "good guy" who understands internet advertising clearstone ranked just out of a possible five points on thefundeds ratings system mr stern says hes irked that disgruntled entrepreneurs often post their comments anonymously "theres no accountability " he complains thefunded was launched in march by an entrepreneur who says he operates a venture backed start up the entrepreneur who declined to be named said in an interview that his company which isnt connected to the site is in the process of being acquired by another firm and that he doesnt want to do anything to jeopardize the deal still venture capitalists cant ignore the site as it carries weight with entrepreneurs jason calacanis one entrepreneur who just launched an internet search company called mahalo com inc says he checked out potential investors on thefunded before looking for funding the reviews of investors were "disturbingly on target " he says one venture firm where mr calacanis had scheduled a meeting to discuss mahalo canceled two hours before the appointment he says later "when i looked at their profile on thefunded other folks had commented on their flaky behavior " he says that firm which he declined to name didnt get a chance to invest in his start up airing all this dirty laundry seems positively declasse for an industry used to trafficking in big ideas managing money for ivy league universities and cutting deals on the golf course other industries are finding similar sites popping up a web site that ranks lawyers called avvo com and backed by venture capitalists launched in june a lawyer who claimed the comments on the site

services business and our customer is the entrepreneur " says mark dempster sequoia capitals marketing partner "its easy for us to forget that " mr dempster who gets a daily email feed from thefunded says sequoia hasnt asked its entrepreneurs to rate the firm on the site "but i think thats a great idea " he says for some entrepreneurs any information on the secretive venture world is helpful venture capitalists "all have their real clubby network but start ups go into these meetings blind " says stephen bell founder of austin texas online video shopping site shangby inc "thefunded is the first step in kind of leveling that playing field " mr bell raised money from draper richards earlier this year and got an email from mr hartenbaum after their meeting asking him to visit thefunded and rate the firm mr bell complied his lengthy review written after draper richards had invested in his start up praised mr hartenbaum and partner bill draper for asking "great on point questions "
