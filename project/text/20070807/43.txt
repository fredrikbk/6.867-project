china next august will take some far in advance planning and strategizing the beijing games are widely expected to be one of the most highly attended olympics in history the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad or bocog anticipates more than two million visitors to the city next year one of them is christopher tuttle an environmental technician from alexandria va who has been planning his trip to the beijing olympics for a year now he says he has been saving of his paychecks and is waiting to snap up the first available seats and hotel rooms he can find no matter the cost "this is not flying across the country to see one of your college buddies its a piece of history thats going on " he says but eager travelers like mr tuttle will likely face obstacles several prominent hotels in beijing are already fully booked either because they offered their rooms earlier were block booked by tour operators or are reserved for local olympics personnel even some hotels still under construction are already booked the yet to open intercontinental beijing north for example is fully committed to olympics personnel many airlines will start selling seats for flights to beijing around the olympics within the next couple of months and industry experts expect those to be snapped up quickly too airspace in china is still closely controlled and american carriers will receive only six new routes into the country for next year tickets to olympic events are still available but are going fast those travelers who get to beijing may find that many of the accommodations are more suitable for the collegiate backpacker set in total there are beds rooms said to be available in beijing for next year but many are in thousands of two star or no star hotels these hotels may not take credit cards or have english speaking staff some have shared bathrooms travelers wanting to ensure western style amenities may want to try to book a spot at one of a number of big international hotels opening soon marriott international inc and intercontinental hotel group have new hotels under construction in beijing and surrounding areas in preparation for the games rooms can be booked on these companies global web sites many will be listed over the next few weeks but the rooms will likely go for premiums which travel agents say are standard for such a large

should begin to look for flights about six weeks less than one year prior to the date they plan to fly out the games begin aug so if people want to leave for china on aug for example which from new york would have them arrive on aug they should start looking for flights in mid september "there arent enough seats to begin with to satisfy the business and leisure demand into china " says george hobica founder of airfarewatchdog com travelers may have an easier time booking through agents who can guarantee seats either on commercial airlines or on charter flights as with hotel rates prices for flights are expected to increase too major airlines including american airlines and northwest airlines have submitted applications including letters and petitions from individuals and corporations to support their bids for the limited number of new air routes that china is allowing so far several american carriers fly directly into china including continental airlines which has daily flights into beijing from new york and united airlines which has daily flights to beijing from san francisco air china also operates direct flights to various cities in the u s and all can be booked on the
