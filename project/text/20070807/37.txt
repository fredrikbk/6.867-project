eyes on the road taking electric a step and miles farther i drove to work one day last week in a prototype that is either a harbinger of a far more fuel efficient future or another in a long line of technological insurgencies that will fail to crack the auto industrys century old status quo the car was a toyota prius modified into a so called plug in hybrid by the addition of a pound lithium ion battery pack it is capable of running for as many as miles almost entirely on electric power the battery pack is a product of massachusetts based a systems www asystems com and its recently acquired hymotion inc subsidiary the prius was parked close enough to my garage that i could run an extension cord from the wall outlet to a three prong plug installed in the rear bumper id plugged in the car the night before and by morning the lithium ion batteries in the trunk were charged i stuck a plastic key fob into a slot in the dash hit the "power" button and then hit it again because i couldnt tell whether the car was on there was no engine noise i put the car in drive and silently rolled out into the street and i continued to roll on electric power in a normal prius the gasoline engine kicks in once you get past walking speed in this car the extra batteries let me keep rolling in electric only mode at highway speeds the company estimates the electricity cost of an overnight charge to be around cents for extra miles accelerating to merge with traffic and avoid becoming a high tech oil spot under a semi i engaged the gasoline motor but cruising was all electric and according to the priuss onboard fuel consumption computer i was cruising at miles per gallon the only awareness i had of the power generation handoffs was the videogame like display in the dashboard my reaction to this experience "wow who wouldnt want this " it is the questions that come next that have been a problem for the auto industry what does it really cost is it reliable what about the warranty toyota motor corp s stance on that last question is that anyone who modifies the prius into a plug in voids the warranty since the industrys earliest days electric cars have foundered on the rocks of cost reliability and range plug ins have range but with current battery technology they didnt appear to have mass market levels of cost or reliability general motors corp earlier this year made a splash with a prototype of a plug in called the chevrolet volt but stressed that the batteries to make the volt real hadnt been invented yet lithium ion battery technology can handle the cycles of charging and discharging required for a plug in better than nickel metal hydride batteries but a lithium ion battery also has what is referred to as "heat management" issues that means fire scarecrow the recent spate of publicity about lithium ion laptop batteries bursting into flame has only made resolving this issue more urgent tony posawatz is the vehicle line director for gms plug in hybrid chevrolet volt and other vehicles using gms e flex electric vehicle technology he says he expects to get battery packs by the end of this year a is part of one group of suppliers along with continental ag another involves big korean battery maker lg chem ltd gm is still aiming to have a production version of the volt ready to roll by late provided the batteries are ready too he says ric fulop an a founder and vice president says the company is on track to offer by early next year lithium ion plug in conversion systems to toyota prius owners and hybrid ford escape owners initial numbers will be relatively low "if we sold next year " he said "thats a big start " prices arent set yet but it is likely that a system able to extend the electric only range of a prius by miles will cost about &# a mile system will cost about half that he says as for the volt mr fulop said "it totally can happen " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
