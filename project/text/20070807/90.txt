the daily fix bonds remains stuck on three tales of playoff hopes online edition barry bonds baseballs co home run king was back in the lineup in san francisco last night with a hometown crowd there to celebrate home run no and hope for no the crowd wound up for bonds wound up for and the giants won in which is all any real baseball fan should need from watching his or her team on a summer night come to think of it some summer nights you dont even need that much in the san jose mercury news mark purdy has found his "official barry bonds home run viewing position teeth gritted a half smile half wince " a conflicted mr purdy writes that "you cannot pretend it doesnt move you somehow in spite of everything you must admire bonds for his home runs for the way he has stubbornly hauled himself through all the turmoil into the batters box all these years for the way he has stared down all of those pitchers and made them pay but you cant admire it too much not after watching mark mcgwire fool us during his home run season in we admired him then learned a few years later that he probably cheated it made us feel foolish for getting excited no one wants that feeling again so we watch bonds in a post modern post mcgwire post balco way teeth gritted " sticking with the merc daniel brown looks at things bonds hank aaron and others have said about the home run record over the years bonds and aaron shot a charles schwab ad together back in before hammerin hanks attitude towards his pursuer changed or if you prefer was changed by the controversy surrounding bonds but mr brown ends on this note "then i used to love to come to the ballpark now i hate it every day becomes a little tougher because of all of this writers tape recorders microphones cameras questions and more questions aaron late in his chase of babe ruth now hey maybe aaron and bonds still have a few things in common after all " one of the odder sights of bondss record tying home run was baseball commissioner bud selig who stood with his hands in his pockets as the slugger rounded the bases saturday night that didnt work for the washington posts michael wilbon who writes that "selig could have stood with bonds and said with no positive drug test to prove otherwise i believe barry is innocent and along with hank aaron the rightful co holder of the greatest record in our sport or selig could have in a face to face meeting with bonds told him he believes bonds to be a steroid cheater and that hes not going to publicly endorse him until baseballs own investigation bogus as it may be is over or until the grand jury looking into bondss possible connection to steroids is completed or dismissed what selig is doing by just sitting there in some sky suite is taking the easy non confrontational way out " mr wilbons colleague john feinstein doesnt agree calling mr seligs semi reaction "one of seligs best moments of the season given that he spoke for millions of baseball fans i knew this was going to happen i knew i had to watch it but i sure as hell dont feel good about it " his complaint is slightly different with everyone knowing bonds would take sunday off why didnt the commissioner hop a plane to chicago to see the new york mets tom glavine go for his th win "there was selig with a free day and the chance to go see one of the true good guys achieve one of his sports great milestone and he took a pass " mr feinstein writes "can someone please explain what the commissioner is thinking right now is he dizzy from traipsing around with bonds for two weeks " the detroit tigers finally snapped a five game losing streak beating the tampa bay devil rays but detroits margin for error in the american league is gone the tigers trail the cleveland indians by half a game in the al central in the wild card chase the new york yankees games out of the wild card on july th actually led the tigers by percentage points before last nights game the yanks are now a half game back with the seattle mariners one game out so whats wrong with the tigers "its the most asked question in town " writes drew sharp in the detroit free press "the answer is pretty obvious if youve got your eyes open theyve got toledo mud hens occupying one third of their batting order on most nights because guys cant stay healthy the starting pitching that was the stalwart of last seasons excellence remains inconsistent perhaps a symptom of them pressing too much to compensate for the bullpens difficulties " the tigers better figure things out fast after their current seven game stretch against the devil rays and the ragged oakland as detroit will play against the indians and the yankees for fans of the chicago cubs the worst part of sunday night wasnt seeing the mets mr glavine win his th game the wrigley faithfuls standing ovation for mr glavine as he exited was pure class rather it was the sight of alfonso soriano the teams &# million man hopping gingerly between second and third before being tagged out gingerly by david wright a torn right quad will keep mr soriano out until labor day last night the cubs lost to the houston astros in innings and remain one game back in the nl central "you are permitted to ponder curses cubdom " writes jay mariotti in the chicago sun times "for every diehard who ridicules the concept i hear another whos convinced steve bartman is a direct descendant of the billy goat there is plentiful evidence that a higher power has it in for the cubs and if harry caray cant lobby for better treatment i dont know who can but this time for once allow me to suggest that your godforsaken franchise wont completely succumb to stinky karma " mr mariottis grounds for optimism he thinks lou piniella is a better manager than the brewers ned yost the cubs vets are in better shape than the brewers kids and the cubs play just of their final games against teams with winning records but considering the baseball postseason is a crapshoot mr mariotti ends on an odd note "honestly now did you really think this was the year anyway its a nice year a fun year a year that should be happening because of the enormous financial investment it is not a championship year and never has been " the st louis cardinals exorcised some demons from a possibly fatal swing through pittsburgh and washington those anti citadels of crummy baseball by returning home to stomp the san diego padres with all runs scoring in the fifth inning deep breath braden looper single aaron miles single david eckstein single so taguchi single albert pujols single juan encarnacion single scott rolen homer ryan ludwick homer yavier molina walk braden looper single aaron miles single david eckstein sacrifice fly so taguchi double play grounder ouch still the cards are and seven games out of the nl central lead stranger things have happened in baseball history including oh an win team winning it all but not very often in the st louis post dispatch bernie miklasz asks "is it possible to have an adult conversation can we put down the kool aid for a few minutes can we take a serious view of the st louis cardinals and see them as a competitive entity in a multi billion dollar industry instead of treating them as sad eyed little leaguers who need our motherly fatherly love " mr miklasz runs through a litany of grim statistics then suggests the team look at the likes
