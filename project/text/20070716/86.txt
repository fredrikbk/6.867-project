what could topple bulls wall of worry high risk investments weak dollar inflation may test stock rally the stock market is again living up to one of wall streets oldest sayings it is "climbing a wall of worry" rising to record heights despite deep worries that any one of several risks could send it tumbling the "wall of worry" idea is that stocks can still flourish when people are nervous skeptics hold money on the sidelines as their fears are alleviated they put money into stocks pushing the market higher the market keeps climbing only if worries are held in check here are some of the main concerns and what it could take for them to knock the market down high risk investments the biggest fear now is that some risky corner of the market could blow up since two hedge funds run by bear stearns got into trouble the main worry has centered on the kinds of investments those funds made securities tied to subprime mortgages which are mortgages taken by borrowers with below average prospects of repaying other money managers bought such securities because of their high yields and investors fear more blowups bulls note that subprime mortgages are a small part of the mortgage market and havent infected the economy more broadly so far that reassuring view has prevailed skeptics respond that other high risk securities such as corporate junk bonds corporate loans or developing country bonds also could face trouble several junk bond deals have been sidelined in the last few weeks as investors reassess their riskiness "investor appetite for emerging market bonds loans from stockbrokers and other risky securities remains abnormally high " says marc stern chief investment officer at bessemer trust he has advised clients to build a cash reserve in anticipation of a pullback in such areas global growth bullish investors have focused their hopes on strong global growth sustained by a u s consumer who refuses to stop spending and by strong growth outside of the u s in places like china india and europe but if high gasoline prices and slumping home prices hold consumers back that will hurt everyone investors now widely expect second quarter corporate profit reports due to flood in this week to surpass analysts expectations of low single digit growth giving stocks a further boost "the main drivers of performance namely continued global economic growth high rates of corporate profitability and reasonable valuations remain in place " market strategists at putnam investments say in a recent report inflation on top of strong growth investors are counting on mild inflation thats a combination widely known as a goldilocks economy not too hot not too cold the global flow of goods and services is helping to hold down inflation because companies increasingly get products and labor from where they are cheapest inflation fears knocked down stocks this spring the worries briefly pushed the yield of the benchmark year treasury note which is sensitive to inflation to a multiyear high higher market interest rates threatened to siphon money into bonds and money funds and to stifle the boom in corporate takeovers financed by cheap debt but "core" u s inflation numbers which exclude volatile food and energy prices have kept pulling back closer to the annual rate that federal reserve officials hope to see skeptics worry that higher food and energy inflation could push other prices higher for now however the bond market doesnt seem concerned the yield of the year treasury note has moved closer to calming fears the weak dollar the dollar has been trading around a record low against the euro and a year low against the pound a weak dollar can help stocks by boosting profits at multinational companies they benefit because money earned abroad is worth more in dollar terms and u s made products are more competitive when priced in foreign currencies but there is a flip side to this benefit the u s depends on outsiders in places like china and japan to buy u s bonds if they become too worried that a falling dollar hurts the value of their investments they could diversify further into euros hampering demand for u s stocks and bonds that kind of diversification has helped push the euro higher but so far foreign demand for u s stocks and bonds has stayed strong net foreign purchases of u s stocks hit &# billion in april and appear to have continued since banc of america securities strategist tom mcmanus says in a report liquidity many agree that a vaguely defined factor known as liquidity the cash available to investors has been one of the markets main drivers liquidity is created in part by low interest rates which make it easy to borrow by a booming world economy and by big dollar denominated trade surpluses in the middle east and asia a big manifestation of liquidity has been the huge private investment funds that gather money from big financial institutions borrow heavily against that money buy big companies and take them private in leveraged buyouts a conservative estimate is that borrowing permits such funds to invest roughly four times the value of the actual money they hold "which means there is &# billion chasing the market " says john lynch chief market analyst at evergreen investments many companies have been buying back stock another source of liquidity "you have a dynamic of more dollars chasing fewer shares " he says as long as interest rates remain low no more huge investment funds blow up foreigners keep funneling money into the u s and the consumer doesnt stop spending the thinking goes liquidity can keep pushing stocks higher
