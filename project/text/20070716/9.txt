boss talk new borders wants to load your ipod george jones also plans to reopen branded web site and redesign bookstores to stress digital offerings george jones chief executive of borders group inc is remaking the nations second largest book retailer as fast as he can since taking over a year ago he has vowed to close nearly half the companys waldenbooks outlets sell or franchise nearly all of the stores borders owns overseas reopen borders branded e commerce web site and revamp the chains computer system mr jones years old says even more changes are ahead as borders tries to keep pace with barnes &amp noble inc amazon com and the big box discounters last month for example borders published nick santoras thriller "slip &amp fall " and it plans to publish more of its own titles a new store design that emphasizes digital entertainment is also crucial to its strategy mr jones says his prior retail experience including a stint as ceo of saks inc s department store group and seven years at warner bros where he served as president of world wide licensing and studio stores has prepared him for the job he recently spoke to the wall street journal about borders and its future the wall street journal why are bricks and mortar stores having such a difficult time increasing sales mr jones the internet is clearly a factor the other major factor is the mass retailers there are a lot of books sold at wal mart and costco even though there is a limited assortment customers see best sellers and other books and that represents a lost visit for us and that affects traffic wsj do you buy into the idea that potential readers would rather surf the web play videogames or watch dvds and if so are they gone for good mr jones some are choosing alternatives but there is still a strong mass of readers out there and as people hit retirement they tend to read a lot more so the aging of our population works in our favor in that regard one thing the harry potter books have done is motivate kids to read kids who didnt read were suddenly standing in line for a page book and that has carried through im not saying it offsets video games or watching youtube com but i do think that regardless of whats happening books are still alive and well and that plenty of people read wsj what is it about the harry potter books that grabbed kids so strongly there have been lots of other adventure sagas with witches and magic mr jones she j k rowling created a complete world a parallel universe with extraordinary detail there is also an amazing cast of characters each of whom is clearly defined she had a vision of seven books when she started so you can follow the kids as they mature between reading the books and seeing the movies people have developed feelings for them im certain that in years new generations will still be reading these books much as they do "the wizard of oz" or "winnie the pooh " youve got a series that spans gender and age and thats an amazing thing wsj early next year borders will launch its own web commerce site ending its relationship with amazon are you too late to the game mr jones no not at all understand that there are many reasons why were doing this first the decision to let amazon do our e commerce site was made years ago when there were completely different economics involved there werent the options for third party fulfillment that there are now you had to build a massive overhead that didnt make sense in terms of the volume of the business by joining with amazon they went from a sizable loss on this business to an immediate profit albeit a small one wsj why reverse course mr jones circumstances are different today first i dont like turning our customers over to a major competitor when somebody goes to borders com and ends up at amazon amazon gets the data and forms the relationship with the customer also and this is a big point we need connectivity with our stores our relationship with amazon limits that connectivity also our rewards program cant be part of it by regaining a web presence we can move toward being the first truly cross channel retailer we will have e commerce offerings in our store that will let us do things to drive more traffic into our stores it will also mean new opportunities for outside partnerships that can work online and in our stores and it will let us take orders for books not in stock say you look inside our store and see that we dont have a book you want today you have to fill out a form and then we have to order it and it could be a week or more you end up saying forget it but if you can order the book online in our store and know that it will be delivered in a few days then we have provided a much better service wsj what do you mean by partnerships mr jones well we have great travel and cooking departments say you are in those businesses you know that the customers who are buying our cookbooks or travel books like to cook or travel some companies will want to reach them both online and in our stores but if we arent online we cant do any of those things this is how our concept stores will differentiate us we know that people like to browse like to buy a cup of coffee like to enjoy our shopping experience but we arent a grocery store nobody has to come to us theyre there because they want to be and potential partners know that wsj couldnt it be a mistake to overemphasize digital offerings in your new prototype stores dont customers have that access at home mr jones youve got to think about america in general there are tons of people and older who dont own an mp player or if they have one they dont know how to operate it these are people who just wont take the time to learn how to do it im like that myself i love music but i dont download music onto my ipod we think there is a place for a retailer to offer a comfortable environment that offers guidance and the opportunity to discover products that provide knowledge and entertainment well show you bring in your mp player and let us know what you want well download it for you wsj price is such a huge driver of sales for bookstores how can you compete with the big discounters mr jones we wont win the battle by slugging it out on the price of every best seller we have to fight battles we can win and to win we have to differentiate ourselves we have a much broader assortment and we want to provide more service wsj why werent the borders foreign stores successful mr jones that isnt the issue what it comes down to is priorities we want to focus our resources on our superstores in the u s why there isnt a scenario that creates value for shareholders in the long run without a better mousetrap in the u s we need to get our u s stores on a better track to grow also those stores will require more capital and systems enhancements we want to retrofit our existing stores after we put out our concept stores wsj you say youre going to keep waldenbooks stores open why mr jones they are clearly profitable and we think we can make them more productive we havent paid enough attention to them mall stores have the same content they did years ago but think how much book retailing has changed in years it doesnt make sense wsj borders has always offered a vast music selection but in recent years music has been a real drag on performance and now it accounts for only of sales will you be exiting the music business mr jones no we think music is very challenging and one of the things that has negatively affected our comparative same store sales however we feel strongly music is part of our dna and part of the experience that makes people spend time in our stores we still sell a lot of music particularly jazz and the classics wsj in early borders launched a free membership that proved so successful that it cut into profit margins earlier this year you reduced the benefits of that membership has there been a backlash mr jones well its less costly to us this year when we first announced the changes people thought we were taking away personal shopping days rather we are timing those days differently also instead of accumulating the rewards all year and paying them out in the holiday period the program pays out lesser amounts more frequently and people are still responding and signing up wsj your membership program was one factor in the decision of barnes &amp noble the countrys largest book retailer to offer its members bigger discounts have you created an environment where the chains will have an ever more difficult time making a profit mr jones frankly i dont think we had a choice barnes &amp noble started a loyalty program in for six years we didnt counterpunch then we did in february we dont charge a membership fee and customers have clearly responded we arent giving away the store but discounting is the world were in customers expect value wsj borders now has some very large investors what are the chances that the company can remain independent mr jones i cant comment its a matter of policy wsj youve been in place a year now what was the biggest surprise about the book business mr jones everybody realizes that this is a business that is challenged and people are willing to try things thats been a very pleasant surprise also some things dont make sense such as physically returning books all the time were packing and shipping books all the time there has to be a more efficient way
