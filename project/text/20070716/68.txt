surface tensions as china grows so does its long neglected navy warship buying spree prompts new worry in washington tokyo kaolao china on one side of a rocky promontory jutting into the yellow sea here sits a ramshackle fishing village its wooden boats pulled up on the beach on the other lie well guarded berths that are home to some of the most advanced vessels in the chinese navy heavily armed attack submarines the stealthy subs their black conning towers and tail fins rising above the water are one of the most potent signs of chinas ambitious effort to modernize its armed services particularly its long neglected navy many believe chinas growing ties to the world economy and its dependence on imported oil and raw materials will ensure chinas "peaceful rise " as beijings leaders have pledged but these same commercial interests and the need to defend them are also driving china to pursue military might "the oceans are our lifelines if commerce were cut off the economy would plummet " says ni lexiong a fellow at the shanghai national defense institute and an outspoken proponent of chinese sea power "we need a strong navy " for chinese strategists the countrys rapid economic growth which underpins the communist partys continued hold on political power and its military advancement are now inextricably linked "security issues related to energy resources finance information and international shipping routes are mounting " says a government white paper published last december that lays out chinas defense policy in response china says it will spend nearly &# billion on its military this year an increase of about from it has also embarked on a ship buying spree acquiring advanced vessels from russia and also building its own over time the strategy could remake the maritime balance of power first in asia and then in the rest of the world chinas leadership insists that the world has nothing to fear from a better armed china the navy known officially as the peoples liberation army navy is still smaller and less capable than that of the u s which has more than major surface combat ships including aircraft carriers china has main surface combatants and no carriers according to the international institute for strategic studies the chinese fleet is also untested in modern naval warfare but as chinas navy becomes better equipped and farther ranging it is causing alarm bells to ring in washington tokyo and taipei the u s is strengthening its forces in asia partly in response to china it is also encouraging japan to boost its own military and naval capabilities and is even cultivating ties with mongolia on chinas northern border "the improvement in the chinese military is significant that is obviously of interest to us and to everyone in the world and appropriately so " says adm timothy j keating commander in chief of u s forces in the pacific much of chinas concern stems from its dependence on foreign oil china imports nearly of its oil and is more dependent on imported middle eastern crude than the u s roughly of chinas imported oil now comes from the persian gulf and africa on tankers that pass through the narrow strait of malacca a strategic choke point between the indonesian island of sumatra and peninsular malaysia president hu jintao has referred to the potential vulnerability of his countrys energy supplies as chinas "malacca dilemma " the country has no ships stationed permanently near the straits china also depends on the outside world for a host of other raw materials from copper to coal and iron ore required to keep what is now the worlds fourth largest economy humming nearly all of chinas trade moves by sea from the countrys east coast many exports are carried by chinas own burgeoning fleet of merchant ships "economic globalization entails globalization of the military means for self defense " zhang wenmu a professor of strategic studies at the beijing university of aeronautics and astronautics wrote last year in china security a military affairs journal "with these complex and expanding interests risks to chinas well being have not lessened but have actually increased " at the submarine base here in eastern shandong province there are signs of the naval shift submarines shelter behind breakwaters between sea patrols chinese subs have been detected in the waters around japan and as far into the western pacific as guam site of important u s military installations a short way down the coast at the headquarters of chinas north sea fleet in qingdao warships including some destroyers equipped with powerful russian made guided missiles share the sprawling port with civilian container ships and oil tankers for most of its history chinas military the peoples liberation army has focused on defeating domestic opponents of the communist party and fighting along the nations land borders the navy had a relatively small role in that mission and concentrated primarily on coastal defense today the navy accounts for about of the million people in chinas armed forces for the first years of communist party rule china remained primarily an agricultural country caught up in political upheaval there was little foreign trade and economic growth was so slow that there was little demand for resources from outside but as china began to open in earnest in the late s and early s a series of geopolitical shifts and chinas accelerating economy combined to radically alter chinese leaders views of the kind of military the country needs in during a standoff between leaders in beijing and taipei over taiwanese moves to assert independence china test fired missiles near the island the u s responded by ordering carrier battle groups to the area chinas inability to prevent this u s show of military strength and support for taiwan rankled political and military leaders in beijing they started to develop what is viewed by the pentagon as an "anti access strategy " the pentagon says it is designed to limit the u s militarys freedom of movement in asia and specifically its ability to intervene in any conflict between china and taiwan the cornerstone of chinas effort is its elite submarine force in recent years eight new russian built diesel powered kilo class submarines have been added to the fleet joining a growing number of new chinese built attack submarines including some powered by nuclear reactors the kilo subs are especially stealthy and hard to detect when submerged chinas navy now has nearly submarines according to u s estimates some of the newest are equipped with russian made cruise missiles that fly at supersonic speeds when they approach their targets and were specifically designed to attack and sink aircraft carriers according to u s naval officers some subs also have advanced torpedoes which home in on ships wakes at high speed "theyve decided that submarines are the best way to delay a u s entry" into any conflict over taiwan by threatening u s aircraft carriers says bernard d cole a retired u s navy captain who now teaches at the national war college in washington and studies the chinese navy "theres nothing harder than finding submarines its a very tough business " china is also building its own surface warships including frigates and destroyers and fitting them out with russian radars and antiaircraft weapons destroyers are the largest class of surface warship in widespread use by world navies chinas are equipped with guns and guided missiles and have a crew of to frigates have similar armaments but are smaller chinas shipyards have been working on two new types of nuclear powered submarines which are undergoing sea trials according to chinese naval officers and late last year china received the second of two sophisticated russian made sovremenny ii guided missile destroyers adding to its tally of russian built surface ships while the immediate driver of chinas naval development has been the potential for conflict over taiwan its longer term goals are much broader navy officers speak of developing three oceangoing fleets one that would patrol the areas around korea and japan another that would push out into the western pacific and a third that would protect the strait of malacca and the indian ocean "the navy needs to be able to go wherever china has economic interests " says one senior chinese naval officer who spoke on condition of anonymity "china should have naval forces stationed at strategic points " the officer says even though "this would certainly push china into more direct confrontation with developed countries " china has helped finance and engineer the construction of a deep water port in pakistan that u s defense planners say could be used by chinese naval forces in the future giving them easier access to the arabian sea and persian gulf region u s military officers also believe china is operating listening posts in southern myanmar to monitor shipping traffic through the strait of malacca china has also begun building a network of satellites that can be used to guide navigation by its own ships at sea as well as to keep track of other countries vessels chinese military leaders are even talking about building aircraft carriers which for decades have been the mainstay of u s maritime power concerns over the potential cost of building and operating such an extensive navy have prompted some national security experts in china to argue against it these critics say china should continue to be a so called free rider allowing the u s and its global navy to bear the burden of policing the seas for now the sea power advocates appear to be winning chinas president hu attended a navy conclave in beijing in december "we should strive to build a powerful navy that adapts to the needs of our militarys historical mission in this new century and at this new stage " mr hu told the assembled officers chinas expanding naval presence is already being felt in the pacific in october a chinese submarine armed with torpedoes and powerful antiship cruise missiles surfaced within firing range of the american aircraft carrier uss kitty hawk part of the u s seventh fleet during maneuvers in the pacific ocean east of the philippines the encounter ended peacefully but the admiral commanding american forces in the pacific at the time william fallon later told reporters that the incident could have "escalated into something very unforeseen " the u s is the only country that regularly operates aircraft carriers in northeast asia and u s officers feel that chinas pursuit of weapons that can be used against carriers has put u s forces in its sights "when you acquire those niche capabilities it raises questions " says one u s officer assigned to monitoring chinese military advances "were a little unclear on why they are focusing on those " adm keating the new u s commander in the pacific says he is trying to get a better understanding of beijings motives and military capabilities he is pushing for more access to chinese forces and more exchanges and expanded joint exercises by the two navies the u s is also strengthening its military posture in asia "i dont think china necessarily has to be a threat i dont think theyve made up their mind yet " says one veteran pentagon asia specialist "thats why we have to take a hedging strategy " china in turn looks at these steps as all the more reason to push ahead with its military buildup the u s moves also strengthen the hand of nationalists in china who believe washington and others are intent on blocking chinas development such views are also held in the mainstream parts of the government "if we develop a strong navy with more advanced weapon systems we have more choices its possible that china will join in a cooperative system headed by the u s " says mr ni of the shanghai national defense institute "but we would also be ready to fight if we have to " ellen zhu in
