real time papers face nfls second rule blogs arent papers only competitors sports leagues are now publishing too online edition so pro football now has a second rule as my print colleague adam thompson writes media web sites reporting on nfl players and coaches are now limited to seconds per day of audio and video shot on nfl property that includes the team facilities where reporters spend much of the six days between games watching coaches hold forth interviewing players and reporting on the doings of the practice fields thats not seconds per subject its total interview a quarterback two running backs a wide receiver and throw in the coachs comments and youve got about nine seconds for each of them after hours the audio and video have to come down and segments have to link back to nfl com and team sites frank hawkins the nfls senior vice president of business affairs notes that credential rules dating back to forbid "game information" which included interviews from being put online with an exception for tv stations simulcasting online he says the nfl didnt begin focusing on the issue until a couple of years ago when web video began to mature and crafted the current policy in response to a newspapers request the second policy he says is "technically a liberalization of what had been in effect before then " though he adds that "i realize its not universally perceived as liberalization " indeed it isnt sports reporters have protested and two journalists groups the associated press sports editors and the american society of newspaper editors have been working with the nfl in an attempt to liberalize or if you prefer further liberalize the policy so far their efforts have resulted in such helpful clarifications as the seconds not including the interviewers questions while the editors have tried patience houston chronicle blogger john mcclain has tried satire a funny guerrilla video demonstrating with the help of the houston texans owner and players just how restrictive the rule is on his blog mr mcclain explains what set him off was a failed attempt to help texans head coach gary kubiak promote a charity event "we ran a couple of inches about it in the chronicle " mr mclain wrote "we wanted to run a video with him talking about it which would have reached a different audience i asked the texans to ask the league if having kubiak on camera talking about the charity event would count toward the seconds the texans said the nfl said yes thats when i decided to do the spoof of the rule " the policy seems ridiculous wouldnt a sports league want as much coverage as it could get but its too simple to dismiss this as a case of lawyers gone rabid its much more than that an example of two old digital trends disintermediation and the online worlds anyone can publish promise colliding in a way web revolutionaries probably didnt see coming self publishing has been a rallying cry since the webs earliest days and has birthed countless web pages blogs myspace profiles and youtube productions as well as bringing a diy liveliness back into professional writing and video at the same time disintermediation or "eliminating the middleman " to be straightforward about it has simplified all sorts of transactions by letting consumers skip distributors agents and others and deal directly with producers and suppliers in these days of social networking and distributed content disintermediation and web publishing may seem hopelessly web but the sea change they ushered in continues to remake industries and todays whizzy webbery is built on their foundations sports coverage has felt the pressures of web publishing and disintermediation newspapers in particular are working to adopt web publishing innovations while struggling to maintain their role as middlemen papers now increasingly supplement their print offerings with daily blogs and audio and video todays beat writer isnt just working the phones conducting interviews in the locker room and writing up game stories for various editions he or she may also be blogging posting audio of interviews and doing video segments to mr hawkins part of the problem is that print journalists have to adapt to more restrictive policies on video that have been around for some time for instance for regularly scheduled programs broadcasters are limited to six minutes of game footage on game day "this is all driven by what had been a pure print medium now becoming more like a tv station " he says adding "tv stations are used to working within the constraints of rules like these because of the nature of their medium newspapers really arent and so when you impose rules on a newspaper thats moving into the multimedia space its perceived a lot differently " and mr hawkins offers a simpler reason he thinks papers will adjust "lets be honest about it watching a press conference with a typical nfl coach not denny green blowing up and not bill parcells is pretty damn boring " the reference is to a tirade by former arizona cardinals head coach dennis green last fall one that nfl spokesman greg aiello notes correctly was "certainly less than seconds " when newspapers ponder their newfound competition they tend to think of blogs the bogeyman is a basement dwelling blogger publishing in his skivvies this is a caricature but never mind that for now sports blogs have succeeded by offering free wheeling conversation building fan communities and discarding the "no cheering in the pressbox" rule of sports journalism full disclosure as ive written before im one of those sports bloggers and i do publish from my basement come to think of it sports bloggers of course are middlemen themselves often building on the work of the newspaper beat reporters and thats a lesson about disintermediation for all the hype around the buzzword the web created more middlemen than it eliminated whether theyre web retailers competing with brick and mortar stores to do the same job better amazon com freshdirect empires built around good search google or the work of individual enthusiasts filtering news and information in any number of arenas the web hasnt eliminated middlemen so much as its forced them to justify their place in the supply chain but the nfl is a different kind of competition its not another middleman but a content producer asking a basic question why should we give our content away when we dont have to its an increasingly common question these days papers jockey for position not just with bloggers and news aggregators but with the very subjects they cover companies organizations and political candidates have their own web sites reached as easily as a newspapers in such a world the only surprise would be if athletes sports teams and leagues were different web rhetoric champions regular folks taking up publishing but those tools work just as well for powerful entities the challenge for newspapers posed by "anyone can publish" is just that anyone can publish in trying to persuade the nfl to change the second rule the asne reminded its officials "of the historic role newspapers have played in developing a fan base for the teams " but "historic" is the key word here media sites need nfl footage or at least they think they do but does the nfl still need the media sites why not herd fans to team and league web sites where the nfl can then show them ads and try to sell them things "we want and are going to have a lot of independent news coverage of the nfl " says mr aiello adding "but we also have to protect our own business interests including our web sites how to balance that where do we draw the line " probably in a place the newspapers dont like todays nfl isnt exactly lacking in fan interest and it has a tradition of maintaining strict control over its image and its content for instance nfl com is the only authorized online source of game footage and its aggressively working to provide that content itself whether its through the nfl network or its web sites moreover nfl teams have six days between games in which the bulk of the news emerges from facilities that they control which is why such policies are perfectly legal there isnt much newspapers can do by way of protest given all the other sources for nfl news a boycott would hurt papers far more than the nfl granted sometimes the league will want maximum exposure for a story about players helping their communities or a coachs charity for instance if newspaper web sites have been sidelined by the leagues own media policy why should they help out then theres the question of whether the always image conscious nfl can cover itself will fans get unbiased news from team sites in good times and bad the nfl says it will keep re examining its policy like everything else this is an experiment whose outcome cant be known but i suspect that newspapers will adjust and maybe find theyre better off web sites are free to post as much video as they wish of their own reporters speaking and theres no limit on speaking to coaches and players away from team facilities on the news tribunes seahawks insider blog mike sando imagines how these new rules may play out in taking greater control of content he notes nfl teams will have less control over newspapers covering them as those papers now have an incentive to seek out players and coaches away from the usual public relations protocol "newspaper web sites should seize this as an opportunity to further distinguish their content from league content " mr sando writes adding "the new web policy encourages independent media web sites to think for themselves as the league monopolizes the stories it wants told others will presumably focus harder on what is left that is not necessarily a bad thing " i agree posting a complete press conference is something anyone with a server and permission can do but perceptive analysis of a game team or player isnt so easy to deliver with the right people newspapers can do that and in doing so reclaim their position as a valued middleman between team and fans by doing something that cant be replaced the nfls policy strikes me as overreaching and its a shame for football fans to miss out on the work of clever reporters like mr mcclain whove taken to a new medium and made it fun but that same cleverness and sense of fun that makes reporters like him watchable also makes it likely that theyll adjust and stay watchable and theres something else at work as a devout mets fan most days i read eight newspaper sites three mets blogs espn com and the teams own site after decades of competing with their print rivals newspapers are still acting like they live in an "or" world in which someone who buys their paper on the newsstand might not buy their rivals but on the web news is increasingly an "and" world in which people interested in a subject devour as much information about it as they can from as many sources as they find useful theres a place for newspapers in that world and even competition from the nfl cant take it away do you get news about your favorite team hobby or interest from online outlets if so which ones more broadly speaking how has the web changed your reading viewing habits how do you assess your news sources and is there such a thing as too many sources of information join me and other online journal readers in the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
