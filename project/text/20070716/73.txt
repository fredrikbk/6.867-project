the daily fix stewart breaks drought after a visit from gibbs online edition tony stewarts drought is over the volatile driver won for the first time in races at chicagoland speedway yesterday holding off matt kenseth down the stretch amid caution flags and restarts mr stewarts reaction "ive got a case of schlitz that i fully intend on getting to the bottom of the cardboard box tonight even if have to do it by myself " it doesnt seem likely that teammate denny hamlin joined him unless team owner joe gibbs ordered the two to do so the stewart hamlin feud began in the pepsi at daytona last week when mr stewart rear ended mr hamlin and took them both out of the race mr stewart accused mr hamlin of "checking up" slowing suddenly and said he didnt know the meaning of teamwork that brought mr gibbs out to chicago for a weekend meeting with his drivers in the daily southtown phil arvia discusses mr gibbss visit and the two sides of mr stewart who "usually seems to hit his stride when the temperature heats up along with his tongue this season he courted public relations trouble only once suggesting on his radio show that nascar was using caution flags to orchestrate finishes until he and hamlin traded paint and unpleasantries last week its enough to make you think chaos is as important to stewart as his chevy " in the chicago sun times herb gould found mr stewarts postgame comments more entertaining than the actual race and wonders if the structure of the season is at fault "nextel cup racing is a marathon not a sprint " he writes "the rewards for winning a race arent great enough for the risks involved in going all out to win if the other guy is faster its smarter to fall into line take your points and get ready for the next race " maybe mr gould was in the wrong place in the northwest herald kevin kaduk salutes the jackman whom he calls "a quarterback in a fireproof suit" after getting a rundown of the job from jason lee of stewart and gibbs racing "the idea lee said is that by the time that the car hits its spot the jackman should already be in position on its right side " mr kaduk writes "the most successful stop includes lifting all pounds with one pump of the jack before directing the displaced tires to the waiting hands of the carriers once the new tires are on the jackman lets the car down and hurries to the left side where he repeats the process preferably this all should be done as quickly as possible all while making sure not to drop the car too early trip over the tire changers pinch a finger off in the jack or get clipped by passing pit lane traffic " rowdy hardy is a " lefty pitcher whos with a era for wilmington the kansas city royals high class a team in innings hes given up hits and walks so why arent royals fans buzzing about mr hardy because he throws his fastball at around mph and in baseball today that makes you a suspect instead of a prospect the curious case of soft tossing mr hardy is exhibit a in an examination by joe posnanski of the kansas city star of the radar gun and its proper role in baseball mr posnanski examines why earl weaver wanted radar gun readings its not the reason you usually hear today surveys the long history of successful royals whose fastballs could barely break glass then examines the long history of unsuccessful royals whose impressive fastballs couldnt touch the strike zone itd be a depressing chronicle except for the surprising and heartening step the royals have taken to break their radar gun addiction and then theres mr hardy "one of the great things about hardy is that he is by all evidence immune to the radar gun allure " mr posnanski writes "he came to grips with his dawdling fastball a long time ago he believes in his heart that he can get people out now all he needs is to get everybody to point their radar guns somewhere else speeding cars maybe and notice that he is getting people out " in a summer of baseball milestones the philadelphia phillies finally achieved theirs by losing their th game a loss at home to the st louis cardinals its a melancholy milestone to be sure but one thats been awaited and acknowledged with uncharacteristic cheerfulness in philadelphia and thats revealed the better natures of phillie fans and fans in general in the philadelphia inquirer bill lyon writes that "this is for all of you for the more than million of you who have slogged resolutely along this trail of tears who have sworn passionate pledges of allegiance and bought tickets to see the major league franchise of philadelphia attempt to commit baseball for the last century and a quarter that is the number that speaks to the heart of the phillies fan a curious ambivalent mixture of idealism and fatalism at once demanding and yet forgiving and above all resilient durable refusing to yield for whom surrender is unthinkable " with the british open beginning later this week time to honor a rather unheralded golfer from its history the day he did the maurice g flitcroft suffered from the aches and pains of lumbago and fibrositis perhaps distracted by his ailments he made wrong turns driving to the golf course and arrived too late to warm up properly such was his rush to history that he then barely had time to change his shoes and sip tea from his flask he even left his faithful wood in his car boot we shall see that these are the accidents of fate from which immortality is fashioned for on that day maurice g flitcroft took his place in golfs pantheon of iconic figures a man who reached for the stars only to fall off the ladder into a bucket of paint the late mr flitcrofts is over par the worst score in the opens year history how he ever got to shoot it is a tale that dave kindred enjoys digging into

redskins dallas cowboys and the new england patriots in the boston globe bob ryan offers an appreciation of an nfl original beginning with the rather odd seeming fact that he was an avid collector of antiques "bucko kilroy in an antique store " mr ryan asks "all feet inches and whatever pounds of him i would think theyd make him sign a waiver before theyd allow him to set foot in the joint " in
