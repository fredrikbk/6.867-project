plastic surgeon sometime during the bush years the verb "to politicize" became an all purpose epithet a good rule of thumb is that whenever charges of "politicization" are leveled the likelihood is that someone has made a political judgment that its opponents dont like the latest scandal ette is that the office of the surgeon general has been "politicized " richard carmona having filled out a four year tenure in the office caused a fuss last tuesday when he declared he had been muzzled and marginalized because of ideological differences this narrative advanced on thursday at a confirmation hearing for james holsinger jr a kentucky cardiologist nominated to succeed dr carmona the initial rap on dr holsinger was that he was anti gay in he wrote a short paper for a local church committee that characterized homosexual sex as unnatural and "incompatible with christian teaching " some may consider this religious view disqualifying for american public life but it hardly justifies the repeated insinuation that dr holsinger believes gays should be denied medical care in refutation the doctor noted his "deep deep appreciation for the essential humanity of everyone " and the seriousness of the senate confirmation process dropped another notch the burlesque then moved to its real purpose which was to arouse support for legislation sponsored by senator ted kennedy and representative henry waxman to make the surgeon general "independent " dr holsinger granted that yes politics should never trump public health the unnoticed absurdity was that dr holsinger then offered all manner of purely political views his top priority is "the obesity epidemic " and he wants to prohibit advertisements for foods that are too sugary or fatty and he favors federal regulation of food in vending machines he also endorsed heavy taxation of cigarettes to make the u s "a tobacco free nation" a ban on pharmaceutical advertising some form of universal health care and an expansion of the state childrens health insurance program schip nobody seemed to mind possibly because these highly political judgments meshed with those of his democratic questioners along the way dr holsinger did at least stumble upon the essential point while opining on stem cell research "i think we cannot have unfettered science without moral and ethical implications being looked at " science and public policy cannot be disentangled too much fat may be bad for your waistline but the business of politics is to figure out what if anything to do about it the office of the surgeon general was created in the th century with no specific mandate and it has no real powers besides the bully pulpit on occasion its holders have done well by educating americans on some matter of public health but theres no reason this megaphone should be exempted from the give and take of political debate the kennedy waxman legislation would all but remove the surgeon general from the executive branch the president could only appoint from a congressionally vetted list the office would get its own budget and "americas doctor" would be accountable only to congress what a surprise it would be better to abolish the office entirely
