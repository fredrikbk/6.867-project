the doctors office doctor patient relationship is an endangered species online edition one of the joys of being a family doctor is the relationships that ive developed with my patients over the last years its the source of energy that keeps me going after a night up delivering babies or a day of business hassles the sense of being needed and contributing to the fabric of the community is the best job satisfaction there is my patients have pulled the family van out of a snowy ditch towed my old honda civic to town when it broke down shingled the roof put windows and doors on the house installed a new fridge after lightning zapped the house last month and brought food to the office id like to think the care theyve demonstrated toward me and my family follows from the care ive extended to them and their family having a long term personal physician who knows your medical condition as well as your quirks and your family is a rarity these days with an ever shifting array of preferred providers and insurance panels plus a proliferation of retail clinics staying with one doctor for long may seem like a throwback to another era the relationship between physician and patient like the family farm is endangered in some places id say its already extinct and thats unfortunate for starters a relationship with a doctor can help provide a safety net when you lose your job and your insurance or become disabled recently a year old lady came back to town after falling on hard times id known her since i delivered her daughter six years ago she was crying and despondent after having suffered for two years with a herniated disk in her neck after a work injury after the injury she lost her job and the insurance benefits that went with it navigating the disability system was humiliating and difficult she couldnt afford the &# office call at the neurosurgeons office for a pain medication refill she needed pain medication but what she needed most was someone who cared though i hadnt seen her for two years i remembered her talked with her on the phone and evaluated and treated her in the same day for free when i follow patients for years i have a better chance to talk them into health screenings and to notice when they dont follow through with recommended testing like annual mammograms and cancer screening i had a follow up last week with a woman with bladder cancer she previously had bounced from doctor to doctor for many years before joining my practice her cancer was diagnosed because of our relationship and a well timed referral to a urologist because she felt comfortable confiding in me that she sometimes had blood in her urine she was able to be diagnosed in time to save her bladder from a tennis ball sized tumor those without the experience of having a steady family doctor might never have given much thought to a relationship with a physician but its something i think about a lot as i make decisions on how to run my practice the doctor patient relationship started to go downhill when patients stopped paying their own office bills for routine care and third party insurance and medicare became the driving forces that was before my time now primary care doctors are pressured to churn patients through the office to the detriment of relationship building and possibly the health of their patients at the same time patients may have to switch doctors because of changes in their insurance i try to avoid the worst situations that i feel the fragmented health system can create when deciding whether to be part of an insurers network i weigh whether the insurers contract interferes too much with my shared decision making with a patient some programs have interfered more with my care of patients than i bargained for when i signed up referral processes and the hoops the patients and i have to jump through to get basic things done are ridiculous and can undermine patients confidence in me i wouldnt sign up again for such programs knowing what i do now as much as i hate to do it to my patients ive had to turn insurance contracts down because of inadequate reimbursement and let some patients find a new doctor patients pay for the churning in terms of lack of adequate follow up lost health histories lower quality of service and possibly poorer health outcomes especially those with chronic diseases like asthma diabetes and heart disease despite the low pay a new illinois medicaid program that links a specific patient with one main doctor gets the thumbs up in my book find out more about the program at www illinoishealthconnect com as we consider proposals to improve our health care system we need to rebuild and preserve the relationship between the patient and the physician its good for patients and business
