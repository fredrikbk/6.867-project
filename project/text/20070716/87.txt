why steel industrys consolidation balkanization may keep prices high washington even as the steel business becomes increasingly global with the continued spate of cross border mergers and acquisitions it is also becoming more balkanized a trend that should keep prices relatively high for the foreseeable future as the industry consolidates dominant regional players have grown strong enough to capture nearby customers and fend off competition from outside their areas for companies in steel consuming industries including auto makers appliance manufacturers and commercial construction companies this means a continuation of the commodity price inflation that has dogged them for the past five years hot rolled steel a benchmark base product used in most finished steel is hovering around &# a ton on the spot market in that same steel cost as little as &# a ton on the spot market right now steel prices are softening in certain parts of the world especially china and the u s as customers work off inventories incurred last year when buyers stocked up to hedge against expected price increases but prices are expected to climb in and remain at a higher level for the longer term for steel companies industry consolidation along with forces that are encouraging steel users to buy locally means being able to avoid the cyclical steep price drops caused by companies selling at bargain basement prices just to keep the mills running "there will always be downturns in pricing " says lakshmi mittal chief executive and president of arcelormittal the worlds biggest steel company but he added "i am predicting the death of the cyclical volatility that caused prices to spiral down to unsustainable levels " mr mittal has been a major player in the industrys consolidation and its balkanization buying smaller weaker mills and turning them into regional powerhouses take the four steel mills operating within miles of one another around east chicago ind a decade ago the four steel mills had four different owners u s steel corp bethlehem steel ltv corp and inland ispat whenever steel prices started heading down rather than cutting production to keep supply tight and prices firm they ramped up production and tried to make money on volume it was often cheaper to keep mills running rather than starting and stopping them even if the steel had to be sold at unprofitable prices but such activity exaggerated the fall in steel prices because buyers could pit one mill against the other for a lower price in a matter of months steel prices might spiral down today those four east chicago mills are still operating but with just two owners u s steel with the same plant and arcelormittal as the new owner of the other three in the brief downturn in steel demand arcelormittal kept traction on a price slide by idling one of its steel blast furnaces which prevented a deep price spiral benefiting both arcelormittal and u s steel "there is no question that consolidation has allowed steel companies and management to become more disciplined " says charles bradford steel analyst for bradford research inc "they dont have to resort to feeding on themselves to stay alive " keith busse chief executive and president of steel dynamics inc an indiana minimill agrees he also sees more symbiosis now with both steelmakers and customers depending on each other one customer who makes garage door parts alerted him that he wouldnt be buying as much steel because of the slump in housing allowing steel dynamics to adjust production he says with steel producers suffering less from price drops they are also less likely to jack up prices to the point where customers go under further flattening the price cycle although no single global steel player is big enough to dominate world production the biggest players still control only about of production unlike the aluminum and auto industries which have far fewer and much bigger players their operations are big enough to dominate local markets roughly a to mile radius around each mill that means steel users have less leverage to winnow down prices some of these steel using companies will be able to absorb higher costs while others may pass some of the higher costs on to consumers what is happening in the steel sector is somewhat unusual typically globalizing industries squeeze more profit by leveraging their lowest cost operations and shipping that product to higher paying customers around the world steels shift toward regionally dominant players is occurring for several reasons demand has been fairly strong across the board in various markets in the past three years so there isnt usually a need to send surplus elsewhere steel demand is expected to grow everywhere but china where demand is expected to grow about in says peter marcus of world steel dynamics a research and advisory firm in englewood cliffs n j transportation costs are also taking the incentive out of invading far away markets the price to move goods especially heavy ones like steel from one place to another is growing each year in large part because of higher energy costs and tight supply as other goods that arent produced and sold regionally fill ships the cost to ship a ton of steel has doubled since to about &# &# a ton consequently regional steelmakers have an advantage with customers who dont want or cant afford to pay the high costs of having steel shipped to them finally the chinese government is adding export taxes for some steel products and voluntarily agreeing to some restrictions on the amount of steel china exports to europe of course if demand for steel drops unexpectedly analysts wonder whether mills in china a relatively low cost producer that has recently ramped up output would turn off some blast furnaces or would continue at full pace and dump the steel at low prices around the world still economists analysts and steel executives are placing their bets that a worst case scenario wont happen and that the current trend of simultaneous globalization and balkanization will continue and with it a flattening out of the cyclical nature of the steel industry on the globalization front just last week brazilian steelmaker gerdau said it agreed to acquire american steelmaker chaparral steel co for &# billion earlier this year indian steelmaker essar global ltd purchased canadas algoma steel and russias oao severstal is stepping up its pursuit of canadas stelco inc mr mittal says that any steelmaker not considering consolidating and dominating its regional market will be in trouble "now is the time for the second and third tier mills to start consolidating or they will find themselves in a very difficult place " he says
