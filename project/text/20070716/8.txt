conservative ethnic kurds so unofficial mediators still have a role to play mr sanli whose reconciliations are sometimes chronicled in local newspapers is the best known and the most prolific of the bunch a minor celebrity he focuses on this region but has resolved disputes all over the country in a neat pink ledger mr sanli has entered feuds he helped resolve since he began keeping records a decade ago the actual number is at least twice that he says covering nearly years of peacemaking mr sanli says he sees the ledger as an anthology of ignorance and misery a holdover from a feudal culture of an eye for an eye one of his most complex cases involved a land dispute that started with two shepherds five years ago and mushroomed into a full blown tribal feud that claimed lives after a year of negotiations in which he pleaded with tribal chiefs to rise above the tit for tat mr sanli held a peace ceremony last july that included participants in another case a man killed a year old boy in late june for speaking too loudly outside his window a few days later the mans wife came to see mr sanli in tears fearing her son would be killed in revenge mr sanli says hell pay a visit to

large cattle farm he also runs a butchers and breeders trade group and owns a funeral parlor in the provincial capital diyarbakir energetic and diminutive mr sanli has eight children and grandchildren and jokes that the longest conflict in his family lasts no more than minutes mr sanli says he was inspired to get into peacemaking by his own history when he was a sanli family cow trespassed onto a neighbors property the annoyed neighbor cut off its tail in an ensuing fight mr sanlis uncle killed the neighbor with a rock fearing revenge the sanli clan fled the village and the feud took another years and several scuffles to resolve "you cannot even imagine what type of life this is " mr sanli says "you are always panicking because you think you are going to die " for the past two months he has been working furiously on the bozkus bingol elopement mr bozkuss son met mr bingols daughter last year in a small village near the town of lice pronounced "lee je" after several secret dates they

says his family just wanted to see where his daughter was living and never intended any harm but the strangers frightened mr bozkus who traveled to diyarbakir and briefed mr sanli in a shaded

said those two love each other please show your big heart " mr sanli recalls "he said hed think about it " mr sanli also asked mr bingol to rein in his son and other relatives mr bingol was polite but he had a demand of his own as compensation he wanted mr bozkus to hand over one of his daughters as a bride for one of his sons such a marriage would be an unhappy one mr sanli replied instead he proposed a payment that would help down the road when one of mr bingols sons found a wife mr bingol asked for &# but mr sanli haggled him down to &# still a large sum for farmers then mr sanli persuaded the two family patriarchs to meet on a searing afternoon earlier this month mr sanli and several village elders gathered at mr bingols single story hut a lunch of rice lamb and yogurt served over a plastic sheet covering the floor was waiting "im begging you please forgive them " pleaded mr sanli propped on a pillow "if someone makes a mistake we shouldnt respond with another mistake " "they embarrassed me its so humiliating for me " mr bingol replied "ok ok lets close this issue " mr sanli said loudly jumping up from his pillow and leaning toward mr bingol "we dont want to see more fighting we all suffered a lot in this area from vendettas " a deferential mr bozkus the grooms father entered the room a few minutes later he and mr bingol briefly disappeared into a side room where the prearranged payment was made mr bingol still isnt happy with his daughter "she should find another father " he said "i will erase her from my memory " driving home at a breakneck speed mr sanli
