mr mackeys offense reading about the covert blogging of whole foods ceo john mackey we were reminded of a new yorker cartoon from some years ago featuring two mutts and a computer "on the internet " one says to the other "nobody knows youre a dog " apparently u s financial regulators dont get the joke theyre responding to mr mackeys anonymous blogging by treating him like a dog or more precisely a potential violator of u s securities laws with the bonus goal of scuttling mr mackeys attempted purchase of whole foods competitor wild oats the sec is leaking as usual that it has opened an "informal" enforcement probe sure "informal " thatll teach mr mackey to flog the virtues of his company on the web he made the mistake in todays hyper regulated world of giving the impression in his blogging that he was just another internet surfing schmoe with an opinion using the alias "rahodeb " a scramble of his wifes name he talked up his company while talking down competitors and judging from the exchanges weve seen generally served as an anonymous corporate cheerleader he once shot down an online rumor about trouble at a london whole foods for example by posting that "i googled whole foods england and read the connected articles and saw nothing whatsoever about whole foods having any problems building their new london store " oh oh cant have that the sec is now going to unleash its army of ambitious year old lawyers to read these blog posts to see if mr mackey let slip any insider information the federal trade commission is also using the posts as a pr and potential legal weapon in its campaign to block the whole foods acquisition of wild oats the ftc which apparently hasnt had enough to do is alarmed that the two organic food purveyors overlap in all of markets its gang of ambitious year old lawyers is already using mr mackeys words against him to portray his takeover attempt as evidence of monopoly intent without having read all of his posts we cant say what mr mackey might have disclosed but from what weve read we cant see how any reasonable person could conclude that rahodebs opinions were going to have any appreciable effect on the whole foods share price the fact that they werent was precisely the point at a time when corporate execs are often accused of being isolated mr mackey seems to have enjoyed the web engagement and used the semi informed opinions voiced on a yahoo message board as his own sounding board to sample the mood of his customers the straitjacket that has descended on ceos including sarbanes oxley and the secs regulation fd "fair disclosure" has often had the perverse effect of restricting the flow of information and thus preventing informed corporate insiders from participating in the markets increasingly democratic information free for all in some cases these prohibitions only keep news and informed views under wraps leading to volatility and "surprises" that can themselves create incentives for insider trading some media scolds will strain to find examples of mr mackey trying to put more optimistic forecasts into circulation than he would offer as ceo but the real lesson is in that cartoon about the dogs mr mackeys comments were the equal of any other investors who participate on such message boards know that they dont know whos on the other end of their exchanges we hope regulators dont punish mr mackey for barking on the web on behalf of his company see related letter "letters to the editor of mackey malfeasance" wsj july
