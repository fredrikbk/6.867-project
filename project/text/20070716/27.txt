emerging ambitions p&amp gs global target shelves of tiny stores it woos poor women buying single portions mexicos hot zones leon mexico every day martina perez diaz spends about five hours sewing pairs of black loafers by hand for a wage of pesos or about &# when she wants to wash her hair she walks to her local tiendita or "small store " to buy a ounce single use packet of procter &amp gamble co s head &amp shoulders shampoo the price two pesos or about cents "that i usually can afford " she says shoppers like ms diaz factor heavily into p&amp gs plan to conquer more of the globe the consumer products giant has a goal of increasing total sales by to annually over the next three years as part of that mission it is looking to tap roughly one billion additional consumers most of them very poor women who live in developing countries reaching these customers isnt easy in emerging markets p&amp g estimates that of people buy their wares from mom and pop stores no bigger than a closet crammed with food and a hodgepodge of household items these retailers serve as the pantries of the worlds poorest consumers for whom both money and space are tight rather than stock up on full size goods which cost more per item they buy small portions of soap laundry detergent and single diapers as they need them even though the smaller sizes are usually sold at a premium in mexico city for instance a full size bottle of head &amp shoulders that lasts roughly shampoos costs half as much per ounce as a single use sachet p&amp g calls such locally owned bodegas stalls and kiosks "high frequency stores " because of the multiple times shoppers visit them during a single day or week though most are rudimentary usually operating out of the owners home these shops are a vital route into developing markets executives believe but while p&amp g estimates there to be about million high frequency stores world wide so far just million carry their products over the past six years p&amp g has been deploying its armies of researchers product developers and merchandising wizards to better understand both high frequency store shoppers owners and the haphazard distributor networks that stock them for p&amp g the stakes are high sales of p&amp g products in developing markets currently total &# billion up from &# billion five years ago in recent years emerging markets have contributed about of the companys "organic" sales growth which excludes gains from acquisitions the company still lags other consumer product rivals last year p&amp g derived of sales in these regions a far cry from unilever and colgate palmolive co which manage to snag about of their business in developing markets many industry observers initially believed that these independently owned shops would die out as major retailers such as wal mart stores inc and united kingdom based tesco plc expanded their reach into developing markets instead p&amp g saw the opposite happen today high frequency stores considered in aggregate are p&amp gs largest customer with wal mart coming in second as these countries economies have grown more tiny stores have popped up to serve their customers rising fortunes the buy in bulk mentality which had made mass merchants roll over smaller stores in the u s simply didnt apply "that was a paradigm shift for us " says p&amp g chief operating officer robert mcdonald "well be in those big box stores but weve also got to be in the small ones " though mexico is one of wal marts most successful markets high frequency stores are still regularly visited by of the population p&amp g estimates by the companys count mexico has high frequency stores in most villages and cities there is one approximately every one and a half blocks though the average shopper spends just pesos or &# a day in high frequency stores annual sales total about &# billion selling products through these stores requires a special set of skills product visibility for instance is one of the biggest challenges to selling in high frequency stores shops tend to be poorly lit and in latin america average just square feet in size p&amp g found to store owners displaying p&amp g staples like household cleaners bath soaps and shampoos isnt a priority those types of products typically represent just of their sales while food brings in and soda brings in to maximize space shopkeepers often store laundry detergent toilet paper rolls and shampoo packets beneath the counter handing them to shoppers only upon request so p&amp g began lobbying for better shelf space one tiny store at a time by offering them special perks that rivals do not p&amp g employed merchandisers visit the stores about every two weeks to tidy the shelves of their products post signs with the items prices and hand out promotional items including posters also sales representatives deliver inventory to stores themselves often sparing owners a trip to the local distributor p&amp g touts other advantages too household cleaners and beauty products bring a higher profit margin than food candy and soda and when products are arranged as p&amp g suggests sales of those items increases the company claims to owners five years ago it launched a "golden store" program to encourage owners to display p&amp g products more prominently as part of the initiative representatives visit the stores to spruce up the shelves and display marketing materials small touches store owners say they like to be considered a golden store in mexico retailers must agree to carry or so p&amp g products displayed together rather than next to competing brands so far about have the designation to prompt even more sales of its products p&amp g began distributing a magazine called "tu negocio " or "your business " reserved for golden store owners the publication explains the benefits of the companys products it also offers basic business management tips including how to calculate profit margins on the items the stores sell recently jose ramon riestra p&amp gs director of high frequency stores in latin america dropped by a golden store in leon immediately he noticed that several p&amp g products including pampers diapers and camay soap were placed along a side wall on shelves below waist level inside a glass case since most shoppers tend to linger for less than seconds they likely wouldnt notice the goods smiling as he introduced himself to rocio vazquez a shy year old at the cash register mr riestra complimented her on her familys store ms vazquez estimates about people from the neighborhood shop there every day often two or three times after inquiring generally about sales mr riestra got to the real business at hand "why are our products so far away over there " he asked pointing to a side wall "why not put them behind you " p&amp g calls space nearest the cashier the "hot zone " and considers it the most valuable real estate in these small stores since more than of customers already know what theyre going to buy p&amp g figures little time is spent browsing but p&amp g researchers found that shoppers tend to gaze at the cashiers area for a precious five seconds as they wait for the owner to hand them a product or get their change a prime opportunity to influence future purchases despite mr riestras request for better placement ms vazquez didnt budge "were known locally as a food store " she says pointing to the potato chips candy and a bowl of hersheys kisses priced two for a peso or about nine cents that occupied the space that mr riestra wanted next mr riestra and a p&amp g sales representative tried to persuade ms vazquez to carry an additional version of ace detergent called ace natural containing aloe the detergent promises to make washing clothes by hand gentler on skin usually high frequency stores carry just one or two brands of detergent so persuading shopkeepers to take on an additional version of a brand they already sell is difficult "tell your customers this will be better for their hands " mr riestra says pointing to the ace bags illustration of an aloe plant he also noted that the price pesos or cents is a peso less than the regular version of ace she already carries on this score he had better luck ms vazquez agreed to carry a few packages of the new detergent initially p&amp g had its own exclusive sales force in mexico to supply store owners with its products then two years ago the company decided that it lacked the scale and resources to maximize distribution especially in far flung regions p&amp g began offering basic sales training to independent agents and encouraged them to build their own teams today the company is experimenting with allowing agents and their workers to earn commissions from markups on products sold to stores by relying on local agents p&amp g is also able to strengthen its ties to store owners this is especially important since owners can be very influential in the brands their customers choose though the agents jobs can be lucrative the barriers to entry are high each must buy his or her own inventory up front paying in cash to purchase his first supply of p&amp g products last year luis mosqueda says he sold nearly all of his familys furniture his car his childrens toys and his mothers gold jewelry now he says he earns about &# a year an income that makes him relatively affluent twelve sales representatives work for him including two of his brothers in marketing goods to low income shoppers p&amp g tries to keep in mind their budget constraints and even the coins they carry because they are often paid a daily wage mexican customers generally carry five and peso coins "if you want to sell to low income consumers you have to know whats in their pockets " mr riestra says "it doesnt make sense to have something cost or pesos " to ensure satisfactory profit margins p&amp g uses what it calls "reverse engineering " rather than create an item and then assign a price to it as in most developed markets the company first considers what consumers can afford from there it adjusts the features and manufacturing processes to meet various pricing targets to hold down the cost of its ace natural detergent used to hand wash clothes p&amp g reduced the amount of enzymes in the product the result a product that costs a peso less than regular ace and is gentler on skin p&amp g says that reverse engineering helps to keep the companys after tax margins "comparable" to those in wealthier developed countries internally p&amp g emphasizes to its employees that products developed for high frequency market must "delight not dilute " quality executives say is still critical "you cannot trick a low income consumer because they cant afford to buy products that dont work " says mr riestra if a product doesnt perform "they wont ever buy you again and theyll tell everyone they know about it too " the company has addressed this point in several ways running water for example is in short supply for many low income mexican consumers in response p&amp g developed a fabric softener downy single rinse it can be added to a load of laundry along with detergent to eliminate an entire rinse cycle in the semiautomatic machines typically used here other observations of the crowded quarters in which many poor mexican people reside have led to lucrative insights about feminine hygiene products with women usually lacking the money and privacy to change their pads frequently p&amp g developed naturella a low priced extra absorbent cotton pad scented with chamomile which has soothing and feminine connotations in latin america driven by strong sales in high frequency stores naturella propelled p&amp g to take the lead in feminine care in mexico and is now sold in other developing markets including russia poland and the balkans this september p&amp g plans to bring to latin america a merchandising technique common in the tiny shops of asia hanging products from the ceiling finding that dangling items can catch shoppers attention more than products sitting on shelves mariano martin p&amp gs global customer business development officer issued a directive to his team "own the air " "the ceiling is still a very virgin location " says christiane rizk a research specialist for high frequency stores "we have to get there before someone else does "
