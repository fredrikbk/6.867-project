the china syndrome what could be reassuring about killer chinese toothpaste toys and tires hard to believe but theres a silver lining the rash of product recalls reveals that china is not the manufacturing juggernaut we fear and that america has an edge we tend to overlook sure greed factors into why chinese suppliers make defective even harmful products but often its because of just plain ineptitude if you visited a typical chinese factory youd see why it lacks capital technology and know how its workers place obedience over quality and it sits along an endless chain of middlemen on average it takes china separate parties to produce a product that would take us three unlike japan in the s little companies drive chinas economic growth not big ones chinas industries are composed of hundreds of thousands of tiny factories and farms plus traders brokers haulers and agents all of whom take control of the goods and materials but add little value to the product with every additional player in the chain the cost risk and time grow effective quality control in this environment is difficult so is effective cost control despite cheap labor making goods in china is often more expensive than in the u s far from being a bottomless atm of cheap consumer goods china is a risky costly and time consuming place to do business yet polls show a majority of americans believe china has mastered basic manufacturing and its now barreling into our high tech backyard thats false as the product recalls demonstrate china can barely make low value goods reliably much less higher value ones the problems are structural not the result of a few bad apples to compete head to head with the american economy china will have to revolutionize the very way its industries are organized it must shake out the thousands of low value middlemen and integrate the tiny factories into larger more competitive companies it must train a workforce in modern technology and business practices and it must instill transparency and a uniform rule of law such an effort could span generations meanwhile were expected to believe that america will import chinese passenger cars in just two years making products that live up to international standards requires more than simply modern production lines your entire corporate culture along with that of your suppliers and buyers must be focused on minimizing errors and defects rattle around in a chinese made car and youll see tangible proof of why theyve had to delay their launch into the u s market again and again and just how far china still has to go before it can make a car americans will buy the u s economy on the other hand can efficiently produce a wide variety of goods and services in most industries were decades ahead of china and huge swaths of our economy like the services sector and high tech manufacturing dont even exist in china yet america possesses this competitive edge at the precise moment when chinese consumers are buying more than ever before chinas middle class already outnumbers the combined populations of the united kingdom and france and its expanding at a rate not seen since the industrial rise of the u s europe and japan chinese consumers want modern homes schools and hospitals as well as advanced technologies and infrastructure local sources cant keep up with demand so china imports most of the higher value goods materials and services it needs as a result china is increasingly buying american and growing five times faster than any other market for u s exports nearly all sectors of the u s economy are experiencing unprecedented chinese demand and while most americans fear the flood of cheap chinese goods many of these products are in fact composed of u s raw materials and components the chinese apparel that lines our shelves is made from american cotton the housewares from american steel the computers from american technologies so as chinese imports to the u s surge american exports to china surge too china is buying from large u s companies as well as small ones and china is the fastest growing export market for small business we should take another hard look at the "china century " chinas rise need not drive americas fall by tapping into its expansion and capitalizing on our strengths americas companies have a once in a century windfall opportunity to build value make money and create jobs here at home not shutter the shop putting near term gains aside though the next century will not be led by the country that can make the cheapest copy of a spark plug it will be led by innovators and entrepreneurs americas unrivaled assets innovation not imitation will create jobs and maintain americas economic primacy in the century ahead the scope of the product recalls will surely widen as we start to scrutinize what were importing from china remember these recalls tell us as much about china as they do about america the silver lining is our inherent strength mr
