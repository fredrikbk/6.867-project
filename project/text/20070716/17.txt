business time backers thrive on bb firms telecom data storage provide ipo paydays for venture capitalists silicon valley investors searching for their next google size windfall still are pouring money into consumer focused web sites and technology companies that do online video and "social networking" web sites where like minded people meet and chat online but the big paydays are being realized elsewhere in the past months initial public offerings of stock by technology companies backed by venture capitalists in the u s have raised more than &# billion according to thomson financial a big chunk of the profits for vcs has come from less glamorous business focused companies selling such products as telecommunications equipment and computer storage some of the nearly such companies that have gone public now sport market capitalizations of more than &# billion each last month alone four telecom and data storage companies starent networks corp limelight networks inc infinera corp and data domain inc launched initial public offerings another telecom company shoretel inc debuted early this month the shares of all five have risen at least since the ipos shares of infinera are up venture capital firms such as highland capital partners matrix partners accel partners sequoia capital and kleiner perkins caufield &amp byers which backed some of these companies have been big beneficiaries for many firms it marks a stark turnabout from the bleak days of and when many venture capitalists were killing off failing companies in their portfolios rather than counting profits "weve had to be very patient " says tom crotty a partner at battery ventures of waltham mass which backed the now publicly traded telecom equipment makers optium corp and veraz networks inc which sell products to businesses battery also has stakes in netezza corp and bladelogic inc two data center companies that have filed for ipos the profits generated by the dozens of stock debuts of these work horse business focused equipment companies dwarf the venture returns of the handful of recent consumer deals such as google inc s &# billion purchase of youtube com which had been backed by just one venture capital firm indeed of the technology ipos in the u s since january only a handful involved companies directly serving consumers one was troubled internet phone company vonage holdings corp its stock has plummeted in the past year amid heightened competition and a patent dispute with verizon communications inc yet the scant attention generated by these little known networking outfits especially compared with such trendy companies as youtube and myspace "seems to be totally out of whack" given the networking companies big returns for investors says peter fenton a partner with benchmark capital in menlo park calif myspace is a social networking site owned by news corp venture capital investors typically buy stakes in small start up companies generating profits only when their portfolio companies go public or are sold profits generally are much higher for ipos than for company sales venture capitalists in the first quarter poured nearly &# billion into internet companies broadly defined up from &# million a year earlier according to the most recent figures from the national venture capital association and thomson financial though many of those companies serve individual consumers some were business focused communications or software companies that used the internet in some way a subset of internet companies often known as web companies they publish the web logs known as blogs or facilitate social networking or audio programming streamed on the internet among other activities received about &# million in the first half from venture capitalists that was up nearly from the &# million invested a year earlier according to research firm ventureone meanwhile the amount of money that venture investors are putting into networking gear and telecom companies while still large is declining these financiers invested &# million in communications and networking companies in the first quarter down from about &# million a year earlier says ventureone ventureone is a unit of dow jones &amp co which publishes the wall street journal all of this highlights how cash rich silicon valley often follows faddish investing trends and overfunds certain sectors despite a lack of returns "i dont want to use the word lemmings " says scott bonham a partner with granite global ventures "but its sort of like five year old kids playing soccer they all swarm around the ball " to be sure some of the consumer companies getting money from venture capitalists today could yield profits for their investors eventually popular social networking site facebook inc for example already has spurned acquisition overtures from such giants as viacom inc and yahoo inc and could go public in the coming years venture capitalists typically take a long term view and dont expect companies they fund to have an ipo or a sale for three to seven years some investors note there hasnt been a blockbuster consumer internet ipo since googles &# billion deal in despite heavy investment in consumer internet companies and some of the consumer web firms that have snagged venture money in the past few years are selling themselves to larger internet or media companies such as google or microsoft corp for a few hundred million dollars or less meaning returns for investors can be mediocre microsofts &# million purchase this year of voice recognition company tellme networks inc whose technology is used for phone directory assistance and internet searches on cellphones among other things was unusually large "does it prove there are companies in the consumer field you can make money on absolutely yes " says kevin fong a managing director at mayfield fund menlo park "does it mean that it makes the space a good investment unclear "
