ahead of the tape rising volatility risks strangling liquidity flow investors spend a lot of time worrying about big jolts to financial markets but a rising frequency of little tremors could be the more important concern for the past several years financial market volatility has been strikingly low but that could be changing last week there were two days when the dow jones industrial average moved more than in one session one up and one down bringing the number of days this year to that compares with such days in all of last year the chicago board options exchanges implied volatility index has been trending higher this year known as the vix the index is based on prices for s&amp p put and call options which let investors buy and sell the index at prearranged prices the more investors worry about sudden moves in stocks the more theyll pay for those options in practice investors volatility expectations are based on what theyve seen in the rearview mirror the rise in the vix merely reflects how volatile the market has been lately other financial assets including high yield corporate bonds emerging market debt and of course anything backed by subprime mortgages have also become more volatile a continued rise in volatility would have important consequences one reason that financial market liquidity funds available for investing has been so ample in recent years is that low volatility has made investors more willing to make bets and lenders more willing to extend credit to market participants if volatility continues to rise it could stanch the flow of liquidity a banks overriding concern when making a loan is that it gets back its capital if an investor wants to put &# down for a &# investment with the bank lending him the remaining &# the bank needs to feel fairly certain that the investment isnt going to suddenly drop by more than &# when the markets got roiled by troubles at two bear stearns hedge funds last month part of the problem was that the funds investments fell to the point where their lenders were worried that they wouldnt get back the money theyd lent as a result the lenders wall street firms moved to sell the investments they held as collateral in an effort recover at least some of their capital in that case it wasnt stocks that had become more volatile it was complex derivatives backed by subprime mortgages bear and its lenders had expected these investments to be less volatile than they turned out to be something many other hedge funds are also discovering about subprime backed bonds these days if financial assets are becoming more volatile points out jeffrey rosenberg head of credit strategy at banc of america securities lenders are going to be less willing to extend as much credit to investors that would restrain what has been an important source of liquidity for financial markets whats more with fewer buyers and sellers to agree on price less liquid markets can be more volatile what has been a cycle of very low volatility and rising liquidity could be in the process of becoming a little less virtuous send comments to justin lahart wsj com
