politics &amp economics safety becomes a hot trade issue as china and u s cite import concerns fears grow rules may be abused as china and other nations exchange heated accusations over the safety of their food and other products it is becoming clear that safety and quality standards are increasingly replacing tariffs and quotas as focal points for international trade disputes chinese authorities friday announced a temporary suspension of imports of some products from several u s meat processors including tyson foods inc sanderson farms inc and cargill inc the notice said chinas tests had found safety problems including salmonella in frozen chicken from tyson and residues of growth hormones in cargills frozen pork ribs the move highlights the chinese governments determination to show it has food safety issues under control after a series of scares and scandals has undermined the confidence of domestic consumers and hurt the image of chinas exports abroad the food and drug administration has blocked shipments of chinese made toothpaste and of several types of farm raised chinese seafood because of worries about chemical contamination china has have pledged to tighten scrutiny of exports and said that thousands of unlicensed or unsafe food producers have been closed down china says more than of u s food imports from china passed fda inspection in each of the last three years chinese authorities also have pledged to look more closely at imports in addition to the chicken and pork ribs blocked last week china in recent weeks has turned back french bottled water australian seafood and a u s drink mix that authorities said were contaminated or failed safety tests safety standards have a history of being used as trade barriers and observers in china and the u s worry that a pattern may be reappearing the back and forth of blocked imports looks increasingly like a trade battle one in which accusations of endangering consumers have taken the place of charges of unfair competition and dumping "we are likely to see these requirements increasingly being used and abused as a trade barrier " says leora blumberg an international trade adviser based in hong kong for the law firm heller ehrman llp ms blumberg says that a series of global trade pacts has reduced import duties across the board and restrained the ability of nations to block trade through other means the current u s furor over issues such as tainted pet food and dangerous toys that were made in china has emerged at a time when u s china trade is a potent political issue in washington several u s lawmakers had called for trade sanctions against china because of what they describe as unfair trading practices even before safety concerns became widespread "its difficult to weigh what is the safety element and what is the trade element but my sense is that both elements are there in the discussions " says zhang hongjun a partner in the law firm of holland &amp knight llp who divides his time between china and the u s "certainly it provides a lot of support to the people who are anti international trade or anti china trade " the growing food safety tension between the u s and china threatens to further complicate an already delicate period in relations between two of the worlds major economies "the risk is a cascade of punitive or blocking steps misinterpretation second guessing and retaliation " donald straszheim of the investment firm roth capital partners wrote in a recent report "this is the last thing we need " the rise in public concern over health and food safety in wealthy north american and european countries also has pushed governments to get tougher but the technical nature of food safety and product standards makes it difficult to ensure that rules are enforced fairly and objectively that is challenging the international trade system to find ways to resolve this particularly thorny type of dispute "there are lots of standards where its impossible to judge whether it is for consumer protection or to create trade barriers " says henry gao a former world trade organization official who teaches at the university of hong kong "governments are sometimes pressured to go beyond what is necessary to protect human animal and plant health and to use this type of restriction to protect domestic industries from foreign competition " says ms blumberg of heller ehrman last year china adopted a zero tolerance policy toward certain pathogens and growth hormones in poultry and pork imports tyson foods and cargill both said chinese authorities hadnt officially notified them of the import suspensions a spokesperson at sanderson farms couldnt be reached for comment yesterday a cargill spokesman said the ban involved pork that tested positive for a growth hormone that is approved for use by the u s but isnt allowed in china some u s companies are seeking chinese approval for use of the hormone ractopamine china is expected to become the u s s largest chicken export market this year surpassing russia and disputes between china and the u s over food safety in the meat industry arent new for years china has been seeking approval from the u s department of agriculture to send raw chicken to the u s and from february to december china banned the importation of all u s poultry products after a strain of low pathogenic avian flu was found in delaware that ban cost the u s poultry industry nearly &# million according to the usda then in china adopted a new standard for the importation of chicken feet and chicken paws a chicken foot thats cut off below the ankle forcing the usda to adopt new inspection methods on the flip side china and other developing nations complain that tough safety standards are being used to keep their products out of rich nations poorer nations often dont have the resources or expertise to cope with shifting technical requirements or to effectively challenge them as trade restraints at meetings of wto committees this year several developing countries said they felt the expanding number of standards is blocking trade argentina for example has asked for a review of new standards on acceptable levels of pesticide residues china has stepped up efforts to make sure exporters are up to date on new standards in their target markets the government has estimated that of all chinese exporters encountered some form of technical trade barrier last year causing them direct losses of some &# billion china exported &# billion of goods last year "traditional trade policies like tariffs and quotas have less and less impact on international trade while the impact of technical trade policies such as standards technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures is becoming increasingly obvious " chinas commerce ministry said last week the wto has a special committee devoted to food safety issues in trade known as "sanitary and phytosanitary measures" where nations can raise concerns about each others policies but many disputes drag on for years out of problems raised at the committee over the past decade a solution has been reported for only according to wto
