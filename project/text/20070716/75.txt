time when debate over iraq is dominating the foreign policy conversation trying to revive the moribund middle east peace process following the split between hamas and fatah the president announced plans to release some &# million in assistance to the government of palestinian president mahmoud abbas and proposed a summit later this year that would include israel the palestinian authority and other arab states western nations have been rushing to bolster mr abbass west bank based government following its bloody break with hamas which now holds power in the gaza strip following battles that forced fatah to flee from the impoverished coastal zone despite its efforts to build up a store of global goodwill by pushing for the release of a kidnapped british journalist hamas has found itself increasingly isolated from the world the european union vowed to reopen the taps to the abbas government soon after the breach and israel announced today that it would free palestinian prisoners of them from fatah but none from hamas later this week by rallying behind fatah outside powers are hoping that they can reach some kind of peace deal between palestinian moderates and the israeli government hamas which is considered a terrorist organization by many nations and which refuses to recognize israels right to exist was never perceived as a viable peace partner by israel or the u s mr bush said that mr abbas and new palestinian prime minister salam fayyad are "striving to build the institutions of a modern democracy " while castigating hamas which he said "has demonstrated beyond all doubt that it is devoted to extremism and murder " he suggested that now is "a moment of clarity for all palestinians and now comes a moment of choice " to be sure the palestinians chose hamas in the parliamentary elections of january sweeping the group to a surprising win that unnerved many in the west but mr bush promised he would continue to take a hard line against the group saying that it must stop gaza from being used by terrorists as a safe haven to launch attacks against israel he commanded that the group recognize the "legitimate palestinian government " allow aid into gaza and dismantle its armed wing "you must reject violence and recognize israels right to exist and commit to all previous agreements between the parties " mr bush said world powers seem to believe that the establishment of the new abbas government creates the good faith negotiating partner that israel never felt it had in previous palestinian administrations diplomatic efforts are gathering more steam with the u s eu united nations and russia the so called quartet of mideast peacemakers scheduled to meet in portugal this week former british prime minister tony blair has been named the groups principal envoy giving the latest campaign to find a settlement an instantly recognizable face and mr bush may be hopeful that brokering peace between the israelis and palestinians
