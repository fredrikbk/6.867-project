americas the case for the colombia fta colombians took to the streets on july in a rebellion against terror the target of their outrage was the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc which five years ago kidnapped democratically elected representatives and earlier this month murdered of them president alvaro uribe headed the protest in bogota under the slogan "freedom without conditions now " in a massive display of civic duty millions of people in all parts of the country turned out to express their opposition to terrorism they were demanding their right to peace and freedom these scenes reminded me of what we experienced in spain years ago when the terrorist group known by its spanish initials as eta kidnapped and murdered miguel angel blanco a young town councilor in the basque country in both cases the murderers sought to blame democratic governments for their crimes colombians and spaniards horrified by the terrorists merciless crimes rose up in protest to defend what is at stake freedom colombia faces immense difficulties and if it and western liberal democracies are to triumph over terrorism we need to pull together this means strengthening both security and economic development if on the other hand the west turns its back it will send a devastating message not only to colombians but to the wider world colombia has been a democracy for many years now there is no doubt that like any human endeavor it is imperfect but colombians have long demonstrated their desire to preserve the freedom it provides and to improve on it this hasnt been easy because the narcoterrorists have used unspeakable brutality against civilians in the hope of destroying their dream in the past groups like the farc enjoyed a spurious international legitimacy based on a false perception that they were fighters for social justice those days are over as a friend of colombia i was honored in my capacity as president of the spanish government for me to ensure that farc was included on the european unions list of terrorist organizations in if there was ever any doubt regarding the farcs true intentions this dissipated entirely in when then president andres pastrana with democratic support was forced to abandon his good faith effort toward establishing a dialogue with the terrorist organization by refusing to come to the table the farc showed its complete lack of scruples and that it is only motivated by an overwhelming thirst for power and a desire to continue its crime based activities since then mr uribe has been elected twice once in and again in precisely because he promised that under the rule of law and democracy he would employ all of the weapons available to the state to defeat terrorism this is also the wish of those who took to the streets of colombia just last week mr uribe also has another anti democratic challenge coming from venezuelan president hugo chavez and his hemispheric project to spread what he calls "st century socialism " mr chavezs ideology despises western values and wherever it has taken root freedom has begun to recede it is a threat to the entire region and it is no coincidence that its proponents are allies of the farc which regards colombian democracy as a foe that must be defeated colombia needs its friends not least because these enemies of freedom are powerful and well equipped cocaine consumption in rich countries is the main source of financing for the farc a fact that makes support for mr uribes efforts both an ethical obligation for western democracies and also in their own interests plan colombia an initiative to combat narcotrafficking begun during the administration of president clinton with support from europe recognizes this obligation president bush continues to support the plan colombia also has to strive to reduce peasant dependency on growing coca crops by fostering economic development integrating colombia into the world economy will boost economic growth and serve to consolidate democratic capitalism this is why it is unbearably cynical for u s politicians to cite the failings of the colombian democracy as an excuse to kill the u s colombia free trade agreement the u s would commit a grave strategic error one that would have dire consequences should it reject the fta with colombia as a former head of government i am perplexed as to how blocking the fta from washington could possibly make sense is it worth lashing out at the colombian people damaging u s security interests and handing a victory to the farc simply to punish mr bush what about the consequences that are bound to accumulate when the u s abandons its best south american friend does the u s wish to push colombia toward the path of st century socialism led by mr chavez if western values are to prevail in latin america against terror and anti democratic authoritarianism europe and the u s must adopt a clear strategy of supporting democratic capitalism this includes policies that strengthen security and encourage trade openness and commercial integration closing the door on colombia either on the security front or on trade will strike at the very heart of the cause for freedom in latin america the moment has come to demonstrate that the friends of freedom colombias friends are both strong and wise mr aznar was prime minister of spain from
