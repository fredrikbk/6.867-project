black and blue the schadenfreude is running thick and fast over conrad blacks conviction friday on four of the counts against him no one seems to like a conservative press baron these days especially no one else in the media but while the offenses are serious what strikes us is how small this business fraud turned out to be the case against lord black and three of his former executives at hollinger international was nothing like the charges in the other recent corporate scandals this was no grand management thievery on the scale of tyco or adelphia and no great accounting fraud a la enron or worldcom the chicago jury dismissed nine of the counts including the sweeping charges of racketeering like so many prosecutors these days in business cases u s attorney patrick fitzgerald threw an exaggerated book at mr black alleging some &# million in systematic looting in the hope that at least one of the charges would stick in the end the jury convicted lord black of stealing a few million dollars in noncompete payments related to the sale of community newspapers his former partner david radler copped a plea and testified that mr black had plotted to pay himself and others rather than the company the noncompetes mr blacks attorneys argued that the buyers had insisted on the payments but the prosecution produced testimony claiming the buyers had not done so this was arguably the key evidence in the case the larger story is that mr black was caught behaving like an imperious ceo after such behavior went out of fashion while he built hollinger into a media empire from scratch he never seemed to grasp how his role changed when he sought public capital and took on fellow owners controlling shareholders with fat paychecks and perks may be forgiven if their stocks perform it was when hollinger stopped performing that shareholders like the investment firm tweedy browne started asking the questions that led to a probe of the noncompete payments which led to mr blacks ouster and now conviction it all strikes us more as a case of hubris than rapacious intent one irony is that mr blacks news sense seemed to fail him when the tide started to run against the imperial ceo earlier this decade when shareholders tried to call him to account starting in he poured scorn on their queries and complaints he stacked hollingers board with figures from the political sphere rather than business experts one more sign that mr black thought of hollinger as a personal vehicle rather than a public company one final note mr black like nearly every other high profile ceo put in the dock in recent years was prosecuted using old fashioned statutes like wire fraud and obstruction of justice so here is yet more evidence that the criminal sanctions of sarbanes oxley were never necessary to rein in corporate crime unless he wins on appeal the year old mr black could serve as much as years in jail anyone who says white collar defendants get off easy these days hasnt been paying attention
