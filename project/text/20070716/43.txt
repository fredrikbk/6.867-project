musharrafs problem and opportunity on july pakistan president gen pervez musharraf surrounded islamic extremists at the red mosque jamia hafsa compound in the capital of islamabad last wednesday government troops raided the compound killing nearly people including taliban al qaeda fighters in response extremists over the past two weeks have sparked anti government protests and carried out a string of bloody attacks yesterday alone some soldiers and policemen were killed extremists have attempted to topple or kill mr musharraf for years is this then the moment they succeed at dislodging mr musharraf from power they apparently think so and are uniting in their efforts the extremists in the tribal areas have renounced the "peace deals" signed with the military last year and have declared war mainstream religious parties which captured of the vote and of the seats in parliament in the last general elections in and which now run two out of four provincial governments have joined with over madrassas controlling over one million angry students across the country these are the people now protesting in pakistans streets and their aim is clear to trigger an urban revolt against the government a post mortem of the red mosque jamia hafsa affair reveals disturbing fissures in pakistani state and society first there is a marked split between pakistanis who say that religious extremism is a curse and the extremists had it coming and those who insist the militants should have been let off in exchange for the safety of the women and children inside the compound more significantly many people think the government may have scripted the drama to divert attention from its various troubles then lost control of the actors and killed them anti musharraf politicians and there are many disgruntled elements at home and in exile are also trying to exploit the situation the net result is mullah outrage and conservative alienation across the country that has hurt the electoral prospects of the pro musharraf pakistan muslim league pml second the popular media print and electronic have sided more with clerical opinion than with the government this is because the sentiments of most journalists are typically anti musharraf anti army and anti america emotional rather than rational positions have become the norm this media bias has exacerbated gen musharrafs difficulties third the bloody conclusion to the lal masjid red mosque affair has only brought the governments simmering political troubles into sharp focus in march mr musharraf ousted the supreme courts chief justice next week the court is expected to issue a ruling on his ouster in this anti government environment any anti musharraf judgment could blow a hole in mr musharrafs plans to be re elected president later this year appoint a pro pml caretaker government and continue to run the country and wear his army uniform for the next five years is all therefore lost there may be a long term silver lining in the red mosque jamia hafsa showdown if the right lessons are drawn by mr musharraf and the military establishment the most significant is that the time has come to disband the military mullah alliance the pet project of pakistans establishment since the s when the afghan jihad was launched the breakup of this alliance should have been a natural consequence of the post cold war world and pakistans place in it after islamabad is now a nuclear power its armed forces have been modernized and replenished its economy is finally on the mend it needs peace in the region especially with india to sustain these developments it has no need for jihadis or radical islamists to promote security on the contrary these radicals have become a large problem for pakistan as demonstrated by their desperate attempts to derail the peace dialogue with india assassinate mr musharraf talibanize the frontier regions provoke american retaliation and enforce their narrow self serving brand of shariah islamic law by vigilante action an equally critical conclusion is that this paradigm shift cannot be accomplished by the establishment simply by allying with the pakistan muslim league party indeed the pml seems to be a drag on mr musharrafs agenda at every turning point its leaders have sought alliances with the mullahs this contradiction between mr musharrafs agenda of "enlightened moderation" and his political partners deep rooted conservatism needs to be resolved a transitional alliance of the military establishment with more progressive and secular elements in the country is the need of the hour a final conclusion is that political and religious extremism cannot be turned back solely by pakistans weak unstructured divided and ill disciplined political parties without the active support of the military such "undiluted" civilian democracy without military backing could be a recipe for anarchy much as military supremacy with a weak civilian consensus is leading to political gridlock instead an enlightened and moderate political military alliance is required to stem religious radicalism in the same way that a conservative and immoderate political military alliance was cobbled together to start islamization in the s is mr musharraf up to this challenge the first step is to reform the madrassas last week mr musharraf pledged to crush seminaries like the jamia hafsa that are spreading militancy and terrorism but he also reiterated that not all madrassas are seats of defiance and revolt against the state this is a mistake a madrassa is not a place where children are readied for the job market studies of madrassa students reveal them to have reactionary views especially on such subjects as non muslims the "infidel west" and women compared to students at mainstream vernacular or english medium schools geared to the job market the extremism of the daily sermons issued from the mosques reflects the worldview imbibed in the "regular" madrassas that are linked to them the pakistani state in the last years has empowered madrassas to a point where they can now set their own agendas and challenge the state itself in interviews with the media female students of jamia hafsa clearly echoed the clerical view justifying vigilante action "because the state isnt ending activities banned in islam " that is why it is ironic that after mr musharraf publicly thanked the federal madrassah board in a recent speech the board struck back by announcing a campaign against him their campaign is sure to be exploited by the religious parties to defend the madrassa system as their source of street power under mr musharraf the madrassas in pakistan have doubled in number now the madrassas are actually hitting back but so far mr musharraf has been unable to fashion a proper strategy to negate their pernicious influence the second step is to form a larger national consensus against the mosques and madrassas that would enable mr musharraf to ward off the islamic threat this consensus hasnt materialized so far because he is not ready to hold free elections and share power with ex prime minister benazir bhutto she is the only secular politician with a mass base to condemn the islamic extremists and support policies to stamp them out as mr musharrafs problems mount and he dithers over whether to impose martial law or usher in greater democracy the fate of pakistan hangs on his willingness to form new alliances against the islamists that threaten his rule mr sethi is editor of the friday times and daily times in lahore
