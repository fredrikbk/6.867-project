telefonica insists major deals are out spanish firm aims at internal growth amid big debt pile madrid spains telefonica sa spent more than billion euros &# billion during the past decade to build a sprawling empire with operations in countries this year in an effort to shed its label as a serial buyer it vowed not to make any major acquisitions a self imposed moratorium that expires at the end of the year and has some investors nervous now telefonicas finance chief says the company has really sworn off big deals and will push for internal growth an important turn for investors still skittish about its massive billion euros debt pile "we have exhausted the debt driven growth model " says chief financial officer santiago fernandez "the time has come to change focus and sweat our assets " telefonicas effort to rev up growth within an empire that stretches from chile to the czech republic marks a big test for the future of europes national telecom giants the spanish phone cellular and data provider has put itself at the vanguard of its industry by consistently finding growth and broadening its reach beyond home by contrast peers like france telecom sa and deutsche telekom ag have faced bottom line pressure and struggled to find new sources of revenue telefonica boasts some of the fattest profit margins in the industry and its market capitalization of about billion euros puts it behind only britains vodafone group plc among europes telecom providers but telefonica faces the same troubling industry trends as its peers the traditional fixed line phone business has come under attack from lower cost alternatives like internet calling competition in the broadband internet market is fierce cutthroat competition in mobile phones has shrunk profit margins in most markets telefonicas plans to wring out growth organically mean it is going to have to find creative ways to both cut costs and find new revenue mr fernandez insists that the buying binge has given telefonica needed scale its bigger size he says makes companywide efficiencies like equipment purchasing easier to implement he says the companys ambitious goals doubling its per share profit by can be achieved through organic growth alone concerns about debt and future dealmaking have weighed on telefonicas share price which fetches a lower price earnings ratio than some competitors in madrid friday it finished at euros roughly flat since february managements vow to swear off big deals runs counter to many analyst predictions that the european telecom sector much more fragmented than in the u s would undergo further consolidation in the near future "its key that they stick to that strategy of debt reduction and dont buy anything else very sizable " says erwin van lumich a telecom analyst with fitch ratings in barcelona telefonica used to have single a rated debt from fitch and other credit rating concerns but it has now established its high triple b rating as its floor telefonica still has smaller deals pending as well as access to an additional billion euros following asset sales last year the company is concluding the billion euros acquisition of an indirect stake in telecom italia with which telefonica is building an industrial alliance telefonica still has its sights set on the it doesnt own in vivo a joint venture with portugal telecom sa operating mobile phone businesses in brazil despite pts reluctance to sell the company also plans to double its stake in china netcom to and it doesnt rule out sporadic smaller deals to bolster its position in latin america or in countries where its market share is lagging telefonica expects to increase total revenue for by to from the billion euros reported last year the highest forecast growth rate among its rivals more ambitious is telefonicas forecast of a to increase in operating profit above last years billion euros analysts say telefonicas goals are realistic provided the company continues the turnarounds it has started in big markets such as brazil and mexico that have underperformed lately the company also faces challenges in the u k and germany operating margins fell almost four percentage points in the first quarter at its o mobile phone unit in the u k as it spent money to keep customers and coax them into spending more time on the phone in germany telefonicas weak market share and tough competition have hamstrung efforts to drive revenue that has led to increased speculation that telefonica may yet bid for kpn nvs e plus mobile arm in germany to gain size telefonica officials say neither kpn nor its units are acquisition targets in recent weeks telefonica management has sought to reassure investors that it will be able to turn around the operations in the u k telefonica says it will scale back commercial activities in the rest of the year in germany it has launched an array of bundled internet and mobile phone packages to drive revenue growth in brazil where telefonicas joint venture has lost market share as it rolled out a new kind of mobile network the company is counterattacking by focusing on high value business customers and introducing pricing plans to increase profits per customer in the first quarter telefonica got users to spend more time and more money on their mobile phones in mexico where telefonica faces rival carlos slim and his america movil operation telefonica seems to be enjoying success after it overhauled its retail offerings during the past two quarters it added about million net customers more than in the past two years combined customer defection has been cut almost in half while mexican users spend almost twice as long each month on the phone compared with a year ago latin america will be especially important to its efforts the massive investment telefonica made there in the s catapulted it from a former state monopoly to a highly profitable multinational company but the volatile region also acted for years as an albatross on the companys shares because so much of telefonicas sales and profits came from countries wracked by periodic economic and political strife the weakness of the dollar including latin american dollar linked currencies against the euro also tarnished latin americas contribution and remains a concern for some analysts but the most favorable macroeconomic climate there in two decades is directly benefiting telefonica its latin american unit accounted for of the groups first quarter growth by adding customers revenue and profit at a double digit clip in the first quarter "we are one of the few companies in the sector and the only one our size that is actually growing " mr fernandez says
