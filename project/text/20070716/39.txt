key bancroft aims for a long shot second family member scrambles to stop sale of dow jones to news corp as news corp pursues its bid for dow jones &amp co a key member of the controlling bancroft family christopher bancroft has launched his own last ditch long shot crusade to block the deal according to people familiar with the matter they say he has spent recent weeks approaching hedge funds private equity firms and others in a quest to buy enough voting shares of dow jones to give him the power to torpedo a sale rupert murdoch chairman and chief executive of news corp has made a &# billion offer to buy dow jones publisher of the wall street journal as a key member of the family that controls of the companys voting power mr bancroft and his two siblings his niece elisabeth goth chelberg and their children are beneficiaries of trusts that control about a third of the bancrofts stake in dow jones his idea is to buy more "super voting" shares from other bancroft heirs who may be ready to sell their stakes but share his distaste for delivering the family legacy into the hands of mr murdoch those super voting rights give family members votes for every one share compared with one vote for common shareholders the shares lose their super voting status once sold unless they are transferred to other family members mr bancroft would need to get of the total votes of the company to block a deal which would cost him hundreds of millions of dollars considering the &# per share payments for other family members he can already vote his current stake against the deal and shareholder james ottaway also opposes it one wrinkle in this scenario holders of common shares probably wouldnt get bought out an unpleasant prospect for the arbitragers and others who own these shares and are expecting &# or more mr bancroft years old and one of three family members on the dow jones board has been working with advisers including the law firm latham &amp watkins llp to structure a deal two people familiar with his actions said they doubted they would amount to much given both the financial and legal complications of his plan bruce leadbetter a partner with mr bancroft in dallas private equity firm beta capital group said friday the group has been trying to help mr bancroft raise the funds he needs to obtain a blocking share but he characterized the effort as "a real long shot " mr leadbetter said the time frame for trying to raise the money and make an offer matching news corp s &# bid was a matter of days due diligence between news corp and dow jones is winding down and people close to both sides say the process is "basically finished " a substantive discussion of price hasnt happened however that could change today when mr murdoch and dow jones chief executive richard f zannino sit down for lunch to discuss price and other terms these people say mr zannino who is expected to be accompanied by two of dow joness board members is likely to try to use the familys reluctance to do a deal as a negotiating lever with news corp according to people close to dow jones mr murdoch hasnt shown any interest in raising his bid because any agreement between the companies would have to pass muster with the family rebellions by family directors such as mr bancroft carry some weight mr bancroft hasnt been the only family member attempting to play a spoiler role in the news corp bid his cousin leslie hill another dow jones director has been exploring options for an alternative to mr murdoch while she initially differed with mr bancrofts rigid opposition to a deal she later changed her mind recently swinging to a more middle of the road view that while a sale might be necessary to secure dow joness financial future accepting mr murdochs offer should be a last resort ms hills resistance to a deal with mr murdoch helped win an audience with the dow jones board for supermarket magnate ron burkle and internet entrepreneur brad greenspan who have been working together to fund a partial buyout of the company earlier general electric co and pearson plc abandoned an effort to bid for dow jones because the price was too high while both bancroft heirs seem to share a similar mission finding an alternative to news corp ms hill and mr bancroft arent aligned in their current efforts tensions among members of the far flung family have surfaced during the stress of the past few months and ms hill has been a vocal critic of mr bancroft at times complaining about his punctuality and lack of attendance at some family meetings some other family members have been dismissive of ms hills and mr bancrofts campaigns people close to dow jones and the companys board dont give mr bancrofts attempt much of a chance as his effort continues the company has looked for ways to make him feel better about a news corp deal mr bancroft requested a further bolstering of an agreement to ensure editorial independence agreed upon by news corp and dow jones and the companies have complied according to people familiar with the matter mr bancroft was initially seen by some news corp advisers as a possible swing vote in favor of a sale these people were disappointed when mr bancroft made public comments opposing an offer in late may even if mr bancrofts attempt to amass shares fails his actions indicate he may remain resolute in his opposition to a sale to news corp a view that could cause conflict in the familys deliberations should the board present it with an offer mr bancroft has a particularly strong attachment to the newspaper he has expressed to others his belief the familys responsibility as stewards of dow jones should trump any monetary gain the family could reap from mr murdochs rich offer he has met with dow jones employees who have opposed the deal in his only public comment about the deal he said selling to mr murdoch would endanger the wall street journals independence and journalistic integrity "why would i risk that " he said but mr bancrofts moves could expose him to pressure from dow joness board and outside shareholders blocking a deal would harm the companys share price without an alternative transaction to offer it would also run counter to the familys stated belief that "the mission of dow jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization which may include news corp " in addition to the wall street journal and its international and online editions dow jones publishes barrons and smartmoney magazines and other periodicals
