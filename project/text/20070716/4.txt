anti immigration activists roil the heartland an elderly womans appointment to a local parks board doesnt normally generate controversy but in kansas city mo frances semlers new position on the citys parks and recreation board has unexpectedly fanned the flames of the debate over illegal immigration the year old mrs semler is an activist in the minuteman civil defense corps a controversial volunteer civilian patrol formed two years ago to secure u s borders and crack down on illegal immigrants while president bush has denounced the minutemen as "vigilantes " and human rights organizations express concern that a group they consider extremist and bent on taking the law into its own hands is winning over ordinary americans the group itself is legal and growing and as the stir over mrs semlers appointment shows the minutemens influence has spread deep into middle america far from the u s mexico borders where the anti illegal immigrant group originated the controversy began on june when new kansas citys new mayor mark funkhouser announced he was replacing a parks and recreation board that he said was rooted in a "culture of elitism and community divisiveness" with new commissioners representing a "wealth of experience perspective and diversity " mrs semler was one of five new commissioners the next day her connection to the local minutemen chapter was made public by the daily kansas city star the citys national association for the advancement of colored people the coalition of hispanic organizations the southern christian leadership conference and the jewish community relations bureau held a news conference on june to condemn the appointment later that day the city council voting to adopted a resolution calling for mrs semlers removal from the parks board hispanic leaders who say they rallied their community to back the mayor he won a narrow victory over his african american opponent now say they feel betrayed by mrs semlers appointment "this is a slap in our face " said cris medina a local latino leader who is also a third generation mexican american he said the appointment generates concerns about racial profiling and discomfort among low income immigrants for whom parks provide free diversion "this is about racism and divisiveness everything we are not supposed to be about " said council member beth gottstein who voted for mrs semlers removal mrs semler a former president of the county rose society said in an interview that she had joined the anti illegal immigrant group late last year because "i believe very strongly in obeying the law " she denies being a racist the mayor says he didnt know of mrs semlers affiliation with the minutemen but doesnt believe it will interfere with her performance "as long as her personal behavior is good i dont see why i should remove her " mr funkhouser said in an interview the mayor said he chose mrs semler because she is "smart creative and caring she is not a racist " he noted that he had appointed a hispanic as president of the board and two black men to be commissioners "diversity is also about diversity of views " he says the expansion of the minutemen into americas heartland coincides with mounting frustration at the federal governments failure to adopt a national immigration policy as well as a new wave of hispanic immigrants into the interior of the u s the center for new community a chicago based organization that tracks nationalist and neo nativist groups has counted minutemen branches in states across the country these chapters appear to be thriving despite the fact that the founders of two regional minuteman factions chris simcox of the minuteman civil defense corps based in arizona and jim gilchrist of the minuteman project in california have been plagued by scandals over their handling of funds and management style "the border is no longer in the desert its all over america " says ed hayes chief of the "heart of america" minuteman civil defense corps chapter in kansas city illegal immigration is as an "invasion of people that are not examined for diseases " he said immigrant rights groups say the demeaning discourse of the minutemen helps promote immigrant bashing and attacks on hispanic day laborers mr simcox president of the minuteman civil defense corps says that the groups priorities are border security and enforcement of immigration law "if you are here illegally you should be deported " he says "we certainly dont tolerate racism in our group " at the border the activists who are usually armed report people they suspect of trying to sneak into the u s to the border patrol mr simcox credits "the serious breakdown in our government" with the spread of minutemen to the interior of the u s "we were just a border watch operation " he says but "we had so many requests from people saying they wanted to start a chapter " many minutemen including mr hayes espouse a "reconquista" theory that holds that mexicans want to take over u s territory when asked about this mr simcox said "it is not a major concern" of the group a retired police captain in the kansas city area mr hayes says he paid &# to join the minuteman civil defense corps in may last year a month later he was invited to become chapter director he says in september people attended a minuteman meeting at a hotel in the kansas city area among others speakers protested the "ethnic metamorphosis in america" and claimed "alien cultures" wanted to dominate the u s according to leonard zeskind director of the kansas city based institute for research and education on human rights who cites the meeting in a recent report that he prepared about rising bigotry in missouri and neighboring kansas since launching the missouri group in kansas city mr hayes says that he has helped form chapters in other towns so far minutemen activity has consisted of picketing construction sites where illegal immigrants are believed to be at work including filming he says "we make a lot of people nervous and they leave the job " he says recently about people including members and supporters gathered for an anti illegal immigrant rally near the kansas state capital topeka mr zeskind and other critics say that mrs semler the citys new park board member was involved in organizing the late june rally mrs semler who didnt attend the
