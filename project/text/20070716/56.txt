political woes dog republicans across the south infighting and scandals could undermine party in longtime stronghold columbia s c the republican led south carolina legislature was in the final throes of a bitter session last month when word of criminal charges against a high ranking state official swept through both chambers a federal grand jury had just handed up an indictment against treasurer thomas ravenel scion of one of the states leading political families for allegedly distributing cocaine mr ravenel who had recently defeated a democratic incumbent who held the office for years was the statewide chairman for former new york city mayor rudy giulianis presidential campaign in what has historically been a decisive early primary state the indictment is just one of the political headaches across the south that are making republicans look more vulnerable than they have in years to losing ground in the regions legislatures and statehouses though there isnt any sign of them losing their dominance in the region the once formidable "solid south" coalitions they forged in the s and s to end a century of democratic dominion have given way to messy schisms and infighting today they look a lot like the bitterly divided democrats of three decades ago most of those divisions stem from internal rivalries that have developed as the party consolidated power in the region where they control half of the legislative chambers some of the tensions can be ascribed to dueling priorities between legislatures and governors others have been caused or exacerbated by personal scandals like the one involving mr ravenel who has pleaded not guilty to the cocaine charges but hasnt made any public statement about them last week sen david vitter of louisiana admitted what he called a "serious sin" in his past after his name surfaced on the list of callers to a washington d c madam mr vitter the southern campaign chairman for mr giuliani couldnt be reached for comment mr giuliani called the situation a personal matter and said mr vitter would continue to represent his campaign georgia gov sonny perdue recently vetoed a property tax rebate and much of the budget crafted by republican house and senate leaders and killed pet projects in house leaders districts house leaders said the vetoes seemed personally motivated the republican governor has said there should be no lasting hard feelings "you can get from point a to b and disagree on what roads to take but we all want to get to the same place " said bert brantley mr perdues spokesman in mississippi gov haley barbour has clashed with his fellow republican lieutenant governor and party legislators over a push to swap an increase in the cigarette tax for a cut in the states comparatively high sales tax on food gov barbour opposed the idea out of concern about changing the tax structure as the state continued to recover from hurricane katrina there have been indictments and scandals involving democrats in the south in recent years too the former speaker of the north carolina house was sentenced last week on bribery charges but the series of missteps involving republicans has coincided with other signs of trouble for the party after two decades of increasing influence in the region and could create opportunities for democrats last year democrats picked up a total of seats in southern legislative races their first net gain since according to the national conference of state legislatures in kentucky a recent poll of registered voters by insideradvantage showed half of independent voters and nearly a third of women voters were undecided about the governors race an ominous sign for republican incumbent gov ernie fletcher who got a big boost from independents the first time around mr fletcher fended off two republican challengers in a may primary in which the dominant issue was his indictment in an investigation into whether he improperly rewarded supporters with state jobs the indictment was dropped last year in a deal with prosecutors "the governor acknowledged that some mistakes were made in his administration but it didnt rise to the level of criminal activity " said marty ryall mr fletchers campaign manager despite their control of nearly every elected statewide position and huge majorities in both houses of the legislature south carolina republicans have been unable to deliver on significant campaign promises including a program that would give state residents vouchers to help pay for private schools in may a split among republican blocs allowed a coalition of democrats and some republicans to engineer the selection of a democrat for a rare opening on the state supreme court the partys once tight control of state spending has weakened the states current &# billion budget now includes a &# million grant fund for pet projects such as festivals celebrating pork and catfish in various legislative districts last month senate leaders angered by what they saw as an attempt to blame them for a budgetary logjam crashed a news conference held by gov mark sanford and house leaders in a bid to tell their side of the story the squabbling has been made worse by scandals involving alleged personal misconduct last months indictment in u s district court in columbia of the year old mr ravenel a colorful charleston developer known as t rav by friends on his myspace page followed by days a no contest plea by a republican state representative to charges of making threats against his estranged wifes boyfriend last year the states republican former agriculture commissioner was sentenced to federal prison on extortion charges related to a cockfighting ring the states year old lieutenant governor andre bauer another rising republican star who was close to mr ravenel was pulled over twice for speeding but wasnt ticketed even though he was clocked on one occasion last year at miles an hour the legislature just appropriated &# a year so mr bauer could have a driver and security detail mr bauers chief of staff said the lieutenant governor regrets the speeding incidents but that they werent related to his getting a driver and security detail the day after mr ravenels indictment state republican party chairman katon dawson issued a public scolding warning members of his party that personal misconduct and legislative double dealing were a threat to the party he reiterated his plea in an op ed article published july in the columbia state newspaper saying he was getting constant calls and emails indicating an unprecedented "sustained unhappiness" with republicans unless officeholders straightened up he said "grass roots activists will not just revolt with their votes theyll revolt with their apathy and that would cripple this country " south carolina house majority leader james h merrill says his charleston constituents frequently ask why he cant get republicans "to act like republicans " "youre going to end up alienating voters " rep merrill said "you saw a little bit of it in washington thats why every years the pendulum swings the other way " mr giuliani who already faces skepticism from christian conservatives because he has been married three times and because of his moderate stance on abortion and gay rights expressed shock at the ravenel charges and named a new state chairman for his campaign however mr ravenels father former u s rep arthur ravenel jr remains a regional campaign chairman and one of mr giulianis most visible supporters in the state democrats already have seized on the elder mr ravenels longstanding support of flying the confederate flag at the south carolina state capitol and on references he made in to the national association for the advancement of colored people mr ravenel referred to the naacp as the "national association for retarded people " mr ravenel said yesterday he wasnt sorry about his remarks but didnt mean to give offense to the retarded he has previously said that he mistakenly transposed the name of the civil rights organization with an advocacy group for the mentally disabled with which he worked in the past the elder mr ravenel has another son with down syndrome elliott bundy a spokesman for mr giuliani declined this week to comment on demands by democrats that mr giuliani condemn mr ravenels previous remarks according to his attorney the younger mr ravenel has embarked on a day treatment program at an arizona facility gov sanford has suspended him temporarily under south carolina law he would automatically lose his office if convicted the republican turmoil has raised some democratic hopes that parts of the south may no longer be as lockstep in support of the republican party but donald l fowler a former chairman of the democratic national committee and the husband of carol khare fowler south carolinas democratic party chairwoman cautions that republican fatigue doesnt yet necessarily portend broad democratic comebacks particularly in south carolina he says it would require a major demographic shift such as an influx of people from other parts of the country and a major economic change such as a depression to change the landscape "at least where we are now democrats dont have the wherewithal to take advantage of the split in the republican party " mr fowler said corrections &amp amplifications ernie fletcher is the governor of kentucky a graphic that accompanied a page one article yesterday about political problems in the south for the republican party incorrectly gave his first name as eddie wsj
