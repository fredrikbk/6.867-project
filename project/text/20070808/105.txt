rubber ducky frenzy as if we didnt have enough real problems to worry about an international media frenzy has erupted over a flotilla of "yellow rubber duckies" from the pacific ocean the ducks are supposedly about to storm the beaches of the british isles years after they spilled off a container ship miles away reporters from scotland england germany several other eu countries canada brazil australia new zealand japan and the u s have been emailing me urgent questions about the ducks have they been sighted in britain yet when will they land and where i have been tracking these wayward bathtub toys for years with the help of an international network of dedicated beachcombers we have collected data on these floaters where they beach and when in order to better understand the oceans currents where they flow how fast they flow and how and when they interconnect based on thousands of data points im sorry to say i cant give the media scribes the story they want and im sorry to have to give the good people of britain and ireland the disappointing news there is no yellow rubber ducky flotilla approaching your shores first of all lets get the facts straight the celebrated bathtub toys that fell into the pacific in january arent made of rubber theyre plastic and they arent all ducks they came in four shapes green frogs true blue turtles red beavers and yellow crouching ducks the latter two have by now been bleached white perhaps a hundred of them have made it to the north atlantic and are now scattered across its vast expanse we know they can travel that far in one duck washed up on the maine coast and a green frog was found on the coast of scotland their year journey began in the central pacific about where the international date line crosses the th parallel they proceeded eastward to southeast alaska where beachcombers recovered thousands of their fellows from there the two toys drifted north to the bering sea across the north pole south along eastern greenland and further south to newfoundland where their paths diverged one to maine and the other to britain to complete these journeys they had to ride four circular oceanic currents called "gyres" or "carousels of the seas " to understand these gyres we have also tracked nike shoes lost in another north pacific cargo spill each one bearing a code for the container from which it spilled spilled hockey gloves five million lego pieces lost off englands lands end and japanese survey stakes that typhoons have washed out into the pacific not to mention fishing boats aircraft parts bowling balls lobster pot tags toy tops piggy banks and myriad other objects likewise lost at sea and of course messages in bottles every item that makes it to shore has a story to tell and data to impart by roaming the worlds beaches and seeing what washes up we have also learned that there is far too much man made stuff floating on the seas especially stuff made out of plastic now found in eight vast oceanic garbage patches most of it does not biodegrade it just breaks down into ever smaller pieces to the size of confetti and finally dust fish birds and other marine animals eat this pseudo plankton and pass it up the food chain our world wide litter is poisoning the seas the creatures within them and ultimately ourselves furthermore we are only now discovering how susceptible these currents are to changing airflows rising ocean temperatures and growing river inputs as the world warms and glaciers melt i hope the intense and widespread interest in the tub toys journeys will yield greater concern for our oceans these humble toys have piqued curiosity and stimulated imaginations around the world but they can also yield important scientific data if you spot one of the bath tub toys please take a picture look for the words "the first years" imprinted on each toy see photos at www beachcombers org and send a note to curtisebbesmeyer comcast net you might also consider joining the beachcombers who patrol and clean our shorelines you can help us better understand and protect our magical but fragile oceans and their powerful circulating currents mr ebbesmeyer is co author with eric scigliano of "the floating world " forthcoming from smithsonian books see related letter "letters to the editor marine debris takes a grim toll on wildlife" wsj sept
