euro fatigue takes hold among new eu members london the early reform drive that led to european union membership for poland hungary the baltic states and the czech and slovak republics is in danger of running out of steam the prospect of becoming members of the european union inspired a frenzy of overhauls in the s and earlier this decade that transformed economies in central and eastern europe creating one of europes great success stories of the past decade but the separate issue of membership in the euro zone has failed to generate the same level of popular enthusiasm so for the first time since the anti communist revolutions in a number of countries in central and eastern europe are without a compelling medium term goal that attracts the support of a majority of voters joining the euro zone "is an uninspiring goal in itself " said erik berglof chief economist of the european bank for reconstruction and development "the fact that it is becoming more distant makes it less relevant for policy makers europe needs to come up with something that will really engage people in these countries " with the public in the new eu states largely apathetic about the prospect of having interest rates set by the european central bank and using the same currency as germany governments have set later and later targets for joining the currency area the czech republic hungary and poland have abandoned their original entry dates for adopting the euro and they no longer have an official target date none has joined the european exchange rate mechanism the antechamber to the euro zone slovakia stands out as an exception keeping up its reform momentum and still on track to adopt the euro in "growing skepticism about benefits from euro adoption and reform fatigue contributed to a weakening of political support for euro adoption " the international monetary fund said in a report released last week according to a survey conducted on behalf of the eu in march and published in may only of voters in the countries that have joined the bloc since believe adoption of the euro would be a positive development only thought adopting the euro would have very positive consequences "the question of euro accession is definitely on the back burner in hungary poland and the czech republic " said raffaela tenconi an economist at dresdner kleinwort in london polish central bank president slawomir skrzypek is an advocate of the go slow approach in a recent interview with a local business daily he said the earliest possible date for adopting the euro was or and announced that he would set up a special office and a team within the bank to analyze costs and benefits of joining the euro zone "i would like for a complete report treating this issue to arise in poland and to try and look at all aspects of this issue and to try to reconcile as much as possible the opposed sides " mr skrzypek told the business daily "i think in order to achieve that the bank at this stage should avoid becoming engaged on any side of the argument " but poland may not be the most euro skeptical of the regions larger economies "in my view the lack of desire in the euro adoption is more visible in the czech republic than in other countries in the region such as poland or hungary " said petr zahradnik the head and chief economist of retail bank ceska sporitelnas eu office but without a unifying and inspiring goal mr berglof fears that overhauls will stall and that domestic politics may become more backward looking thats already happened in poland the regions largest country where the question of what people did to their neighbors during the communist regime has become the dominant issue this year polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and president lech kaczynski identical twins who were involved in solidaritys efforts to overthrow the communist government in the s are attempting to purge from public life all those people who collaborated with the hated secret police of the communist era eighteen years after polands first free elections the twins sought to introduce a law which was struck down by the constitutional tribunal requiring many people with a public role including teachers company owners and journalists to declare whether they cooperated with the secret police to keep their jobs "there is a backward looking policy environment where people are looking at past injustices looking in the archives and not much that attracts them to europe " mr berglof said most of the new member states continue to record high levels of economic growth boosted in part by strong inflows of foreign investment since the organization for economic cooperation and development expects the polish economy to grow by this year and next and expects the czech economy to grow by this year and next even hungary where an austerity program designed to bring a ballooning budget deficit under control has hit growth is expected to see its gross domestic product expand by this year and next but that strong performance may simply disguise some weaknesses for example in education systems the european bank for reconstruction and development warns in the czech republic and the slovak republic fewer than of people aged to have a university or third level education in hungary the proportion is less than while in poland it stands at around in korea by contrast of to year olds have had a third level education while in the u s the proportion is and in ireland whose economic surge over the past years the new eu members want to emulate the proportion is also edith balazs in
