the evening wrap irans role online edition irans influence in iraq took center stage amid both an iraqi diplomatic push and a u s military raid aimed at shiite militias allegedly linked to the islamic republic iraqs prime minister nouri al maliki met with iranian officials wednesday in tehran to discuss tamping down violence in his war torn country his visit came as u s troops and aircraft attacked shiite militiamen in baghdad whom the u s accuses of smuggling deadly armor piercing roadside explosives from iran the u s said it killed suspected militants and took captive in the raid in baghdads shiite stronghold of sadr city the military action followed a stepped up series of up assertions that iranian linked weapons have been playing a key role in deadly attacks against u s troops on sunday the u s militarys second in command in iraq lt gen raymond odierno said iranian armed shiite militants were to blame for nearly three quarters of attacks that killed or wounded american troops in baghdad last month iraqi officials declined to say if mr maliki who is on his second trip to tehran in the past year would directly touch upon on u s accusations during his talks with iranian leaders in fact iraqi officials declined to say much of anything about the visit a spokesman for the iraqi government said the visit aimed to boost agreements to make iran "a positive base" in support of iraq mr malikis visit and the u s raid both underscore the influence iran has over events in iraq and many perhaps most notably the bipartisan baker hamilton iraq study group have proposed that the u s try to harness that influence by engaging iran diplomatically but such a diplomatic push is easier to suggest than it is to pull off in recent months officials from the bush administration have met twice with iranian representatives in the first such discussions held with iran in years as such they represented a shift for u s policy but so far they produced little the last meeting in late july involved ryan crocker the u s ambassador to iraq and his iranian counterpart ambassador hassan kazemi qomi it resulted in what mr crocker called "several heated exchanges " over u s accusations iran was boosting aid to groups attacking iraqis and u s servicemen still as a result of the talks the u s iran and iraq agreed "in principle" to set up another group to meet and discuss security issues at a lower level achieving more significant progress with iran would be a daunting proposition especially in light of the range of tensions between the two countries which include irans nuclear ambitions as well as its support for support for hamas and hezbollah still common ground between iran and the u s might be found according to a recent report from the carnegie endowment for international peace a washington think tank as "iran arguably has more common interests with the united states in iraq than any of iraqs other neighbors " still in its conclusion the report noted any progress on the diplomatic efforts between the u s and iran would be "operating in the backdrop of years of mistrust and opposition from hardliners in both capitals means its going to be a drawn out affair that will undoubtedly cause a great deal of mutual frustration and test each sides patience " in the meantime iraqs violence continues with the u s military saying wednesday that a roadside bombing in western baghdad tuesday killed one u s soldier and wounded four others so far this month at least u s soldiers have been killed stocks rise as risk worries fade stocks rose as the nasdaq composites jump
