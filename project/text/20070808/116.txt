taking stock of a festival jacobs pillow th anniversary season various venues through august becket mass the rolling berskhire hills that surround the year old dance complex known as jacobs pillow with numerous peaks and valleys arent the only ups and downs connected with the area the pillows long running festival has a bumpy history all its own initially set up as a farm in and eventually a stop on the th century "underground railroad" that helped escaped slaves reach canada jacobs pillow got its dance connection when it was bought by dancer teacher and choreographer ted shawn in the then year old had just separated from his famous wife and longtime artistic partner ruth st denis the interpretive dancer eventually known as the "mother of modern dance " together the couple had led denishawn to world fame as a showcase for concert dancing in many varieties now minus st denis shawn turned the farm into a place for dance through the end of the s the works presented within this rustic locale were shawns own specifically created to promote stage dancing as a serious and legitimate pursuit for american men in his all male troupe ted shawn and his men dancers inaugurated a series of public performances initially arranged as "tea lecture demonstrations " as the decade came to a close complications connected with world war ii led to the disbanding of shawns select troupe temporary leasing of the facilities came in and led to the establishment of a berkshire hills dance festival now seen as artistically if not financially successful ballet tenants followed linked in part to the then fledgling ballet theatre later known as american ballet theatre with an international dance festival offering a variety of dance disciplines at the instigation of local enthusiasts shawn was coaxed back into a directorship which led directly to the now annual jacobs pillow dance festival which concludes this year on aug between the relaunch of the pillows very own activities including a school as well as theatrical presentations and this years diamond jubilee further struggles ensued some were dramatic occurring just as the pillow began building its enlarged and less rough hewn theater building and wartime conditions hit with gas rationing and a dearth of male personnel others were as inevitable as leadership succession woes particularly in the wake of shawns death in following what norton owen todays director of preservation calls "crisis and renewal " in "a certain place " his overview of the pillows past the leadership passed to todays executive director ella baff the nearly two dozen activities slated for this anniversary season began in june with "nina ananiashvili and the state ballet of georgia " inaugurating the troupes first u s performances though shawn himself is connected in the minds of many dance watchers with modern dance the pillows festival offerings have regularly included ballet presentations like all such efforts within the somewhat limited confines of the pillows ted shawn theater this georgian performance remained chamber sized showing the ensemble in a carefully chosen repertory with the world famous bolshoi ballet connected ms ananiashvili at its head the group could have become a background showcase for her stellar presence the pillow program however proceeded artfully with two varied works showcasing the groups unfamiliar dancers before the troupes big name director appeared in a festive concluding suite from "don quixote" arranged to spotlight ms ananiashvili george balanchines "mozartiana " his reverie on tchaikovskys take on mozarts music opened the bill with elegance and warmth if not necessarily the lightness and ease associated with balanchinean dancing at its truest buoying this alternately playful and ethereal balanchine work as well as the sunny tone of trey mcintyres celebratory "second before the ground" was the notable and impressive presence of the georgian male dancers these handsome and elegant men made up in personable self confidence what they might lack in finesse another attempt to promote the cause of male dancing today came with the late july appearances of "bad boys of dance " led by the american born and trained rasta thomas the two part program was given in the pillows smaller doris duke studio theater where sightlines are less than ideal mr thomass all male core group included four dancers counting himself with the addition of two guest artists twin brothers from argentina with hip hop and tap dancing interests the year old mr thomas has a string of national and international appearances with top ballet companies to his credit here on his own spouting youthful rhetoric about bringing dance to larger and broader audiences he looked naive at best the part sampler of often puerile exercises showed mr thomas and his youthful fellow dancers grinning like mad and romping through athletic vignettes that went from the glib to the tired "finding oz " choreographed by adrienne canterna mr thomass wife a chopin accompanied number involving the four "boys" with a single red rose a mirror and book as props was remarkably cliche ridden for so brief an effort the boys will be boys self consciousness threading through the presentation wore thin almost immediately and proved that boys who dont have notable artistic direction or originality will be bad in a literal rather than street speak sense in no time at all shawn once described his programming for the pillow as including "ballet modern ethnic and what have you dancers " the "bad boys " for all their specifically disciplined backgrounds were reduced in mr thomass scheme to "what have you" dancers of the least remarkable order flashes of depth peeked through this two hour studio display particularly in mr thomass own signs of real charisma and prowess but they were too few and too little shawns mission of making the pillow a showcase for dancing of many stripes while putting male dancers on an equal footing with their female counterparts has been largely successful given the pillows long history with many hands and minds since shawns working through problem areas occasional failures like "bad boys" are probably inevitable if mr thomass "boys" stay around the pillow more they might learn from their missteps and grow up to become worthy heirs of shawns "men dancers " mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
