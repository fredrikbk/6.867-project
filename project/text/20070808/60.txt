how inventory swings affect drug sales pfizer inc s report last month of a sharp drop in sales of its lipitor cholesterol drug pointed to an old industry practice that some thought had gone away speculative buying by wholesale distributors though diminished the practice persists which means investors should continue to expect occasional swings in quarterly sales of big pharmas wares that are out of sync with underlying prescription demand speculative buying occurs when a wholesale distribution company such as cardinal health inc stocks up on a drug in anticipation of a price increase by the manufacturer then sells it to retail pharmacies at the higher price locking in profits in recent years cardinal and its main rivals mckesson corp and amerisourcebergen inc have shifted away from speculative buying to a "fee for service" model in which they keep drug inventory levels within specified bands and provide other services in exchange for fees from the manufacturers the new model is designed to reduce inventory levels and to make earnings more predictable for wholesalers also the deals are meant to tighten the correlation between prescription demand and recorded product sales for manufacturers "you find in general theres a closer connection between prescription demand pharmacy demand and wholesaler demand " said adam fein president of pembroke consulting a philadelphia management consulting firm that advises drug makers on their distribution channels "theres fewer fluctuations and variations " but the industry shift isnt complete cardinal health still practices what it calls "investment buying" with certain manufacturers said spokeswoman tara schumacher the company doesnt comment on specific customers or products also it has "hybrid" relationships with some drug makers engaging in speculative buying for some products and fee for service on others "from the beginning we knew we wouldnt have a shift " ms schumacher said "that was never the intent we wanted to ensure we were negotiating fair prices for each customer were comfortable with the economics of some of the contracts not being fee based " some manufacturers have concluded that the benefits of the new agreements arent worth the costs said jamie hintlian a partner in accenture ltd s health and life sciences supply chain practice "not all suppliers to the distributors have felt compelled to participate in those programs " he said in the past pfizer has indicated it wasnt interested in fee based deals with wholesalers now it wont say whether it has bought into the new model "pfizer continues to look at all options that are currently available in the market to ensure that the best possible service is provided to patients " the company said in a statement still wholesale arbitrage played a role in the big fluctuation in lipitor sales between the first and second quarters during the first quarter pfizer allowed wholesalers to purchase some lipitor supplies at prices despite a january price increase this led to a wholesale inventory buildup that helped boost lipitor sales by in both the u s and world wide despite a declining prescription volume then during the second quarter wholesalers proceeded to lower inventory levels contributing to a plunge in u s sales and a drop world wide pfizer executives said the inventory swing wasnt unusual and that they closely monitor inventory levels "this is the cycle which is normal in wholesalers " pfizer vice chairman david shedlarz told analysts during a conference call last month "they tend to have largely higher inventories at the end of the first quarter for us and then adjust them down in the second quarter so this is not overly abnormal relative to prior year performance " compounding the situation has been lower prescription demand for lipitor because of last years introduction of a cheaper generic anticholesterol drug simvastatin wholesalers saw where lipitor prescriptions were heading and made sharp adjustments in the second quarter weekly u s lipitor prescriptions between may and early july were down between and from year earlier periods according to bear stearns amerisourcebergen bases its inventory levels on either product demand or "the contractual relationships we have with the manufacturer " said spokesman michael kilpatric he declined to comment on specific products or manufacturers for better or worse quarterly inventory swings have affected other drugs recently such as wyeths effexor antidepressant and protonix heartburn drug in wyeths case inventory increases helped second quarter sales of effexor and protonix whereas inventory decreases had hurt sales for both drugs in the previous quarter protonix sales jumped well above average for recent periods effexor sales rose reversing a drop in the first quarter "we got some restoration of our inventory levels that benefited protonix and effexor although thats not going to repeat " said bernard poussot wyeths chief operating officer in a written statement wyeth said it has "wholesaler service agreements " and that "some fluctuation within reasonable ranges and within agreement guidelines will occur in response to certain market conditions and general inventory management tactics " inventory swings may produce quarter to quarter fluctuations but analysts say they generally balance out over time so that annual sales figures are more in line with underlying demand some drug makers use specialized third party software to monitor inventory levels edge dynamics inc says half of the top u s drug makers use its software to get a better read on their distribution channels to help make operational and financial decisions "there is no excuse today to be surprised by whats going on in the channel " said edge chief executive henry olson
