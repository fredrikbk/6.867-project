for small agency a battle to shed boutique stigma questions for john berg company new york office of taxi title president new york life hails a taxi the new york office of taxi a boutique ad firm based in toronto known for its creative flair is on a winning streak not only did it recently land ad duties for new york life insurance co but the firm also was hired by johnson &amp johnson to handle ad duties for motrin and childrens motrin brands taxi new york which has been open since already works for brands such as sports cable network versus molson canadian and blue shield of california despite the rash of account wins taxi knows it cant rest easy the new york ad scene is crowded with boutique firms such as amalgamated and mother that like taxi aim to convince big marketers that hiring smaller and independent ad firms is a better way to go still the firms success vindicates the decision by taxis toronto headquarters to diversify into the u s john berg who before taking the reins at taxis new york office worked for big ad shops such as havas sas euro rscg and omnicom group inc s ddb and bbdo talks about taxi and where the firm will open its next office the wall street journal what are clients fears about hiring taxi john berg i think there is an interesting thing that happens we have been referred to in the press as a boutique which makes us crazy the word carries along with it a whole set of things like creative indulgence and creative for its own sake when people think boutique they dont think about a significant agency that is really working to help a client solve its business problems they think about it differently so the battle has been about getting rid of the boutique stigma what taxi has is years in the canadian marketplace when you come into the organization you know what taxi is about and what it believes in we are not inventing a new agency in new york we are just taking one that works well and bringing it to new york if we have had trouble in new business or if we have seen some hesitation with clients its usually around the question of "do you have the scale resources or would you be serious enough business partners " wsj when ampd mobile left taxi the company reportedly said that "taxi has done a good job as a boutique" and that it needed a bigger shop how much does taxis size hurt it in competing with the big global ad concerns mr berg i dont know how much credibility i would give that people come in here and see the strength of the resources in canada and then they look at bios of individuals of the people here and the clients then say its not a small agency doing small things when you look at new york life they could have said they needed a bigger agency or more people and they didnt do that it is something we do have to deal with and talk about wsj there seems to be a rash of small ad boutiques in new york right now from amalgamated to mother to taxi are there too many and how does taxi stand out in the clutter mr berg i dont think there are too many i think the question is will they do really interesting work that grows their clients businesses is there something in that size that makes them take chances and do new things will that result in a body of fresh and interesting work wsj toronto taxi launched taxi ii another toronto shop last year because it wants to keep the shop small to employees or less why and will this happen with taxi new york if you get that big mr berg it is very important to us because years ago jay chiat asked the question "how big do you have to be to get bad " interestingly everyone thought it was just a provocative question and nobody answered it so taxis co founder and chief creative officer paul lavoie being paul decided to answer it he looked at a bunch of sources he looked at african tribal culture he looked at american military structure and he looked at malcolm gladwells writing and paul said its above an organization starts to lose its culture anyone that has ever worked at a large advertising agency knows that eventually it starts to develop subcultures and little cultures that start to compete with each other when i was at bbdo in many ways there was the little john berg agency and a little jeff mordos agency mr mordos is chief operating officer of bbdos north american operations each was a bit different its good for any organization to have a culture and having everyone driving toward a clear point of view when the culture starts to bifurcate i dont think that is beneficial personally someone somewhere can argue there is some benefit but here at taxi we want everybody focused on our culture our theory is that culture runs the risk of declining after people bbdo declined to comment wsj when will you open another new york shop any plans for other u s cities mr berg we are growing so rapidly that we are starting to prepare for that eventuality that will come relatively quickly what we are finding with taxi ii is there are benefits of having two shops like in any organization you have people that are right underneath that leadership and in order to gain those leadership jobs you have to leave to get to that level so in toronto a few of those types of people have shifted to taxi ii and we were able to keep them in the organization we dont have any plans to be in any other u s cities its true we do have our eye on europe at this point but it becomes complicated because we dont want to stretch our resources too thin we wouldnt do a taxi ii in new york and try to open in europe at the same time wsj every few years a certain country becomes a hotbed of creativity why are canadian ad firms hot right now mr berg canada has a number of smaller independent shops and there can be a relationship with independence and success and creativity a lot of the more senior and the most talented people that work in a holding company or a public company spend a lot of their time on stuff other than clients issues what happens with an independent agency is one you dont spend a tremendous amount of time on financial issues and two you are not locked into a set of predetermined choices based on a number you have to hit or a profit margin you have committed to in an independent organization you can sit down and make decisions based on the clients needs and we can decide to do certain things for the sake of creativity but if you were trying to hit a profit margin number those things wouldnt be options for you wsj ad agencies that open new york outposts often fail how will taxi avoid such a fate mr berg that is a simple one paul lavoie and jane hope executive creative director at taxi studied the market for a good solid year before committing to the market in order for our culture to successfully move from canada to the u s it would need to be carried by someone who understands the culture so paul and jane decided to move here therein lies the difference i dont think you can take a great agency and send a playbook to new york and hope it sticks
