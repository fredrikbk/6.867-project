fcc auction may expand cellphone options services washington the federal communications commissions next airwaves auction expected in january could give consumers more services delivered on their cellphones and more options when it comes to picking service providers the fcc last week set aside a third of the airwaves under auction for wireless networks that would let customers use whichever cellphone or wireless device they want not only will consumers be able to buy any cellphone and then choose a provider the types of products and services offered by wireless companies could expand greatly although the degree of change will depend on who buys the bulk of the spectrum being offered analysts expect to see much easier cellphone access to online banking stock trading mobile video web search engines and anywhere anytime music downloading as well as new versions of email the new rules also open the door to cellphone use of wireless internet services such as ebay inc s skype the u s wireless industry is dominated by a few large players led by at&amp t inc and verizon wireless jointly owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone plc of the united kingdom the auction could set the stage for another company to enter the market and even if one of the big incumbents does win the bulk of the airwaves being sold it will have to change how it offers service and phone handsets the changes wont happen overnight the megahertz span of radio spectrum is coming to market because television broadcasters are converting to digital signals from their current ones but tv broadcasters dont have to vacate the spectrum until early and successful bidders will still have to construct their cellular networks that hasnt damped the excitement generated by the agencys open access requirements for one of the wireless licenses coming available in the auction today most cellular companies limit the services that customers can access using their wireless devices in effect keeping them on a private network rather than allowing them to access the entire internet over their phones "the difference in how we communicate could be as dramatic as how the internet changed communication when it first started to be used for commercial purposes " said bill belt a senior director with the consumer electronics association an industry trade group mr belt says the change will likely start with large content providers such as google inc yahoo inc and ebay making portable versions of their services more widely available but before too long he says a wide variety of currently unimaginable services will be available google is in talks with a number of handset makers about making a phone that would support its web applications currently it would need to find a service provider partner to bring the phone to market but with the auction either google itself could buy the spectrum and enter the wireless market or at the very least it could sell its phones with confidence that customers could use them to access wireless services it is also likely that more device makers will enter the market companies such as finlands nokia corp one of the worlds largest handset makers have at best a marginal presence in the u s eventually all cellular companies are expected to be more consumer friendly when it comes to signing up for service but if one of the existing cellphone companies wins the license many think changes will be more marginal verizon has already said that if it buys the spectrum it will comply with the rule but wont actively promote the use of new phones sell them in its stores or offer much in the way of after sales service verizon wireless declined to comment for this article
