tribal connections how courting sheiks slowed violence in iraq marines try payments alliances in anbar area chasing out al qaeda ramadi iraq to understand how the u s managed to bring relative calm to iraqs unruly anbar province it helps to pay a visit to sheik hamid heisss private compound on a recent morning a year old marine corps lieutenant from ohio stacked &# in cash in neat piles on sheik heisss gilded tea table the money paid for food for the sheiks tribe and for two school renovation projects on which the sheik himself is the lead contractor even the marble floored meeting hall where the cash was handed over reflects recent u s largesse the marines paid sheik heiss and his family &# to build it on his private compound such payments have encouraged local leaders in this vast desert expanse to help the u s oust al qaeda extremists and restore a large measure of stability and security today anbar is averaging about attacks a week down from a week last year on the main street in ramadi anbars main city iraqi laborers are removing three years of accumulated rubble that couldnt be carted off previously because of the threat of sniper fire theyre fixing sewer lines shredded by years of roadside bombs the work is taking place on the same thoroughfare where al qaeda in iraq late last year staged a parade of fighters that was posted on jihadi web sites "for three years we fought our asses off out here and made very little progress " says lt col michael silverman who oversees an soldier battalion in ramadi "now we are working with the sheiks and ramadi has gone from the most dangerous city in the world to a place where i can sit on sheik heisss front porch without my body armor and not have to worry about getting shot " the success in anbar province which lies west of baghdad hasnt come easily the key to the u s campaign has been recruiting cultivating and rewarding tribal leaders at points the effort even involved a marine general making several trips abroad to woo an important exiled tribal sheik to return home the progress here which has unfolded as violence elsewhere in iraq has climbed has become central to american hopes of success in the deeply divided country president bush has repeatedly touted it and u s commanders throughout iraq are looking to export the marine model but as remarkable as the turnaround here has been it isnt clear how broad or lasting the gains will be with the threat of al qaeda now gone from their area many of the anbari sheiks have begun to jockey with each other for power and influence more ominously some tribal leaders including sheik heiss complain that their real enemy now isnt al qaeda but a shiite dominated government in baghdad the government the u s is trying to build up to hold the peace in anbar province the marines say they must convince the sunni tribes that there is a place for them in the provincial government and in the shiite dominated national government the marines plan is to spread economic political and security power as evenly as possible among the tribes and the government institutions they hope to create a balance that will lead if not to peace then to stability it is an agonizingly slow process that for now u s commanders say seems to be working one of the driving forces behind the strategy in al anbar is brig gen john allen a brainy and slightly built marine officer gen allen has become an avid reader of gertrude bell the british archeologist who in the s drew the lines of modern day iraq her travelogues dogeared and underlined are scattered across his desk "when the tribes are at their best they live in a condition of splendid equilibrium " says gen allen quoting ms bell the lesson he says "is that the tribes are constantly shifting alliances to suit economic and security needs " in the process they are also testing boundaries with u s forces and each other to see how far they can expand their power about three quarters of iraqs population both sunni and shiite are members of one of the nations tribes each tribes leadership consists of a senior sheik and a council of several dozen sub sheiks whose positions are typically hereditary the sheiks oversee vast business networks that often include some cross border smuggling say the marines they award spoils and arbitrate disputes within the tribe they also seek to place members in key jobs throughout the local and national government so that they can deliver money power and influence "tribal society makes up the tectonic plates in iraq on which everything rests " says gen allen saddam hussein managed the tribes with a combination of cash and brute force gen allen says when his government was toppled in the equilibrium among the tribes that he had constructed over three decades fractured into chaos some tribes aligned themselves with al qaeda for religious reasons linking with their muslim brothers to drive out the occupiers say the sheiks others were driven by economics smaller tribes saw an opportunity to align with the terrorists and amass wealth and power that had been denied to them more than of the fighters aligned with al qaeda in anbar province in were iraqis who either came from anbar or other parts of iraq gen allen says the remaining were foreigners who provided weapons and money the al qaeda leadership quickly moved to seize power from the tribal sheiks and institute sharia law which hews to a strict interpretation of the quran the tribal sheiks who tend to be more moderate muslims some keep a few bottles of whiskey stashed in their homes balked at that and al qaeda operatives began to slaughter them in the fall of sheik sattar al risha a ramadi tribal leader whose father and two brothers had been killed by al qaeda quietly approached the u s about forming an alliance to fight al qaeda his tribe the albu risha lacked the money prestige and influence of some of the larger anbar tribes within the larger confederation of tribes in anbar known as the duleimy confederation the albu risha are second tier players by linking with the americans sheik sattar who is tall lithe and a polished speaker saw a chance to get revenge and build strength his tribe saw an alliance with u s forces as a means to gain power the u s parked an m tank in front of sheik sattars house and began to train his men other tribal leaders in ramadi such as sheik heiss began to rally to sheik sattars side soon the ramadi sheiks were leading a force of some men with the help of u s forces who provided training and backup firepower they had by march essentially pushed the radical islamists out of ramadi toward baghdad what worked in ramadi however couldnt be replicated so easily in other parts of the province to the east in fallujah the prominent sheiks had fled to syria or jordan the fallujah tribes were also reluctant to join in any movement run by sheik sattar whose tribe lacks the wealth and proud history of the fallujah tribes to win the tribes allegiance the marines created a three prong strategy first they sought to convince the most prominent fallujah sheiks to return home second they had to help them organize train and equip their men finally they had to give the sheiks some money in the form of reconstruction projects which they could use to attract followers and consolidate power after months or years in exile "these guys do everything with money " says lt col john reeve who is the second in command of the marine regiment in the area "every deal goes to the sheik he then trickles the money down to reward sub tribes who cooperate and punish those who dont " gen allen began to make regular trips to jordan to meet with exiled sheiks his top priority was to convince sheik mishan al jumaily the head of the powerful jumaily tribe to return from syria u s forces had killed one of his four sons in by mistake at a checkpoint a second of the sheiks sons was killed by radical islamists in "after he was killed my wife died of a broken heart " sheik mishan says in may gen allen was having dinner with a prominent anbari businessman in amman when he mentioned that he needed to get in contact with sheik mishan it was p m the businessman pulled out his cellphone hit one number on his speed dial and began talking to the year old sheik who was in syria "sheik mishan is coming here tomorrow to see you " the businessman told gen allen the sheik drove through the night and arrived in amman the next day he and gen allen spent two days together in amman and petra another jordanian city in the hours before he returned to iraq gen allen made a final pitch to sheik mishan to come with him "we in the west know there are pivotal moments when the right person can appear on the battlefield raise the spirits of his people and serve as a tipping point for success " gen allen recalls saying "your return would be that tipping point " sheik mishan a small man with round rosy cheeks begged off "if i return it will be because god wills it " he says he replied he went back to syria over the following month col reeve continued to reach out to sheik mishans tribesmen providing them training scavenged weapons and small reconstruction projects "we had to show them that this group of americans was going to do something of permanence we werent going to go eat their goat dinner and then disappear for six months " col reeve says in late june sheik mishans third son was killed by a roadside bomb outside of fallujah the following day he called gen allen and said he wanted to return to iraq the general immediately jumped on a military plane to amman and on the fourth of july escorted the sheik back to his front door with the support of the two main tribes in fallujah the marines trained an man "provincial security force" to fight al qaeda and man checkpoints in the areas outside of fallujah where the terrorists had found support primarily from sheik mishans own people the sheiks presence combined with u s training and reconstruction contracts helped galvanize the tribe attacks on u s and iraqi army forces in fallujah plummeted in a matter of weeks today with al qaeda gone many of the tribal leaders in ramadi and fallujah have begun to talk about rebuilding their cities ravaged by four years of war and jumpstarting the local economy as recently as march the fallujah city council couldnt meet because of the instability in the area two council members were killed and the mayor was arrested these days they meet and security in fallujah isnt even the main topic of conversation instead they argue about the decrepit electricity system and how to start garbage pickup in the trash strewn city unfortunately some city leaders and prominent sheiks in anbar have also already begun to talk about the next fight against the shiite militias in baghdad "if the americans give us orders and money we will get rid" of the militias says ramadis sheik heiss "we will have a new government run by sunnis that will be fair to all " recently sheik heiss says he sent about of his tribesmen to the mansour district in baghdad to fight al qaeda american officials have since given him strict orders not to deploy his men outside of his tribal areas because the sheik is dependent on the u s for reconstruction contracts and his men depend on the ministry of interior in baghdad for their pay u s officials are confident he will obey the marines say the best way to keep the sheiks in line is to make them dependent on the iraqi government for the money and services they need to care for their people and run the patronage networks that sustain their influence "its sort of like putting them on welfare " says col reeve one morning last week col reeve drove sheik mishan to a fallujah city council meeting the sheik sat directly behind the mayor and council chairman who were wearing suits the sheik wore a traditional arab dishdasha and a black shawl with gold piping amber prayer beads were wound tightly around his thumb the first day col reeve brought sheik mishan to the meeting in early july the council members who saw the wealthy and influential sheiks presence as a challenge to government control threatened to leave says col reeve now they seem to tolerate him but there is little indication that the two sides even though both are predominately sunnis are working together the money the city government gets from baghdad is focused almost entirely on the city proper sheik mishan and the tribal areas outside the city depend almost entirely on the u s forces for reconstruction contracts on the security side the marines are working feverishly to maintain a balance of power between the tribally aligned provincial security forces and the city police so far it seems to be holding in late july col reeve was watching police training when col faisl al zobai the fallujah city police chief pulled him aside for a private meeting col faisl who sees the tribally dominated forces as a threat to his command of the fallujah area had for weeks lobbied col reeve unsuccessfully to have them put under him on this morning he told col reeve he wanted to send his police forces into the jumaily tribal areas to clear out some al qaeda fighters because his force wasnt strong enough to do the mission alone he needed the provincial security forces help "can i order the sheiks to support me with men and two trucks of fighters " he asked col reeve told col faisl that the sheik in the area would probably be willing to assist him "have you asked him for help " he queried "no i dont know what i would do if he said no " col faisl replied then col faisl asked if the tribes would give him men to help clear out a neighborhood in baghdad col reeve told him a mission in baghdad was a terrible idea because it would inflame sunni shiite tensions and that the sheiks wouldnt support him "col faisl wants immediate and unhesitating obedience to his orders " col reeve explained after the meeting "i can tell he is frustrated he cant go to baghdad and it is pissing him off " for col reeve though it was a victory col faisl the city police chief now realized that he had to win the support of the tribes for any big operation "weve created a codependency " he says the next day col reeve asked the tribal commanders if they would provide col faisl with the men to do the raid in the jumaily tribal area they said they would today the sheiks biggest fear is that the americans will leave them to the devices of a failing sectarian government in baghdad recently the u s military flew a small group of national security experts to anbar province to have dinner with fallujah sheiks at the marines base the think tankers who hailed from the brookings institution listened as the sheiks who came from the jumaily and issa tribes described their frustrations "we have gotten rid of al qaeda but we have other organizations that are worse " said sheik mishan referring to the iraqi government one of the fallujah sheiks then reached out a hand and placed it on gen allens knee "this is my government " he said proudly gen allen sighed "unfortunately that is the problem " he said
