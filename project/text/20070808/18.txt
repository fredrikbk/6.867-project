broadcom lands blows to rival supply deal with nokia comes as court rebukes qualcomm over patents broadcom corp rocked opponent qualcomm inc in two legal bouts this week in one unusual ruling a federal judge concluded that qualcomm had engaged in "an organized program of litigation misconduct" in a patent suit against broadcom now broadcom is landing a blow in the market the chip maker today plans to announce that nokia corp a dominant handset maker that also is squabbling with qualcomm has chosen broadcom to supply chips called baseband processors though the deal only involves selected phones that use a network called edge the deal is broadcoms first order for such chips from one of the top cellphone makers broadcom of irvine calif is already a power in communications chips but san diego based qualcomm is the dominant force in cellphone chips commanding patent royalties from most handset makers in one move to pressure its rival broadcom convinced the international trade commission to ban imports of future models of cellphones containing qualcomm chips found to infringe broadcom patents on monday in another victory for broadcom the bush administration rejected calls by qualcomm and cellphone carriers to set aside the ban the same day in a patent case in san diego u s district judge rudi brewster ruled that two qualcomm patents related to video compression technology cant be enforced because the company deliberately concealed the patents from a standards setting group qualcomm compounded its misconduct by withholding evidence and making false statements before during and after a trial in the case that ended in january the judge concluded while the rulings arent likely to have any short term effect on qualcomms fast growing profits they point to a series of long term risks because of the companys legal battles in the san diego case a jury had already rejected qualcomms allegations that broadcom infringed the two patents but the judges additional findings could have significant financial and legal repercussions he ordered qualcomm to pay broadcoms legal costs and is considering its motion for additional sanctions disciplinary proceedings against lawyers involved in the case also are possible if the judges findings are borne out said monroe freedman an expert in legal ethics who is a professor of law at hofstra university "i consider it a very serious matter " he said qualcomms lead attorney during the trial james batchelder wrote the judge in april that the company discovered relevant emails on the laptop computer of a qualcomm witness during the trial he apologized "professionally and personally" for not having discovered the documents sooner and for "asserting positions that we would not have taken had we known of the existence of these documents " mr batchelder was replaced in april as lead attorney on the case he couldnt be reached for comment yesterday but craig casebeer a partner with his firm noted the prior apology and added that the firm "respectfully disagrees with the inferences and conclusions made by the court " qualcomm which also apologized in april yesterday said it "acknowledges the seriousness of the courts findings" and reiterated its regret for "errors" made while responding to broadcom requests for documents and for "the inaccurate testimony of certain of its witnesses " paul jacobs qualcomms chief executive added in an interview that an initial investigation showed the company had simply made "a series of mistakes" in providing evidence though it is still studying how those mistakes were made there was no intention to mislead the court or the standard setting group he said "its disappointing to me to have these kinds of mistakes made " mr jacobs said "its even more disappointing to have them taken in such a negative fashion " qualcomm plans to appeal the ruling the battles are the latest in the lucrative market for cellphone chips industry standard setting bodies have become a particular flash point such groups staffed by engineers from a variety of organizations define specifications that can affect technology suppliers for years they often require members to disclose patents to avoid locking technology suppliers into choices that can force them to pay royalties during the san diego case broadcom asserted that qualcomm had violated an obligation to disclose patents to a group called h that was setting standards for video compression qualcomm insisted that it had not participated in the group before it defined a standard in may but after the surprise discovery during the trial of an initial set of relevant emails qualcomm found and later shared more than emails and other documents with the court after reviewing the documents judge brewster concluded that qualcomm engineers had participated in the group well before may he also rejected qualcomms suggestion that its failure to share evidence with broadcom was an accident "the eventual collapse of qualcomms concealment efforts exposes the carefully orchestrated plan and the deadly determination of qualcomm to achieve its goal of holding hostage the entire industry desiring to practice the h standard " he concluded broadcom meanwhile is pushing to find out more about whether senior qualcomm executives knew of evidence that should have been disclosed sooner it contends qualcomm withheld information from other standard setting bodies too a charge qualcomm rejects "i think this is just a snapshot of their corporate behavior " said david j rosmann broadcoms vice president of intellectual property litigation kevin kingsbury contributed to this article
