the informed patient hospitals boost patients power as advisers after undergoing two years of treatment for non hodgkins lymphoma at moffitt cancer center in tampa fla ron giovannelli got a clean bill of health in february needing to return only quarterly for a check up but the year old civil engineer had already agreed to come back regularly in a different role as a member of moffitts new patient and family advisory council there the center tapped him to consult with architects and engineers on an expansion project after years of confining outreach efforts to the occasional focus group on decor or food service hospitals are striking far reaching new partnerships with patients and their families creating advisory councils whose members help plan new facilities set hiring standards and interview job candidates patient groups are participating in the design of clinical trials evaluating hospital equipment reviewing medication safety measures and helping train medical residents the new councils are giving patients an increasingly powerful voice at a time when hospitals are scrambling to increase customer satisfaction better respond to complaints and avoid costly malpractice litigation hospitals also have a strong financial incentive to bring patients and families into the equation starting later this year medicare will require hospitals to publish customer satisfaction data on the medicare web site to receive full reimbursement for their services patient advisers from hospitals around the country worked with survey firm press ganey inc on five questions to measure concern for patient and family issues the nonprofit institute for family centered care which developed the core principles behind the patient and family centered care movement is working with hundreds of hospitals in the u s and europe to create patient and family advisory councils last week the bethesda md group sponsored a conference in seattle where patient and family advisers reported on their achievements to hospital administrators patient advisers "provide a vital perspective on the experience of care that administrators and providers simply dont have " says beverly h johnson the institutes founder and chief executive as more hospitals participate the collaboration has resulted in real changes both big and small kirk hennig who has used a wheelchair since he suffered a spinal injury while working on a pile driving site at a pier in seattle in was asked to join the rehabilitation services council at the university of washington medical center in the council made a number of "nuts and bolts" recommendations such as putting bathrooms in more convenient locations in the rehab floor and changing electronic doors so disabled patients werent hit as they closed all of which were quickly adopted "we were emboldened to think bigger once it became clear that someone with the power to make changes was hearing our message " mr hennig says the council subsequently developed a manual for the centers patients and worked on rearranging occupational therapy areas redesigning two patient rooms for single occupancy and developing new standards for evaluating occupational therapists based on their collaborative efforts with patients "there are some constraints financially and structurally to what we want to do but everything was listened to and nothing has been rejected outright " mr hennig says cezanne garcia associate director of patient and family centered care and education services at the university of washington says its four different family advisory councils have also come up with creative solutions to offer restitution to families who had grievances or legal complaints against the hospital and have helped select residents for the obstetrics and gynecology program over the past two years such patient advisory councils are far from ubiquitous at the university healthsystem consortium an alliance of large academic medical centers and of their affiliated hospitals a recent survey showed that only about half of its members have councils in place but the group has launched a project to help its members adopt guidelines from the institute for family centered care including creating patient and family groups "we are making people aware of how important it is but there is still a lot of fear about loss of control" in bringing families and patients into decision making in hospitals says project leader kathy vermoch the institute for family centered care also hosts an online forum that advisory groups use to trade tips on working with hospital staffers and provides guidelines for consumers who want to start an advisory group at their own hospital on its web site familycenteredcare org advisory council members volunteer their time and get nominal perks such as free parking travel reimbursement or lunches during meetings hospitals also put volunteers through orientation programs that include training in privacy laws though councils may meet quarterly or monthly members are often asked to sit on committees that meet more often to work on specific projects or go on retreats with staff hospitals typically seek members with diverse ethnic racial and occupational backgrounds including those with medical conditions who are "frequent fliers" in the health care system when choosing advisory council members "we dont want somebody so positive that they cant cast a critical eye to see how to make things better but we also dont want someone who is so angry that they have an ax to grind with the hospital and cant move beyond that " says nancy wells newman director of patient support services at moffitt in many cases hospitals are turning to patients with special expertise such as mr giovannelli the civil engineer the moffitt cancer centers family advisers also include a retired education administrator who is helping to improve training programs for hospital staff and a brain tumor patient with a background in information technology who helped develop the councils web site since the advisory council was started last year moffitt has made a number of changes based on its recommendations such as extending valet parking for patients who have late infusion treatments adding flavored barium to the pharmacy for patients who drink the unpleasant tasting substance prior to come imaging procedures and redesigning clinics to make them more comfortable for patients new initiatives include participating in training of fourth year medical students on breaking bad news to patients and families by acting in role playing scenarios and family advisers will be asked this year for input on designing clinical trials such as identifying barriers to participation including transportation or costs and strategies for recruiting more minority patients vanderbilt university hospital in nashville tenn which created an adult patient and family advisory council last fall includes one patient who had a heart transplant two diabetics and a woman whose husband died at the hospital from burns sustained in a plane crash the diabetic patients suggested reclining chairs in treatment rooms with longer leg rests that didnt impede circulation the wife of the crash victim suggested free parking passes for families of long term patients the council also suggested nine changes to hospital bills to make them easier to read which were incorporated by the billing department says terrell smith director of patient family centered care mcg health inc in augusta ga a member of the university healthsystem consortium uses patient and family advisers in more than organizational committees according to patricia sodomka senior vice president for patient and family centered care among them max bassett a father of nine and nuclear chemist in aiken s c whose daughter neva required two heart surgeries at the hospital at mcg where he is chairman of the family advisory council mr bassett says family advisers persuaded the hospital to dedicate space to a vending area with a microwave close to the neonatal intensive care unit they also helped develop policies to improve security and deal with concerns about violent threats to staffers persuading hospital administrators to educate families about the rules and boundaries rather than adopting a policy focused on ejecting those perceived as a threat after experiencing "impersonal and institutional care" at other hospitals says mr bassett "i want to see my hospital succeed so families dont endure needless suffering over the way they are treated " email informedpatient wsj com
