the daily fix theres a new home run champion and his name is barry bonds online edition barry bonds inspires love hate and indifference depending on whether or not you think he used performance enhancing drugs to transform himself from a feared slugger to a terrifying one but whatever you feel is true about bonds the numbers dont lie and they say that bonds is now baseballs all time home run king the san francisco giants slugger connected for no in the fifth inning last night against the washington nationals ushering journeyman hurler mike bacsik into the record books as his victim the home run broke a tie bondss giants wound up losing in a short ceremony after his blast bonds thanked his family his teammates and the fans and turned to watch a video message from hank aaron who had this to say "i move over now and offer my best wishes to barry and his family on this historical achievement my hope today as it was on that april evening in is that the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams " in the san jose mercury news tim kawakami writes that "it was the sound of history and nothing else bat on ball a perfect crisp electrifying crash just maple wood meeting ball and then for just a moment at at&amp t park there was silence instant thumping massive history will do that to you almost every time after a second or two as barry bonds pointed two fists to the sky smiled wildly and skipped around the bases of course there was noise and fireworks and shouts and minutes of game stopping delirium but the homer was really about that exact spark of contact bat on ball and the sudden brief ripple of silence it sent through the crowd and probably the entire nation " "whether you consider the new record a messy bit of baseball bookkeeping or a towering achievement its etched in stone now so deal with it " suggests scott ostler in the san francisco chronicle adding "for the media for bonds teammates for fans and probably for barry himself who suffered such anxiety type side effects as a rash on his head the record chase has sometimes been as painful as frontier dental work the chase has been fun too and it stimulated a lot of national debate but it also brought out the worst in a lot of people " surveying the furor surrounding bonds the detroit free presss mitch albom writes that "it is not about race it is not about personality if you cannot get past those stumbling blocks on such an important issue you dont deserve to be discussing it you really dont the man bonds surpassed for the home run mark was black the next guys most likely to catch him are black or dominican american this is not white versus black nor is it about being a jerk pete rose was hardly a saint ted williams was grumpy ty cobb was a nasty cuss so what nobody ever challenged their baseball marks bonds will be challenged and may never stop being challenged he is not the only one alleged to have taken steroids only the most famous most accomplished and still active " mr alboms conclusion "you can only say this about barry bonds this morning tomorrow morning and as he trots around the bases from now until the day he retires there goes a hell of a baseball player who may have done a hell of a thing to his sport " going back to the merc ann killion writes of bondss melancholy legacy noting that willie mays bondss godfather was once the face of the giants "he put his mark forever on a city and a team " she writes "when you were a giants fan it meant you had rooted for greatness had witnessed the best player who ever lived but for a legion of new fans the franchise will now and forever for better or for worse be defined by bonds by his long stretch of dominance by his controversial ascent to the home run throne by the stamp he has put on this era this ballpark and this city giants fans have been ridiculed and pilloried for their worship of bonds but they have been fully invested partners in this compromised march toward history and now they have seen history perhaps the last significant moment they will witness for a long time and are left with only a losing misguided team " the associated press notes one of those connections that would be spooky except for the fact that baseball is so rife with them mr bacsiks father also named mike faced aaron when hammerin hank then finishing his career with the milwaukee brewers had home runs the elder mr bacsik got aaron on a flyout then allowed an infield single oh and another feared s slugger also went for against the first mr bacsik bobby bonds barrys dad the younger mr bacsik wasnt too concerned about being forever linked with bonds before the game he joked that he and al downing who surrendered no to aaron could do card shows together afterwards he offered this wry note "i dreamed about it as a kid but unfortunately when i dreamed about it i was the one hitting the home run " if this is all too much for you try brandon strouds dugout take on bondss record tying blast starring khalil greene ignore the random swipe at alex rodriguez the ending sums up bonds better than any columnist has yet managed its baseball son its all its ever been fathers and sons cheers and some boos you did this and he shouldve done this and you shouldnt have done that it broke my heart and it filled that broken heart back up brady quinns holdout is over the rookies new five year deal which could be worth as much as &# million means mr quinn will finally be at training camp with his cleveland browns teammates but starting the season as clevelands qb seems out of the question coach romeo crennel who didnt refer to mr quinn by name during his holdout said the rookie would be put at the bottom of the chart as charlie frye and derek anderson continue to compete for the right to line up behind the center in the akron beacon journal terry pluto warns fans not to expect mr quinn to start anytime soon "if youre a browns fan and a quinn fan you should want the rookie to sit for several weeks " he writes "havent we watched enough rookies chewed up in this league please save the conspiracy theories about the browns playing hardball in the contract talks so that quinn would hold out and not be forced to immediately start that was not an option based on the minicamps none of the quarterbacks looked good but he was the least impressive " jermaine oneal wants out of indiana yes he does well sort of depends whos asking on sunday at a charity basketball game the unhappy pacer said he wanted to be traded to the los angeles lakers or failing that to the new jersey nets on monday he backed off those remarks amending his comments to something along the lines of wanting to go to the east or west coast if this proves a rebuilding year for indiana bob kravitz of the indianapolis star understands why mr oneal is unhappy hes been saying for some time that the pacers arent improving but thats not the same as endorsing mr oneals comments "if anything oneals words may backfire making a palatable deal with los angeles or anybody else even more difficult to execute " he writes "theres nothing tougher in the nba than making a decent deal when everybody else knows you have to move a player the pacers are not going to be forced again to make a trade under duress they had to get rid of ron artest after artests trade demand they had to get rid of stephen jackson after the nightclub incident theres really no pressure on the pacers this time no matter what oneal says or doesnt say " tip of the fix cap to readers michelle alessandri and don
