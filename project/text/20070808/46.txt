fannie mae to the rescue with wall street openly lobbying for someone to ride to its rescue in the credit markets the news is that fannie mae and freddie mac have offered to step into the breach for a price their offer deserves to be treated with the same skepticism as their claims some years back about bullet proof accounting the irony here is that congress chartered fannie and freddie expressly to expand access to "affordable" housing yet the two mortgage giants have long sought their profit opportunities in the more credit worthy segments of the market yes their regulator requires them to do some business in the low end of the market but the "low end" is defined pretty generously and fan and fred have tended to do the minimum necessary to keep congress and regulators off their backs in other words the whole subprime lending industry the securitization of those loans and their sale to investors is the product of private innovation the same goes for so called jumbo mortgages which have been too big for fan and fred to securitize everyone agrees that there have been excesses in that market for which these companies are paying a price in reduced earnings or bankruptcy but our point is that real expansion of available credit to less than ideal borrowers owes little to congresss favorite "affordable housing" giants now however fannie and freddie are suddenly saying they can be white knights for a jittery illiquid mortgage market and no doubt with their government backed borrowings they could provide some liquidity in the short term but their offer comes with a big catch the journal reports that fannie has asked regulators to lift the cap on the size of their portfolios of mortgage backed securities mbss freddie meanwhile wants permission to buy larger mortgages than is currently allowed so called jumbo mortgages that on account of their size tend to go to the well heeled because their mission is supposedly "affordable housing " fannie and freddie are currently limited to buying mortgages of no more than &# their friends on capitol hill have been trying to raise this so called conforming loan limit through legislation but freddie mac sees the current turmoil as a way to get access to the biggest mortgages and play savior at the same time beauty regulators capped the companies mbs portfolios in the wake of accounting scandals and the companies have wanted them lifted ever since amid the current widening of credit spreads fannie no doubt sees an opportunity to step in and grab market share that it has lost while the cap has been in place but the types of loans fan and fred are likely to buy are not the ones that have been in distress recently since those loans dont meet their underwriting requirements their real game here is to get back in the business of using their borrowing advantage from their implicit taxpayer subsidy to once again dominate the mbs market no wonder fannies stock was up monday and another yesterday on the prospect that the regulator might remove the shackles but confusing private profit with public benefit is what got fan and fred in trouble in the first place the portfolio caps were put in place to contain the systemic risk that those portfolios pose to the economy so lifting them now would be ill advised in the extreme
