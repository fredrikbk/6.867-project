politics &amp economics obama seeks to make the sale to hispanics despite ability to draw crowds and donations senator is still largely unknown to crucial group miami before people at the convention of a powerful hispanic advocacy group recently sen barack obama made a pitch for unity between african americans and hispanics "our separate struggles are really one " the illinois democrat declared quoting a telegram martin luther king jr sent in to farm worker activist cesar chavez mr obama compared last years massive immigration rallies led by hispanics to the civil rights marches of african americans in the s and called for the two groups to stay the course in a common fight for equality to rousing applause at the convention of the national council of la raza he alluded to "one dream" for blacks and latinos later he cited his kenyan born father as an example of an immigrant who came here in pursuit of the american dream despite becoming this presidential races phenomenon with the power to draw huge crowds and raise millions of dollars mr obama remains relatively unknown among the countrys fastest growing electorate nearly half of latino voters have never heard of him according to a june gallup poll even as he gains awareness among hispanics he may find wooing them to his campaign a challenge across the u s tensions simmer between hispanics and blacks who regard each other as rivals for jobs educational resources housing and political power in los angeles hispanics have become the majority in traditionally black enclaves and clashes have erupted between the groups in schools and on the streets for mr obama this has created a tricky situation the fiery debate over immigration in congress alienated many hispanics pushing conservatives among them into the democratic camp and encouraging others to register to vote but to tap into that mr obama must navigate past democratic primary opponents who are better positioned to capitalize on those voters "if obama were the democratic presidential nominee he would do well in the hispanic community " says mark mellman a democratic pollster but "he will have to fight for their support in the primaries " hillary clinton already boasts name recognition and endorsements from prominent latino leaders while bill richardson the new mexico governor is hispanic and speaks fluent spanish mr obamas message of a shared black latino struggle may strike a chord with political activists but could ring hollow with core latino voters "the hispanic and black elites may be singing kumbaya together but at the neighborhood level theyre duking it out " says paula mcclain a duke university political scientist who studies black latino relations "obama needs to understand the nuance and not assume a broad brush coalition" between them ms mcclain and other academics say hispanics have negative stereotypical views of blacks generally hispanics feel they share more in common with whites than blacks says ms mcclain "in a primary contest one has to wonder how a latino electorate will feel about voting for a black person " there is precedent for african americans and hispanics combining electoral power in the los angeles mayoral race many black leaders disenchanted with white incumbent james hahn threw support to antonio villaraigosa the mexican american candidate won on the promise of bridging the citys racial divide with support from the african american electorate but "it wasnt a black brown unity election " says jaime regalado executive director of the pat brown institute for public affairs at california state university los angeles "it was a sign of displeasure with the incumbent " in miami mr obama introduced a jingle to woo latinos a percussion infused "reggaeton" tune in spanish with a refrain to pump up his recognition "how do you say it what do you call him obama obama " "the community really hasnt been introduced to obama " says larry gonzalez a political consultant who formed "latinos for obama " which includes high profile hispanics many of them lawyers and entrepreneurs as the first primary state with a significant hispanic electorate nevada is expected to offer a hint of how latinos vote in other hispanic heavy states such as arizona and new mexico in las vegas mr obama has met on three occasions with hispanic hotel and casino workers who make up a large portion of the influential culinary workers union as well as with local hispanic political figures in a sign of the challenges mr obama faces a recent independent poll by a group called latino decisions says that in nevada mrs clinton currently is favored by of democratic or democratic leaning latinos while mr richardson has and mr obama but a new national wall street journal nbc news poll shows better results for the illinois senator it found mrs clinton is favored by of hispanics followed by messrs obama and edwards with each and mr richardson with the obama campaign has begun distributing campaign literature in nevada in spanish and says it is putting more than staffers on the ground with offices in las vegas reno and other cities the campaign says it is also mobilizing thousands of volunteers to go door to door spanish language television is likely to play an important role in the primaries as it amps up campaign coverage to mr obamas disadvantage "they are going to have direct sound bites in spanish from bill richardson " notes federico subervi professor of mass media at texas state university in san marcos on the other hand he says latinos more politically attuned and more likely to vote in the primary get their news both in english and spanish mr obama has secured the support of some prominent latino politicians such as illinois rep luis gutierrez and california senate majority leader gloria romero "he understands civil rights and poverty " says ms romero who supported rev jesse jackson when he ran for president mrs clinton has won endorsements from heavyweights such as l a mayor villaraigosa new jersey sen robert menendez and dolores huerta who co founded the united farm workers of america with cesar chavez
