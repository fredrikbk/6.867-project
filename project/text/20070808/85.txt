not by geeks alone in a globalizing economy americas competitive edge depends in large measure on how well our schools prepare tomorrows workforce and notwithstanding the fact that congress and the white house are now controlled by opposing parties lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are bent on devising new programs and boosting education spending consider the measure the america competes act that recently passed congress and is on its way to the presidents desk the bill will substantially increase government funding for science technology engineering and math "stem" subjects president bush education secretary margaret spellings as well as house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid support this initiative nearly all of the presidential candidates endorse its goals and state legislatures have also recently enacted stem bills the buzz is as constant as summer cicadas indeed stem has swiftly emerged as the hottest education topic since no child left behind theyre related too nclb puts a premium on reading and math skills and also pays some attention to science marry it with stem and you get heavy emphasis on a particular suite of skills but there is a problem here worthy though these skills are they ignore at least half of what has long been regarded as a "well rounded" education in western civilization literature art music history civics and geography indeed a new study from the center on education policy says that since nclbs enactment nearly half of u s school districts have reduced the time their students spend on subjects such as art and music this is a mistake that will ill serve our children while misconstruing the true nature of american competitiveness and the challenges we face in the st century as with all education reforms the stem winders mean well they reason that india and china will eat americas lunch unless we boost our young peoples prowess in the stem fields but these enthusiasts dont understand that what makes americans competitive on a shrinking globalizing planet isnt out gunning asians at technical skills rather its our peoples creativity versatility imagination restlessness energy ambition and problem solving prowess true success over the long haul economic success civic success cultural success domestic success national defense success depends on a broadly educated populace with flowers and leaves as well as stems thats what equips us to invent and imagine and grow one business line into another its also how we acquire qualities and abilities that arent easily "outsourced" to guangzhou or hyderabad students who garner high tech skills may still get undercut by people halfway around the world who are willing to do the same work for one fifth of the salary the surest way to compete is to offer something the chinese and indians and vietnamese singaporeans etc cannot technical skills are not enough apples ipod was not just an engineering improvement on sonys walkman it emerged from steve jobss american style understanding of peoples lifestyles needs tastes and capacities yes mr jobs dropped out of college but went on to study philosophy and foreign cultures pragmatic folks naturally seek direct links from skill to result such as engineers using their technical knowledge to keep planes aloft and bridges from buckling but what about abraham lincoln educating himself via shakespeare the bible and other great literary works alan greenspans degrees are in economics but he plays a mean jazz saxophone indeed many of todays foremost and wealthiest entrepreneurs people like warren buffett studied economics not a stem subject in college adam smith studied moral philosophy the liberal arts make us "competitive" in the ways that matter most they make us wise thoughtful and appropriately humble they help our human potential to bloom and they are the foundation for a democratic civic polity where each of us bears equal rights and responsibilities history and literature also impart to their students healthy skepticism and doubt the ability to question to ask both "why " and "why not " and perhaps most important readiness to challenge authority push back against conventional wisdom and make ones own way despite pressure to conform how will that be viewed in china were already at risk of turning u s schools into test prepping skill factories where nothing matters except exam scores on basic subjects thats not what america needs nor is it a sufficient conception of educational accountability we need schools that prepare our children to excel and compete not only in the global workforce but also as full participants in our society our culture our polity and our economy addressing a recent fordham foundation education conference arts endowment chairman dana gioia said "we need a system that grounds all students in pleasure beauty and wonder it is the best way to create citizens who are awakened not only to their humanity but to the human enterprise that they inherit and will for good or ill perpetuate " creating such a system calls not for a host of specialized new institutions and government programs but for closely examining the curriculum in all our schools it also calls for recalibrating academic standards and graduation requirements as well as amending our testing and accountability schemes most certainly including nclb by widening the definition of "proficient" to include reasoning creativity and knowledge across a dozen subjects as well as basic cognitive skills we need to start reconceptualizing "highly qualified" teachers as people who are themselves broadly educated rather than narrowly specialized abandoning the liberal arts in the name of stem alone also risks widening social divides and deepening domestic inequities the well to do who understand the value of liberal learning may be the only ones able to purchase it for their children top private schools and a few suburban systems will stick with education broadly defined as will elite colleges rich kids will study philosophy and art music and history while their poor peers fill in bubbles on test sheets the lucky few will spawn the next generation of tycoons political leaders inventors authors artists and entrepreneurs the less lucky masses will see narrower opportunities some will find no opportunities at all which frustration will tempt them to prey upon the fortunate who in turn will retreat into gated communities exclusive clubs and private this and thats thereby widening domestic rifts and worsening our prospects for social cohesion and civility not a pretty picture adding leaves and flowers to stem and nclb wont necessarily avert it but hewing to basic skills at the expense of a complete education will surely worsen it mr finn and ms ravitch former assistant u s secretaries of education and members of the koret task force on k education at the hoover institution are editors of "beyond the basics achieving a liberal education for all children" thomas b fordham institute see related letters "letters to the editor dont undersell geeks when it comes to american competitiveness" wsj august
