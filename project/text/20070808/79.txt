markets gyrate as fed straddles inflation growth with investors seeking a sign that the federal reserve might be ready to help contain disarray in financial markets fed chairman ben bernanke walked a public fine line yesterday he acknowledged that credit market turmoil is darkening the economic outlook while reiterating that the central banks principal worry is inflation the feds policy committee unanimously voted to hold its target interest rate at the accompanying statement by including a recognition that the outlook for economic growth is weaker was a modification of the central banks recent solitary focus on inflation but it was a disappointment to those in financial markets who hoped the fed would more clearly hint at the possibility of a rate cut in the next few months responding to the market turmoil presents mr bernanke with perhaps his biggest challenge since taking office months ago hinting at a rate cut could have raised questions about his anti inflation credentials or allegations that the fed is too willing to bail out reckless investors a practice critics often attributed to mr bernankes predecessor alan greenspan but standing pat might have led some to question whether mr bernanke a former academic with little hands on market experience is so focused on inflation that he was blinded to the real risks posed by tightening markets turmoil in credit and stock markets had prompted wall street traders as recently as monday to place odds of a rate cut in september at the fed dashed those expectations though and the odds plunged to yesterday as indicated by futures contracts pricing the fed said its "predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected " as it also said in june that suggests a bias toward higher interest rates which can keep inflation in check as they damp spending by making borrowing more expensive but the fed added that "the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat" meaning it sees a slightly higher probability of weaker economic growth stock and bond markets initially sold off on the feds failure to more strongly hint at a rate cut but after subsequently gyrating throughout the afternoon the dow jones industrial average had recovered to finish up points at treasury bonds were little changed in recent months investors growing aversion to risk first made it harder for lower quality home buyers to borrow then for lower quality companies and more recently for some creditworthy borrowers stocks have careened wildly as investors try to assess the ultimate impact of tighter credit on the economy yesterdays fed statement addressed the need to show that inflation vigilance wont be abandoned rashly but that the central bank is aware of the broader danger a credit meltdown poses "financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses and the housing correction is ongoing " it said but the economy should still "expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy " measures of inflation that exclude food and energy have edged down the fed said but a "sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated " an identical description to its june statement that implies it would take one of two things for the fed to move to a neutral statement where the risks to growth and inflation are nearly in balance and thus level the odds of a rate cut or increase either evidence that the drop in inflation will be sustained or that there is greater risk to economic growth a third factor unmentioned in the statement could also trigger a rate cut a freeze up in the markets that would risk destabilizing the financial system threatening the solvency of otherwise healthy institutions only with time will the fed know if the strategy is on target a return of market confidence in coming weeks would vindicate its low key response a further deterioration in markets that deepens the housing slump could force a rapid shift in game plan perhaps even a rate cut with little warning today following a previously planned meeting between president bush and his economic advisers both the president and treasury secretary henry paulson will make public statements as they try to shore up public confidence in the economy amid the financial market turmoil when mr bernanke took office critics labeled him "helicopter ben" their literal interpretation of a speech in which he referred hypothetically to the academic notion of dropping money from helicopters to battle deflation they compared that to mr greenspans alleged predisposition to cut rates whenever markets got in trouble a notion labeled the "greenspan put " a "put option" protects an investor against loss in recent months mr bernankes anti inflation rhetoric has damped suspicions that he would be quick to sacrifice stable prices to put a floor under the markets after he told congress last month that a recent drop in inflation could be transitory goldman sachs economists commented that the fed chief and his colleagues "seem determined to either downplay good inflation news or raise the standard on what constitutes good news " "helicopter ben was supposed to mean the guy was ready to stimulate the economy at the drop of a hat " said james bianco president of bianco research llc a financial markets research firm mr bianco says he got mr bernanke wrong "now we have the biggest problem in credit markets at least since the general motors downgrade and he shows no signs of wavering on the inflation front " in fact some in the markets now worry he will err in his zeal to prove his toughness "i have been involved in financial markets most of my life and cannot recall these kinds of conditions before " said brian m barish president of cambiar investors llc a &# billion fund manager "i am fearful of a policy error where the fed may be overly concerned with headline inflation when it is a credit collapse that is the far greater risk here " several people who know mr bernanke say his policy wont be influenced in any noticeable way by a need to dispel an unflattering nickname "if there was a perception that credit market problems were going to lead to a contraction in output and declines in prices hed be inclined to lower rates " said mark gertler an economist at new york university who co authored papers with mr bernanke in the past but mr bernanke wouldnt ease interest rates to cushion the markets if he thought that doing so raised inflation risks later mr gertler said "the best way to maintain financial stability is to maintain price stability " he added "thats the lesson of the great depression " a subject mr bernanke studied intensively as an academic
