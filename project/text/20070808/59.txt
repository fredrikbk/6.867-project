gms pending olympic exit reshapes marketing arena after the beijing games sponsors likely will seek to cut more nimble deals general motors sent two big marketing messages this week when it said it would give up its sponsorship of the olympic games after beijing next year it needs to be nimble rather than locked up in long term obligations and it is continuing to pull away from traditional forms of advertising gms corporate sponsorship of the olympics including a prominent role in a two week network television advertising blitz was one of the most traditional and long term of all the auto makers decision will force the u s olympic committee to look for a new sponsor to replace that revenue and it is a serious blow to general electrics nbc universal whose broadcast and cable networks have exclusive tv rights for the olympic games in the u s they are losing one of their biggest olympic advertisers gm disclosed its decision to pull out of the usoc sponsorship which ends in december on monday yesterday a spokeswoman for the car maker revealed that it also wont renew its related agreement with the nbc networks to be the exclusive domestic auto advertiser on the olympics broadcast the move is the latest sign of how gm is aggressively rethinking its approach to marketing with tv viewers increasingly able to skip ads many big marketers are questioning the effectiveness of tv advertising gm struggling to turn around its business has a particular incentive to get the most bang for its buck "the media landscape has changed and our marketing strategy has changed " says ryndee carney a spokeswoman for the auto maker "we are looking for ways to be more flexible instead of entering into a year deal we need to be able to move faster because business is moving faster " the auto maker has been aggressively shifting ad dollars into nontraditional marketing sectors last year for example gms spending on tv ads fell to &# billion while its spending on internet banner ads and such rose to &# million according to tns media intelligence gms current olympic sponsorship deal struck in reflected a shift in approach for the u s olympic committee for the first time the usoc worked with the u s network televising the games at that point nbc to sign up companies looking for both olympic sponsorship and long term tv ad deals in a deal valued at the time at as much as &# billion over the year period gm became both the exclusive domestic auto advertiser on the olympic tv broadcast and got the right to use the olympic rings in gm ads and marketing and to host hospitality events at the games but the sponsorship didnt quite work out for gm ms carney says the auto maker found the usoc sponsorship valuable when the games were held in the u s during the salt lake city games for example gm arranged a big olympic marketing program involving local car dealers but the auto maker found it difficult to get as much out of the sponsorship when the games were held overseas she added gms departure will take a bite out of the usocs budget primarily used to train and support athletes the auto company a usoc backer since is paying an average of &# million a year to the committee between and about of the usocs annual budget "we greatly appreciate all that general motors has done in support of americas athletes for the past two decades " says usoc spokesman darryl seibel who added that the organization hasnt yet started searching for a replacement in part because gms contract isnt yet up nbc may be even more affected gm spent about &# million on ad time during each of the past few olympic broadcasts carried by nbc according to ad tracking service tns media intelligence that made gm routinely one of the largest advertisers during the broadcast offering up patriotic ad fare the auto maker also sponsored nbc produced vignettes on different athletes for a nightly feature called the "chevrolet olympic moments " a spokesman for nbc says "gm is signed on for beijing " but he declined to comment further nbc has the rights to the olympic broadcast through media buyers note that gm could still buy ad time on future olympic broadcasts ms carney said gm doesnt know "what is going to happen beyond " searching for a new sponsor in the auto category wont be easy for either the usoc or nbc given the business pressures on the auto industry particularly u s companies but the usoc isnt restricted to american sponsors among its foreign sponsors are electronics concerns lenovo and samsung according to the usoc branding experts say that could present an opportunity for foreign auto makers to jump in one possibility toyota which last year doubled the amount of money it spent on sponsorships according to ieg a sponsorship research firm owned by wpp group a spokesman for toyotas u s division declined to comment but signing up a replacement advertiser may also be complicated by the perception that future games the event is in vancouver and the summer games are in london wont draw the same attention as beijing the usocs mr seibel disputed that idea noting that one enticement for advertisers could be the prospect of a domestic games in chicago is considered a strong candidate to land the olympics that year stephanie kang contributed to this article
