fix pick pga championship online edition i love watching tiger woods play golf in the tournament before a major many times over the years he has been out of contention but shoots a very good score in the final round moving up the leaderboard in that pretty much meaningless tournament to garner a ho hum top "hey boys " he seems to be saying "just because i didnt win this one dont forget about me at the next major " tigers final round last week better than everyone else by at least two strokes in rainy and chilly conditions was such a round his bogey free round had a bit of a twist in the normal script in that tiger wasnt out of contention but wound up winning the bridgestone invitational lapping the elite field by eight strokes someone needs to page rory sabbatini and his bruised and battered ego mr sabbatini is on record as saying tiger is as "beatable as ever " yet he lost a one stroke saturday night lead and was bettered in that final round by a jaw dropping nine strokes so this years final major the pga championship is a foregone conclusion right tiger tiger tiger tiger hes looking for his fourth pga championship and is the defending champion not so fast in an earlier fix pick i talked of how quirky this year was setting up to be and with three first time winners zach johnson of iowa at the masters angel cabrera of argentina at the u s open and padraig harrington of ireland at the british it has been a quirky year no doubt if a first timer wins here it will be only the second time in years that first timers won all four majors this week the worlds greatest golfers gather in hot and steamy oklahoma at southern hills site of the u s open which was won by then first time major winner retief goosen but only after a couple of putts of less than two feet were missed on the final hole by the final group on sunday mr goosen won in a playoff the next day tiger failed to get a top at the open that year never fully recovering from a four over in the first round and finishing th and the par yard behemoth is full of doglegs that force players to play for position not just length for instance the th doglegs at about yards so most players will hit something less than a driver to that point leaving themselves a middle iron to the elevated and still tricky green the green has been redone since to take out some of the almost unplayable slope there are only two par fives on the course one almost unreachable by mere mortals in two strokes at yards and the second at yards reachable by almost everyone so the long ball isnt really needed to win here but at the same time the pga of america takes a more humane approach to rough rejecting the hack it out policy of the usga at the u s open so some players could be tempted to rip out some chest hairs toss them up to test the wind and go mano a golf courso if they get lucky with lies in the rough and openings to the green they might end up holding up the wannamaker trophy on sunday fairways and greens are still important at the pga but arent the obsession they need to be at the open but no matter what it should make for very watchable golf this weekend the question though is who will win and the fix pick is k j choi he missed the cut at the open but in an interview this week notes that he had recently come over from his native south korea and was adapting to life in the u s mr choi who would be a first time major winner and thus complete this years maiden voyage finished seventh at last years pga and has won twice on tour since june hes an almost quiet fifth on the money list he has the high ball flight required to win at southern hills and as a former weightlifter the strength to hold up the wannamaker trophy mr carroll is an editor at the print journal his golf game is in such a shape that if asked to hold up the wannamaker trophy he is sure he would bogey the presentation and drop the trophy on his feet write to him at tim carroll wsj com
