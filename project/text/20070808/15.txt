business bookshelf hard work and delta blues high cotton by gerard helferich counterpoint pages &# in karl marx stated that "without cotton there would be no modern industry " about this if only this he was right cotton drove the industrial revolution in both england and america in john henry hammond a u s senator famously declared that "cotton is king " is it still in a way yes or at least it remains a plentiful american crop a thriving sector of the commodity market a ubiquitous fiber in all sorts of products clothing being only one the object of huge government subsidies &# billion a year and a major export especially these days to china for gerard helferich though cotton is at the center of a regional identity and as he observes in "high cotton" often a tough way to earn a living "high cotton" is a portrait of life on the mississippi delta where mr helferich tells us of mississippis cotton crop is grown the delta itself is really a flood plain well north of the mouth of the river the books portraiture is devoted primarily to zack killebrew one of the regions cotton farmers and as it happens a cousin of mr helferichs wife mr killebrew is a small time operator mr helferich notes overseeing roughly acres of land much of it leased on short term contracts the regions big time operators are not farmers but "planters" who preside over yes still plantations a word that these days has overtones of corporate bigness more than antebellum grandeur without maudlin excess mr helferich is at pains to show that for mr killebrew and farmers like him there is a constant precariousness to existence the costs of diesel fuel fertilizer insurance and land seem to edge upward unrelentingly but the price of cotton has edged downward in the past years it is true that government subsidy helps to mitigate the punishments of price fluctuation but the profit margins are narrow enough to make survival a real question from season to season the great wild card is the weather drought can be irrigated against but storms and too much rain can be truly punishing wiping out crops or diminishing the quality of the cotton grade "no matter how diligent he is " mr helferich writes of mr killebrew "no matter how skillfully he applies what hes learned over three decades in the end his financial success or failure is largely subject to impersonal meteorological forces " naturally mr killebrew tries to manage his risk by selling "futures" locking in his cotton at a certain price or by buying options on the cotton of other farmers and he tries to carve out part of his acreage each season for soybeans corn and rice a cotton farmers version of diversifying his portfolio but no moment seems free of worry we see mr killebrew tooling around in his ford pickup truck his "mobile workshop" talking on the phone and on his two way radio conferring with consultants soil irrigation shuttling between fields and supervising his hired men it is true that mr killebrew is in a sense a manager producer and sometime speculator more than he is a husbandman in the old sense of the word but he still "savors the daily routine of working the land " mr helferich writes "the smell of the earth the sight of grass being plowed under " and we come to care immensely about his fate as mr helferich presents him mr killebrew is an exceedingly likable man he hunts talks shop with his fellow farmers over coffee prepares exquisite barbecue and raises his two sons and he works very hard the whole experience of cotton farming despite its vicissitudes is clearly for mr killebrew and for his neighbors a way of life the year mr helferich catalogs is the year of hurricane katrina we watch as mr killebrew having labored for months tracks the storm by television and grows more and more concerned about his crop katrina brings fierce rains but all seems well since they come when the cotton bolls are closed but just as the bolls open and their lint is exposed hurricane rita strikes mr killebrew his sons and his crewmen work for hours without rest to try to harvest what they can but in the end they cannot harvest enough to avoid a sizable debt to top things off bales of cotton catch fire when a machine overheats a mistake that costs mr killebrew an additional &# "this farmin just dont look good to me " mr killebrew says toward the end of mr helferichs evocative account his grief is almost palpable his two sons are having a tough time too "theyre taking it like a farmers supposed to take it " mr killebrew remarks yet as time passes somehow he muddles through when it is planting season again he fires up his tractor and heads out into the delta the tractor "pulls away across the flat waiting land towing its plow churning the pale mississippi earth and preparing it to receive the seed " mr morris is a writer in oxford miss
