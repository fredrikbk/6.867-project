business world terror insurance is here to stay buzz about terror threats comes and goes last month it turned up a notch as a result of a two page intelligence summary suggesting al qaeda might like to hit us throw in homeland security secretary mike chertoffs recent assertion that his "gut" signaled that an attack may be on its way whether such indicators are reliable forecasters of a terrorist attack those of cynical disposition may wish to notice their serendipitous timing for the latest congressional debate about whether to renew the "temporary" terrorism insurance program instituted after sept in the congressional handbook a "temporary" program is defined as any program on its way to becoming permanent barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee has been moving along a bill to extend the federal backstop for years expand it to cover unconventional terror weapons and increase the governments share of the total payout after an attack you read correctly six years after the attacks with the collective iq of the insurance industry having worked long and hard to understand and price the threat mr frank is proposing to increase rather than shrink the federal role swiss re the big international insurer that took the brunt of the world trade center losses issued a careful report six months after the attacks predicting it would be three to five years before the industry could stand on its own feet in covering terrorism risk swiss re is now among the virtually unanimous industry voices calling for a permanent federal program new york sen charles schumer for one claims that "uncertainty" over the programs fate is already disrupting real estate deals and construction projects you might have thought congresss last handiwork provided plenty of certainty engraving into law the programs sunset after this year you might also have thought that buildings are assets with useful lives measured in decades so project managers would have factored the subsidys demise into their calculations long ago and yet the urge to extend the program is not entirely what you think reflexive pork barrel simply because a constituency of lobbyists and campaign donors has grown up around it what should furrow the brow is the discovery of an insidiously rational new justification for the federal role in the terrorism market because it applies to every other insurance market the argument is two fold without a federal backstop private insurers worrying about an off the charts mega attack that might bankrupt their companies set their rates higher than many property owners think coverage is worth then a second factor enters washingtons presumptive habit of rushing in with aid after a disaster if property owners are deterred by high prices from buying coverage before the fact it only increases the cost to taxpayers of providing after the fact relief the good people at rand corp have tried to quantify this effect they conclude that the current backstop would actually save taxpayers money in the most likely terrorist scenario e g a modest truck bomb that does a few billion dollars in damage "if the government assumes more risk insurers would sell more policies covering conventional attacks which would mean fewer losses covered by the government " rands lloyd dixon told an audience in new york city recently but what if coverage were extended to "nonconventional" attacks nuclear biological chemical and radiological which insurers now exclude from policies rand says that doing so would be desirable but would also jack up the price prompting many property owners to go naked paradoxically taxpayers would be more on the hook for losses after a far more likely ordinary attack and insurers indeed have concluded that destructive megaplots on the scale of have become much less likely thanks to heightened international surveillance rands advice cover unconventional terrorism but make other adjustments to the program to reduce the risk to insurers and thereby optimize from taxpayers point of view the takeup of insurance by property owners bingo mr franks bill mandates coverage of unconventional attacks but cuts in half to &# million the damage trigger before federal money kicks in he also would impose a friendlier deductible allowing insurers more quickly to hand off the lions share of losses to washington you need not scour the high grass to find many who see a model here for a greater federal role in insuring against natural disasters hurricanes earthquakes and floods present exactly the same problem careful insurers limit their risk by setting rates high enough to guarantee their own survival even if hit with losses from say a year hurricane higher prices mean less insurance is bought by property owners so taxpayers get stuck with even more relief costs given the political imperative to be seen responding to human suffering on the cable news here its necessary to correct the careless lobbying of those who insist terrorism is simply "uninsurable " lets be clear the problem is that charging for such protection cant compete with free government disaster aid on the flip side property owners make a realistic gamble when they choose to go uncovered and count on washington to make them at least partially whole in the very unlikely event that they suffer terrorism losses all lines lead back to the same problem washingtons readiness in the case of massive televised misfortunes to redistribute to taxpayers the financial consequences of other peoples bad decisions or bad luck heres another thing you can take to the bank rands rational arguments for a permanent federal role in terrorism insurance will return as a rational argument for a greater federal role in insuring against all manner of natural disasters see related letter "letters to the editor insuring the unthinkable what government can and should do" wsj aug
