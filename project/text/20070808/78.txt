kazakhstan toughens oil project stance threat to fire eni group over delays rising costs aims to gain concessions astana kazakhstan ratcheting up the rhetoric over a cost overrun dispute at one of the worlds largest oil fields the prime minister of kazakhstan said his government might remove italys eni spa as operator of the project "we are very disappointed with the execution of this project " karim masimov said in an interview in the kazakh capital astana "if the operator cant resolve these problems then we dont exclude their possible replacement " mr masimovs comments signify intensifying brinkmanship ahead of a face off this week between the government and the eni led consortium developing the strategically important kashagan field oil industry observers and regional insiders have said kazakh authorities arent likely to take the extreme step of firing eni as operator because of the projects complexities but they will probably demand a bigger and possibly earlier take from revenue once seen as a significant new source of crude at a time of escalating global demand for oil and tightening supply kashagan has been dogged by holdups technical hitches and rising procurement costs an eni spokeswoman said the consortium is in contact with the kazakh authorities and is confident the issue will be successfully resolved "kashagan is a very important project that will be central to the kazakh economy and the world energy market for decades to come " she said "all members of the consortium are working together toward the success of the project " kazakhstans toughening stance toward foreign investors comes with resource nationalism on the rise in other oil rich nations such as venezuela and russia last year royal dutch shell plc was forced to sell a majority stake in its sakhalin energy project in russias far east to the state gas company after announcing its costs had doubled the growing assertiveness is in part a backlash against agreements reached in earlier decades when oil prices were low prompting countries to agree to less advantageous terms with oil companies and other investors some have suggested eni might share a fate similar to shell but many analysts note that kazakhstan still lacks the capacity to manage huge technically challenging operations like kashagan and so will probably have to make do with the current setup indeed mr masimov was careful to note that despite its quarrel with eni kazakhstan remains open for business "without foreign investment and the sanctity of contract kazakhstan cant develop " he said with declining production in traditional oil nations such as mexico venezuela and iran kazakhstan has been a rare bright spot in the global oil industry and one unusually welcoming to western oil majors kashagan the largest oil field outside the middle east by reserves was key to the central asian nations ambitions of tripling its oil output to three million barrels a day by the middle of the next decade making it one of the worlds top exporters of crude located in the kazakh section of the caspian sea kashagan was the biggest oil find in years when it was discovered in eni estimates its recoverable reserves at billion barrels roughly the same as the previous biggest discovery alaskas prudhoe bay in but the kashagan consortium which includes exxon mobil corp and conocophillips of the u s shell of the u k and the netherlands frances total sa the kazakh national oil company kazmunaigaz and inpex holdings inc of japan has encountered huge technical problems kashagans high pressure oil contains abnormally high levels of deadly hydrogen sulfide the shallow waters of the northern caspian a breeding ground for rare seals and beluga sturgeon freeze for nearly five months of the year eni originally said it would start pumping at kashagan in a deadline that slipped to then in february it was pushed back to the end of eni also increased the price tag for the first stage of the project to &# billion from &# billion it said it had underestimated kashagans scope saying the fields peak production would be million barrels a day in rather than million barrels in as previously thought it also blamed the weakening of the u s dollar and rising procurement costs the company presented its revised estimates to the kazakh government at the end of june last week mr masimov accused the consortium of breaching the terms of the contract that governs the project and threatened "appropriate measures " kazakh officials have claimed eni had raised the overall investment over the life of the year contract to &# billion from &# billion eni wont confirm those figures which have been greeted with some skepticism by analysts "when the costs increase by by thats one thing " mr masimov said in the interview "but when they rise by times either the planning was wrong or the execution is wrong or it was deliberate " kazakh anger is focused on the terms of the agreement that like shells deal in sakhalin allow the investors to recover their costs from kashagans revenue before they have to start sharing large proportions of their income with the government meanwhile because kazmunaigaz has an stake in the consortium which it acquired in the kazakhs will themselves be forced to come up with nearly one tenth of the additional investment "this means fewer schools fewer hospitals " said mr masimov "there is real discontent in society about what is happening "
