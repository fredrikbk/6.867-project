newfoundland in centuries old fishing villages like this one americans and europeans are taking advantage of a warming climate and a struggling regional economy to buy seaside summer homes for the

costantino the bulk of the new breed of seasonal newfoundlander bought property here after the sept terrorist attacks after the u s closed its airspace that morning planes crossing the atlantic were

them to consider coming back "it put us on the map " says albert hillier a real estate agent with years of experience selling homes in the area "i think people began to understand what were all about and word just spread " climate change is attracting some of the tourism the average temperature during the summers in newfoundland and labrador has increased by nearly four degrees fahrenheit over the

properties tend to be the places that are the farthest from the major canadian cities " not including a six hour ferry ride the drive between st johns the capital of newfoundland and montreal the closest major canadian city is miles direct flights from both the u s and london however have increased in recent years and that has helped to attract more americans and europeans on the islands west

flight from gatwick is faster than fighting city traffic to a cottage in the lake district and the units are a better deal than a traditional cottage on the irish coast in twillingate the influx is making some locals uneasy walter and shirley sharpe lifelong residents have even toyed with the idea of relocating to escape all the hubbub although there is virtually no crime in the area a couple of years ago ms sharpe for the first time began locking the door to their house when her husband wasnt home "you used to know everybody in town " mr sharpe said "now you dont who knows whos up around here anymore there could be criminals from the city who come to hide out " last year when ms sharpe was walking her dogs they approached a tourist who yelled at her to keep them away it was the first time anything like that had ever happened to her and in other towns not too far away some locals say americans have built some enormous homes that are utterly out of sync with the areas architecture and history the jump in demand for local real estate by foreigners as well as among mainland canadians comes as the province of newfoundland and labrador continues to endure a prolonged out migration in with fish stocks severely depleted on the grand banks the nutrient rich underwater plateaus where the gulf stream and the labrador current merge the canadian government imposed a moratorium on cod fishing the lifeblood of these communities for years in a single day jobs disappeared since then the population of canada has risen by while the population of newfoundland fell by the majority of the people who left the province were from rural fishing villages where populations have routinely shrunk by a third before the moratorium twillingate among the larger of these villages was home to people by its population was a loss of many people have headed west to work in the oil gas and mining industries mr costantino a thickset year old who used to own a paint store in wells maine splits his time now between florida and newfoundland he visited twillingate a few years ago after his wife heard about it from a girlhood friend and bought the house in the winter of hes impressed by the icebergs the whales and more than anything the people "i came up in june and the house is vacuumed the lawn is mowed " he says "you pull into your driveway with something to unload and there are five people there to help you " newfoundlanders attribute their hospitality to the remoteness and isolation of the island its the size of california with just two thirds the population of san francisco and the ruggedness of the land "people depend on each other here " says cal king who runs the harbor view restaurant up the road from mr costantinos home "weve been clinging to this rock for years this is our heritage its how we survived " mr costantino hopes that doesnt change "i was in wells before it got crowded " he says "then it got ruined all the snotty people came "
