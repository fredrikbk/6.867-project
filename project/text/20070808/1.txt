a left right divide exists even on issues as wonky as spectrum that liberals and conservatives disagree about budget deficits and foreign policy isnt a surprise but how can there be left right divides on wonky tech issues like radio frequency spectrum auctions quite easily judging from the recent controversy over what the fcc should do with the airwaves soon to be emptied by tv broadcasters as they shift from analog to digital transmissions last week the panel set guidelines for the auction of this spectrum known as mhz with potentially billions of dollars at stake the run up to that ruling was marked by intense lobbying not only by companies and trade groups with a direct interest in telecommunications but also by washington think tanks the latter were drawn to the battle because of the many ideological issues it raises how well do markets work all by themselves how much does government help or hurt when it tries to nudge the economy in a particular direction and should property rights be curbed for the public good and if so how the specific question before the fcc last week involved what conditions if any should be put on the spectrum before the bidding existing mobile phone companies like at&amp t and verizon along with their trade groups said that there should be no restrictions and that the auction winners should be able to do anything they want with the spectrum which is essentially the freedom cellphone companies have right now conservative groups in washington tended to take this side on the other hand a number of consumer groups and their liberal allies have little patience for the current mobile phone market and they wanted the fcc to require the winner to abide by a number of restrictions for example the winner would be required to sublease portions of the spectrum to other companies including potential competitors this would have probably resulted in lower bids and thus less tax revenue from the auction google was on this side of the debate so was the consumer electronics association even though its members include some of the mobile companies in the end the fcc split the difference giving the consumer groups two of the four restrictions they wanted whoever wins the auction will have to allow different uses of the spectrum and wont be able to prevent other companies devices from connecting to the networks one issue in the debate involved the state of the current u s mobile phone market and the left right debate over whether anything is broken and in need of government repair in the first place robert hahn who has worked with the conservative american enterprise institute said the current mobile phone market is competitive with mobile companies responsive to marketplace demands and unable to unilaterally set prices the other side said the u s mobile industry lags behind the industry overseas with american consumers having fewer choices both in terms of the sorts of phones they can buy and what they can do with a phone once they get it "twenty years after mobile phones were invented we are still asking can you hear me now " said art brodsky of public knowledge a consumer group involved in the discussion another divisive question involved the legitimacy of googles request that the auction rules be set to favor the search company googles defenders said that was necessary because mobile phone incumbents have an enormous incentive to overbid for the spectrum freezing out potential competitors the other side argued that if google saw value in the spectrum it should bid for it in an open market rather than work the political system to get special treatment and both sides invoked the iphone to support their views the telecom companies pointed to it as an example of the technical innovation made possible by the u s system their opponents noted that to use the device customers must lock into a two year contract with at&amp t the spectrum auction controversy isnt the last time an ostensibly technological disagreement will be the proxy for a bigger political debate next year the fcc will have to decide what to do with even more spectrum being cleared out by broadcasters many of the same consumer groups involved in the recent debate want the fcc to leave the spectrum unlicensed allowing anyone to do anything they want with it as long as the devices they use meet certain technical specifications thats the case with the spectrum now used for wi fi computing a market most of silicon valley would consider a great success but the nations broadcasters who own this spectrum are expected to oppose leaving it unlicensed so will many conservatives who say that if no one licenses the spectrum no one will have an incentive to spend the money needed to develop it properly "you are virtually certain to get more investment and more innovation when you have as strong a property regime as possible " says tom lenard of the conservative leaning progress and freedom foundation industries like broadcasters and mobile phone providers have historically been big political contributors in washington in recent years tech companies have learned to catch up now that the money from the two sides is canceling each other out perhaps the better ideas will win email me at lee gomes wsj com
