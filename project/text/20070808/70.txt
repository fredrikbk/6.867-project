inflation burdens grocery stocks after a spring fling wall street is now snubbing supermarket stocks robust sales at kroger co and safeway inc this spring helped convince investors that long costly efforts to remodel supermarkets and improve their wares are paying off that optimism sent shares to multiyear highs in stark contrast to a few years ago when many wondered whether traditional grocers would survive as aggressive discounters such as wal mart stores inc and costco wholesale corp expanded their food businesses doubts have resurfaced as both krogers and safeways second quarter earnings showed disappointing margins and the latter warned that weakness could persist into the second half supervalu inc the nations third largest grocer by revenue after wal mart and kroger and owner of the albertsons chain in late july said sales during the past few weeks slowed the news sent supervalus shares nearly lower on the day and shares of larger rivals kroger and safeway also dropped the chief culprit has been food inflation as harsh weather has increased prices for produce in addition surging demand for corn based ethanol for use as a gasoline additive has lifted the prices of items that are produced with the help of corn including meat and dairy products supermarkets typically arent able to pass on rising food prices to shoppers immediately and some fear the chains wont be able to pass these costs along any time soon if prices continue to rise as consumer spending slows "inflation is not going to be nearly as friendly as people thought " says bill bishop chairman of willard bishop llc a barrington ill grocery consultant there frequently has been an upside to food inflation for grocers and the main debate for grocery stocks is how soon or whether it will materialize margins are typically squeezed at the start of an inflationary period as grocers absorb spikes in commodity items to protect shoppers from "sticker shock" that might cause them to cut spending or defect to cheaper venues but once prices stabilize broad markups across the store increase profits and when wholesale prices begin to ease grocers typically delay easing their retail prices thus recovering from earlier margin losses grocers also can benefit during inflationary periods as cash strapped shoppers dine out less mr bishop notes and supermarkets have expanded and improved their private label offerings which carry higher margins and sell more when prices rise mr bishop says business overall typically slows as shoppers tighten purse strings or head to discounters pamela kipreos a mother of two in atlanta says she has been following her usual routine when food prices go up she makes shopping lists and sticks to them rather than "wandering the aisles " which can result in walking out with more items than she intended ms kipreos also looks for promotions on such items as chicken and milk and avoids bringing along her children but ms kipreos says this time she and her friends are taking it a step further rooting out bargains such items as ground beef and baby formula she says she has noticed that more of her friends have been shopping at discounters of late "if we find something on sale we buy it up for each other " ms kipreos says "its a tag team effort " such consumer behavior portends weaker sales and margins for grocers says andrew wolf an analyst at bb&amp t capital markets last month he cut his ratings on kroger and safeway to "hold" from "buy " in addition to weak second quarter margins mr wolf cites government data showing that wholesale prices accelerated their increases versus retail in the second quarter historically that means that gross margins will continue to suffer he says "the big question out there is whats wal mart going to do " mr wolf says a main worry is that wal mart will continue to cut prices this fall luring more grocery shoppers away from traditional supermarkets there has been some evidence that this is happening as the big discounter said june sales were stronger than expected and cited particularly brisk grocery sales a recent study by goldman sachs group inc found that wal mart has been cutting prices on more grocery items than last year and on more items than it had planned wal mart is likely to be more of a threat to some grocers than to others while kroger in recent years has focused on making operations more efficient in order to cut prices supervalus albertsons chain has lost some customers as it tried to protect its margins it isnt clear why sales have slowed at albertsons but some analysts say its prices are likely a factor safeway has remodeled about half of its stores to a "lifestyle" format that includes more attractive displays and lighting for its premium meat produce and deli items the strategy appears to be mimicking that of smaller upscale chains such as wegmans food markets inc in the northeast and publix super markets inc in the southeast says bonnie ulman president of haystack group an atlanta firm that specializes in marketing to women "these are the stores that will weather this slowdown better than some of the others " ms ulman says "its the middle of the road thats more susceptible to wal mart " sorting through the risks analysts disagree on whether grocery stocks are cheap as a group kroger safeway and supervalu are trading at about times wall streets profit forecasts for the year that is slightly above the standard &amp poors stock index and well above their historical average cibc world markets corp last week published a lengthy report that labeled as unwarranted "hysteria" the recent selloff in supermarket stocks analyst perry caicco said price gaps with wal mart have narrowed stores have been remodeled private label programs are stronger and grocers have become better merchants bulls also note that both wal mart and grocers alike have slowed store expansion which augurs well for the productivity and profitability of each store "the entire sector has suddenly been painted as an inflation ravaged industry with weakening sales and declining margins " mr caicco says he adds that great atlantic &amp pacific tea co and its acquisition target pathmark stores inc have also been unjustly hurt by worries about inflation still even grocery executives admit that the outlook is far from certain during a conference call with analysts in july kroger chief executive david dillon said he expects the chain will be able to eventually pass on higher food costs to its customers but he added that it is difficult to gauge whether and when shoppers intend to spend less or switch to lower priced goods "i dont think supermarkets as an industry are very good at measuring behavior change during these times of inflation or no inflation or other economic activities " mr dillon said
