backlash hits annuities tied to stock market wave of lawsuits take aim at sales practices suitability of equity indexed products equity indexed annuities are among the hottest products sold through seminars infomercials and free dinner events that target older adults with investment pitches now insurers that sell them are facing growing legal claims from investors and state regulators who allege that the companies or their agents are using deceptive marketing or targeting consumers who are too old to benefit from the products in the biggest such case the eighth u s circuit court of appeals in st louis last month upheld the class action status of a lawsuit that covers more than investors who bought equity indexed annuities from allianz life insurance co of north america a unit of munich based allianz se and the top seller of this type of annuity in the u s more than a dozen federal lawsuits against a number of insurers also are seeking class action status in courts across the country meanwhile attorneys general and regulators in illinois minnesota and california are pursuing claims against insurers selling the products "equity indexed annuities have emerged as the vehicle of choice for unscrupulous insurance agents " says roxanne rehm assistant general counsel for the florida department of financial services older investors she contends "dont realize theyre long term investments and once they realize they cant access the funds its usually too late " an equity indexed annuity as the name indicates is one whose performance is tied to the stock market a person invests a lump sum or makes a series of payments during a "deferral period" that is often five to six years and is guaranteed a minimum return based on changes in an equity index like the standard &amp poors stock index if stock prices rise returns can increase if stocks fall investors at worst realize no gains when the deferral period ends investors can take either a lump sum payment or "annuitize" the account meaning they would get a series of payments over a set period or for life the promise of potential gains and little downside risk has fueled sales of equity indexed annuities which climbed to &# billion in from &# billion just five years earlier according to advantage compendium ltd a consulting firm that tracks annuity data but critics say equity indexed annuities do in fact carry risks especially for older investors who may need access to their money before the investments term ends some of these annuities are structured to provide only a small portion of market index gains carry high surrender or early withdrawal charges for some of the more popular products that can last for much or all of a contracts term and often involve relatively rich sales commissions that regulators say can make it tough for consumers to get unbiased advice like some other types of annuities equity indexed annuities can be useful for investors seeking guaranteed income but equity indexed products also offer some potential for gains tied to the stock market its important for investors to understand such terms as how the interest will be calculated and if there are hidden penalties there is controversy whether equity indexed annuities are appropriate for older people because their money is typically locked up for several years some advisers suggest investors compare returns on equity indexed annuities with other products such as certificates of deposit which can yield around these days and variable annuities with guaranteed minimum income benefits which offer a similar downside safety net the big class action case against allianz centers on the marketing of so called immediate bonuses that are paid to people when they buy an annuity typically an amount between and plaintiffs say investors actually have to wait years for the money if they can get their hands on it at all allianz responds that the bonuses are immediate because their value is credited to investors accounts the day they buy the annuity meaning they can start earning interest based on a bonuss value right away in september michael altschul a year old sales representative in laguna niguel calif paid &# for an equity indexed annuity from allianz after hearing it described in a radio infomercial "the protection of principal was a huge draw for me " he says as was the &# bonus mr altschul says the agent who sold him the policy told him he could withdraw of his initial investment each year for years and then withdraw the balance but in june he noticed an online article about the allianz product he bought posted by a financial planner and realized he can withdraw a year only for the first five years although this would cut into his gains after that unless he annuitizes the balance for years he would lose the promised bonus and much of the interest his money could earn and could be subject to hefty surrender charges "that was news to me " he says an allianz spokesman says that privacy laws prevent the insurer from discussing mr altschuls individual situation but the materials the insurer provided "at the point of sale clearly explain the product " and the insurer encourages customers with concerns to "contact us so that we can conduct a thorough review " a lawsuit filed by illinois attorney general lisa madigan last year in sangamon county circuit court alleges that "deceptive" mailers sent to older people offering help with estate planning and medicare were used to schedule appointments with agents selling annuities for american investors life insurance co now part of aviva plc mary menges a year old retired nurse in collinsville ill says she responded to a postcard offering help in "understanding your money situation" two years ago and was persuaded to move her individual retirement account &# in mutual funds into an equity indexed annuity "i didnt know this was an insurance company at all " she says after her son learned about the move and explained the restrictions on withdrawals to her the mother and son wrote a letter to the company and also reported her experience to the attorney generals office she got her money back she says michael vaughan a kansas city mo attorney representing american investors says the company has "seen no evidence that this is a broad based issue " he declined to comment further the california department of insurance has taken a close look at allianzs marketing to older people specifically examining sales to people who were at least years old and who replaced existing annuities with equity indexed or immediate annuities elderly customers incurred new surrender charges in more than such cases from jan through july the department says in a regulatory filing allianz says age is only one of a number of factors involved in determining whether an annuity is appropriate for a customer and that its "business conduct was proper " insurers selling equity indexed annuities are starting to face challenges from securities regulators as well debate has raged for at least two years among securities regulators insurance departments and industry trade groups over who should have oversight so far the securities and exchange commission hasnt weighed in but it could deem the products securities if it chose to do so in december massachusettss top securities regulator secretary of the commonwealth william f galvin fined investors capital corp a unit of investors capital holdings ltd &# for allowing its representatives to use "unregistered investment advisory services to sell equity indexed annuities to unsuspecting elderly customers " steven preskenis investors capital corp s chief operating officer and general counsel said in a statement the company was pleased to resolve the issue and take part in restitution and it looked forward to working with state officials to improve "oversight understanding and education of these financial products " and joseph borg director of the alabama securities commission has found a new approach "if the agents are advising people to sell mutual funds or get out of k s they are acting as investment advisers and in my state being an unregistered investment adviser is a felony " in "dozens" of equity indexed annuity sales the state has investigated in the past few years he says insurers have "paid the money back plus interest " fair warning
