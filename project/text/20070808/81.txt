mexican firms answer call to give back more for a country with an estimated million poor people mexico appears to have its fair share of billionaires according to forbess latest count many of whom head some of the countrys biggest companies although a number of the oldest businesses have a long tradition of giving back it is only in recent years that the charitable activities of large and increasingly multinational corporations have been expanding and evolving economic and corporate growth escalating pressure from civil society and a change in business culture are encouraging companies to give more recent efforts illustrate a transition from mere philanthropic donations to private sector participation in the creation of development programs once the sole responsibility of the state built up around the latest buzz phrase corporate social responsibility "of course a lot of this is just public relations and for tax purposes " says barbara merz of harvard universitys global equity initiative however ms merz believes and others agree that a change toward increased corporate social responsibility also reflects a desire to expand the role of the private sector in social development well targeted initiatives some suggest also assist financial performance numbers are difficult to come by but according to corporate foundations and academics studying the field mexican companies are continuing to give more often in line with expanding revenue fundacion telmex is the social assistance arm of telefonos de mexico the fixed line telephone company that dominates mexicos

president in years who wasnt from the institutional revolutionary party or pri fundacion televisa president claudio gonzalez describes mr foxs election as a milestone in a decades long weakening of the states monopoly control over mexican society "what i believe we are seeing now is an adjustment to a system of control where other actors begin to have a wider participation " mr gonzalez says of the corporate sectors expanding social role "its a process first of getting your footing starting to grow and becoming more professional and efficient and continuing to take sensible steps forward " fundacion televisa has employees an annual budget of &# million and a massive media infrastructure that it uses to develop alliances between the corporate sector nongovernment organizations civil society and government institutions among its projects are a higher education scholarship program funded by the company members of the banking community universities and state governments as well as a project that has brought technology to schools with the help of "redondeo" funds where consumers can round up the amount of their purchases to the nearest peso and donate the difference to a development fund "televisa puts forth the idea million pesos for the fund and the communications campaign " mr gonzalez says "this is the way in which we convert seed funding from the foundation into a major educational technology or scholarship program " the media companys efforts in this regard are an example of how the mexican business community uses internal resources and private sector efficiency to advance socially responsible activities managers of corporate foundations insist their objective is helping the disadvantaged but their efforts also assist the companies image and bottom line "this is the only form through which all of this will become sustainable " says gerardo lozano a philanthropy specialist at the tecnologico de monterrey university "the companies programs are aligned more and more with their strategies trying to support the areas for which the company has an interest " effects of their activities on the environment and local communities also have led some companies to act mining company penoles a big silver producer is one example in recent years the firm has created community development programs in its mining towns to assist those affected by its

"in addition to bringing benefits to the interested parties we are somehow placing ourselves in a favorable situation of dialogue and exchange with our consumers " mr alaniz says "tomorrow this could turn into a competitive advantage " diana chavez who heads the mexico branch of united nations corporate responsibility body the global compact says corporate social responsibility has become a major theme of mexican business recently "today there exists a new consciousness " she says noting similar trends elsewhere nevertheless the advancement of corporate responsibility in mexico has a long way to go experts estimate that the percentages of corporate earnings given to social causes are significantly lower in mexico than in developed countries with lower levels of poverty and inequality one place for improvement is through the participation of small and medium enterprises for whom it is difficult to support their own foundation fundemex an organization created in has begun to accumulate donations from small businesses and turn them into community development programs tecnologico de monterreys mr lozano highlights another bottleneck "businesses want to involve themselves in social responsibility but there still is a lack of developed talent for this inside the business community " he says increased participation by wealthy families could also help mexican businesses are often inseparable from the families that control them and local billionaires could follow the lead of rockefellers carnegies and gates to the north telmex owner mr slim who owns a number of mexicos most profitable enterprises appears to be on such a course aside from fundacion telmex his efforts involve well endowed fundacion carso and a partnership announced in june with the clinton foundation for a
