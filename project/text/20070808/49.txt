fiscally fit the problem with family vacations terri tells why she tends to avoid extended family vacation trips online edition when my father in law gerald celebrated his th birthday this month he told my husband that all he wanted was to visit ireland one last time with his sons and their families my father in law longs to return home to county mayo to show his boys and grandchildren his family farm the home he built with his own hands and the village where he spent his youth unfortunately thats not likely to happen a family vacation to ireland wont work for my brother in law brian and his family a long plane trip isnt practical due to his young daughters neurological disorder and the familys steep medical bills leave little money left over for travel that leaves my husband gerry my son gerald and me a few years ago gerry urged me to spend some time online researching places we could go in ireland which led to the first reason weve resisted planning a family vacation my father in law rejected the idea of scheduling an itinerary "ill show you the real ireland not those tourist traps " he said my father in law also thought it was stupid to book a room at a scenic riverfront lodge id found when he had so many family members whod host us for free he insisted we simply buy the plane tickets and leave everything else to him that was a problem for gerry and me though we had different reasons i wouldnt call myself a control freak but ive had bad experiences in the past leaving vacation planning to others years ago during a family vacation with my mother her partner and his family i ruffled some feathers by choosing to stay in a more expensive hotel room than the one theyd booked what can i say im picky when it comes to where i sleep and there were hurt feelings when gerry gerald and i decided to spend one day visiting an attraction that the others thought was too pricey some felt gerry and i should have been more considerate of others who were on a tighter budget but it was after all our vacation and we felt that for at least one day we should have the choice of doing something we wanted to do regardless of what the others had planned looking back i should have made it clear before we traveled that my family might want to do some things on our own and looking ahead i know spending a day alone with my family doing what we want to do wont go over well with gerrys dad during a family vacation in ireland gerry wasnt so much worried about his father planning our trip as he was apprehensive about staying with family members instead of spending money on a hotel room gerrys always felt uncomfortable when staying at other peoples homes no matter how close we are to the homeowners we spent a week at one of my dearest friends home while on vacation when gerald was a toddler not to save on money but so we could spend as much time as possible together gerry couldnt relax and was constantly apologizing for imposing "next time we get a room " he said on the flight home so spending a week in the homes of people we barely knew in a foreign country no less wasnt his idea of a relaxing vacation and since it would be our family vacation theres our son gerald to consider the more gerrys father talked about what wed do in ireland the more it sounded like wed spend a week visiting his relatives and catching up with old friends gerry and i agreed gerald would most likely be bored and i dreaded the thought of having to listen to a week of my son complaining about having nothing to do gerry and i went over the pros and cons of visiting ireland as we do every year when his father brings it up but his dads recent throat cancer scare and the milestone of a th birthday has gerry feeling strongly about granting his wish we talked about ways to compromise and i briefly considered swallowing my concerns about the family vacation and going ahead with it then gerry suggested something wed never done take separate vacations hed accompany his dad to ireland for the week while gerald and i would spend the week doing something more age appropriate with our son it wasnt an easy decision gerry has only two weeks of paid vacation compared to the five weeks im allowed generally gerry uses one week of vacation time for us to get away together as a family and saves the remaining five days off for emergencies so if he goes to ireland with his dad we wont have our own family trip next year and its likely ill end up spending far more to vacation separately with gerald at an amusement park than if we went to ireland with my husband and his dad but gerry and i wanted to do what we thought was best for both geralds so we agreed to compromise for the first time in the years weve been married gerry and i will take separate vacations next year we knew we made the right decision as soon as we told gerrys father about our plan i know the two will have a fantastic time together exploring their roots and im comforted that my husband wont look back and regret that he never granted his fathers wish how do you avoid conflicts over scheduling and finances when you travel with your extended family how have separate vacations worked
