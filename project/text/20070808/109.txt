staff but will continue funding prime mortgages alt a mortgages are a category between prime and subprime that often involve borrowers who dont fully document their income or assets luminent mortgage capital inc which invests in residential mortgages and is based in san francisco said it had been hit by margin calls was canceling its second quarter dividend and was considering "strategic alternatives " ubs analyst omotayo okusanya said bankruptcy filings could be a likely outcome for these companies without additional funding impac and luminent didnt respond to requests for comment earlier this week american home mortgage investment corp based in melville n y filed for chapter bankruptcy court protection and in a new report riskmetrics group analyst zach gast says five of the biggest mortgage reits that are dependent on short term debt are at higher risk of failing because of the liquidity crisis the residential mortgage reits that often lend money like banks for people to buy homes are the reits struggling the most like all reits these publicly traded companies dont pay corporate income taxes as long as they pay out at least of their taxable income in dividends because of such payments some of these companies might not have enough cash on hand to weather the storm some real estate experts have questioned whether these companies should be structured as reits given that the cash crunch leaves some of them unable to make new loans or pay dividends "were learning that certain credit risk assets like mortgage loans probably dont belong in this structure to begin with " says matt howlett an analyst at investment bank fox pitt kelton residential mortgage reits that specialize in loan originations as opposed to those that simply invest in mortgages have been hit hardest by the credit squeeze here is why to offer the loans these companies relied on lines of credit provided by banks when these loans began to default banks initiated margin calls which happen when the reits collateral drops in value at that point banks require the reit to deliver additional collateral to pay for the decline in value banks have cut off the lines of credit for reits that arent able to fulfill these margin calls leaving them incapable of making new loans although all types of mortgage lenders have been faced with margin calls the situation is worse for mortgage reits because the need to pay dividends makes it difficult to have enough cash to meet margin calls thus for residential mortgage reits reliant on this type of credit "even if the market shuts down for a short period of time it can wipe that company out " says bose george an equity analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods in new york american home said in a statement that it had "substantial unpaid margin calls pending " the high levels of leverage some as high as a ratio of debt to total market capitalization held by some of the mortgage reits has contributed to the downward spiral of such companies in good times high rates of return on cash can be more easily achieved with higher leverage but when the markets take a turn for the worse leverage can magnify losses said david chiaverini an analyst at bmo capital markets what was surprising was how quickly some of these companies were wounded by this chain of events the soaring rate of defaults among subprime loans which are granted to borrowers who dont qualify for prime loans because of weak credit ratings or lack of assets became common knowledge in march by april subprime lender new century financial corp an irvine calif reit filed for chapter bankruptcy protection only in the past few weeks have real estate experts detected rising defaults in alt a loans with that american home which offers prime and alt a loans also blazed out
