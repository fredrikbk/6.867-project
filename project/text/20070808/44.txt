espn calls a do over on its online video site network plans more games live events on the internet argentinian polo anyone bristol conn espn has toyed with online video since before most americans knew what the internet was in the sports networks web site launched with a choppy slow to download image of oklahoma state basketball star bryant "big country" reeves breaking a backboard with a dunk but while all that experience with online video has helped build espn com into the countrys most popular sports web site the network hasnt been able to capture that same kind of success with its all video site espn com launched in to take advantage of the explosion in high speed internet connections in u s homes espn has suffered from a business model that has limited the number of users it can reach and a mix of programming that has made it hard to differentiate itself from espn com espn is expected to announce today that it will relaunch next month shifting it more toward live events from argentinian polo matches to national basketball association games to college football news conferences with the hope of eventually hosting those kinds of offerings hours a day espn executives found their fans "were having trouble sufficiently differentiating which service offered which content" when choosing between espn com and espn com according to john kosner the companys senior vice president and general manager for digital media after the mid september relaunch games and news conferences will be shown on espn smaller shorter packages of news highlights and analysis as well as archived shows will appear on espn com executives say espn will stream over live events in its first months mostly games after streaming in if suffered from a lack of a list programming before they hope a nearly tenfold jump in college basketball games to nearly along with a quintupling of its college football offerings to will win fans attention its success or failure should prove once and for all whether the walt disney co unit was ahead of its time in launching its video site so early or merely wrong about how fans want their games online or the way to make money off it from the beginning the video site has seen its share of growing pains dan flagler manager of online video content and programming for verizon communications inc called some of the sites earliest offerings "painful " while the programming has improved videos available recently have featured snippets of expert analysis something also found regularly on espn com as well as low demand libraries of the networks talking head shows like "around the horn " espn has carried a smattering of sporting events but they were often viewed by underwhelming five figure audiences at best an espn spokesman declined to reveal how many monthly video streams that users have viewed "weve been very pleased with the evolution of espn up to now " mr flagler says "the relaunch with the addition of more live sports content will build upon that success you cannot underestimate the value of putting live sports on the internet " for example cbs corp s streaming of the ncaa mens basketball tournament has been a huge hit with fans an unusual business model similar to how many cable tv networks operate also has likely limited its growth espn charges its internet service a monthly fee instead of recruiting individual subscribers to pay a fee for its content while it can claim at&amp t inc and verizon as customers major cable companies like time warner cable inc comcast corp and cox communications inc have balked at the idea of paying for a single service that not all of their web customers want "thats not a model were looking to take into the internet space " says a cox spokesman sports fans receiving high speed internet service from nonparticipating companies cannot view the site and many of the biggest cable companies show no signs of budging as a result espn reaches fewer than million households a total of million homes had high speed connections in the first quarter of according to jupiterresearch llc a division of mcg capital corp an espn spokesman declined to reveal what companies pay to get espn alone or as part of a suite of similar products from other disney brands such as abc news and the disney channel on espns campus here they like to compare to the companys first years as a cable network in the early s when skeptics questioned the viability of full time sports programming back then the network made its name with off beat sports like australian rules football the new espn will also depend on its fair share of quirk hoping to find many groups of small audiences to watch cricket rugby and polo espn executives admit that the six tv networks it produces games for already provide plenty of outlets for second tier sports but they view as an incubator for competitions americans arent hip to yet but while oddball sports initially won espn attention it really took off only after it married its irreverent brand to higher interest programming like major pro and college sports recent rights deals allow to put some bigger names on its marquee but theres a limit to how big or exclusive they can be espn doesnt have internet rights to its national football league games so for the major sports it will have to bank on fans looking for simultaneous coverage of nba college football and college basketball games already on espn networks as well as college games unavailable nationally espn has experimented on a much smaller scale in the past year plus supplementing its televised games with extra camera angles and other bonuses and streaming events like world cup soccer games that didnt make the cut for u s television early results are mixed when the tv feed from wimbledon was stuck with a boring tennis match featuring a bigger name this summer the savvy fan could go to espn and keep apace of any drama happening away from centre court but an online camera following david beckham around during his debut with major league soccers los angeles galaxy backfired when mr beckham barely played "wed have been better off going to posh cam " jokes jeff cravens espns vice president and general manager referring to mr beckhams pop diva wife victoria the new iteration of espn should also allow for some experimentation international soccer events have encouraged network executives their interest is particularly piqued by the response to games fed from other countries airing in spanish and other foreign languages mr cravens says of his soccer audience "its loyal and if we started to aggregate that over a couple of thousand events a year i think that theres value there " new game along with major college football and basketball the national basketball association and grand slam tennis events espn com will have its share of less mainstream sports programming including sports from other countries mexican pacific league baseball mexican college football venezuelan baseball argentinian polo international rugby college sports lacrosse baseball hockey other sports international and domestic soccer arena football open wheel auto racing
