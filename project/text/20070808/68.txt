how wild a ride can you handle three weeks ago stocks were soaring now anxiety is rattled by your recent stock market losses heres how to analyze your portfolios risk level and how to keep your investment cool gauging risk lets start with the obvious the more you have in stocks and stock funds the more you could lose in a market downdraft thats bad news for folks who have of their portfolio in stocks and good news for those who have say just invested yet even if you have just in stocks you could still find yourself unnerved by a stock market decline sure your bond market gains might offset any stock market losses but that can seem like scant comfort and you may fret endlessly over each losing investment this fretting can be especially bad if you own volatile stocks and stock funds so how volatile are your investments if you own funds check out two key measures "standard deviation" and "beta " you can find both statistics by looking up your funds at morningstar com your fund company may also offer one or both measures at its web site standard deviation tells you how much say a funds monthly return has varied from its average return over the past three years take a look at the accompanying chart which lists five of the countrys largest stock funds as you will see fidelity investments contrafund has an annualized standard deviation of percentage points while american funds investment company of america weighs in at just standard deviations have been low in recent years so these numbers arent a good guide to the absolute level of volatility but they are helpful for making comparisons if you own a fund that has a much higher standard deviation than competing funds or than the for vanguard groups standard &amp poors index fund the ride will likely be rough beta meanwhile measures how sensitive a funds performance is to market movements vanguards s&amp p fund has a beta of one meaning it performs in line with the market by contrast investment company of america has a beta of suggesting it may not gain as much as the s&amp p when shares are rising but it should lose less when stocks drop prefer individual stocks you can find the beta for each of your holdings by requesting a stock quote at moneycentral msn com but these numbers should simply confirm what your gut is already telling you if you own stocks and stock funds that have skyrocketed over the past few years youve got yourself some volatile stuff and that volatility could come back to haunt you calming nerves if you discover all your money is riding on a handful of high octane stocks you probably ought to revamp your portfolio within reason however theres nothing wrong with owning some wild and crazy investments gold stocks high yield junk bond funds emerging market stocks commodity funds microcap companies and international small cap stocks can all take terrifying dives but if you have just of your portfolio in each these investments may boost your portfolios long run performance while still leaving you with a relatively calm investment mix the reason when some of these investments are suffering others will likely be soaring all this of course assumes youre able to focus on your overall mix rather than agonizing over each investment if you find that tough to do try three strategies dont check your portfolio so frequently research suggests that the more often investors look at their results the more cautious they tend to be favor funds that give you broad market exposure you might for instance buy a lifecycle fund where you get a host of stocks and bonds in a single portfolio that way you will have exposure to risky sectors but all you will see is a single share price that performs relatively sedately whenever the market plunges whip out your checkbook and send &# or &# to your favorite stock fund that will turn the decline into an opportunity and youll feel a little better about your losses
