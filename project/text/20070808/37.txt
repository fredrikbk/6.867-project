common sense prognosis is good for energy stocks in the long term smartmoney could energy investments be the next casualty of tighter credit and lending standards with oil prices well exceeding &# a barrel that may seem a ridiculous question but in case you havent noticed energy stocks and especially limited partnerships have been getting battered the past week to cite a few examples suncor energy which i own was down over monday and is well off its recent intraday high of &# the kayne anderson energy limited partnerships one of which i own gyrated wildly monday before closing to lower even solid exxon mobil was trading more than lower after hitting an intraday high of &# on july this decline has been a boon to my strategy of selling calls on energy holdings a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price those calls are now so far out of the money that i can buy them back for pennies or just let them expire worthless keeping the cash i got when i sold them i find it curious that even though oil prices are a few dollars off their recent high of more than &# a barrel prices are actually higher than they were during the first week in july when i sold those calls why would energy stocks be cheaper with &# oil than they were with &# oil as usual with markets there is no way to know for sure clearly the psychology has changed some traders have said there is a tremendous amount of leverage built into the energy and commodity markets thanks to hedge funds and yield oriented partnerships now that the mortgage crisis has made "leverage" a bad word many of those big money investors are trying to deleverage by selling liquid energy stocks partnerships and funds such as those whose shares were plunging this week leverage magnifies the losses from even a modest decline in oil prices which in turn leads to margin calls and even more selling some of that was allegedly happening on monday there have been suspicions for some time that commodity oriented hedge funds by making big bets on oil and gas prices have been driving up oil prices and now the reverse may be true recent reports on last years collapse of the amaranth hedge fund which made huge and it turned out erroneous bets on natural gas prices concluded that amaranth tried but failed to manipulate the market in its favor i remember when the hunt brothers tried to corner the global silver market also unsuccessfully so i would discount the market power of any one hedge fund even if collectively they do account for much of the trading with recent projections that double digit annual increases in demand for oil will continue the long term case for higher oil prices seems unassailable that doesnt mean that prices wont gyrate and there may well be some excess leverage that needs to be wrung out now that investors have rediscovered the notion of risk for patient investors this means buying opportunities are likely to emerge james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
