big fans for fannie freddie some lawmakers see one time pariah firms as subprime salvation the mortgage market meltdown isnt over but it already has produced two clear winners fannie mae and freddie mac the nations biggest investors in home loans until recently politicians in washington were arguing about how best to rein in the two giant government sponsored companies both recovering from accounting scandals and lapses in financial controls now as worry about the housing market trumps accounting scruples the political debate has shifted to whether fannie and freddie need to grow even bigger to buy more loans and calm mortgage investors sen christopher dodd d conn chairman of the senate banking committee yesterday called on the companies regulator to consider raising the caps placed last year on the amount of mortgages and related securities fannie and freddie can hold as a way of ensuring that plenty of money is available to fund mortgage loans sen charles schumer d n y also called for higher caps both fannie and freddie are pushing for the same move a spokeswoman for their regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight or ofheo said the agency will respond to the senators shortly fannies shares gained to close at &# on the new york stock exchange yesterday while freddie was up to &# the two stocks have held steady over the past month amid anxiety over mortgage defaults while shares of countrywide financial corp the nations largest home mortgage lender have fallen fannie and freddie are benefiting because investors are still happy to buy the mortgage securities they create backed by loans purchased from lenders scattered across the country the two companies collect fees for guaranteeing the interest and principal payments on the loans backing those securities although fannie and freddie are private sector companies they were created by congress to funnel money into housing and investors assume that congress would bail them out in a crisis with loan defaults rising and house prices falling investors now are shunning at least temporarily mortgage securities packaged by wall street firms and others that dont have any implied backing from uncle sam that makes it hard for lenders to find buyers for loans that cant be sold to fannie and freddie regulations prevent them from buying loans of more than &# on single family homes and they have stricter standards on down payments and verification of income than were imposed by wall street during the housing boom the result is a spike in rates on some types of loans that cant be sold to fannie or freddie such as prime year fixed rate jumbo loans those above &# yesterday the average rate on such loans was according to a survey by financial publishers hsh associates thats percentage point higher than the average rate on "conforming" loans those that meet fannie and freddies standards typically over the past decade the premium paid for jumbo loans has been around to point even middle class people often pay &# to &# for a humdrum home in high cost areas so the higher rates on jumbo loans could be "devastating" for the housing market in some areas says michael menatian president of sanborn mortgage corp a mortgage bank in west hartford conn as lenders recoil from riskier types of mortgages "were turning a lot of people away now " says jeff lazerson chief executive of mortgage grader a mortgage broker in laguna niguel calif many investors hope that alarm over the housing market will induce ofheo to ease restraints on fannie and freddie but joshua rosner an analyst at the new york research boutique graham fisher &amp co describes as "mass delusion" the idea that they can save the day for investors exposed to billions of dollars of ill advised home loans now heading toward foreclosure for one thing he says ofheo has required fannie and freddie to follow stricter standards recently imposed by banking regulators in assessing borrowers ability to repay so they cant buy up loads of reckless loans to speculators or people failing to pay bills richard syron chief executive of freddie agrees that there are limits to what his company can do "neither we nor anyone else can buy at par loans that probably shouldnt have been made in the first place " he says mr syron says freddie can provide funding to refinance many subprime borrowers stuck with loans due to reset to sharply higher monthly payments but not most of them in addition he says freddie could help the market by buying and holding more mortgage securities packaged by wall street if the cap on its holdings rises fannie and freddie may be able to buy subprime mortgage securities at discounts that more than make up for the credit risk kenneth posner an analyst at morgan stanley said in a research note they also may be able to charge more for providing guarantees on securities sold to others he said "we cant imagine anyone complaining right now theres no other game in town " the flight of other investors from the mortgage market "does show the role and the need" for freddie and fannie to act as steady providers of mortgage funding mr syron says still he says freddie isnt gloating "you dont want to take a lot of joy in other peoples suffering "
