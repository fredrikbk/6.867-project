chaos theory in india a retailer finds key to success is clutter consumers like noise bins mr biyani says narrowing the aisles mumbai on a tour of one of his supermarkets kishore biyani notes that shopping carts are getting stuck in the narrow aisles wheat and lentils have spilled onto the floor black spots cover the onions and its difficult to hear above the constant in store announcements he grins and congratulates the store manager mr biyani years old has built a large business and a family fortune on the simple premise that in india chaos sells americans and europeans might like to shop in pristine and quiet stores where products are carefully arranged but when mr biyani tried that in western style supermarkets he opened in india six years ago too many customers walked down the wide aisles past neatly stocked shelves and out the door without buying mr biyani says he soon figured out what he was doing wrong shopping in such a sterile environment didnt appeal to the lower middle class shoppers he was targeting they were more comfortable in the tiny cramped stores often filled with haggling customers that typify indian shopping most indians buy their fresh produce from vendors who keep vegetables under burlap sacks so mr biyani redesigned his stores to make them messier noisier and more cramped "the shouting the untidiness the chaos is part of the design " he says as he surveys his mumbai store where he just spent around &# to replace long wide aisles with narrow crooked ones "making it chaotic is not easy " even the dirty black spotted onions serve a function for the average indian dusty and dirty produce means fresh from the farm he says indian shoppers also love to bargain mr biyani doesnt allow haggling but having damaged as well as good quality produce in the same box gives customers a chance to choose and think they are getting a better deal "they should get a sense of victory " he says the approach has made mr biyani rich his company pantaloon retail india ltd is now indias largest retailer it expects to report sales of more than &# million for the fiscal year ended in june he and his family own a stake in pantaloon valued at about &# million mr biyani is proving that modern retailing with a bit of spice can work in a country where traditional markets dominate on the back of his success and rushing to close his head start are some of the worlds largest retailers while few may subscribe to mr biyanis chaos theory of retail all will be struggling to find ways to attract the millions of indian consumers who are shopping at branded chain stores for the first time wal mart stores inc agreed this week to set up a joint venture with bharti enterprises ltd which runs indias largest cellular company that will open wholesale stores to sell goods to small retailers manufacturers and farmers in india bharti plans to spend &# billion to build a nationwide network of supermarkets and small stores wal mart has to use this route into india because indian regulations dont allow multiple brand retailers to sell directly to consumers but they can run wholesale operations and provide support to indian retailers tesco plc of the united kingdom and carrefour sa of france are also eyeing india petroleum refiner reliance industries ltd one of indias largest companies by market value plans to spend more than &# billion in the next five years to open thousands of supermarkets all are hoping to tap into the rampant consumer spending sweeping india amid fast economic growth indias total retail market is about &# billion a year and will expand more than in the next four years estimates technopak advisors a new delhi based retail consulting firm it says sales of branded chain stores now represent less than of total retail sales but are expected to grow more than five fold by accounting for of retail sales many more indian women are working today and dont have the time to visit several mom and pop stores "i cant go to different stores to get different things im a working mother " says candice dsouza a year old public relations firm manager who recently became a convert to mr biyanis big bazaar stores wealthy indians often employ servants who do most of the shopping many of mr biyanis unique touches are designed to make the household help rather than their employers feel comfortable shopping indeed he says that the greatest potential pool of customers for retail chains in india comes not from the wealthy but from those who work for them mr biyani divides indias billion people into three types of consumers "india one " as he calls them are those with good educations good jobs and much disposable income they also are the target audience for many foreign companies seeking to sell their wares here mr biyani estimates that such customers comprise about of the total population where he sees the greatest sales potential is among consumers he calls india two the drivers maids cooks nannies farmers and others who serve india one he estimates that of indians roughly million people fall into this category they are seeing their wages rise and their children frequently pursue further education and careers that will vault them up the social ladder india three he says is the rest of the nation those at or slightly above subsistence level who dont represent much of a market for modern retailers he thinks any retailer that tries to re create a western store in india will miss most potential customers "people like to do what they think works in the west " but india is different he says mr biyani has been studying indian consumers for more than years though many of his innovations are distinctly indian he credits icons of u s retailing as his inspiration his copy of wal mart founder sam waltons book "sam walton made in america" is battered from constant use from mr walton mr biyani says he learned how to "rewrite the rules" in retailing mr waltons photo hangs on his office wall below mother teresas he also has written his own autobiography called "it happened in india " in the s mr biyani left his family textile business to launch a business selling "stone washed" denim he started his own line of shirts and trousers at a time when few indians bought ready made garments and later opened clothing stores because he couldnt get others to carry his products when he decided to enter the supermarket business in his friends and executives told him india wasnt ready he thought otherwise food bazaar mr biyanis western style supermarket now has outlets in the country big bazaar which sells household goods and clothes and frequently is housed under the same roof as food bazaar has outlets mr biyani also has expanded into other businesses including restaurants bars property mall management media a private equity fund and a bowling alley all his businesses are loosely gathered under an umbrella company called the future group based in mumbai the big bazaar and food bazaar stores make up more than of the annual sales of pantaloon the main listed company in the group both big bazaar and food bazaar stores seek to invoke the atmosphere of a public market mr biyani says albeit in the air conditioned malls that are springing up around india the outlets have floors of gray granite tiling common in markets and train stations so newcomers who have never been in a large modern store feel at home instead of long aisles and tall shelves the stores cluster products in bins and on low shelves with long aisles he says "the customers never stopped they kept on walking on and on so we had to create blockages " the bins let customers handle products from different sides decades of shopping from stalls also means that most customers feel more comfortable looking down when they shop he says narrow winding aisles create small traffic jams that make people stop and look at products last month one of his first stores in mumbai changed from long straight aisles to the haphazard cluster design "sales are up since the change " mr biyani said as he struggled to walk through the knots of shoppers at the store indian consumers arent used to processed and packaged goods so the stores sell wheat rice lentils and other products out of large buckets housewives want to grab handfuls checking them out for pebbles quality and smell he says mr biyani tells his staff not to tidy up as he noticed that customers are less likely to check out a product if it is in neat stacks he scoops up a handful of plastic razors from a pile in a bin "when it is like this " he says "it feels like a good deal " because he says indians like to talk and consult and bicker as they buy the stores have up to three times the number of employees per square foot than a typical wal mart a few employees walk around the store using megaphones to announce promotions adding to the din from constant music and commercials playing in the background mr biyani doesnt want his stores to be quiet or relaxing many of the stores arent air conditioned on purpose the announcements and ads are done in indias many local languages to make non english speakers feel welcome "we advertise in the language that people dream in " says mr biyani who is proud he isnt one of the many business leaders in india who has lived or studied abroad though he speaks the language "i dont dream in english " he says mr biyanis chaos theory of retailing extends only so far when it comes to taking in money and making sure there are plenty of goods for customers to peruse his stores strive to be as efficient as any in the world they run software from german technology giant sap ag to find out when a new brand of noodle isnt selling well in bangalore or the supply of curds is running low in kolkata more than items are delivered using just in time inventory and the stores have large numbers of cashiers to ensure that the checkout process is fast not all his efforts to replicate the feel of a market have worked when thousands lined up in front of each of his big bazaar stores for an annual sale in he had to shut down stores early and call in the police to avoid rioting in bangalore the police forced the management of one big bazaar to extend the sale by one day to calm the angry crowd now his annual sales run for three days and he uses ropes to control the long lines the approach also has its limits mr biyanis department stores called pantaloon are aimed at wealthier indians who are likely to have either lived or traveled abroad and expect a different shopping experience there floors are scrubbed the air is cool and every item is carefully arranged on shelves as others now roll out their own supermarkets mr biyani says there is enough business for everyone but that it will take years for newcomers to catch up with him he also argues that india doesnt need foreign mass market retailers yet and is part of retail industry associations that support restrictions on foreign investment he says foreigners might dump products on india to gain market share and ruin indian retailers before they have a chance to grow he has voiced concerns about foreign companies taking profits out of india in the meantime he is taking his experiments into what indian consumers want into a different domain across mumbai on the site of a former milking shed is orchid city centre mall mr biyanis pantaloon retail owns the mall and manages most of the plus stores inside it is a petri dish to test new retail formats and adapt them for indian consumers it has the future groups own bookstore electronics childrens clothing plus size clothing home furnishing and drug stores as well as a video arcade food court gym beauty salon and banquet hall while he expects brisk demand for the banquet hall from weddings he has already figured out that his customers dont want &# coffee the gourmet coffee shop has shut down and stands empty while he thinks of something else to put in its place the biggest pull in the mall is still the chaotic big bazaar and food bazaar he put them on the top floor to force shoppers to see the rest of the mall when they come to buy rice it seems to be working the penthouse grocery store is packed and the mall is crawling with shoppers pushing grocery carts "nobody knows " what will sell until they try says mr biyani "we all have to discover by doing " tariq engineer
