heinz faces challenges keeping flow heinz shareholders may be able to squeeze more out of their investment in the ketchup giant but probably nothing like the run up they have seen since activist investor nelson peltz first began prodding the company to improve its performance shares of pittsburgh based h j heinz co are up almost since march when the company announced that mr peltz was seeking board seats mr peltz had acquired almost of heinz shares through his hedge fund company trian fund management lp in september he won two of the five board seats that he wanted one for himself and one for inov beverage co chairman michael weinstein the company has since done many of the things that mr peltz demanded such as boosting marketing spending decreasing supermarket promotions and cutting administrative costs per share earnings increased to &# and sales rose to &# billion in the fiscal year ended may but some analysts believe expectations for further improvement are already built into the stock price "i dont believe well see a spike like we saw in early because theres an expectation that the company will continue to improve " says sanford bernstein &amp co analyst alexia howard whose firm has provided noninvestment banking securities related services for heinz in the past months "from a fundamental perspective theyre doing fine but from an investment perspective i cant get excited " ms howard has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock and neither she nor her firm owns shares in heinz the stock is now trading a few dollars below its week high of &# in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange heinz shares fell cents to &# giving it a market value of about &# billion the stock is trading at almost times estimated per share earnings according to thomson financial slightly cheaper than other food companies shares of campbell soup co are trading at almost times expected earnings kellogg co at nearly and kraft foods inc at about of the heinz analysts surveyed by thomson financial seven rate the stock a hold five rate it a buy and two recommend that shareholders sell the coming year will be a test of heinzs ability to increase consumption of its namesake ketchup as it pumps more money into marketing and rolls out more new products than ever including garlic infused ketchup and roasted ore ida potatoes to encourage more people to eat ketchup with their burgers and fries the company is toying with the idea of putting images of that meal on its ketchup labels in april heinz started a web based advertising campaign calling for consumers to create their own television commercials featuring creative ways to use ketchup and during the july weekend heinz for the first time sponsored a hot dog eating contest on new yorks coney island one of the few ideas the company is quick to ascribe to mr peltz "the addition of peltz and weinstein should begin to show some benefit in the next to months " says peter jankovskis chief investment officer of quantitative products at oakbrook investments llc which has &# billion in assets and owns more than heinz shares "but if the company resorts to what was a prior pattern of management presenting a plan not showing results and then presenting a new plan the market will become disenchanted " investors will get an indication of whether the companys new initiatives are paying off aug that is when heinz reports financial results for the first quarter of fiscal david driscoll an analyst with citi investment research is confident that "the trends are going in the right direction theyve got a bunch of cost savings and theyre putting them back into the company in the form of marketing spending " mr driscoll recently upgraded his rating on the stock to a buy from hold his firm has an investment banking relationship with heinz and owns a small stake one risk is if the companys long struggling european business fails to build on recent improvements a new slate of managers has been installed in europe more money is being invested in the brands there and the business is starting to turn the corner the companys future also hinges on how well mr peltz and heinz chief executive william johnson continue to get along the two seem to have made up since the proxy battle of last year when heinz called mr peltz and his slate of board nominees a "self interested clique" and mr peltz referred to the companys "abysmal eight year record of value destruction " after the election votes were tallied last september mr johnson invited mr peltz to dine with him at downtown pittsburghs duquesne club a favorite haunt of heinz executives "we both said the past is the past and shook hands " mr peltz recalls "i hate to say this but i consider him a friend in the context of business " mr johnson says now that mr peltz is inside the companys tent it remains to be seen how effective he will be in pushing for change one sign of his influence could be the fate of heinzs european baby food business last year he pointed to heinzs plasmon baby food brand in italy and its abc soy sauce in indonesia as possible divestiture candidates and the company resisted the idea of parting with either abc has become heinzs most profitable business in asia but the baby food industry is undergoing consolidation with groupe danone sas recent announcement that it will acquire dutch maker numico nv and nestle sas plans to acquire gerber heinzs baby food business in its large italian market has been losing share to both numico and nestle according to sanford bernstein but mr johnson says the recent industry consolidation "confirms the value of heinzs global infant nutrition business " mr peltz through a spokeswoman declined to comment on the baby food business since he is now a member of the board
