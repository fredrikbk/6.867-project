same period a year earlier a state accredited safety testing center passed the amulet in the rudimentary tests required for cars sold in russia where price typically outweighs safety for budget minded consumers and the car remains on the road today chery contends that the test was biased the lab that conducted it is owned by russias biggest car maker oao avtovaz a major chery competitor chery officials were present during the test on april but at the time they didnt cite any specific deficiencies in the procedure a chery representative said this was because they were there only as observers and protocol precluded them from making comments he said the company strongly suspects that the test was part of a campaign of dirty tricks by competitors to discredit chinese made cars which pose an increasing threat to russias own enfeebled auto industry but he declined to give any details on how the test could have been rigged the lab russias biggest and a tester for a wide variety of vehicles says the presence of auto magazine avtorevu was "a guarantor" of the tests independence the magazine which paid the lab to conduct the test of the amulet rejected any claim of bias it said the test was " independent " and says it has no affiliation with any manufacturer among russias most respected car magazines avtorevu has conducted crash tests in its year history many of locally made cars not tested by governments elsewhere one of the worst performances a score of out of was recorded by an avtovaz model in at times the magazine has been scathing about the safety

said in its june issue the magazine said the test dummy became so entwined with the wreckage of the car that it had to be removed piece by piece out of a possible points the amulet got just "we have never seen such terrible deformation of a cars body " avtorevu reporter yury vetrov who observed the tests wrote in his article a month after the russian test chery had the amulet tested in china hiring the commercial arm of the u k governments vehicle certification agency to conduct the trial in its lab in shanghai the conditions were less demanding the cars speed was kilometers an hour the impact was full frontal rather than the more difficult angle the russian lab used there was an airbag unlike the model in russia and the crash barrier was less rigid than in the previous test the u k agency said the amulet met european safety standards in this test but a spokesman for the agency later stressed that the result applies only to the single car on that one day and didnt amount to an endorsement of the entire line the avtorevu article questioned the quality of the metal used in the amulet "where is the guarantee that the chinese have not cut costs on new models crafting the frames from low quality steel " in tests of the another chery model the qq and a very similar car the matiz subcompact from south koreas gm daewoo auto &amp technology co a unit of general motors corp

the day " mr klegon said italian auto maker fiat spa yesterday announced a joint venture with chery to produce alfa romeo and fiat brand cars for the chinese market fiat has been dissatisfied with the
