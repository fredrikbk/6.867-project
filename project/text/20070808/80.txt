me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q we have a subaru outback with miles four drivers including our two teenage sons share it as an errand and commuting car we use the lowest grade gasoline would switching to premium lift fuel economy enough to warrant the price differential barrett burns greenwich conn a i think you should stick with regular i have often heard higher octane fuels yield better fuel economy but have not seen a difference on the road at least not since my ford required premium to run properly modern vehicles with computer controlled ignition and fuel delivery systems make the most of regular grade gas switching to lower octane fuel can however cause a decrease in horsepower that a driver is more likely to notice than a change in fuel economy how about a little math the latest average price per gallon for regular gas is about &# compared with &# for premium according to the american automobile association generally the difference in price between the highest and lowest grades is about cents suppose your subaru travels miles on a gallon of fuel your fuel economy would have to improve by more than two miles per gallon to compensate for the higher cost of premium such a improvement is extremely unlikely from a switch in fuel grade or any other single change aimed at saving fuel while it may sound dull the most noticeable increases in fuel economy typically result from obeying speed limits especially on the highway q i recently purchased an infiniti g sport coupe with a manual transmission i had a manual on my previous car a mitsubishi gt and always believed the conventional wisdom that to get true "sports car" performance one had to have a manual however i must admit that i test drove the same car with an automatic prior to purchase and thought the automatic was significantly faster my question is has the performance on automatics improved to the point where they are now as fast as or faster than manuals how do professional drivers clock those blazingly fast speeds steven wilensky silver spring md a i have never been a fan of automatic transmissions because i think they leave the driver without enough to do so it is difficult for me to admit that automatics have developed to the point of shifting more efficiently than all but the most skilled drivers indeed automatic transmissions have long done a better job of shifting than the average driver who would have a hard time matching the zero to times recorded by test drivers speedy acceleration is sometimes accomplished through stressful use of the clutch and gearbox
