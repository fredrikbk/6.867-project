politics &amp economics delays hurt airlines capitol hill connections push to boost fees on corporate jets flags in congress washington canceled flights lengthy delays and heightened security concerns have turned air travel into a maddening experience for many fliers now the same problems are making life difficult for commercial airlines on capitol hill some legislators responding to an increasing volume of complaints from constituents are calling for a "passengers bill of rights" that could change the way carriers manage severe delays others want to prevent regulators from redesigning flight paths a move desired by airlines to cut delays at congested northeastern airports and for the first time in nearly years the department of transportation is considering new rules that would force airlines to pay more when they bump passengers from flights "the problem with airport delays is only getting worse " said rep mike thompson d calif who sponsored the passengers bill of rights in the house "fortunately congress is starting to pay attention " these and other head winds are threatening to interfere with one of the industrys biggest political battles of recent years getting corporate jets to shoulder more of the costs of running and upgrading the nations air traffic control system airlines generally have the backing of the white house and the federal aviation administration but congress is proving a tougher sell the issue will come to a head next month when lawmakers return and the current law funding the faa expires this week the transportation department reported that delays were among the highest they have been since record keeping began in only of airline flights were on time in june down from a year earlier complaints about airline service rose nearly that month compared with and the rate of mishandled luggage soared more aircraft are straining an outdated radar system and more passengers are crowding into planes "people are angry they feel like they have no control " said kate hanni a real estate broker who launched coalition for an airline passengers bill of rights last year after being stuck for hours on a texas runway ms hannis association hopes to park a mock plane in front of the capitol building next month and invite lawmakers to spend an hour sitting in it among other measures ms hanni is pushing to allow passengers to get off a plane after three hours on the tarmac thus far the air transport association the airline industrys main trade group in washington has been able to bat away some of these proposals arguing that a single standard would make matters worse for travelers airlines have developed their own contingency plans detailing the kind of nourishment temperature control and bathroom access they will provide during delays these moves have helped to forestall more severe congressional action meanwhile the faas changes to route designs are inching forward the agency says the department of transportation wont decide until late this year at the earliest whether to increase compensation for bumped passengers the industrys main lobby group however knows that pressure will increase if airport woes continue "anything related to delays gives congress a reason to want to become more interested " ata president james may said last week airlines are hoping to turn the gloomy state of the industry in their favor by arguing that things will get even worse if congress fails to steer &# billion to &# billion toward modernizing air traffic control in the next years the question is whether taxes and fees will be overhauled so that commercial airlines pay a lesser share and corporate jets pick up the slack the air traffic control system is now funded by user fees and ticket taxes paid by airlines and their passengers plus taxes on jet fuel that most aircraft pay other revenue comes from the general fund currently commercial carriers and their passengers provide over of the taxes that fund the system yet they consume closer to of the costs of running it the faa estimates general aviation which includes corporate jets and other private aircraft that dont necessarily use controlled airspace accounts for of total costs by the faas count but provides only of the taxes while the number of commercial airliners in the air is growing private jets are growing faster in years the faa predicts traffic at the nations busiest airports will be to higher than it is today the number of hours flown by general aviation pilots is expected to jump by airlines arguing for a change in how the system is funded have unleashed an advertising campaign steeped in class warfare in one animated internet video funded by the ata a corporate jet cuts in front of several airliners queued on a runway "coming through " it says "ive got a foursome here with an early tee time " a star of the ads is edna a blonde who says she loves "big wigs " but "not subsidizing them " in hearings on capitol hill faa administrator marion blakey noted that commercial carriers pay &# in fees and taxes for a flight from new york to los angeles but a corporate jet traveling the same route contributes only &# the aircraft owners and pilots association a group representing private fliers says commercial airliners consume much of air traffic controllers attention by jamming planes into overcrowded airports the leading senate bill to fund a new air traffic control system would narrow the funding gap an approach supported by airlines but the house transportation and infrastructure committees bill so far offers little change in funding formulas except for a slight increase in general aviation fuel taxes rep james oberstar d minn the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure panel says he is happy for private planes to "pay a little bit more" but adds that "i do not think that airlines should pay less " mr oberstar recently had a flight from duluth to minneapolis canceled because of mechanical problems
