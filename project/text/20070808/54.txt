ges jet engine dogfight with eye on its future company pushes for rival programs for new fighter the future of general electric co s fighter jet engine business is once again up in the air the defense department is squaring off with congress over whether a ge led team should continue to develop an engine for the u s militarys most sophisticated fighter plane the f joint strike fighter ge and its supporters in washington argue that a second engine is needed to a rival engine effort by pratt &amp whitney in order to create competition give the military a ready alternative and save money in the long run but the pentagon which is struggling to keep its development costs in check hopes to kill the ge program as part of a larger effort to save &# billion over the next six years both ge and pratt a unit of united technologies corp have been lobbying fiercely on opposite sides of the debate staying on as part of the program is particularly important for ge if it wants to be able to remain a viable competitor in the prestigious military engine business ge reaped &# billion in aviation sales to the u s military last year thats a small amount for the fairfield conn conglomerate and losing the business wouldnt have an immediate impact but the joint strike fighter being built by lockheed martin corp is likely to be the last major new fighter program this decade assuming a price of &# million per engine and significant international sales ge estimates it could stand to lose out on an estimated &# billion over three decades and its military jet engine business could fall behind significantly ges partner rolls royce plc wont disclose the revenue at stake "in our experience competition always benefits the customer by providing better products better service at a lower cost " said mark rhodes the top rolls royce executive with the ge rolls team ges efforts mark the new arithmetic defense contractors face in dealing with the pentagon which is dealing with budget pressures and rising expenses from the war in iraq in certain areas like jet engines and rockets the government has propped up competing efforts to spur greater efficiency and alternatives but that approach is falling out of favor leaving companies to fight for bigger slices of a slower growing pie the fight over the engine tests both the strength of ges argument and its political clout backing from the house of representatives and significant support from well positioned senators will help its effort but this second challenge in two years marks increasing pressure on the program last year congress gave a boost to the ge rolls royce team when it set aside &# million to pay for development of its engine for fiscal the house has lined up &# million to keep work on the second engine project going the senate is expected to take the issue up after the recess although thousands of joint strike fighters will be bought in the coming decades initial orders have been pared back in the face of budget pressures originally the u s planned to buy some planes but that number shrunk as development costs grew the government accountability office said in march that the pentagon could end up spending more than &# billion on the development and purchase of about jets through or roughly &# million per plane keeping them in the air will add an additional &# billion according to the gao pentagon officials say the reduced number of planes makes it less cost effective to keep funding two competing engines the air force which is buying the greatest number of the fighters and will get the first planes says it is confident that one engine maker can get the job done "recent experience with engine development indicates there is low operational risk to the warfighter with a single engine supplier " the air force said in a written response to questions despite that confidence some industry experts are concerned that the air force is forgoing future savings in order to cut back spending now "i think in the long term they cant afford not to do it " said jacques gansler a former undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics and a professor at the university of maryland the air force expects to buy jets the navy and marine corps together will buy jets that are either toughened up for the navys carrier duty or can take off in a short space and land vertically like the marine corps harrier jump jet deals from other countries for hundreds more jets are also in the offing from allies that play a critical role in the planes international supplier base a move to take advantage of the latest technology and hold costs down without competition say senate advocates for the second engine taxpayers and the military will be dependent on pratt &amp whitney referring to total cost estimates from ge that include international sales spares and other elements sen john warner called an exclusive contract "a &# billion monopoly " echoing that language russ sparks head of ges military engine business said "this is a &# billion market segment that theres never been a competition for " its supporters say no direct competition between the two was held momentum is on pratt &amp whitneys side the first joint strike fighter took to the skies in december under the power of a pratt engine it was designed to use the engine for the f which is made solely by pratt &amp whitney the government has "made its choice " said bill begert vice president of international programs with pratt &amp whitneys military engine division among pratt &amp whitneys supporters is sen joseph lieberman of connecticut who also counts ge headquarters in his state mr lieberman a member of the senate armed services committee along with mr warner says he is confident that sticking with pratt &amp whitney alone is the best course "the pentagon made a strong case to our committee that an alternate engine was not needed that it will add substantially to the cost of the jsf and may delay the program " he said in an emailed statement he added that the reduction in the number of expected airplanes makes it "less likely that we will recover the substantial up front investment in the alternate engine program " mr sparks of ge and his staff have handed out nearly copies of "the air force and the great engine war " by retired u s air force col robert drewes in the book published in col drewes examines the sparring between ge and pratt &amp whitney for air force fighter contracts and concludes having two competing engine designs saves money and guarantees the militarys readiness if one engine doesnt work out
