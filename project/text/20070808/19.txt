brocade ex ceo found guilty in backdating case criminal trial victory for u s likely to serve as model for prosecutors gregory reyes the former chief executive of brocade communications systems inc was convicted of securities fraud in the first criminal trial over the backdating of stock options the verdict in u s district court in san francisco was a major victory for the government and is expected to stoke the pursuit of other executives for backdating one of the prosecutors in mr reyess trial assistant u s attorney timothy p crudo is involved in deciding whether to bring criminal charges over backdated options at apple inc "to get a conviction with these facts which werent all that strong will encourage the government to continue prosecuting backdating cases " said phillip stern a chicago lawyer and former enforcement official with the securities and exchange commission some companies have come under federal investigation for backdating and about executives have lost their jobs as companies conducted internal probes mr reyes was convicted on counts including fraud falsified accounting conspiracy and filing false financial statements after the verdict was read his wife sobbed as did some jurors mr reyes hugged his wife and members of his defense team before checking in with federal probation officers mr reyess lawyer richard marmaro issued a statement saying his client was innocent "we are confident he will ultimately be exonerated at all times he acted in the best interests of the employees and shareholders of brocade " mr marmaro said the trial in which jurors heard five weeks of testimony was closely watched by executives lawyers and other corporations caught up in the options scandal kevin ryan the former u s attorney in san francisco who filed the reyes indictment said mr reyess conviction is sure to "invigorate" the prosecution of backdating cases about half of which are in the san francisco office "now we have some guidelines the standard has been set " he said mr ryan said there was "keen interest" by his former bosses at the department of justice in washington in the brocade indictment and other backdating cases he said he briefed former deputy u s attorney general paul mcnulty on his decision to pursue the case and gave mr reyess attorney mr marmaro several chances to explain his theory of his clients behavior mr reyes who faces up to years in prison was accused of defrauding brocade shareholders between and by conspiring to alter the grant dates of stock options awarded to employees and of falsifying documents including the companys financial statements to cover up the scheme the company based in san jose is a data storage networking firm a stock option gives its holder the right to buy shares at a future date at a fixed price usually the market price on the date of the grant if the stock later rises the recipient can cash in the option for a profit by backdating a grant to a prior date when the price was lower the awards value increases and the option is instantly "in the money " during the trial the defense didnt contest that stock options were backdated at brocade mr marmaro termed them "periodic look backs " he conceded the options were improperly accounted for because they werent recognized as compensation expenses in brocades financial statements as accounting rules required at issue was whether mr reyes understood that what the company was doing was wrong the prosecution maintained that mr reyes engaged in a conspiracy with stephanie jensen brocades former head of human resources to backdate options to recruit and retain employees and then repeatedly falsified meeting minutes to hide the practice from accountants and ultimately investors the prosecution called as witnesses several former human resources employees who described how they selected earlier option grant dates and prepared phony minutes of options granting meetings that mr reyes later signed several employees testified they felt uncomfortable with the practice ms jensen also faces criminal fraud charges and will be tried separately although no trial date has been set the government also claimed that mr reyes later lied about the backdating practice to a law firm brocade used to review its options granting procedures prosecutors argued that mr reyes understood that "in the money" options should be expensed and introduced into evidence a email in which he wrote "its illegal to backdate options grants " despite this knowledge they said he signed financial statements including annual reports falsely stating that the options were granted at "fair market value " meaning they werent in the money "amazingly in this case the defense seems to have gone to extraordinary lengths to cast doubt on the veracity of the defendants own certification " assistant u s attorney adam a reeves said in his closing argument "that defense is the corporate equivalent of the dog ate my homework " mr marmaro said in his closing argument that mr reyes was "a sales guy" with no background in accounting and that brocade was no different from many other companies that engaged in options backdating "that accounting opinion that was at the heart of this case was indeed widely and in good faith misrepresented or misinterpreted and misapplied by hundreds of companies " he said mr marmaro also argued that "in the money" options are noncash expenses and therefore arent of concern to investors and he noted that mr reyes never granted any backdated options to himself "this is not a case of a ceo lining his own pockets " mr marmaro said he argued that mr reyes only wanted to retain good employees and had no intention of defrauding shareholders mr reyes is the latest in a series of white collar defendants to be convicted of fraud after arguing they were too busy and had too many responsibilities to realize what they were doing wrong "the jury isnt going to sit there and buy that somebody was just too busy to know what his job is and points the finger at others " says mr stern adds c hunter wiggins a former sec lawyer who now practices with a private firm in chicago "that story line only works in legally gray areas concerning hypertechnical accounting rules " u s district court judge charles breyer scheduled mr reyes sentencing for nov the judge who said he would consider routine motions for a retrial this month has wide latitude in punishing mr reyes former prosecutors said he can decide for example that all crimes for which mr reyes was convicted stemmed from the same scheme thus reducing possible prison time the judge can also opt for leniency for mr reyes based on his own interpretation of the evidence at trial said bill leone a denver lawyer and former u s attorney there though judge breyer ruling last friday refused to grant mr reyess request to dismiss the case the judge did express doubts after the prosecution rested its case about whether mr reyes knew he was violating any laws to date executives at eight companies have been charged with criminal offenses related to backdating seven have pleaded guilty one has fled to namibia and is fighting extradition to the u s the government has recently closed some of the investigations it opened without taking action mr reyes still faces civil charges filed by the sec on may brocade agreed to pay the sec &# million to
