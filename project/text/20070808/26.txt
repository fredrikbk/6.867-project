cities wi fi push hits snags the rollout of minneapoliss wireless fidelity or wi fi network a complex and wide ranging orchestra of radios strung together to provide wireless internet access was impeded by the simplest of things leaves the constant and random swaying of foliage in the tree heavy city wreaked havoc on wi fi signal traffic "wi fi and trees dont get along very well " said joe caldwell chief executive of usi wireless and founder of parent company us internet corp of minnetonka minn "i dont think we had a full grasp on the problem we knew the tree problem was bad but i dont think we had an idea of how bad it was " as a result usi wireless the company building and operating the network for the city had to increase the number of radios and access points as well as put them in specially mounted poles to get around the large number of trees it increased deployment costs by as much as a quarter the leaf problem is but one of the issues facing cities that want blanket wi fi coverage other hurdles include spotty reception and an unproven business model local governments view municipal wi fi networks as a potential boon to their coffers but instead have met with hiccups the difficulties should serve as a warning to companies such as google inc and earthlink inc that are looking to offer larger scale service to major cities "the whole thing starts off with the issue about how youre going to run the economics of the network " said ken dulaney an analyst for research firm gartner inc "the ones who try to put in the network as a service to their constituents generally find its not a good thing to do " hundreds of cities around the u s have deployed or plan to deploy wi fi networks in hopes that it will generate revenue and provide internet service to residents and government workers in the field cities initially took it upon themselves to build their own networks but have reached out to third parties to shoulder the financial burden by building and operating the networks "basically it becomes a competitive thing " said selina lo chief executive of ruckus wireless inc which makes wi fi modems that amplify weak signals "its so visible that if youre not doing it something is wrong " both the cities and the companies building the networks have encountered a number of problems such as leaves that have complicated the buildouts and some critics believe there are unrealistic expectations about their potential return on investment "there are technical challenges no ones really built this network before " said esme vos founder of muniwireless com a blog dedicated to public wi fi adding that miscalculations about how much network equipment is needed have led to higher costs hartford conn is planning to provide free wi fi service to residents it was one of the first projects for the citys chief information officer eric jackson who is responsible for hartfords technology needs and infrastructure wi fi is designed to provide internet access to a limited range either indoors or outdoors but not both the signals have difficulty going through walls and other obstructions "theres an unrealistic expectation that it will penetrate into peoples homes " mr jackson said adding that even after all the citys work "there are still some real issues with it " in order to increase reception the city bought ruckus wireless modems and installed them in homes that couldnt pick up the wi fi signals on their own the city has spent &# million on building a network in the downtown area and in one of its neighborhoods mr jackson said he plans to spend a total of &# million on the entire city which includes another neighborhoods he expects to save money through better planning and purchasing as well as selectively placing access points where the need is greatest he added he wasnt planning to add more ruckus modems which ate into the budget hartford is embracing more of a collaborative model than other cities as it works with providers such as at&amp t inc and comcast corp rather than compete against them as a result there are no plans to charge its residents for the service instead mr jackson sees the creation of a city web portal for services and content that can be used to generate a return on their investment down the line specific portals for children adults and senior citizens could be created mimicking time warner inc s aol "thats where i think the real money is in terms of value " he said "its content not transport " usi wireless hopes to generate revenue through a more traditional way the company operates the network and minneapolis acts as the "anchor tenant" to guarantee the company at least one steady customer it runs both a network dedicated to public safety as well as a more general network for public works employees city officials and consumers it offers wireless internet access with minimum connection speeds depending on how far the home is away from an access point the network covers about a quarter of the city mr caldwell said customers have been dropping their traditional wire line high speed internet connection for his service the company expects to complete the buildout in november it is unclear whether the business will be profitable the service has been available for five weeks mr caldwell said he sees the network turning a profit within two years
