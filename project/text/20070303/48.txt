pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies youtube youth can film survive the new generation now that the oscars are behind us we can get back to worrying about the future of movies last week brought one straw in what threatens to become a gale a spate of stories on the web and tv about chinese kids being sent to boot camps designed to cure them of internet addiction their lives are supposedly being devoured by online games the coverage was pretty silly what with solemn discussions of cure rates one figure was and campers who turned out to be rich spoiled and media savvy in more ways than one some of them sounded pleased to be suffering from such a cool new disease still the stories themselves qualify as a symptom kids are ditching traditional forms of entertainment especially theatrical films in favor of digital media and theyve got hollywood scared stiff just how scared was the subject of a recent article that ran in variety under the headline "invasion of the techie tots " the piece cited several converging trends the allure of web sites videogames ipods and the like a dramatic growth in the popularity of electronic toys and slipping sales of the plush toys and action figures that have long been mainstays of studio profits and have sent kids back to movies for repeat viewings it also invoked a marketing acronym that pulls together the whole kid and caboodle in four letters kgoy or "kids getting older younger " but techie tots if thats what our children are becoming pose a conundrum that varietys article never quite articulated no one has a handle on how they think not only how they think about toys as expressed in what the toy trade calls play patterns but how these junior multitaskers are taking in the world around them in decades past children made a predictable progression from the intrigue and suspense the "what happens next " factor of bedtime stories through the mixed blessings of tv to the revealed delights of narrative fiction on big screens thats no longer the case at ever earlier stages in their development kids are besieged by digital entertainments that divide their attention and shrink its span not because the people who purvey such stuff are evil or even cynical but because theyre genuinely baffled by whats going on in kids heads so they opt for the seemingly safe strategy of fragmentation and miniaturization a grazing menu of electronic tapas that leaves the grazers hungry yet eager for more of the same where does that leave the people who make movies variety reports that studios are already wary of committing huge budgets to supposed blockbusters aimed at kids whose tastes seem ever more unpredictable and those are kids whove already acquired the movie habit what if the techie tots come into their filmgoing years with no interest in sitting still for films whats at risk is nothing less than the mediums future these are hardly cheering thoughts to be thinking in the wake of the oscars yet the oscars were a reminder that wonderful movies are still being made movies that not only entertain us but enrich us by deepening our understanding of to borrow a title from the cream of the current crop the lives of others those of us who grew up loving motion pictures may have no direct influence on the mediums evolution market forces and the inexorable march of technology will determine whats going to be seen on what sorts of screens in what settings still we can help to assure the continued existence of a receptive audience by infecting our children and grandchildren with the movie bug doing so effectively though means knowing which battles cant be won and which ones neednt be fought video ipods and other dazzling gizmos are here to stay so are videogames which can be engaging and challenging as well as benumbing and the enemy is not the web per se where oases of creativity coexist with vast reaches of trash and gibberish i recently found on youtube a new cartoon that any kid would love a three minute masters thesis animation called "kiwi" to find it search for "kiwi" on youtube com it concerns a flightless bird with a flight wish and its packed with poetry feeling and humor the enemy in whatever medium is incoherence along with its partner in crime indiscriminateness in this fevered media environment kids need not only to be restricted in their access to commercial junk but exposed to what will delight and nourish them first to childrens literature and then to our endlessly rich heritage of motion pictures exposing them is all we can do what happens next must be an article of faith im certainly a congregant though i believe the same lures that hooked me on movies as a kid the spectacle the mystery the roiling emotions and the suspense about what happens next can hold their own against whatever enticements the new media may serve up first though our techie tots must see the flickering light morgensterns picks gems for kids many fine films for kids are widely known the best of disney animation the best of pixars output plus live action features such as "the black stallion " in case youve forgotten though here are three others the adventures of robin hood how did they do what they did in this film almost years ago without digital effects they began by hiring the pre eminent swashbuckler of his time errol flynn after thinking of giving the role to james cagney and choosing the reliable michael curtiz to direct a dream cast that included olivia de havilland basil rathbone and claude rains then they shot it in technicolor the all but unfading three strip process that still looks glorious to our eyes imagine what those hues looked like to a kid with an unjaded eye and brain a little princess before the ascension of three mexican directors alfonso cuaron alejandro gonzalez inarritu and guillermo del toro to their rightful place of prominence mr cuaron directed "a little princess " a lovely adaptation of the frances hodgson burnett novel sara the young heroine who suffers severe reversals of fortune at a private boarding school after her father goes off to war is played by liesel matthews and the schools hateful headmistress miss minchen by eleanor bron the sumptuous cinematography is the work of emmanuel lubezki who worked his magic most recently for "children of men " modern times why not the charlie chaplin silent classic almost silent classic is a perfect way to initiate kids into the wonders of movie comedy you neednt breathe a word about it being socially significant or reveal at least for now that parts of the film derived from rene clairs "a nous la liberte " which came five years before it and that chaplins take on industrial society in "modern times" has inspired countless films that came after it just tell the kids its a love story theyll understand
