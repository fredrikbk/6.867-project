pursuits food &amp drink drinks mmmmm warm flat beer brewers tap thirst for british cask ales the drink bartenders fear when kegs explode to the list of british imports that includes fish and chips and the beatles you can now add flat beer microbrewers have tried everything from chili pepper beer to raisin flavored beer to lure drinkers from mass market brews like bud and coors now theyre trying their hand at a british staple cask beer that is only lightly carbonated and served via a retro hand pump u s bars in addition to serving american cask are increasingly stocking english brands this comes as more brits are shunning these traditional ales in favor of u s style beers for some beer geeks casks are considered a more honest drink they are served at between and degrees fahrenheit compared with near freezing for keg beer because cold numbs your taste buds cask beer has a fuller flavor if youre drinking a cask pale ale for example cask comes in the same range of styles as regular beer the bitter hops flavor is even more intense than with a normal pale ale but for those accustomed to u s beers like coors or even heartier microbrews cask ale can be too harsh it can also be hard to swallow for bartenders while a standard keg takes just a few seconds to tap serving cask is far trickier after it comes in the door it can take several days to get the brew flowing thanks to a series of waiting periods required to let the beer settle to tap it bartenders have to slam a plastic pin through a cork stopper using a rubber mallet this can be perilous at titanic brewery &amp restaurant a coral gables fla brewpub a brewer had to go to the hospital after striking his finger with a mallet during tapping cornwalls in boston says it stopped serving cask because its barrels kept blowing up spewing sweet rodent attracting liquid all over the floor mark posada co manager of dublin sports pub &amp grill in dublin calif says repeatedly pulling down the hand pump gave him "a little workout " there was no love lost when the bar decided to stop selling casks a year ago "i dont miss pouring them one bit " says mr posada andrew hanson a systems administrator in san diego grew up in the pacific northwest drinking six pack cans of rainier and olympia his first sip of cask a year ago at a local beer bar didnt go well "it was instinct not to drink it " he says cask beer and regular beer begin their lives the same way malted barley is heated in water flavored with hops then yeast is added creating alcohol and carbon dioxide bubbles but unlike most beers which ferment at the brewery cask beers sometimes called "real ale" or "cask conditioned ale" are put in casks called "firkins " before theyre finished and continue to ferment on the way to the bar with keg beer brewers add extra carbon dioxide to provide more fizz cask which has a similar alcohol content and price to other microbrews is served only on tap there are hundreds of different cask beers mostly from the u s and england despite its unusual taste or perhaps because of it cask beer is taking root in the u s b united international inc a redding conn importer now sells cask ales to bars in states twice the number in brooklyn brewery in brooklyn n y made gallons of cask ale last year more than triple the figure five years ago while casks are slowly finding a home among die hards here the beer is losing ground in england to the colder fizzier beers popular in the u s thats because of changing tastes and a shift in the ownership of bars most are now run not by breweries but by bar companies that are focused on the bottom line cask beer requires more labor and is prone to spoilage cask ales were just of the british beer market in by volume compared with a decade ago according to the british beer and pub association most cask beer is part of the so called craft beer segment which accounts for only about of the u s beer market by volume but has grown by about annually over the past three years meanwhile domestic noncraft beer brews like budweiser slipped to just under of the beer market last year from just over in according to the brewers association on a recent afternoon at the ginger man in new york manager dave urbanos knelt behind the bar with a black rubber mallet cocked his arm and with a few swift swings smashed a t shaped line into a small hole on the top of the metal cask but the cask had actually been rolled into place the day before to give the leftover yeast and sediment a chance to rest before the beer was tapped about four hours before the tapping mr urbanos "vented" the beer to release excess gas because this too disturbed the brew another rest was required once tapped the beer came out looking like a pint of pond water so more settling time was needed "im not going to serve this to a customer for at least a few hours " mr urbanos said cask ales after they are opened last only a few days to a few weeks because cask is a delicate beer brewers only sell it to select bars brooklyn brewery doesnt list cask on its product sheets and even sales representatives arent allowed to sell it if a bar requests brooklyn cask it has to talk directly with brewmaster garrett oliver it also has to have an employee willing to take care of the beer from tapping it to flushing the lines to get rid of the live yeast after closing "if i offer training and they dont take me up on it that is a total red flag " says mr oliver on a few occasions he has had to actually pull cask ale from bars that didnt serve it properly he says a few times a month mr oliver checks up on the spotted pig in new york one of his clients "its nice having a relationship with the guy who made the beer " says ken friedman the pubs co owner "the only thing thats awkward is when a customer is drinking a pint and garrett walks up to the bartender and says this beer tastes like wet newspaper why are you serving it "
