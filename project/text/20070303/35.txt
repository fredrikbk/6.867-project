kudos for spitzer eliot spitzer has debuted to mixed reviews as new york governor with our favorite episode being his recent remark to one legislator that "im a f steamroller " such charm isnt news to our readers but hes also moved a brick or two in the right direction in corrupt albany most recently in this weeks deal to reform workers compensation new yorks current workers comp system with its combination of high costs and low benefits is one of the nations worst its average cost per claim of &# leads all other states according to the national council on compensation insurance at the same time benefits paid to injured workers are capped at &# a week an amount that hasnt increased since along with onerous taxes workers comp costs have been a ball and chain on the states economy particularly in manufacturing the business council of new york state reports that manufacturing employment fell by more than double the national average between and delphi ceo steve miller has called new york "about the worst state from a workers comp standpoint we have a finite ability to pay our labor costs to operate a plant in new york in competition with plants that could be in other states " mr spitzers reform would attack the systems destructive costs by imposing limits on what are inelegantly called "permanent partial" disability payments which typically go to someone whos sustained a head or back injury more than other states have a cap on the number of weeks you can collect workers comp once youve been "permanently partially" disabled but not in new york once that status is conferred you collect til you depart this mortal coil though only of all claims theyre or more of costs the governors plan would end these payments for more than of cases after eight years or less under the theory that this is plenty of time for a person to be compensated rehabilitated and retrained mr spitzer also wants to increase the weekly benefit for injured workers to &# over three years thereafter the benefit would be indexed at two thirds of the average weekly wage in the state all told the governor says his reforms would cut workers comp costs for employers by up to any deal was always going to hinge on whether the afl cio would agree to reform in return for a benefit increase and under mr spitzers predecessor republican george pataki the unions had refused to compromise its nice to see them finally realize that the status quo is hurting businesses while benefiting only a small subset of workers at the expense of all others one important reform not included in the agreement would implement some objective medical guidelines to determine the level of impairment sustained in an injury mr spitzer says he will pursue this administratively and we hope he will the governor has much more to do if he wants to reverse the francofication of new yorks economy but his workers comp fix is a welcome start
