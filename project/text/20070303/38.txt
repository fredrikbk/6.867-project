no romance please just the coffee and quickly starbucks chairman howard schultzs memo questions whether starbucks drive for growth and efficiency has compromised the "romance and theatre" of a visit diluting the starbucks experience "starbucks chairman says trouble may be brewing " leading the news feb i see starbucks problems differently when i ordered a latte at a maryland starbucks i wasnt looking for "romance and theatre " i wanted a latte with sugar and cinnamon quickly but when i tried to add sugar there was none i asked a clerk for some no sugar cinnamon or stirrers she suggested i get them at another store im not in the habit however of sneaking into another shop to steal sugar packets and a stirrer for the overpriced latte i purchased elsewhere while starbucks original concept might have been to provide "romance and theatre" to patrons who spent time relaxing in their stores theyve now expanded into the fast serve market where those things arent important and the companys service is consistently poor mr schultz may think the issue is that customers cant see the "barista" making their coffee but i think the problem is much more basic the service is poor and the prices are high coffee is a discretionary purchase and there are plenty of vendors from which to choose if starbucks doesnt provide good service it doesnt matter if i can see the barista or not ill go where they have quickly service plus sugar and stirrers anita nolan new hope pa i cant believe it took starbucks this long to recognize the commoditization of its brand the original starbucks experience has vanished the atmosphere used to be quaint and quiet along with that wonderful coffee aroma throughout the store when you visit a starbucks today the sound of blenders making frappuccinos reminds me of being at a dairy queen and ordering a blizzard niki cherpas fairlawn ohio
