real estate holdings and hedge funds where to look now not all of the riskiest investments are overseas many bond fund managers responding to years of low interest rates have filled their funds with more higher yielding junk bonds and financial advisers in recent years have been recommending that investors place an ever greater percentage of their assets into alternative investments such as commodities real estate and hedge funds such strategies can be helpful to diversify an investors core portfolio of stocks and high quality bonds especially because alternative investments are devised to zig when markets are zagging but as investors start to re evaluate their appetite for risk after the past weeks market selloff many of these investments which can be complex and carry high fees warrant a closer examination heres how to avoid some of the key perils bonds bonds are a traditional haven but in a &# trillion market there are bound to be some dark corners one index called abx based on risky mortgages fell about tuesday and despite a rebound later in the week is still down sharply on the year any type of bond can default since anybody from a homeowner to a small company to a midsize country can have problems paying off its debt the trick is finding one that gives the highest yield with the lowest chance of default but as investors have poured into higher risk debt the yields went down compared with safer bonds like treasurys mutual funds offer diversified bond holdings and thus usually reduce risk of course some funds are more diversified than others jpmorgan government bond fund which holds mostly treasurys and high quality mortgage related bonds currently yields schwab yieldplus fund dabbles in corporate bonds and sports a yield of loomis sayles high income fund a gets a yield with bigger bets on junk bonds junk bonds in a fund arent necessarily a red flag for the risk averse indeed sticking with only treasurys could lead to lower returns in some years but the more junk you hold the more youre likely to suffer in bad times generally if or less of a funds assets are in junk it wont lead to big problems on tuesday the day of the big market selloff a merrill lynch index of junk bonds fell but is still up so far this year real estate the insatiable appetite of private firms for property has helped inflate prices of commercial real estate particularly in the office sector that has helped drive real estate investment trusts to outperform the s&amp p index for seven years "if were moving to a riskier environment its not good news for real estate " says mike kirby chairman of green street advisors a real estate research firm reits have never been as expensive relative to stocks overall as they are now green street calculates to be sure real estate is now part of most advisers idea of a well balanced portfolio and that isnt likely to change real estate fundamentals also have been good with demand for space on the increase and rents following across most sectors but private buyers have been aggressively bidding up prices to heights that would have been thought outrageous not long ago for instance shortly after blackstone groups recent mega deal for equity office properties trust macklowe properties bought its new york portfolio of eight buildings for &# billion the price is so high that macklowe will lose money initially but its betting it can raise rents sharply in coming years that bet could sour however if the economy turns suddenly for investors looking to size up the risk of their real estate stocks "leverage" or the amount of borrowing is one of the quickest and easiest routes reits with low debt ratios like avalonbay communities or kimco realty corp are relatively less risky than those with high debt ratios such as general growth properties or first industrial realty trust retailing could be more stable shopping mall leases tend to be long term and numerous making mall owners like simon property group less susceptible to economic downturns than more cyclical sectors like office where one tenant leaving can empty out an entire building alternative investments many individuals plunged into alternative investments because they assumed these holdings could reduce the risk of an overall portfolio but as investors have learned these investments may not give much cushion during market

positions long refers to the standard investment strategy of buying shares in hopes that prices will rise a short on the other hand is a bet that prices will fall using borrowed and sold stock thus market neutral funds try to pick a mix of investments that will do well no matter which way the market moves funds like these weather market downturns better but they often dont rise as vigorously when times are good on tuesday for example the jpmorgan multi cap market neutral fund was essentially flat but so called long short funds can take more active bets on the markets direction by allocating varying amounts to short positions one long short fund geronimo sector opportunity fund lost on tuesday commodities are popular investment but volatility in energy markets has made some commodities more risky several funds track broad commodity indexes but investors should check the holdings about a third of the value of the deutsche bank liquid commodity index optimum yield is based
