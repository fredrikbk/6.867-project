pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink hold the horseradish the tehran meeting of f d r winston churchill and josef stalin in was at times a bloody minded affair in the strategy discussed and the cocktails consumed stalin suggested executing to german officers once the war was won president roosevelt assuming old joe had to be kidding joked that would do but the soviet dictator was in dead earnest churchill argued that war criminals should be tried and get their due but political mass executions were right out the rest of the conference stalin needled churchill repeatedly insinuating that he harbored a secret love of germans there was tension in the rooms and roosevelt and churchill tried to ease it with an abundant supply of drinks on the first day they met f d r mixed stalin a batch of his dirty martinis but it was in the evenings that the liquor really flowed and none so much as the night of nov churchills th birthday there was much champagne and according to the chicago tribunes reporter cocktails that "looked like tomato juice were served probably these were the famous middle east bloody marys made by mixing vodka and tomato juice " i have never been particularly fond of bloodies because the drink as practiced today is rarely in balance sometimes you get a veritable salad of crudites stuffed into the glass and almost always the drink is ruined by a heavy hand with the spice jars the standard bloody mary seems to be a glass of tabasco sauce tempered with horseradish if thats how you like your bloody fair enough but every now and then its worth getting back to the basics of any recipe as a touchstone to ward off excess in its earliest incarnation the bloody mary was little more than tomato juice and vodka in equal measure employed as a hangover cure john steinbeck would later describe its curative powers in terms that embrace the drinks ruddy name and appearance "it is elixir it is pretty close to a transfusion " comedian songwriter movie producer and raconteur george jessel the "toastmaster general of the united states" laid claim to having created the cocktail in the s he even appeared in smirnoff ads declaring "i george jessel invented the bloody mary " in his autobiography jessel told a fantastical story about the morning in palm beach when after a nonstop night of drinking he devised the first bloody mary to clear his head for a game of beach volleyball with "al" vanderbilt given jessels knack for self promotion many doubted his claim and that opened the door for the head barman at new yorks st regis hotel fernand "pete" petiot was serving bloodies under the alias "red snapper" at the hotels king cole bar by the start of the s once the bloody mary became a national sensation in the s petiot would claim that he had invented it while working at harrys bar in paris in the s but dogged etymologist barry popik a consulting editor of the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america has found that the earliest references to the bloody mary all credit the drink to jessel the first was this mention in lucius beebes new york herald tribune cafe society column "george jessels newest pick me up which is receiving attention from the towns paragraphers is called a bloody mary half tomato juice half vodka " petiot qualified his own claim in a interview with the new yorker "i initiated the bloody mary of today " he declared "george jessel said he created it but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when i took it over " case closed but of more interest than petiots inadvertent admission is how he describes what he did to jessels basic drink "i cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt two dashes of black pepper two dashes of cayenne pepper and a layer of worcestershire sauce " into the shaker he added lemon juice two ounces each of vodka and tomato juice and some cracked ice and then he gave the most important detail "shake strain and pour " not only did the first full blown bloody marys lack horseradish and celery but they were served without ice since then the drink has morphed into a pint glass affair usually with some six or eight ounces of tomato juice on the rocks spiced within an inch of its life even the st regis now serves its bloodies over ice but its worth trying the drink according to petiots specifications it is a lighter more refreshing pick me up in which you can actually taste the juice but what of the chicago tribune mans claim that the bloody marys served in tehran were a "famous middle east" specialty the drink was rather exotic at the time and i suspect the reporter mistakenly assumed it had equally exotic origins i like to think that churchill who oversaw every last detail of the preparations for his birthday party that night chose the drink with a purpose could it be that churchill was getting in a sly dig at the man he toasted that night as "stalin the great" by serving the dictator a drink sanguineous in name and appearance with
