howard stringer japanese ceo caught between two worlds the sony chief tightens his management grip will it work tokyo howard stringer is annoyed since becoming sony corp s first foreign chief executive almost two years ago he has been slammed by japanese financial analysts and sony employees for being disconnected from the companys daily operations especially during two big crises investors in the u s meanwhile have put him under constant pressure to fix sonys problems more quickly and he was hearing conflicting advice from both sides "look in america i was told to cut costs " mr stringer says "in japan i was told not to cut costs two different worlds in this country you cant lay people off very easily in america you can " in a series of interviews at the end of a tumultuous year for sony mr stringer says he balanced those competing demands to squeeze growth out of sonys electronics business and beat earnings estimates for four successive quarters sonys stock price has risen since he took over in june he bristles at criticism mostly from japanese that he lives in a hotel when in tokyo and spends too much time in new york and london to run the company effectively says mr stringer sitting in a conference room in sonys tokyo headquarters "if im not running the company who the hell is " fixing this iconic japanese company is one of the biggest challenges in business mr stringers dilemma is that he is caught between different management styles and cultures he says he recognizes the risk of falling behind amid breakneck changes in electronics but he says theres an equal risk in moving too aggressively "i dont want to change sonys culture to the point where its unrecognizable from the founders vision " he says "thats the balancing act im doing whether he can pull it off is still an open question for the welsh born executive the task is complicated by having to navigate a sea of obstacles from uncommunicative top executives one surprised mr stringer with bad news at a board meeting to poor public relations advice the risk to sony from his management through persuasion is that the company could fall further behind nimbler and more aggressive rivals mr stringer has already shifted gears once adopting a more assertive stance after his softly softly approach faltered when he became ceo mr stringer started cautiously he knew that despite its global brand name sony remained a traditional japanese company full of employees with lifetime tenure who were suspicious of change japan had opened up to the idea of having foreign managers run japanese companies notably carlos ghosn at nissan motor co but it hadnt necessarily embraced the western style of management mr stringer years old stuck with the executive team he inherited he tried gently persuading managers to cooperate with one another and urged them to think about developing products in a new way the dangers of that approach quickly became clear two big missteps a delayed launch of the playstation videogame console and an embarrassing battery recall tarnished mr stringers first years in charge in both cases managers tried handling problems in the traditional sony way quietly and without informing top executives last fall mr stringer put together an executive team more to his liking the reshuffle included moving an uncommunicative star executive ken kutaragi from his position running sonys videogame unit mr stringer now receives every report about manufacturing problems "more emails than i care to read " he says in one of the interviews mr stringer counseled patience to his critics noting that his turnaround of sonys u s operations took five years to complete "you cant go through a japanese company with a sledgehammer " he said in another interview conducted just after the battery recall crisis mr stringers forbearance was wearing thin "im going to do what i want to do now " the chief executive said "im not going to be following everybodys suggestions ive got to be true to myself in some ways mr stringer says nothing has changed in his management style the perception of him as a hands off manager he says was fueled by his decision to live in a tokyo hotel the ceo says he now regrets that decision but also rejects as "insane" the notion that he wasnt firmly in control he says his response to the crises wasnt a change of heart but a quickening of his long term plans he adds that his record has been obscured by the battery crisis "which took too long for bizarre japanese reasons that i dont want to spend the rest of my life discussing " mr stringer started life as a tv reporter he spent nearly three decades at cbs inc he became a u s citizen in eventually rising to become head of broadcasting he made his name at sony leading a turnaround of its u s entertainment operations including streamlining its movie and music businesses slashing hundreds of jobs when he was named ceo sony was in a poor state a company built on hardware engineering that was floundering in the age of software for decades sony had produced the gold standard of consumer gadgets such as televisions and tape players sony made products the old way first developing hardware then almost as an afterthought adding software to make it run the walkman the epitome of the companys success was a triumph of electronics engineering ever since sonys innovations have focused largely on hardware design making products smaller thinner and lighter as apple inc has shown most spectacularly with its ipod music player nifty software is the ticket to creating hit gadgets these days in it wasnt only the ipod that was vexing sony competitors such as microsoft corp a software company were eating into sonys gadget business especially its famed playstation one of mr stringers goals was to encourage sonys hardware engineers to treat software seriously when developing products but sonys culture celebrates proud innovators who do what they want many still quote an admonition by one sony veteran if you have the misfortune to be under a clueless boss dont tell him about new ideas just execute them for example last summer more than sony colleagues attended a mock funeral thrown by famed engineer toshitada doi he had resigned after his pet project the aibo robotic dog was axed one of many activities sony deemed superfluous at the ceremony the year sony veteran recalls saying that the aibo was a symbol of a risk taking spirit that was now dead mr stringer didnt know much about electronics sonys core identity when he took over his careful approach a hallmark of his time in the u s as well was evident from his first days notably when he decided to keep and defer to the japanese executive team chosen for him by his predecessor nobuyuki idei the executives were electronics veterans familiar with sonys operations in japan but soon after mr stringer was upset he couldnt unveil cuts in the companys product line because his top executives had not finalized their plans the executives "were all put in place " says mr stringer "what was i supposed to do show up on monday and say i dont like who youve given me " sony president ryoji chubachi emerged as mr stringers right hand man mr chubachi was promoted at the same time as mr stringer after having spent his career overseeing components such as videotape his primary experience in software was the programs sony embedded in hardware devices not the kind of modern outlook mr stringer was after "to be honest it didnt click with me at first when howard first talked about the importance of software " mr chubachi says in an interview one casualty of mr stringers early hands off style was connect a unit set up before his arrival that he nonetheless championed as an example of collaboration between hardware software and services connects task was to create a portable music player and online music service under the walkman and connect brands to challenge apples ipod and itunes connect had two presidents sony hardware veteran koichiro tsujino in tokyo and philip wiser an online music pioneer in new york the two clashed mr tsujino wanted to build a new type of software from the ground up while mr wiser wanted a more conventional approach as the feuding intensified they complained to mr stringer about the dual president system say people familiar with connect mr stringer declined to intervene asking the two to work out the problems on their own the people say the new software packaged with the walkman a compromise solution was so error prone that u s executives refused to sell it sony eventually abandoned the software in japan too by mid messrs tsujino and wiser had both quit sony and the connect unit had been disbanded mr stringer concedes backing off but he says connect was a vestige of the old sony way of doing business where executives ran independent fiefs "we learned from the lesson that we are not developing software that way anymore " mr stringer says after the connect unit was disbanded the entire business including hardware software and services was moved to sonys audio devices group under the control of yutaka nakagawa an executive who was openly skeptical of the connect music service according to sony managers he told colleagues that sony should concentrate on its strengths in hardware mr nakagawa declines to comment other than to say that connect "didnt seem quite right " another stumbling block was mr kutaragi the renegade head of sonys videogames division who invented the playstation videogame consoles the companys most successful marriage of cutting edge electronics technology and software mr stringer hoped mr kutaragi would come up with similar hit ideas for sonys other products mr kutaragi was notorious within the company for his reluctance to communicate with his bosses or other units in mr kutaragi hosted an event at a big electronics conference in las vegas to celebrate the u s launch of the playstation portable handheld game machine one of the companys biggest products that year he didnt invite executives from sonys electronics division which provided the parts in developing the playstation console the devices latest iteration mr kutaragi went over budget on development costs without informing mr stringer according to a person familiar with the situation when mr stringer urged mr kutaragi to have dinner with the heads of the electronics division he did so just once a year this person said a spokeswoman for mr kutaragi declined to comment mr stringer tried to win mr kutaragis cooperation with patience "ive had dinner with mr kutaragi more times than ive had dinner with my wife and thats not really healthy " mr stringer says in september mr kutaragi announced sony was halving shipments of the new playstation to the u s and japan and was pushing back its european launch at a news conference mr kutaragi blamed sonys electronics group for failing to produce enough of a critical component exposing his tense relationship with the division "if were asked whether sonys quality of manufacturing has declined i would have to say yes " mr kutaragi told reporters at a board meeting a few weeks later mr kutaragi sprang another surprise on mr stringer suggesting he drop the price of the entry level playstation console by to just under yen about &# to make it more competitive "it wasnt financially one of my best moments " mr stringer says "the budget implications were self evident but i agreed because i wanted the launch to be successful " the price cut will help double videogame related losses for sonys year ending march to about &# billion erasing many of the efforts made by other units to boost profitability "i think its fair to say that any time youre aiming for the stars youre running the risk of falling a bit short on your timetable " mr stringer says meanwhile another crisis was bubbling over in august dell inc announced it was recalling million laptop computer batteries made by sony after the pc company decided they posed a danger of overheating and catching fire dells recall triggered a stampede by other computer makers and prompted sony to launch a voluntary global recall program in late september mr stringer says he first heard about the magnitude of the problem not from his own managers but from dell founder michael dell the problem in sonys typical independent fashion the battery subsidiary sony energy devices corp tried solving the issue itself says mr stringer instead of treating the matter as a public relations challenge the battery executives saw it as one of engineering mr stringer says he erred by deferring to his japanese deputies suggestion that he avoid public comments about the battery recall the idea was to contain the problem in the components division but mr stringers silence gave the impression among japanese press and employees that he wasnt taking responsibility for one of sonys worst public relations disasters the constant stream of reports about battery fires was "a kind of chinese water torture " mr stringer recalls and prevented the company from putting a lid on the matter within sony mr stringers silence disappointed some employees several executives say some questioned mr stringers commitment to the electronics business because of his living arrangements in tokyo a complaint echoed among local financial analysts "mr stringer has no background and hes not in japan managing the day to day so its impossible" to run the company effectively says tatsuya mizuno an electronics analyst for fitch ratings "sonys dna is in electronics so the top management needs to understand whats going on there " mr stringer bristles at the idea that he isnt committed to tokyo "i have a home in england and i have a home in new york im already bloody cross cultural and i just didnt want to be in a lonely apartment somewhere in tokyo even for symbolic reasons " at the same time mr stringer says he should have "faked it better i mean that seriously " he says mr idei warned him about what might happen it he didnt establish a home here "i shouldve put the flag up the flagpole and said heres my residence in downtown tokyo im here even if its less practical than living where i live and much less comfortable and friendly " he still lives in a hotel the two crises were a wake up call in videogames mr stringer says he persuaded mr kutaragi to give up day to day control of the division in december he remains chairman and chief executive focused on next generation games mr stringer replaced him with the u s head of the videogame unit a longtime ally in electronics mr stringer moved mr nakagawa the executive who questioned the role of software to a unit overseeing batteries chips and other components messrs stringer and chubachi receive daily emails alerting them about manufacturing problems companywide via a product safety officer who was appointed in the fall mr stringer also put all of sonys consumer gadgets under katsumi ihara mr ihara played a key role in jump starting the mobile phone joint venture between sony and telefon ab l m ericsson of sweden which has built a reputation for style mr ihara has set up a task force based in the u s to develop products that will allow users to download content from the internet onto sony products like the walkman and playstation he also created a center in tokyo to develop software one early effort a module for tvs that allows users to watch video from the internet using a remote control it uses some of the same software as the playstation console mr stringer says the rough experience of the past few months gave him an opening to speed up his plans "all crises create opportunities " he says "while we were being beaten up on the one hand it was an opportunity to accelerate the transformation " kate kelly contributed to this article
