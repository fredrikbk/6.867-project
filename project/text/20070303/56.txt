pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece goyas radical painting the style of tres de mayo is as revolutionary as its subject anatomy of a classic in the recently widowed francisco de goya painted one of his greatest masterpieces which changed the concept of history painting forever an intense explosive work now in the prado the "tres de mayo" commemorates the execution of spanish insurrectionists by napoleons troops on may it is one of the two history paintings by goya the other the "dos de mayo " records the uprising the previous day by unarmed citizens against the mounted mamelukes the egyptian mercenaries napoleon sent to quash the spanish rebellion against the french occupation legend has it that goya actually witnessed the may executions on mount principe pio through a telescope from his nearby home on the outskirts of madrid where he had withdrawn during the chaos as he painted it the scene of the dawn massacre is shrouded in darkness illuminated by only a single lantern adding to its theatrical drama the composition is symmetrical the victims huddled against a wall on the left are confronted by the row of cocked rifles held by their military executioners grouped at the right the agonized expressions of the terrified civilians contrast with the anonymous impassivity of their paid killers the spontaneous rough style of the painting is as radical as its contemporary subject the documentary effect is heightened by the blur of the action and the massing and generalization of form the vehemence and broad painterly manner lacking specific detail or outline of the "tres de mayo" is the opposite of the carefully drawn contours slick surfaces and bright colors of the "charge of the mamelukes " the official title of "dos de mayo " which depicts the events of the preceding day the link between the two paintings is apparently the street fighter knifing a rearing horse at the puerto del sol on may who seems to be identical to the bloody corpse sprawled under the still standing victims about to share his fate in the "tres de mayo " the french invasion and the spanish guerrilla resistance provoked a cycle of attack and reprisal terror and counterterror massacre rape and famine inspired goyas famous series of etchings of "the disasters of war " so horrifying they could not be published until after goyas death the outrage expressed in the "tres de mayo" and the prints and drawings of "the disasters of war" are the basis of goyas reputation as a rabid revolutionary there is no doubt that as an artist goya was radical in his approach to tradition and rejection of academic constraints on the other hand he was a political chameleon and a consummate opportunist the adulation goya received as a revolutionary firebrand is contradicted by the fact that he was a paintbrush for hire while the french triumphed he remained as court painter in the service of joseph bonaparte the brutal brother napoleon installed as king of spain and painted his portrait on the return of ferdinand vii to the throne of spain goya once again served as painter to the spanish court the "tres de mayo" is a first in depicting a tragic current event in this case the massacre of unarmed civilians rather than a historic heroic distant battle or victory fifty five years later edouard manet who had seen goyas painting in the prado used it as a model for his "execution of maximilian " both paintings represent the consequences of popular uprisings against french colonialism in manets case the victim is maximilian ferdinand the pathetic archduke of austria set up by napoleon iii as emperor of mexico this time the executioners are not the invaders but the indigenous mexican guerrillas serving the deposed mexican president benito juarez soon to return to power maximilians execution in was still a relatively current event when manet painted it in early because of the political climate the painting could not be shown in france so in manet at his own expense shipped the painting to new york there it was seen in the context of the great pictures exhibitions of sensational large scale single works widely publicized to attract crowds the show was a flop but the recent moma exhibition reuniting all four versions of manets paintings of the theme including the cut up version put back together by degas was a box office sensation as much a tourist magnet as the "great pictures" of the th century picassos "guernica " often cited as a contemporary painting depicting the senseless slaughter of civilians is based on poussins biblical scene of the massacre of the innocents rather than on the works by goya or manet there is however a related picasso painting of a firing squad with rifles pointed at innocent civilians his "massacre in korea" cataloged as lost for years but now in the picasso museum in paris is little more than a political cartoon lacking the humanity of goyas and manets executions it is simply a formulaic piece of anti american propaganda that picasso produced as a member of the communist party "massacre in korea" is a poster masquerading as a painting it is two dimensional and flat like graphic art lacking the spatial complexity of a painting the grisaille palette is similar to that of "guernica " but it has none of that works subtle contrasts and sense of tense urgency the actual photographs of the event are far more moving neither manet nor goya believed artists had political power however in painting these bloody execution scenes perhaps they thought they could change human conduct although current events seem to have proved them wrong manet certainly saw the futility of art as propaganda "what an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts " he wrote a friend concluding "but there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes that were not politicians and have no desire to be elected as deputies " dr rose is an art historian who lives in new york and madrid
