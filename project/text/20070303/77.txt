the weekend interview with myron scholes risk manager rye brook n y what some called the "goldilocks" market got a sharp rap upside the head this week why cant things always be smooth and nice and predictable myron scholes operator of the hedge fund platinum grove asset management says you wouldnt like it if they were you know him better as a winner of the nobel prize in economics you may also recall him as a principal of the hedge fund long term capital management ltcm which went belly up in the late s indeed to the authors of a certain type of financial potboiler hell always be the mad scientist who almost blew up the world a better description would be a lifelong student of risk and why we humans need risk how we manage it and why wed be unhappy without it start with the commonplace that risk is one side of a coin whose other side is reward "we all have a taste for it " he says "in life it would be kind of boring if there was no risk on the other hand if theres too much risk too much uncertainty too much chaos we cant handle it either we simultaneously want order and disorder simultaneously want risk and quiescence " our conversation at his suburban new york headquarters takes place just before the recent market gyrations but his analysis has a greater ring of verisimilitude than many that filled the media this week "right now " according to mr scholes "were quiet because the lion is tame and maybe its the central bankers of the world who are keeping it tame " and thus "individuals will say oh things are now quiescent and will be forever and theyll take more risk again " he adds "my belief is that because the system is now more stable well make it less stable through more leverage more risk taking " bingo a chinese family decides what the heck lets mortgage the house and invest the money in the shanghai stock market prices can only go up american bankers say what the heck lets lend people of dubious credit on the price of a house house prices can only go up but then another question is why must the corrections be so convulsive one of mr scholess favorite words is "model" as befits a man awarded a nobel in for the famous black scholes model for pricing stock options in chaotic times speculators who are business people in mr scholess view providing liquidity services to the market doubt their models they want to reassess in todays ever more globalized and complex economy "the information set is huge its gigantic " as a result "decision time becomes elongated" and speculators hold back their capital just when their services are most in demand the lack of liquidity itself then becomes a factor in asset pricing leading to swift sharp drops in values you may be tempted to slightly arch your eyebrows right now if you remember ltcm mr scholes expects as much hes made his peace with it he says he feels like the woman in the local paper who whatever she does will always be remembered for one thing "mrs jones who was falsely accused of the ax murder of her husband in recently had a garden party for of her friends " mr scholes fellow nobelist robert merton and former salomon trader john meriwether set up long term capital in for the first three years it delivered spectacular returns then came the russian bond default of and other reverses and suddenly the fund was deeply in a hole and worse its very large borrowings in danger of being yanked says mr scholes succinctly "the amount of risk taken by the fund was too large " was the financial system ever in danger from ltcms collapse as widely predicated in press accounts at the time i half expected mr scholes to pooh pooh the worry as apocalyptic instead he pauses finally saying "i dont know the answer obviously we had one run of history its interesting to me however that you could have taken the bankruptcy route and add that to the court system and to think about what the consequences would have been " well never know a phone call was made the new york fed agreed to intervene and organize a notorious "bailout" by the creditors to prevent a fire sale liquidation mr scholes was doubly marked for notoriety because he had just a year earlier been awarded the nobel prize along with mr merton for their work on derivatives pricing he readily acknowledges that the episode was financially and personally embarrassing "in life you pay tuition right sometimes you pay too much tuition sometimes learning is costly " that learning began in timmons ontario in and young mr scholes learned early about the risks of life he was diagnosed with a progressive eye disease that would make reading difficult it taught him to concentrate he says and to listen well hes been through three cornea transplants as an adult and now can see fine of an academic bent and inspired by the free market insights of milton friedman and george stigler he ended up at the university of chicago albeit with the plan of returning to northern ontario eventually to help run a small chain of department stores in towns with names like south porcupine that his mother had started and was now operated by an uncle but then he and his uncle had a disagreement "i was disowned " he says he needed a job but as a canadian on a student visa he wasnt legally entitled to work except on campus noticing a sign seeking a computer programmer at the campus computer center he volunteered though he knew nothing about computers but as helper of faculty research projects he became acquainted with faculty legends such as lester telser merton miller and gene fama and discovered a fascination for securities markets arbitrage and the pricing of risk life next brought him to a teaching job at mit where he met one of his great collaborators fischer black who shares authorship of the black scholes formula though he died before the nobel was awarded both men had been independently thinking about the knotty problem of how to price other than by intuition and experience option contracts though he says now he didnt understand what the ability to disaggregate and price risks would really mean for the future a financial revolution was in the making and messrs scholes black merton and a handful of colleagues were at the center of it businesses he explains today make their money from specializing in "idiosyncratic risk " not "generalized risk " starbucks specializes in selling coffee to consumers it doesnt gain anything from exposing itself to currency risk commodity risk interest rate risk etc greater sophistication in financial markets has now made it easier and cheaper to lay off these generalized risks to others more expert at managing them businesses can concentrate on managing the risks and reaping the rewards unique to their own skills and assets what does it all add up to "i dont see derivatives or hedging of generalized risk as being unto itself i see the cost of using those contracts as competing with the cost of equity well see more substitution of risk management for equity " translation the exit of companies from the public markets in favor of private equity will continue and yes regulation is a factor too "maybe if we keep doing more and more regulation and rules everything will end up in private entities with risk transfer and hedging and the corporation will disappear " one point of attack on the public company of course has been executive compensation mr scholes hears his name invoked constantly since the black scholes formula has become the basis for assigning a value to stock options dished out to employees and senior management he finds much of the criticism misguided noting that executive compensation is a strategic matter for companies and no less subject to learning than other strategic considerations many of the giant paydays that incense the media he points out came about because a companys share price over a succession of years greatly outperformed a boards reasonable expectations as a board member he says "you might say the probability of the stock price going up times is zero so why do i have to write a contract" that protects the company from outsized payouts in such an unlikely circumstance "but if that happens a few times people will start writing" those protections into the contract "so theres learning that occurs " ditto large severance payments for executives who were hired with manifest approval of the stock market and later fired when the shares underperformed "people will fashion new contracts and new ways of doing things boards will learn it doesnt mean you have to overturn the whole applecart simply because the market did terrific and a lot of people got paid well " back in the s mr scholes was fascinated by the then heterodox idea that markets are better at generating human welfare than government regulation and he doesnt doubt that this megatrend is still unfolding witness the growing realization that governmental and corporate benevolence cant secure our old age that well have to rely more on private planning and saving and that a burgeoning advisory industry already visible will be able to help "that vision we had back in the s and s was that one shoe fits all didnt work and wasnt working and was constraining society as the world became more uncertain more individualism and more flexibility would be needed is that a better world yes in my view its a better world " mr jenkins is a member of the editorial board of the wall street journal he writes a weekly column "business world " and edits opinionjournal coms daily political diary
