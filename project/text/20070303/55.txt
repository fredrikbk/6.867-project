pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations how mccain got dinged wednesday night john mccain made it official "i am announcing that i will be a candidate for president of the united states " he told david letterman adding that this was actually an announcement that he will make a formal announcement in april best line of the night came from bandleader paul shaffer "hes doing the formal announcement on leno " why did he do the letterman show to get his name in the paper or rather to get his name in the paper followed by the word "announces" as opposed to the word "over " a year ago he was pretty much on top the past few months hes lost steam why was he once so hot and now so not politics is like show business nobody knows anything everyones guessing everyones waiting to find out then when its over they tell you at great and knowing length why it happened maybe the mccain story is as simple as what hes always known what he was taught and what he experienced in war the more time you spend in the air the more you get dinged everyone knows his bio but when you stop and look at it again you realize its even more impressive more moving than you remember john sidney mccain iii born in the panama canal zone on aug third in a string of high spirited men who would serve their country heroically his father was active duty navy his mother the daughter of an oil wildcatter in texas and oklahoma both mr mccains father he liked subs and grandfather he liked ships rose to the rank of admiral the latter promoted posthumously from vice admiral in john mccain iii goes to episcopal high school in alexandria va attends the u s naval academy class of becomes an aviator he likes planes is sent to vietnam in the spring of and on his rd bombing mission on oct is shot down by a surface to air missile he ejects breaking both arms and legs is captured is sent eventually to the infamous hanoi hilton where he spends much of his imprisonment in solitary he refuses special treatment as the son of an admiral is beaten and tortured as are the others on march years ago this month he is freed along with almost other american prisoners he receives the silver star bronze star purple heart and distinguished flying cross he stays in the navy works as liaison on capitol hill goes home to arizona and is elected to congress from the first district replacing john jacob rhodes in he wins the senate seat of barry goldwater he is re elected in landslides in and and runs for president in his straight talk express gets slammed at a south carolina crossroads by a bullet train called the inevitability of bush he is re elected to the senate in with of the vote and runs now again for president what a life in all as he came up he would have been an organic conservative schooled in the old american rigors of duty and honor shaped in a world that was competitive aware of the existence of evil a world in which not to be a conservative was like announcing "i dont understand life " his patriotism the patriotism of his family was acted out and lived as opposed to put on like a hat or merely claimed no one in modern national level politics has a better life story than his in retrospect it is almost amazing that it didnt beat that of george w bush who wryly admitted to friends and supporters in that he was "a little light on the resume " but americans dont elect resumes they elect men here some aspects of mr mccains highly individualistic nature hurt him he is funny quick brave colorful he is emotional has a temper carries grudges harbors resentments if the latter set of traits were not true the former set would have won the washington political establishment as it is he has a portion of it but many were hired for money as political advisers this is a traditional but at this point old fashioned way to spend money all the advisers disagree all of them gossip to reporters most of them can define a problem but not a solution and again most dont know anything they were born for cable always an interesting place but one where you pay little price for being wrong there is the sense in mr mccain that he came to believe his resume gives him special latitude george w bush in felt he had to seem down the line conservative though this involved some head faking he had to tell you who he was because you couldnt see it by looking at his history i suspect mr mccain knew no one could question his life that it showed who he was and so he could do what he wanted in terms of policy and not jeopardize his support after all his whole life was a testament to conservative principles so he could go against general conservative thinking on campaign reform on immigration he could hang with the liberal boy journalists on the bus "my base " he jokingly truthfully called them in in he felt he could take on christian conservative leaders in the south bad timing in they were at the peak of their years of power now their followers are tired and questioning after a generation of political activism and many leaders seem compromised dinged after all that time in the air mr mccain could rebuke them now and thrive instead he decided to attempt to embrace them and there is iraq the war was generally popular from through roughly and mr mccain won broad credit from conservatives for standing with the president but now that support heightened by the surge debate is costing him not only with the general public but in a subtle way i think with republicans republicans dont abandon a republican president in time of war and they have a special relationship with this president a simple admiration for who he is at the same time they dont precisely want another w for president another man who seems just as convinced stubborn single minded invested one suspects mr mccain knows this but is stuck where hes stuck and stands where he stands what is his promise his potential its that hes john mccain in a changing world he is a constant hes earned it his promise is that hes moe greene he made his bones when the rest of them were out chasing cheerleaders
