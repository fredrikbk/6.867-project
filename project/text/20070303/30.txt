hot topic cap and charade the idea of a cap and trade system for limiting carbon dioxide emissions in the u s has become all the rage earlier this year big american companies formed the climate action partnership to lobby for government action on climate change and this week the private equity consortium that is bidding to take over texas utility txu announced that as part of the buyout it would join the forces lobbying for a cap on carbon emissions but this is not as lenin once said a case of capitalists selling the rope to hang themselves with in most cases it is good old fashioned rent seeking with a climate change patina start with the name most of those pushing this idea want you to think about it as cap and trade with emphasis on the trading part senator barbara boxer touts all the jobs that would be created for people trying to game the system er save the planet and her colleague jeff bingaman calls cap and trade "market based " because you know people would trade stuff but for that to happen the government would first have to put a cap on co emissions either for certain industries or even the economy as a whole at the same time it would allocate quotas for co emissions either based on current emissions or on energy output or some other standard if a company then "over complied " which means it produced less carbon dioxide than it was allowed to under the rules it could sell the excess allowance to someone else that someone else would buy the right to produce co if doing so cost less than actually reducing emissions in this way emissions would be reduced in an relatively efficient way those for whom reductions were cheap or easy would reduce and if they reduced enough they could sell their excess allowance to someone for whom the reductions were harder or more expensive this kind of trading works and weve argued in these columns that cap and trade beats the pants off just plain capping by lowering the overall economic burden of a cap the difficulties dont lie with the trading but with the cap which is where the companies lobbying for restrictions come in james rogers ceo of duke energy put it plainly earlier this year "if youre not at the table when these negotiations are going on youre going to be on the menu " translation if a cap is coming better to design it in a way that you profit from it instead of being killed by it which is why the emphasis really should be cap and trade its all about the cap because without it theres no trading we dont buy our daily ration of oxygen because its in abundant supply same with carbon dioxide theres no constraint on your ability to produce co until the government creates one when it does it creates an artificial scarcity what duke entergy txu bp dupont and all the rest want is to make sure that when the right to produce co becomes limited theyre the ones that end up owning the allowances because that would mean they could sell them and make money off something that previously wasnt worth a dime thus entergy a utility that relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear power and thus produces relatively less co would love a cap that distributes the allowances based on how much electricity you churn out rather than on how much co you produce entergys "carbon footprint" is small compared to some other utilities so an electrical output based cap would be windfall city dupont meanwhile wants credit for reductions already made because it sees instant profit in costs already paid it also wants a cap to cover as many industries as possible so it can make money selling emissions reduction products we dont begrudge anyone the opportunity to make a buck but theres a difference between making money by producing things people want and making money by gaming the regulatory process theres no market here unless the government creates one and who has the profit opportunity depends entirely on who the government picks as the winners and the losers in designing this market in the first place so its no wonder that almost any business that has ever put an ounce of co into the atmosphere is rushing to show its cap and trade bona fides by far the biggest question however is where the cap is set the trading of emissions credits does nothing to lower the quantity of emissions it merely shifts around the right to emit its the cap that sets the amount of co put into the air and as europe has learned that figure is a political football unto itself when the eu started emissions trading in the price of a ton of co quickly tripled before cratering when participants realized that the cap hadnt been set low enough to create a genuine shortage the european commission is now in the process of reviewing each countrys plans for allocating emissions allowances for but in the first round it found that all but one national plan had set the cap too high to comply with kyotos limits of course even a stringent cap means nothing if countries dont comply and so far europes commitment to kyoto has been more hot air than action the reason is hardly a secret though you rarely see climate change activists admitting it despite all the talk of "alternative" fuels some of the energy that the world produces today comes from carbon based fuels barring cold fusion or some other miracle technology that ratio wont change much for decades to come that means in turn that any stringent co cap would inevitably have serious economic costs we doubt voters will elect politicians who tell them the cost of reducing their "carbon footprint" is more blackouts or a lower standard of living and in any case china is putting up a new coal fired plant every week raising emissions that will overwhelm whatever reductions cap and trade would yield in the u s the emerging alliance of business and environmental special interests may well prove powerful enough to give us cap and trade in co it would make hollywood elites feel virtuous and it would make money for some very large corporations but dont believe for a minute that this charade would do much about global warming
