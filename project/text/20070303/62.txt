pursuits sports golf journal spin control golfs police are tweaking clubhead rules but a bigger issue looms the balls unless you are a total golf gearhead you probably missed the report this week about the new limits on clubhead grooves the u s golf association has proposed that starting in irons must have grooves with edge radiuses no smaller than inch radical yes but true theres also a second specification but its too complicated to explain the changes are intended to stop elite players from imparting so much spin to shots hit from the rough the usga takes pains to point out that most of us recreational players wont notice any practical difference when the new regulations take effect because we arent skilled enough to impart spin out of the rough even using our current clubs the decree is a response to what many of the powers that be see as a disturbing trend in professional golf a "de skilling" of the game when pros know they can hit precise shots to greens from anywhere even the rough they dont need to pay much attention to accuracy off the tee they can just bomb it last weeks winner on tour for instance was a swede named henrik stenson who averages more than yards per drive in the last five years according to pga tour statistics the correlation between driving accuracy and success formerly significant has been almost completely obliterated jack nicklaus thinks that this bomb and gouge mentality has ruined the professional game "it used to be shotmaking and about power " he said in a lengthy first person article in the current golf digest those percentages now are reversed he said his proposed solution is to scale back the distance that golf balls travel by or more among the advantages would be making some of the classic old courses now too short viable again as venues for pro tournaments mr nicklaus is not the only one talking this way gary player greg norman and other luminaries most of them past their playing prime also support a ball rollback the usga is researching the issue and recently requested samples of limited distance balls from manufacturers on its face rolling back the ball seems like a reasonable response to concerns about distance so this week i called two of the leading ball manufacturers titleist and callaway to ask what they thought both companies denied that distance was a problem that needs solving right now noting that driving averages on the pga tour after climbing yards between and have now mostly leveled off if and when distances start climbing again and golfs governing bodies deem it necessary to act both companies said they would be eager to help but that rolling back the ball for everyone is not the answer "that would get us really hot and bothered " says steven mccracken senior executive vice president at callaway titleist has been especially aggressive in countering any whisper of support for ball rollback joseph nauman an executive vice president at titleists parent company acushnet acknowledges that its executives have had "very pointed conversations" with media and other organizations about the issue in at the height of the alarums about distance titleist started pulling all of its ads from the industrys most outspoken magazine golf digest mr nauman says that wasnt a response to articles on the distance controversy but the action had a chilling effect nonetheless on ad dependent media throughout the industry none of this is to suggest however that the ball makers dont have some good arguments to make balls were only partly responsible for recent distance increases on tour better clubs and club fitting stronger more athletic better trained players and faster fairways probably contributed even more designing balls that fly shorter yet retain other desirable playing traits would be far more complicated than people realize and matching the new ones to players unique styles would be highly disruptive furthermore speaking for myself even if someone persuaded me that switching to shorter balls was necessary for the good of the game i cant imagine being happy about it id hate to have to start laying up short of that bunker on no that i now carry getting older is enough of a burden without having to play a shorter ball too if push comes to shove a solution that probably makes more sense is bifurcation requiring only elite players to use a shorter ball the distance problem after all is theirs not ours driving averages for regular players apparently havent increased much at all but nobody really wants that it would break the lovely if illusory bond that we have with the worlds best players we all use the same tools the whopping distance increases of the last years have not been good for golf they have robbed the pro game of some of its charm wounded the pride of many old courses and distracted us from more nuanced pleasures but for now at least the usga seems to have its thumb in the dike and we can probably manage to live with things as they are lets just hope those pro driving averages dont start getting out of hand again that could prove a sad regrettable mess for everyone email me at golfjournal wsj com
