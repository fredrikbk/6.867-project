pursuits books misadventure capital a hapless entrepreneur recounts his new media pratfalls the royal nonesuch by glasgow phillips black cat pages &# about a quarter of the way through reading "the royal nonesuch " i was surprised to discover that back in glasgow phillips co founded a naming firm called quiddity the idea was to profit from the dot com boom by persuading internet entrepreneurs to hire him and his partner to name their new ventures "we at quiddity think of ourselves as genetic engineers of language " went the sales pitch "and a soundly engineered name is the foundation of effective marketing " mr phillips is the first to admit that there was a large dose of hucksterism in all this but even so how did he manage to come up with such a poor title for his memoir "the royal nonesuch" conveys almost nothing about its contents except perhaps that mr phillips has a whimsical offbeat sense of humor that not all of his readers will share fortunately a book can no more be judged by its name than by its cover in fact "the royal nonesuch" is a fairly lively example of what is rapidly emerging as a mini genre the new media memoir the first instance that i know of was "burn rate" michael wolffs hilarious account of his own misbegotten internet venture while mr phillipss book isnt quite in that league it manages to hold your interest nonetheless because he is such a self confessed loser most new media memoirs are about failure if their authors had become rich they wouldnt be writing books but "the royal nonesuch" stands out because mr phillips achieved so very little for him a first round of financing was a distant dream never mind the ipo this book chronicles the internet gold rush from the point of view of a pack pony a graduate of the stanford creative writing program mr phillips published his first novel "tuscaloosa" in at age and then moved to los angeles where along with his best friend he launched a new media venture in called certified renegade american product given the acronym would you hire this man to name your company the businesss primary activity consisted of organizing an alternative film festival each year at sundance actually thats not strictly true organizing a handful of parties in utah may have been the pinnacle of the companys achievements but the bulk of mr phillipss time was taken up with writing business plans and meeting with potential investors his aim was to raise enough money to cover the overhead so that he could get down to the job of writing even longer business plans and meeting with even bigger investors almost no one was crazy enough to give mr phillips any money one of the few people to cut him a check was matt stone of "south park" fame who invested &# in a low budget film that was designed to cash in on the success of "the blair witch project " in what must qualify as the sickest new media venture ever conceived mr phillips planned to make a fake snuff movie in which he pretended to murder his girlfriend and then broadcast it over the internet presenting it as a live event his hope was that the ensuing media brouhaha would propel the film to the top of the video charts incredibly mr phillips made the film enlisting the help of a hollywood special effects company but he wisely decided not to release it after an internet porn baron described it as a "monstrosity " another madcap scheme involved making a late night talk show for comedy central hosted by a character named timmy the woodsman mr phillips managed to string the cable channel along even though his star was a real life homeless man whose party trick consisted of taking all his clothes off and running around on all fours in the hope of persuading people that he had overdosed on lsd at other times he simply overdosed on lsd in a blog post on feb mr phillips announced that the woodsman had just died even after the woodsman became progressively unstable mr phillips refused to give up on this project the fact that the author stood by the woodsman going so far as to take him home for christmas in points to the character flaw that prevented mr phillips from making a fortune on the web namely hes far too nice a guy time and again he would collapse with laughter during some pitch meeting unable to keep a straight face as he outlined his pie in the sky revenue projections his internet start up was essentially just a device to enable him and his partners to pay the wages of a string of bizarre characters whom no one else would employ and he didnt have the heart to pretend it was anything else in the end it is this fundamental decency that makes "the royal nonesuch" such an enjoyable book glasgow phillips is no genius and hes certainly not someone youd ever want to go into business with but hes a very likable fellow and youll end up rooting for him even though you know his harebrained ideas will come to nothing mr youngs latest book is "the sound of no hands clapping" da capo
