the week ahead our take on coming events economy jobs productivity data will offer nervous investors a lot to chew on by mark whitehouse after a week in which stocks took their wildest ride in years in which alan greenspan uttered the word "recession" and in which economic data pointed in various directions investors are understandably desperate for any decent clues as to where the u s economy is headed they might not get what they want in the coming week but they will get something big to chew on the governments report on february employment the monthly estimate of how many people companies added to their payrolls is notoriously volatile and subject to revision just the kind of data that tend to shock investors and send markets into gyrations nevertheless taken together with previous readings the full jobs report will offer some valuable insight aside from a fresh glimpse at job growth and wages both important drivers of consumer spending the report will provide a clue as to how company executives are actually feeling that is important because recent data have suggested they arent too optimistic about the future the latest report on durable goods for example showed companies cutting back their spending on big ticket capital goods such as computers and machine tools a sign that they might not be expecting to have a lot of business to do over the next year or so but if executives are genuinely pessimistic they should also be hiring fewer people so far that hasnt been the case over the three months ended in january nonfarm payrolls added a monthly average of jobs according to the governments most recent estimates that is above the level consistent with an economy growing at its long term inflation adjusted potential rate of about annually some economists worry that shifting weather patterns could make the february jobs number look pretty bad that is because the labor department takes its payroll readings from the week that includes the th day of the month that week was warm in january but stormy and cold in february "you could easily build houses in shirtsleeves in early january but by the time you got to february the ground was frozen solid" in many parts of the country says richard berner chief u s economist at morgan stanley in new york he estimates that nonfarm payrolls will add only jobs in february even if the payrolls number proves strong though that doesnt mean the economic outlook is rosy companies hiring practices are sometimes a bit behind the times often they keep bringing on workers even as their markets are beginning to evaporate and wait until things get really bad before letting people go that is why historically the amount of output companies get out of each hour worked known as labor productivity has been a better harbinger of the future health of the economy than hiring according to the latest data available productivity all but stopped growing in the third quarter of last year and bounced back a bit in the fourth but the government will revise its estimate of fourth quarter productivity on tuesday probably sharply downward mirroring this weeks downward revision of fourth quarter economic activity "that will not be viewed as good news " says nariman behravesh chief economist at consultancy global insight automobiles european car makers try to hash out differences on emissions plan by stephen power europes car makers gather in geneva this coming week to tout their latest environmentally friendly models including a saab station wagon that runs on bioethanol and a volkswagen passat sedan

emissions from new cars sold in europe by at least from present levels by the companies are trying to persuade european union regulators to focus less on costly vehicle technology improvements and more on tax policies that favor low carbon fuels the eus co crackdown is part of a gathering global debate about how to respond to the threat of global warming and the risk of middle east oil shocks without harming economic growth in washington the bush administration has proposed raising automobile fuel economy standards as part of a strategy of reducing u s reliance on imported oil but the plan is generating resistance from midwestern lawmakers worried about its impact on general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler division all of which are struggling financially amid a shift by many customers toward small fuel efficient models from heavy but profitable pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in europe the auto industrys lobbying push has been complicated by the fact that the eu proposal could benefit french and italian car makers such as italys fiat spa and frances psa peugeot citroen sa those companies model lineups are skewed toward light fuel efficient vehicles cars that consume less gasoline tend to emit less co "this is a business war in europe its the italians and french car firms against the german manufacturers " porsche ag chief executive wendelin wiedeking told shareholders recently instead of setting one average target for new cars mr wiedeking says regulators should set individual limits for different types of automobiles such as small cars midsize cars and suvs but his counterpart at peugeot christian streiff takes a more sanguine view of the european commissions proposal "we support these goals even if theyre tough " mr streiff said when the commission announced its plan last month wednesdays meeting of the european automobile manufacturers association comes as some of its largest players are shedding jobs amid weak overall demand for cars and rising competition from asian rivals such as toyota motor corp although the broad outlines of the european commission plan are clear key details remain to be worked out

im sure theyre going to come up with the solutions that are needed "
