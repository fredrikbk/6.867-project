journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources religion muslims on terrorism misunderstood why do some people believe american muslims havent condemned terrorism strongly enough journalist paul barrett says that in fact many prominent muslims have spoken out strongly against violence but until recently some of the denunciations were accompanied by caveats that diluted the overall message just as significantly non muslims sometimes pay little attention to the moderate muslim leaders who have condemned terrorism mr barrett an editor at businessweek who has written a book about islam in america describes the efforts of khaled abou el fadl who teaches islamic law at the university of california los angeles after sept mr abou el fadl regularly decried terrorism noting islamic law prohibits the killing of innocents mr abou el fadl says that u s muslim leaders need to do a better job of persuading the american public that muslims share the outrage over the attacks by and large moderate voices like that of mr abou el fadl have been overlooked by non muslim americans but this disconnect mr barrett says doesnt just stem from a "failure to listen " muslim leaders themselves often have been instrumental in watering down their message take the response to mr abou el fadls suggestion that american muslims needed to express their sorrow over sept more vociferously u s muslims did enough after the attacks says maher hathout a retired cardiologist who helped found the islamic center of southern california "when you find a statement like that from an insider it creates anger " yet mr hathout also suggests that the actions of the hijackers were so contrary to the teachings of islam that the perpetrators couldnt be real muslims this verbal feint mr barrett says fuels the divide fortunately mr barrett says the divide that sometimes separates muslims and non muslims appears to be shrinking especially after the july bombings in london those attacks believed to be carried out by homegrown british muslims led some american muslim groups to reassess "their past tendency to try to deflect and evade questions" about what mainstream muslims are doing to address terrorism salon com march economics why women get hit harder by inflation than men now in the economy as in so many things men and women often experience the world differently in addition to the well documented disparity between mens and womens pay there is a persistent gender gap involving consumer prices lately that gap has been widening merrill lynch economist david rosenberg says the cost of consumer goods and services targeted at women including clothes shoes cosmetics jewelry housekeeping and appliances has been rising faster than that for typically male products mens clothing sporting goods televisions and auto parts and repairs using u s consumer price inflation data for the past year mr rosenberg pegs the "female inflation rate" at year to year times the rate for men there are a number of factors driving the disparity for starters women currently are experiencing greater job growth than men fueling an increase in their consumer confidence to six year highs that bolsters demand and consequently prices for the things that women are more likely to purchase whats more women are marrying later than they used to or not at all that affects price inflation because single women spend a greater proportion of their income than single men unmarried women also tend to spend more money on themselves than men do according to the census bureaus consumer expenditure survey the growing gender gap should be noted by investors mr rosenberg says if prices continue to increase for womens clothing and jewelry while items like auto parts and big screen tvs hold steady or decline it makes sense to calibrate portfolios to reflect those trends businessweek march cinema onward christian moviegoer film critics serve a niche a
