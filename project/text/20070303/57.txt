pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings the critic who knew too much can experience get in the way of enjoyment new york not long ago i reviewed "franks home " a play about frank lloyd wright americas greatest architect the play was based on an actual incident in wrights life but richard nelson the author bent the facts to suit his purposes though not in a way that would have been evident to most playgoers it happens however that i know enough about wright for the liberties taken by mr nelson to have jumped right out at me as for peter weller the actor who played wright his charismatic performance was perfectly true to the spirit of wrights larger than life personality yet here too the facts kept getting in the way of what i was seeing on stage wright who was born in lived long enough to appear on tv in the s most of his appearances were filmed and having seen them i knew that mr wellers wright a smooth talking side of the mouth sharpie bore no resemblance to the real wright a stately victorian gent with a pancake flat midwestern accent the makers of fictionalized docudramas and the authors of fact based novels are forever running into such obstacles if youre trying to evoke the lost world of the past a single rip in the fabric of verisimilitude can destroy the illusion you seek to create the problem is heightened when your characters like mr nelsons are drawn from real life models david strathairn for instance did a brilliant job of portraying edward r murrow in george clooneys "good night and good luck " yet anyone whod seen murrows tv shows from the s knew that the two men looked very different did that matter not to me but i can see how another viewer might have found it distracting it is of course the critics job to factor out such distractions and attend to the performance at hand in mr nelsons case hed made it clear in interviews that his intention in writing "franks home" wasnt to portray wright literally but to make a larger point about the place of the artist in american society i had no problem with that i know the difference between a play and a biography and i think i was able to engage with the show mr nelson wrote nevertheless a little voice in my head kept on whispering "who is this guy kidding louis sullivan never came to california in to visit wright the whole things impossible " is it possible for a critic to know too much not a chance the unhappy truth is that its far more common for us not to know nearly enough about the art forms we review if you doubt it ask any artist but ive also discovered that the accumulation of knowledge can inhibit our ability to appreciate an artistic experience i know middle aged opera buffs who never seem to enjoy the performances they attend whenever they go to "la traviata " they always end up spending the whole intermission grousing about how the soprano wasnt as good as some half forgotten diva they heard in milan years ago theyve lost the knack of enjoying the performances theyre seeing not to mention the piercing beauty of the music theyre hearing calvin trillin wittily summed up this incapacity in "american fried " his book about the joys of eating "whenever a reviewer starts explaining how the preparation of a quiche lorraine at the restaurant he has visited differs from the way one prepares a true quiche lorraine i always want to interrupt but did you like it i want to shout did it make you happy did you clean your plate " i know what trillin meant and i do the best i can to shake off the chokehold of nostalgia when i go to see a masterpiece like "la traviata" or "the tempest " i always clean my plate still theres no getting around the fact that the more you learn about an art form the harder it becomes to enjoy it in a straightforward uncomplicated way the literary critic r p blackmur had this phenomenon in mind when he observed that "knowledge itself is a fall from the paradise of undifferentiated sensation " go to "swan lake" for the first time and youll be blown away by the flood of gorgeous new sights and sounds that spills over you go times and youre more likely to notice that the orchestra played out of tune and the ballerina did fouettes instead of thats not snobbishness its connoisseurship and its a good thing unless it gets between you and the immediate experience of art gratuitous pickiness is a soul killing trap against which the critic must always be on guard i reviewed eight bad shows in a row last fall and by the time i finally saw a good one id started wondering whether there might be something wrong with me i was right about the plays but no less right to worry about myself two saturdays ago i wrote in this space that lincoln kirstein was born in boston he was of course born in rochester n y apologies for my absent mindedness mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
