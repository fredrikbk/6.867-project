ask encore focus on retirement converting to a roth may not always be worthwhile in your article last week you suggested making withdrawals from iras before age to lower mandatory withdrawals and the resulting tax bite later how about converting to a roth ira i just turned and i have been converting to a roth the past couple of years my income is &# including social security but i still intend to convert a small amount staying within the to tax bracket robert w long tucson ariz in short it depends on what you are trying to accomplish as you note when you convert traditional ira assets to a roth you owe tax on all tax deferred contributions and earnings in return any future earnings along with withdrawals from the roth by you or your heirs eventually would be tax free and with a roth you dont have to follow a schedule for making mandatory withdrawals after you turn years old as you would with a traditional ira one other thing we are assuming that you are paying the taxes owed on the converted assets using other savings not from the ira itself a roth conversion "makes no sense if you take money out of the ira to pay the taxes " says christine fahlund a senior financial planner at t rowe price in baltimore a t rowe price analysis last year found that converting to a roth as compared with leaving a traditional ira intact "wins over and over again" but the advantage narrows as investors get closer to the age at which you start making regular withdrawals so if you are already nearing age it may not be worthwhile to convert to a roth every year you "get closer to having to take the money out anyway the question becomes do you want to pay the taxes a year before you have to " ms fahlund says because your tax rate is quite low she suggests that you get help from an accountant or a tax preparer estimating the size of your required ira withdrawals "and then figure out if that is going to push you into a higher tax bracket or not you might be worrying unnecessarily " but even if the tax savings turn out to be a wash you still may have valid reasons for switching to a roth "if you want the roth because you dont expect to need the money once you pay taxes on it and you want to leave it to your heirs that would be an argument for converting it now " ms fahlund says "and if you emotionally feel better when youre out from under the thumb of the government and you can decide when you want to make withdrawals that would be an argument as well " just make sure you are comfortable using your personal savings to pay the taxes involved "if youve always had &# in cds and that made you feel good how are you going to feel if you see the balance going down closer to &# " she asks losing that sense of security may be too big a trade off send your question to encore wsj com ask encore focus on retirement is a weekly column answering readers questions about retirement and personal finance from annuities and bonds to trusts and inheritance issues please include your full name and city and state
