report on fda blasts new effort to track drugs four year delay is said to hinder safety work agency disputes claims the food and drug administration has bungled its effort to build a new system for detecting the side effects of medicines after they go on the market delaying its implementation by at least four years according to a report commissioned by the agency itself as a result the agency must continue to rely on its existing "dysfunctional" computer system as a primary tool for tracking the safety of medications sold in the u s according to the november report which hasnt been made public the situation is "frustrating and undermining the post marketing drug safety work" of its staff "because they lack some of the basic tools they need to perform their jobs e g a computing system that meets their requirements " says the report it was prepared by the breckenridge institute a research and consulting firm in breckenridge colo the fdas drug tracking system called the adverse event reporting system consists of a database and other software and hardware that amass and help sift reports of potential side effects that have been filed by drug makers doctors and others the data are the fdas main way to detect drug related hazards and can lead to changes in label warnings or even withdrawals of drugs from the market but the report says fda safety experts waste time an average of minutes per day dealing with the inefficiencies and snags caused by the current software the adverse event reporting system is overwhelmed by the growing volume of adverse event reports which exceeds a year the report says the fda track record on drug safety has faced harsh scrutiny in the wake of major problems including the withdrawal of the painkiller vioxx after it was linked to cardiovascular problems such incidents underscore the importance of monitoring drugs after they go on the market where some end up being prescribed to millions of patients in clinical trials conducted before fda approval drugs typically are tested on thousands of people at most not enough to turn up every potential danger the fda has sought to upgrade the technology used in its safety tracking program for years but efforts that date back at least to havent produced the planned successor to the adverse event reporting system dubbed aers ii instead the breckenridge report says a new system isnt likely to be up and running until at the earliest and that the fda has wasted an estimated &# million through its efforts the report argues that the fda could have had a new adverse event reporting system working in if it had simply relied on a proposed off the shelf software package a document prepared by fda officials in response to the report which is marked as a draft said it is "riddled with editorial conclusions based on misleading or incorrect facts " douglas throckmorton deputy director of the agencys drug center said the current adverse event reporting system "is a system that is working" despite "exploding" amounts of data "is it the best it can be of course not " he said the fda wants to develop a replacement "as quickly as anyone else does but we want it to be done right " echoing other recent outside examinations of the fda the breckenridge analysts say the "root cause" of the problems can be found in the culture of the agencys drug regulators more specifically the report largely blames a "lack of effective leadership and management" by the centers office of information technology which it says mishandled the initiative through bureaucratic infighting flawed planning and duplicative work performed by outside contractors mark bodnarczuk executive director of the breckenridge institute said he stands by the contents of the document after it was completed the fda asked him to delete much of it he said "what they asked me to do was gut the report and i refused to do it " the fdas dr throckmorton said he believes breckenridge was asked by fda to extend its work at no cost which would have "given us an opportunity to talk about those misunderstandings those inaccuracies " fda contracting practices as well as the agencys handling of drug safety are already the focus of congressional investigations senate finance committee chairman max baucus a montana democrat and ranking republican charles grassley of iowa have sent a letter to the fda about the computer system issue mr baucus said the report raises "troubling questions " and mr grassley said the report is evidence of a "broken down process" at the agency in the house energy and commerce committee democrats john dingell and bart stupak both of michigan are also examining fda contracting according to the breckenridge report the agency by june was considering moving forward with a package of off the shelf software that potentially could have allowed aers ii to be up and running in at a one time cost that had been projected at about &# million according to the report but the report says an official in the drug centers information technology office in june advocated a different approach a system that could track adverse events from all products regulated by the agency such as medical devices rather than just drugs later the report says the information technology office commissioned further analysis including assessments of what a new adverse event tracking system would need with some work done by contractors the need for the new analysis was questioned by officials who worked in drug safety at the fda who argued they "could not wait two more years to repeat the process they had just completed " according to the report that analysis was nonetheless carried out the breckenridge report contends it "did not add any value" and helped delay a new system the fdas dr throckmorton said the agency is already moving to address issues related to its safety culture yesterday the agency formally unveiled its plan to publicize emerging safety issues on its web site as for the delay of aers ii dr throckmorton said "based on what i know those timelines were caused by the complexity of it the need to get it right and the need to consider integration into a larger system " rather than by strategic or management errors he added that the integrated approach was endorsed at high levels of the fda generally analyzing goals is "absolutely essential" in developing a good system he said adding that the fda "considered" the earlier off the shelf software package and "rejected it " agency under fire the fda has been criticized for its handling of drug safety some
