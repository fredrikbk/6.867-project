public schools private operators paul petersons commentary "the philadelphia story " editorial page feb mischaracterizes our report on philadelphia public schools our study found that academic improvement among students attending philadelphia public schools that were managed by private operators kept pace with but did not exceed the substantial achievement gains of students in the rest of the district we agree with mr peterson on the key question if the low achieving schools had not been turned over to private managers what would have happened in those schools and district wide we did not as mr peterson states say "that philadelphia could have done equally well by doing nothing " philadelphia implemented many other school improvement programs that could have been put in place even if schools had not been given to private managers it is impossible to know definitively whether private management or other interventions are responsible for the citys across the board achievement gains but other low achieving schools in pennsylvania likewise gained without private management in examining gains for the privately managed schools we carefully considered whether the rest of philadelphia constituted a fair comparison group we accounted for baseline achievement differences by examining changes in achievement this method assumed that in the absence of private management those schools would have maintained their relative position in district wide achievement something they were doing before private management began our study found that achievement in philadelphia has indeed risen dramatically in both privately managed schools and district managed schools the districts leadership deserves credit for this but we did not find evidence that private management has a differential advantage over other interventions and we cant conclude that private management was a necessary component of district wide improvement mr peterson incorrectly states that rand has been "unwilling" to "make its philadelphia data available to other qualified researchers " the data which includes sensitive information on individual students is owned by the philadelphia school district and only the district has the authority to release it brian gill the rand corporation pittsburgh jolley bruce christman research for action philadelphia
