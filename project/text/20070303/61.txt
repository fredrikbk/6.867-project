pursuits sports colleges roar wars the new science of fan power to gain an edge teams give rowdy fans prime seats and shop for louder bleachers the ohio state buckeyes are an early favorite to advance to the final four of the ncaa basketball championship later this month thanks to their foot freshman center and charismatic coach they have also gotten help from another source hundreds of rowdy students now sitting courtside a move that pushed season ticket holders farther away from the action the idea was to raise the noise level and rattle buckeye opponents "it worked " says ohio state athletic director gene smith "they stand the whole game and they scream at everything " its an article of faith among many fans that their cheers can help lift their teams to victory now research suggests the effect is both real and potent and teams are taking new steps to harness fan power oregon state university recently spent more than &# to install football bleachers that make more noise when stomped on the university of maryland picked a relatively uncomfortable seating option for some sections of its comcast center to force fans onto their feet as often as possible football teams from the university of michigan to the indianapolis colts and the dallas cowboys are having architects tweak conventional stadium designs to funnel crowd noise toward the field the push for fan power is ratcheting up a cat and mouse game between teams looking for an edge and league officials charged with keeping things fair a number of college basketball conferences including the acc and the big east are cracking down on the practice of seating pep bands directly behind visitors benches to make it harder for coaches to talk to their teams during timeouts last year major league baseball instituted new rules governing stadiums with retractable roofs which can be closed to keep out the elements but also to keep in the noise teams now have to tell the league by may their criteria for deciding when to open or close their roofs during the season and in the postseason the final decision is up to mlb perhaps nothing is as contentious as relocating alumni to make way for raucous students ohio state says about of the displaced regular season ticket holders complained and a few asked for refunds "we didnt run anybody out of the building " says bill jones the assistant athletic director for ticketing in research fan power is linked to a variety of benefits last fall researchers at university of bath in england studied more than soccer games and found consistent home team bias by referees specifically refs tended to hand out more yellow and red cards which are issued for disciplinary offenses to visiting teams in a separate study published this past summer a ph d candidate in canada took saliva samples from players on a minor league hockey team before and after games the key finding levels of testosterone which have been found to facilitate assertive and aggressive behavior were to higher before home games suggesting the home arena triggered players elemental instinct to protect their territory "it has the potential to go a long way in developing techniques to create the ideal physiological profile prior to playing " says justin carre the doctoral candidate at brock university in st catharines ontario who co authored the study of course teams since the dawn of professional sports have been using control over their fields to stick it to opponents in baseball groundskeepers often soak the infield dirt if a team with speedy runners is in town former boston celtics coach red auerbach was legendary for shutting off the hot water and heat in the visiting locker room at boston garden to make his teams opponents uncomfortable now the moves are much more ambitious at the university of michigan the &# million renovation of its football stadium includes two brick towers designed to trap the noise generated by the more than fans that the venue holds one of the power players in this business is kansas city mo architecture firm ellerbe becket and its longtime design director james poulson who is emerging as a master of maximizing crowd noise his firm recently completed construction of the university of virginias basketball arena and is working on one for missouri state university mr poulson made his name in the s overseeing construction of the portland trail blazers arena for owner and microsoft co founder paul allen mr allen an avid fan of both music and sports wanted the new venue to draw top bands for concerts but not if that meant using materials that would deaden crowd noise during basketball games ellerbe becket came up with a novel although expensive solution rotating ceiling panels with a soft absorptive side for concerts and a hard side that reflects crowd noise back to the court during games mr allen later hired mr poulson to construct qwest field in seattle in addition to contracting engineers to make sure that the wind and rain would disproportionately hit the visitors sideline mr poulson placed the cheapest endzone seats where he says the "crazies" sit atop steel risers that send thundering noise to the hard surfaces on the overhangs and roof redirecting it back to the field the seahawks are among the nfls leaders in false start penalties called against visiting teams theres no debate that teams fare better at home sports statistician jeff sagarin says that if two teams of equal ability play the home team would be expected to win of the time in the nfl just over in the nba and nearly in college basketball teams play better at home for a variety of reasons beyond a cheering crowd from their familiarity with the court or field to the toll that travel takes on visiting teams there are certain lines teams cant cross in their quest for a bigger homefield edge the nfl for example requires that team generated noise like public address announcements or piped in music cease when the visiting team has the ball and the play clock starts in the nba teams can artificially generate noise with music or other sound effects but it cant exceed decibels during play or decibels when play is stopped there are no limitations on fan generated noise sports venues in previous decades were plenty loud but many modern stadiums were built to maximize comfort and revenue which meant wider seats and larger premium seating areas in short the loudest fans were pushed back that is why teams are now moving students closer to the action stanford university relocated its roughly seat student section that extended to the top of the old football stadium to a wall of field level seats from the yard line to the goal line in the stadium that reopened last fall in basketball schools such as auburn north carolina and washington state have moved more students into the best seats at other schools its more than just musical chairs thats going on when oklahoma state university expanded its gallagher iba arena already one of the loudest venues around it went overboard to make sure that those deafening noise levels didnt drop after taking sound readings and measuring reverberation times throughout the building architect gary sparks came up with a strategy instead of building the extra seats outward he stacked them on top of the existing seats on a steep slope he also added a flat ceiling stripped of almost all absorptive materials the goal was to give every sound wave a direct path to a hard surface that would send it ping ponging around for as long as four seconds one unintended consequence it makes it hard for the audience at commencement ceremonies to hear what the speakers are saying
