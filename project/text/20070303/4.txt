world wide poured a record &# billion into emerging market stock mutual funds according to emergingportfolio com fund research so far this year after two months they have put in an additional &# billion the weeks declines are a reminder that while these markets are more economically sound and dynamic than in previous years the risks are evolving as well investors need to watch for new dangers

s blue chip shares based on ratios of stock prices to corporate earnings a few including india and chile are even more expensive the problem with that u s companies generally are more mature and stable so riskier companies in less developed countries should be cheaper "emerging markets are still not the same as the u s or other developed markets " says carlos asilis of hedge fund vega plus
