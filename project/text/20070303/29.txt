hot topic businesses rethink carbon curbs a growing number of businesses are calling for federal caps on greenhouse gases which could spur congress to action for years most of the business community has strongly opposed controls on carbon dioxide emissions which contribute to global warming reducing emissions would inevitably place new costs on businesses particularly utilities but in the past few weeks three industry trade groups that have long fought such regulation the edison electric institute the american gas association and the electric power supply association dropped their opposition to a cap that coincided with calls for an emissions cap by the two private equity firms bidding for texas utility txu corp earlier this year corporations including wal mart stores inc and general electric co announced their support for mandatory curbs on greenhouse gases the shift underscores a growing belief that congress eventually will pass mandatory emissions caps many business leaders have concluded it would be better for it to happen now rather than later eliminating the current uncertainty moreover they fear absent federal government action theyll be left to deal with a patchwork of state regulations and they believe that by endorsing emissions caps theyll be given a seat at the table in the negotiations over how such a cap would work heres a closer look at what a national emissions "cap and trade" system would look like how would a carbon "cap and trade" system work companies would be required to have a permit for each ton of carbon that they produce the government would limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that companies could produce and create a market for companies to buy and sell permits to produce emissions beyond their caps firms that went beyond the mandated limit would have to reduce their emissions or buy permits from companies that had gone under their limits the aim is to create a marketplace that would provide incentives for companies to invest in new environmentally friendly technologies the clean air act established a similar cap and trade system to combat acid rain and it has been widely viewed as a success what types of proposals will congress consider at least five bills propose tackling global warming with some type of cap and trade market the most ambitious bill would reduce emissions to below their levels by sen john mccain r ariz and sen joseph lieberman i conn have proposed a target of below those levels by the bill has been voted down twice before sen jeff bingaman d n m offers a more modest approach stabilizing emissions at their level by and including a "safety valve" that would force the government to issue more permits if the price of those permits rose too sharply who wins and loses in a carbon market since the devil is in the details its still unclear who will pay how much pollution permits could be sold in an auction market or given away to companies utilities in the southeast and midwest that rely on coal fired power plants are lobbying for a higher cap or more permits to offset what would otherwise create steep price increases because coal releases more carbon emissions than any other fuel conversely west coast and northeast states that rely on cleaner fuels could be more insulated from higher energy costs either way consumers can expect higher energy prices because most emissions caps target electricity producers who will pass those costs on to customers a study by the u s energy information administration estimates that under the bingaman bill electricity prices could rise by resources for the future an environmental group predicts that under the mccain measure electricity prices could rise as much as by companies that produce low carbon fuels or energy efficiency products could benefit from a carbon cap but the steel industry which produces large amounts of carbon dioxide warns that a cap would raise costs and hurt their ability to compete with overseas rivals that arent subject to pollution penalties nick timiraos points of view we need to solve the climate crisis its not a political issue its a moral issue" former vice president al gore "the buyout and turnaround of txus position on global warming is an earthquake that happened in texas but shock waves are going to be felt from wall street to washington " dave hawkins director natural resource defense councils climate center facts of the original european union member nations only britain and sweden are on track to meet emission targets under the kyoto protocol the global

island california and new york had the lowest per capita energy use china is on track to surpass the united states as the worlds leading producer of carbon dioxide in last years average temperature
