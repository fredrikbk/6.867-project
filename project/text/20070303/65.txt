pursuits travel resorts breaking into snow business to boost tourism a utah town courts ski makers along with vacationers ogden utah during a walk around this former railroad town mayor matthew godfrey points out a key part of ogdens plan to become a premier center for outdoor tourism an abandoned cannery with rotting wood floors and boarded up windows in a few months it will become home to some of the biggest brands of the ski industry including salomon and two other units of helsinki based amer sports "there is no silicon valley for the ski industry " says mr godfrey a year old former technology executive "why not us " ogden a city of perched on the edge of the wasatch mountains wants the same thing as many other western communities a piece of the growing outdoor tourism market but odgen is taking an unusual approach instead of just courting vacationers its also going after companies that make skis snowboards and other outdoor gear so far it has gotten more than brands to move to town including nidecker and descente central to both sides of the towns strategy is a controversial proposal for an overhead gondola the gondola which is estimated to cost &# million to &# million and would be funded by the developer would carry skiers from ogden up to the secluded nearby malans basin ski area the projects supporters hope it could eventually be extended to snowbasin where the winter olympics held downhill events and saw bode miller win a silver medal ogden officials particularly mr godfrey say the plans are the towns best hopes for a renaissance their pitch to the ski and outdoor companies an opportunity to get in on the ground floor with relatively cheap real estate in an up and coming resort area which makes it attractive for executives retailers and other customers to combine vacation and business if the gondola project is approved these companies can also take potential wholesale buyers up to the nearby slopes to try out gear the mountainous location also ties into product credibility companies like patagonia have seen the benefits of associating themselves with picturesque rugged areas on the tourism side the outdoor businesses will have a vested interest in seeing the towns profile as a destination rise says kurt geiger vice president of descente north america an outdoor clothing maker in this view passionate outdoors types might visit ogden in part to see where their snowboards and high performance jackets are made some companies are planning to open showrooms in downtown offices for commercial and retail customers mr geiger says during the years descente was based in denver clients hardly ever visited in just over two years since relocating to ogden "weve had nearly retailers who just dropped in " he says that plus lower overheads in ogden which has allowed them to spend more on marketing has helped boost sales he says but perhaps even more critical to the future of the town is that these companies could become allies in the battle over the gondola plan which is being spearheaded by developer chris peterson it has divided the city on whether public funds and resources should be used to help fund a project which critics say doesnt solve the communitys mass transit issues and benefits a private developer the construction of the gondola would be funded by a housing development built in part on hiking land that the city would sell to mr peterson the idea of a gondola link from malans basin to snowbasin has also failed to gain support from earl holding the head of sinclair oil and the owner of snowbasin resort who is also mr petersons father in law clint ensign head of government relations for sinclair oil says that the company studied the feasibility of a gondola link and thinks that its too difficult and costly mr peterson also says he has no plans to connect the two resorts if the plans come to fruition "ogden can be one of the best most convenient high adventure communities in the country " says mr peterson who has the support of the towns new ski businesses descentes chief operating officer bob geiger the son of kurt geiger is the head of the pro gondola group lift ogden for now ogdens tourism draw is mainly as a cheaper though less convenient alternative to park city ogden hotels offer ski packages to snowbasin and powder mountain both within a half hour drive there is also cross country skiing and snowshoeing along the wasatch mountains downtown historic th street has been attracting new restaurants nearby the swanky redesigned offices of snowboard maker nidecker have opened with a showroom and retail store further down the street crews are finishing construction on the new salomon center named for one of the latest big brands to move to town the recreation center will have an indoor wave pool a sky diving wind tunnel and rock climbing walls but the strategy still has skeptics though town officials have succeeded in attracting some companies others are waiting to see if the city council approves the gondola project "other companies have intimated that theyre interested but really would like to see the gondola come through " says mr godfrey trip planner how to get there its about a minute drive from salt lake city international airport what to do ogden is about minutes from ski mountains including snowbasin known for lodges with giant fireplaces and chandeliers and powder mountain known for its backcountry terrain you can also get to popular spots like alta snowbird brighton and solitude in less than an hour try ice climbing at nearby waterfall canyon in the summer there is kayaking along the ogden river and hiking in the wasatch range for a dose of history try union station once a major stop on the transcontinental railroad the george s eccles dinosaur park has replicas of t rex and triceratops the treehouse childrens museum is devoted to literacy and language reed albergotti
