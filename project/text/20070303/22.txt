cross country rontrells choice johns island s c at years old rontrell matthews has a better idea than most of his peers what an education is worth this past summer he made his way through this rural poor community not far outside of charleston to show up at the doorstep of capers preparatory christian academy in his hand was his first paycheck a meager sum of &# that hed earned making sandwiches at the local subway shop spurring him along was a determination to buy his own way out of one of the states many failing public schools school choice is always controversial and often opposed on the grounds that it will undermine public schools subsidize middle class parents and cherrypick the "best" kids for a private education after meeting rontrell in capers cramped conference room on a recent afternoon its hard to disagree that school choice in this state would help one of the best kids get a better education rontrell is now excelling in school encouraging his younger brother to study hard he has landed a partial scholarship and continues to work at subway to pay part of his &# a month tuition bill hes a good kid but as south carolinas state legislature now debates whether to allow parents to use a modicum of government funds to send their children to a school of their choosing public or private its difficult to accept the objections of school choice on their merits rontrell freely admits that he was a problem student in public school acting up in class and neglecting to hit the books he might have just as easily given up he notes his friends from public school still tell him that hes "stupid" for turning his paychecks over to capers founded in by faye brown a year old retired public school teacher capers is one of a handful of "independent schools" that serve the states rural poor it operates out of rented office space has a total of students in kindergarten through th grade and makes due on an annual budget of about &# a year nearly all of its equipment desks books and the eight imacs in its computer lab were donated to the school the teachers who arent volunteers make &# an hour with no fringe benefits many of the kids show up without lunch often parents fail to make their monthly tuition bills only five students at the school come from two parent homes and most of the students are african american each year ms brown is forced to dip into her retirement account to keep the school running "its robbing peter to pay paul " she told me "ill let the power bill go until theyre about to shut off the lights and then im rushing down there with the money " one place capers isnt skimping however is academics the school places a heavy emphasis on reading writing and math as a result the schools average sat score is points above the state average and this year the school expects every one of its graduates to go on to college st johns high school the public school these students would be attending if not for capers has an average sat score of education superintendent jim rex the only democrat to win election statewide in south carolina this past year recently came out in favor of school choice saying "its time to take the plunge " but his support comes with a caveat he wants to limit choice to within the public school system which would do precisely nothing to help rontrell and his capers classmates pay their tuition bills and its not just the capers kids whod be left out of mr rexs reforms south carolina students are on average dead last in sat scores trail the nation in graduation rates and turn in abysmal scores on proficiency tests in core subjects there are an estimated students across south carolina who are poor and stuck in failing public schools mr rex notwithstanding theres now a groundswell of support for broad based school choice in recent weeks several thousand residents have rallied at the state capitol and advocates have lined up bipartisan support in the republican controlled legislature for creating a &# tax credit for middle class parents and a &# state "scholarship" for poor kids in failing public schools that can be used to attend any school two years ago similar reforms were defeated in the state house by seven votes but school choice supporters picked up several seats in the last election one of which is now help by curtis brantley an african american from rural jasper county who picked off an incumbent in a democratic primary last year "its time " he told me recently while sitting in his sparsely furnished office "to try something new " as a former public school official who as he tells it was forced into retirement after trying to reform the school system from the inside mr brantley is now becoming a powerful voice for reform in columbia and he was only too happy to organize buses for school choice supporters from his district to attend the rally in spartanburg james miller a year old machine operator and second class petty officer in the navy reserves is hoping the state scholarships make it through the legislature this time last year he was called up to active duty and shipped off to the persian gulf he thought heading off to war would prove to be a hardship for his family it turned out to be a blessing with his hazard and other increased pay he earned &# tax free each month double what he makes as a civilian and enough to pull his son rodney out of a crummy public school rodney is now thriving at a local christian school but mr miller worries about next year hes back from the gulf and he and his wife charlene arent sure how theyll pay the tuition bill coming due in june without one of the state scholarships now being debated in the legislature "its hard " he told me "we have just the one son and we want to do right by him " mr miniter is assistant
