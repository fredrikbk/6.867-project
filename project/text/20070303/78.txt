the wider war the papers and airwaves are full of stories about an impending american assault on iran some accounts claim we will target their nuclear facilities others speak of a far more ambitious attack designed to destroy the islamic republics regime whatever the truth of these stories vigorously denied by the bush administration we are clearly paying much more attention to iran than we did in the past and this is a good thing the terror war now extends to four continents running from thailand and indonesia to india and pakistan down the horn of africa to somalia and yemen and back up to afghanistan on to iraq palestine israel lebanon and thence to europe and the united states to restrict our national debate to iraq and afghanistan alone is to accept the failure of strategic vision that has plagued us from the wars earliest days we have decided to fight in one place at a time secure that area and then move on that isnt good enough because it gives our enemies the luxury of attacking us where when and how they choose neither iraq nor afghanistan will ever have decent security so long as we only play defense we have to attack our enemies when we wish not respond to their initiatives and their most important operational bases are outside iraq and afghanistan our primary enemies are states which provide the jihadis with much of the wherewithal for their operations intelligence weapons and other technology including the advanced explosive devices iran gives the terrorists in iraq false documents safe havens and training facilities for a long time they needed money too but nowadays ransoms and drug profits have eased the burden on their state financiers until the fall of saddam there were four pre eminent supporters of terrorist groups iraq iran syria and saudi arabia now there are three and as it has been all along iran is by far the most important the iranians created hezbollah probably the most lethal terrorist organization in the world as well as islamic jihad in all they support no less than terror groups both sunni and shiite including al qaeda several of whose leaders have been operating from iran since the liberation of afghanistan syria works hand in mailed glove with the mullahs in lebanon and iraq the saudis provide money for terrorist groups and support a global network of radical wahhabi mosques and schools that indoctrinate young muslims in the ways of jihad without the active support of those three countries it would be a lot easier to defeat the terrorists on the battlefields without syrian and iranian support hezbollah would shrivel up and die ditto for islamic jihad whose leader the former florida based academic ramadan abdullah shallah recently met in tehran with iranian leaders plus hezbollahs operational chief imad mughniyah and iraqi militia leader moqtada al sadr al qaeda would be similarly weakened and the many palestinian terrorist organizations that keep their offices in damascus would find it very difficult to relocate and maintain their effectiveness all would be weakened by the loss of saudi funding and moderate muslims everywhere including in the u s would breathe a sigh of relief if the wahhabi mosques were closed it doesnt require more boots on the ground or bombing raids it requires a traditional american policy support for democratic revolution against our tyrannical enemies iran is the keystone of the terrorist edifice should there be free elections no one wearing a turban would be elected to anything and there is good reason to believe the country is ripe for a pro western democratic revolution the regime clearly has a cash flow problem its failure to meet scheduled payments has driven its friends the russians to suspend construction of the bushehr nuclear reactor there are also demonstrations against it all over the country and no wonder with more than of the young population two thirds under years of age below the poverty line widespread drug addiction and thousands of women sold into sex slavery every year nor is it surprising that some of the oppressed minorities have launched armed attacks against the revolutionary guards corps and the fanatical basij forces the regimes prime instruments of oppression there are open denunciations of president ahmadinejad of former president rafsanjani and even of supreme leader khamenei all this is taking place against the background of the cancer ridden khamenei who is expected to die in the near future and a thinly veiled struggle for succession pro democracy organizations in iran believe they can bring down the regime if they receive support from the u s of the same sort we gave to solidarity in poland the aquino forces in the philippines the cedar revolutionaries in lebanon the orange revolutionaries in the ukraine and so many others they wish our leaders would openly endorse regime change and they would like our radios and television to support freedom instead of apologizing for the mullahs we should call for western trade unions to build a strike fund for iranian workers many of whom have not been paid for months some for more than a year and we should provide sympathetic iranians with laptops servers cell and satellite phones and phone cards so that they can communicate with one another regime change in iran does not require an invasion or even the sort of bombing so many are now advocating in order to thwart the mullahs program to build atomic bombs the issue is the regime not its instruments thousands of americans have already been killed and wounded by irans terror army we should assault the mullahs with our most potent weapons which are primarily political the recent sanctions against iran are welcome but support for freedom is the key to regime change in tehran the mullahs know their doom will come from their own people which is why they have embarked on a new wave of mass repression with a spate of public hangings in the kurdish balouch and ahwaz areas a wave of arrests of pro democracy leaders in tehran and isfahan the most famous face of the iranian resistance ahmad batebi reportedly suffered a stroke in the mullahs torture chambers and is now in a coma in khuzestan the oil region in the south there are plans for a massive program of ethnic cleansing moving more than a million arabs to other regions it brings back memories of stalins efforts to destroy soviet "nationalities " all these actions bespeak a profound insecurity in tehran just waiting for the free world to exploit a free iran would deliver a devastating global blow to the terrorists and would no doubt change the calculus and perhaps the regime of syria under those happy circumstances we might muster the will to insist that the saudis shut down the wahhabi schools and mosques which constitute an assembly line of fanatics all over the world its an ambitious strategy but we are an ambitious people we are engaged in a global war and while we have done well in many respects we have thus far refused to recognize the real nature of the fight mr ledeen is the freedom scholar at the american enterprise institute see related letter "letters
