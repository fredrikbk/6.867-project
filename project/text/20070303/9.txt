business insight a special report leaders of the pack a look at strategies for securing market domination and keeping it its harder than ever for a company to dominate its market these days or to defend a dominant position that makes it all the more important to have a strategy to try a company with a so called stronghold is so powerful in a geographic product or customer segment that it sets the standard for all others in the market in terms of price performance reliability and other characteristics a stronghold represents a companys key source of profitability its platform for expansion and its power base for attacking its rivals companies without one are often spread too thin across many markets or segments making them vulnerable to more competitors for most companies however strongholds have become much more difficult to obtain and to hold among the reasons with so much market research data available its typical for several players to converge on the same new territory at once trends needs and government regulations change faster than in the past making strongholds more temporary and some barriers that once helped defend strongholds are weakening due to converging technologies and globalization yet having a stronghold has never been more important increased volatility in financial markets has made wall street a less steady source of capital for many companies businesses with solid strongholds on the other hand generate the kind of continuous cash flow that wall street likes to see and that a company needs to grow knowing your way around a landscape of strongholds requires familiarity with basic stronghold strategies studying such strategies focuses ones attention on competitive questions central for any company where will your company dominate where will it concede to rivals how can you secure a stronghold once it is captured and how does this stronghold need to change to ensure success in the future what follows is a look at the essentials the five ss of stronghold strategies securing a defensible stronghold separating strongholds into nonoverlapping parts of the market surrounding rival strongholds to contain them storming a stronghold by direct or rapid assault and shape shifting strongholds by radically redefining the boundaries among strongholds in a market securing a stronghold a companys ability to defend a stronghold depends on the strength of its walls and on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the defender and the attacker in the absence of strong walls the ability to secure a stronghold depends upon willingness to take risks inherent in giving up territory before counterattacking a traditional stronghold defense is to create strong walls or barriers to entry that block competitors from a market these can include building economies of scale and a full line of products making heavy capital investments and limiting access to distribution channels walls however develop holes as time goes on and companies grow walls are vulnerable to technological change globalization mergers deregulation and convergence of industries from the s to the s international business machines corp for example had a stronghold in mainframe computers in part by relying on entry barriers of switching costs and a full line of mainframes its customers faced huge costs and potential disruptions if they attempted to replace their ibm mainframes with those of a competitor and the companys full line of mainframes made it difficult for others to find a hole through which to enter however in the s competitors simply flew over ibms walls as companies started switching from mainframes to pc based computer networks ibm was forced to migrate to a new stronghold establishing itself in information technology services and business software when fixed barriers can no longer be relied on more flexible defense strategies can be used including proactively counterattacking outside the stronghold in markets or segments not crucial to the control of the stronghold these act to deter distract or deflect potential entrants in ralston purina dominated the biggest part of the u s pet food market with a share of dry cat food and of dry dog food ralstons stronghold dry pet food was secured mainly by two barriers ralstons economies of scale in purchasing and processing grains for humans and animals and its ability to command supermarket shelf space as a major food producer threats to ralstons stronghold could be contained as long as the rest of the market remained divided like it was with quaker oats co and gaines foods inc occupying the small and declining soft dry and moist dog food segments respectively and carnation co h j heinz co and alpo a division of grand metropolitan plc at that time battling over canned dog and cat food with the market divided in this way no rival was strong enough to launch and finance attacks into ralstons stronghold to break out of this situation heinz and carnation tried to build full line cat brands that cut across dry canned moist and soft dry foods similarly quaker acquired gaines to create a stronghold in soft dry and moist dog food and to build a full line of dog foods these rivals were attempting to resegment the market into a dog stronghold and a cat stronghold and to switch the basis of competition from economies of scale in production which favored ralston to economies of scale in advertising and branding which favored the rivals ralston successfully defended its stronghold by regularly using product launches in the canned soft dry and moist segments to keep its rivals off guard signaling that it could undermine their profitability if it wished and to stir up price competition among rivals ralston thus used mobile and pre emptive maneuvering outside its stronghold in its border territories separating a second strategy is to make tacit alliances with competitors that allow a peaceful coexistence of nonoverlapping strongholds in the same market home depot inc and lowes cos initially coexisted by tacitly dividing the home improvement market along lines based on store format and customer types home depot went for a warehouse format and focused on do it yourselfers and professionals the part of the market traditionally served by lumberyards and construction supply businesses lowes used a hybrid between retail and warehouse formats and focused on women geography too played a role with lowes focusing on secondary cities and the southeastern u s both companies also offered different product mixes and brands with each pushing for exclusive distribution deals separation can widen over time but mostly it doesnt last without using the securing strategies discussed above indeed the uneasy truce between lowes and home depot has been eroding as lowes attempts to serve more contractors and home depot adds more services and fashion items to appeal to women lowes began copying home depots large warehouse model and moving into high traffic suburban and urban areas other times rivals in the same competitive space maneuver to get out of each others way for example frances bic group and gillette now a subsidiary of procter &amp gamble co formerly competed in two key areas disposable lighters and razors when bic introduced a disposable razor in the mid s gillette had no choice but to introduce its own disposables but these products cannibalized gillettes higher margin cartridge razor business after a decade of brutal price wars gillette moved to make a separation it pulled out of the cigarette lighter business leaving it to bic gillette then poured its resources and attention into the successful introduction of its sensor cartridge razor in by the end of that year gillette had two thirds of all razor users the remaining third of the market went to bic and other competitors gradually gillette has been pulling back on its disposable razors as well further separating its stronghold in cartridge razors from bics in disposable plastic products surrounding some companies surround a rivals stronghold by riding the fastest growth segments outside the stronghold this strategy positions the company to contain or constrict the rivals stronghold gradually it is often used to box the rival into a less attractive part of the competitive space in the late s wendys international inc launched an initiative that had the effect of pinning down mcdonalds corp and burger king holdings inc in their core stronghold fast food burgers while wendys surrounded them with a shift to nonbeef menu items like salads wendys began by introducing its cent super value menu in mcdonalds and burger king later adopted their own cent big macs and whoppers which led to intense price cutting between the two and culminated in mcdonalds much criticized and draining cent big mac promotion over two months in wendys meanwhile maintained its original cent menu but didnt discount its premium beef sandwiches moreover while mcdonalds and burger king remained pinned down in price wars for control of the less profitable burger market wendys carried on with a menu that included higher quality items such as signature sandwiches and garden sensation salads and higher prices in wendys market share in the fast food burger segment grew percentage points from a year earlier while mcdonalds and burger king lost share wendys also maintained a higher average customer check than mcdonalds &# versus &# in adrienne hayes burger king vice president public relations and marketing communication says burger kings decision to discount whoppers in the mid s was not in response to wendys introduction of the cent menu a spokeswoman for mcdonalds lisa howard says "we continue to be absolutely focused on our customers and on our brand " a variation of the surround strategy uses a rival strongholds inflexibility and entry barriers against the rival itself in effect trapping the rival behind its own walls like a city under siege take a look at fast food again as the battle among the big three raged so called fast casual restaurants burst upon the scene such as panera bread co these restaurants have margins more than double those of quick serve restaurants because they cater to customers who are less price sensitive the big three meanwhile have been unable to attract these kinds of clients in large numbers because of the very things that defended their strongholds to begin with ubiquitous franchising systems and powerful brand images that stand on low prices and a core customer of children and families storming sometimes companies storm a rivals stronghold by breaking through going around or neutralizing its entry barriers when the u s auto makers built massive service networks that would take years to replicate they thought they had an invincible barrier to entry but the japanese simply made cars that needed less service in shock treatment the attacking company uses overwhelming force to push a rival out of a stronghold it has targeted circuit city stores inc appeared to use this strategy in local geographic markets against sears roebuck &amp co which held the leading national share in retailing of small and large home appliances and consumer electronics circuit city became the largest retailer of consumer electronics and small home appliances in the u s for a while by going into local or regional markets like gangbusters the goal according to its annual report was to quickly "gain a dominant position in any market we enter " by circuit city had free standing stores and had achieved market share for retail consumer electronics in its markets circuit city has since been overtaken by best buy co there are risks to using shock rivals may counterattack if the attacking company uses overwhelming force it must be sure the defender is left with too little strength to strike back the defender also may concede its stronghold only in order to regroup and move aggressively into other markets because of the risk of retaliation many companies prefer attack strategies with more finesse in a stripping strategy rivals slowly pick away at a stronghold piece by piece often so gradually that the competitor doesnt respond and suffers death by a thousand cuts sears for example once defined its stronghold as being the general store for the middle class but bit by bit the old department store and catalog company was stripped of its business chains like kmart and wal mart arrived offering more discounts on many goods other department stores consolidated giving them more purchasing power to lower prices for higher end goods big box stores specializing in electronics home appliances and hardware carved new territories out of what were once steadfast sears departments even the sears catalog came under attack as specialty books began to multiply in a domino or steppingstone strategy a single company moves toward the stronghold of a rival in a series of steps each of which adds capabilities resources and momentum for the next move toyota motor corp started with a stronghold in small cars a peripheral zone for general motors corp and ford motor co it then moved into luxury cars with lexus and is now moving into the core profit zones of the u s manufacturers suvs and trucks finally guerrilla attacks can be staged on different strongholds or on different parts of a single stronghold small skirmishes keep the rivals guessing where the next attack will come from pepsico inc did this in with the pepsi challenge a blind taste test in which participants indicated they preferred pepsi to coke the tests launched in dallas proved so successful that pepsico eventually staged challenges in cities and towns nationwide in random patterns a few cities at a time the ability to move quickly and strike without warning a key feature of guerrilla attacks left coca cola co vulnerable to these attacks cokes resulting loss in market share gave pepsi a temporary but significant victory in the cola wars a few years later coca cola changed cokes formula to new coke to make it sweeter as pepsi continued to make inroads in the cola market scott williamson a spokesman for coca cola responds that while it might be an interesting exercise "to look back decades " coke is still the no soft drink in america and "the worlds most valuable brand " shape shifting shape shifting strategies change the borders and size of strongholds by changing the competitive landscape there are three basic methods convergence or redrawing the boundaries of once separate markets into a new larger playing field reinventing strongholds by creating new customer and product segments and recombining existing segments convergence which redraws boundaries between industries is seen often these days apple inc by introducing the iphone which combines the ipod music player with a cellphone and internet browser features is attempting to carve out a new stronghold in the mobile device market banking companies that add stock brokerage services and insurance and health maintenance organizations that sell both insurance and the delivery of health care are using convergence strategies too reinventing strongholds by contrast involves identifying new types of customers and products within existing industry definitions in the s for example motorcycles were largely judged by their engine power and unique style motorcycle segments were largely divided based on lightweight and heavyweight even though it offered lightweight machines harley davidson inc s stronghold was in heavier bikes making it king of the road in the s and s british rivals made performance more important using superior technology the british started producing lighter motorcycles with better fuel efficiency less noise and vibration and better handling this redefined the competitive landscape into two new segments high and low tech with the british establishing a stronghold in the high tech segment then in the mid to late s japanese competitors created a new customer segment and a new stronghold based on inexpensive high quality and small displacement motorcycles and marketing campaigns that targeted respectable people over time the japanese marketed larger motorbikes to responsible but adventurous riders commuters looking for reliable transportation and thrill seeking sports bikers so by the s strongholds were based on the type of user with harley strong among the rebels and weekend rebels and the japanese among the other types of riders with each redefinition of motorcycle strongholds over the past years the successful initiator gained ground while harley was initially weakened when the emphasis shifted to technology reliability and lower prices it later helped shift the division of the market again to branding and lifestyle which gave it a new clear stronghold from which to base its future growth moves in the third method of shape shifitng companies try to increase market share by recombining existing product or customer segments microsofts stronghold in desktop operating systems for instance expanded by incorporating adjacent segments into its suite of software windows rapidly added spreadsheet presentation and word processing programs an encyclopedia and an internet browser microsoft thus widened the boundaries of its operating system stronghold giving itself a strong base from which to stage attacks into the strongholds of others including network and server software internet portals and user interfaces for mobile devices while the five ss are presented as separate strategies they are often used in combination or in sequence and the lines between them are not always distinct they form a spectrum of options companies might use a defensive strategy on one front for example while using storming strategies on another companies need to think through the impact of moves and countermoves that can lead to chain reactions and ripple effects as companies move out of the way of each other voluntarily or not and as strongholds shift in shape very different market landscapes emerge in the end to protect and leverage the power of strongholds the use of the five ss must be governed by four principles anticipate ripple effects by understanding the changes in positioning of companies on the playing field and the potential redefinitions of the playing field companies can become more skilled in repositioning and redefining the field to their advantage it isnt always possible to think through every possible endgame in reality there is no endgame because the competitive interactions always continue but it is important to be aware of the dynamics and to develop scenarios about where they might lead strengthen your stronghold to hold back the ripples the strength of a strongholds barriers to entry the relative financial attractiveness of the stronghold the ability to use the five ss to advantage and the deep pockets generated from years of controlling a stronghold are just a few factors that affect the companys relative balance of power avoid the pressure of overpowering ripples companies not strong enough to resist ripples in their competitive space must flexibly move to re establish a stronghold in new space as ibm did when it migrated from its stronghold in mainframes to one in services a company can also sidestep the ripples for instance by focusing on international markets if the battle in the u s is too intense or by creating a new distribution channel once companies achieve new strongholds they often signal one another through public announcements in the hopes of maintaining separation among their strongholds which in turn allows them to build strength build a sphere of influence to create your own ripples the sphere is not just the stronghold and the territories adjacent to it it is how far the ripples from your stronghold extend throughout the marketplace a powerful sphere can maneuver competitors into corners reduce the risk of price wars through the threat of mutually assured destruction or shape the market to the mutual advantage of separate strongholds it can also create a favorable balance of power as ralston did against its rivals in the pet food space for companies seeking market power the object is ultimately to extend the power of the sphere this strategy can involve more than just the core product segments of the stronghold any part of a companys portfolio is important if it serves to preserve and protect value in the stronghold dont think only about whether a product segment contributes directly to the bottom line consider how noncore products and segments may prevent the erosion of the core by blocking steppingstone strategies of rivals or constraining the aggressive instincts of a rival or whether they can be used to force or lure rivals into less favorable product segments this is something often overlooked by securities analysts who believe in "pure play" portfolios and by those who believe a portfolio must be built by leveraging a core competency without regard to protecting a core stronghold the best strongholds can be more than a mere safe haven they create power and the purpose of stronghold strategy is to keep the balance of power in your favor prof daveni is a professor of
