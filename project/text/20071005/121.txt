weekend journal travel the finicky traveler downtown vibe uptown prices new wave of hip hotels raise rates add pampering a flood at &# a night as my husband and i approach the jade bar in the manhattans gramercy park hotel for an after dinner drink a young man with a clipboard intercepts us though were hotel guests apparently we need a reservation after p m both here and for the sanctum within the rose bar suddenly i feel like im back at studio in the s and i cant get past the velvet rope let alone into the vip lounge the feeling isnt so surprising because hip hotelier ian schrager whos made the renewal of this historic hotel his pet project was a founder of the long defunct disco fortunately before we get too downcast we learn that an even more exclusive bar awaits us on the rooftop for guests only and we dont need a reservation the gramercy park hotel is part of new wave of luxury boutique hotels in new york and other cities with a private club vibe atmospheric decor and the promise of first class services and amenities at a price many are opening in restored landmarks or buildings painstakingly designed to look like one atlantas ellis hotel opens oct on the citys highest hill in a building where a famous hotel fire took place while bostons liberty hotel opened last month in the storied charles street jail in portland ore the hotel deluxe opened last year in a building restored to recall old hollywood recently my husband and i tried the gramercy and farther downtown the rival bowery hotel finding both a refreshing if quirky change from stark minimalist hotels with mobbed lobby bar scenes and revelers lined up at the door par for the course at boutique hotels such as starwoods w chain and some of mr schragers earlier projects such as miamis delano mr schrager whos often credited with inventing the boutique concept says he plans to build eight or nine more "private label" boutique hotels such as the gramercy around the country he also recently signed a deal with marriott corp to create a chain of or more boutique hotels in the u s and overseas that combine a sophisticated and edgy look with great service "you will not be walking through a nightclub to get to your room " he promises "that was the idea years ago but its time for a new idea " of course the new challenge is to make hotel guests feel welcome when they arent sure if they can get into the bar or not at both hotels we found ourselves explaining that we were guests on more than one occasion and sometimes style trumps substance the designer lighting makes it hard to see in the gramercy hotel bathrooms and the deep marble tubs in the bowery can be hard to climb out of both the gramercy and the bowery have restaurants off their lobbies that are already attracting crowds and we had trouble getting a table at a decent hour at both the neighborhoods couldnt be less alike the gramercy hotel is known for the famous gated park it overlooks while the bowery area has plenty of new fancy construction but not long ago was called skid row but the hotels have more in common like mr schrager bowery co owner eric goode is an impresario of a bygone era club who embraced the hotel and restaurant business he was a partner in the funky downtown s nightclub area and both hotels want the same clientele hip yet grown up and deep pocketed when i walked into the gramercys lobby i could see why it takes six pages of publicity materials to describe the place opened last august in the original building the &# million plus project includes rooms and residences and it has an foot venetian glass chandelier suspended from a foot lobby ceiling supported by beams said to be of "reclaimed fumed cypress wood " rotating art exhibits include warhols basquiats and schnabels julian schnabel oversaw the whimsical decor and personally designed items like the solid bronze concierge desk and a lobby carpet made from a patchwork of th century style remnants we peeked into both bars the jade bar with its venetian mirrored sconces and bronze studded barstools and the rose with rose colored velvet upholstery and walls as for the rooftop garden and bar i loved it though after dinner it can get pretty smoky from cigars and four berry bellinis and a mineral water came to &# including an service charge when i asked if that was the gratuity our waitress joked "yes but feel free to give me &# extra " mr schrager to whom i spoke afterwards as usual i didnt identify myself in advance or during my stay says the bars policy is meant to keep them from becoming a mob scene he made headlines in the gossip columns shortly after opening by saying the likes of paris hilton and lindsay lohan were not welcome in the hotel bars "its nothing against them " he says adding "weve designed these bars for adults for conversation and for longevity " as for our room we went for grand paying &# for a one bedroom suite with huge picture windows overlooking the park rooms start at &# though as in all hotels cheaper rates may be available depending on occupancy stiff backed chairs covered in velvet and tapestry along with tufted leather sofas gave the living room a vintage look though it was dispelled by the big flat screen tv mounted on the wall and the ipod docking station with heavy red velvet drapes and a blue velvet upholstered bed our dimly lit bedroom was a bit like a bordello not necessarily a bad thing of course whoever designed the lighting in the powder room and the master bathroom with no tub just a shower had favored style over utility and clearly never had to apply eye makeup clear round bulbs with glowing filaments tied together like a bouquet of upside down flowers took the place of regular lights above or around the mirror if you stood far away you could barely see your face and if you leaned in too close the filaments were too bright and hot mr schrager says the lighting is meant to be both functional and stylish but says he will take another look the hotels restaurant wakiya chinese food prepared by a japanese chef had just opened so the food was a tad spotty but we enjoyed the people watching the hotels spa is really just a couple of treatment rooms off a large sunny fitness room that looks out on the park while my terrific masseuse really got the kinks out the thumping of the treadmill next door made it hard to relax guests can have treatments in their rooms we returned to the roof for breakfast supposed to be part of our room package but we were charged &# together for a relatively sparse buffet of fruit cereal and pastries our server said the bill would be adjusted by the desk when we checked out but i forgot to ask about it and it wasnt its a different world at the bowery faded rugs antiques and doilies over the backs of chairs give the lobby a vintage parlor feel the room hotel a red brick tower with factory style windows was built on the site of a gas station "everything is new but made to look old " the bellman said after telling the restaurant hostess who stepped in front of the entrance that we were guests we were able have a drink on a pretty outdoor terrace overlooking a green lawn thats part of the oldest nonsectarian cemetery in new york mr goode says that generally hotel guests should get favored treatment but no reservations are necessary and hes definitely not going for the "velvet rope" policy that makes guests feel excluded we had booked a suite at the bowery for &# rooms start at &# some rooms have terraces it offered a large seating area and window table that looked down on a defunct tattoo parlor and the famous street though spare and a tad dark the suite was comfortable with an upholstered headboard turkish rugs hardwood floors and sleek white italian linens trimmed in red we walked through the lobby to the packed but attractive restaurant gemma with decent italian trattoria food mr goode says the hotel is still working out some early kinks and plans improvements to the rooms such as adding reading lamps near the sofas he also plans a spa with a pool the white marble and tile bathroom with separate shower and high tub seemed great until my husband used the shower the next morning with no lip to separate the shower from the floor within a few minutes the water had flooded the bathroom and was spilling out into the room we used every towel and the two bathrobes to mop up the mess and reported the problem to the front desk where a young woman promised to send up new towels and someone to clean up after a delicious breakfast at gemma i returned to the room an hour later to find the mess still there i reported it again to another front desk staffer who said it was the first shed heard of it within a few minutes a staffer brought a pile of towels unfortunately i found out after hed left that they were just washcloths and small hand towels to avoid the shower problem i took a bath placing a few washcloths on the floor so i could step on them when i got out unfortunately the floor was still wet from the deluge and as i tried to hoist a leg over the edge of the tub the washcloth slid sending me sprawling the bruise was not pretty mr goode whom i spoke to by phone after my stay says the room i stayed in was designed for handicapped access with no barrier to the shower but that it should have drained quickly the hotel is planning to correct the problem by adding more "pitch" to the shower floor as for me i dried myself off with the remaining tiny towels and headed for the terrace off the lobby where the morning sun shone on the lawn and i had the place to myself as i read the paper on a couch i felt like an insider in a very exclusive club
