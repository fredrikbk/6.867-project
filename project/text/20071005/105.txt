weekend journal review books a terrible slog the day of battle by rick atkinson holt pages &# on feb a remarkable scene unfolded near monte cairo in southern italy a german courier bearing a white flag offered a truce to u s forces a chance for both sides to collect their dead the two armies had battered each other on various italian fronts for seven months the german couriers offer was accepted the grim work begun "there were bodies all over the hill and the odor was bad " a g i wrote in his diary but before long the troops were swapping cigarettes and family snapshots and "chattering about italian girls and favorite movie stars " a german soldier offered a handshake to an american "it is such a tragedy this life " he said then it was back to battle and a battlefield as unforgiving as any in world war ii the italian campaign from the invasion of sicily to the capture of rome serves as canvas for rick atkinsons "the day of battle " the majestic sequel to his pulitzer prize winning "an army at dawn " about the north african campaign of if "an army at dawn" was a generally spirit lifting account of the allied march across north africa "the day of battle" is the story of a terrible slog a long and harsh affair that to this day provokes debate about whether it was worth waging at all by summer a tide had begun to turn in favor of the allies though as mr atkinson notes "if the allied powers now possessed the strategic initiative the axis powers of germany italy and japan still held the real estate " operation husky an amphibious invasion of sicily was set in motion with the aim of taking back real estate and in the process diverting axis manpower and materiel from northern europe and the soviet front "great possibilities are open in this theatre " winston churchill opined the british believed that vanquishing italy would "unhinge rome and unbalance berlin " the americans had their doubts wasnt italy a sideshow the real prizes being france and then germany itself ultimately churchills arguments won over roosevelt and carried the day on the morning of july seven american and british divisions landed on two dozen beaches in southeastern sicily beginning a push that would in mr atkinsons phrase "reclaim for the allied cause the first acreage in europe since the war began " operation husky went well and moved quickly and in early september the allies attacked the mainland dwight eisenhower the supreme allied commander believed that the time had come "to discontinue nibbling at islands and hit the germans where it hurts " from the start there was trouble allied power met fierce german resistance and a host of other enemies malaria venereal disease confusion in the ranks even occasional incidents of fratricide there was inter command bickering too "tell montgomery to stay out of my way " gen george patton growled referring to the british gen bernard montgomery "or ill drive the krauts right up his ass " winter in the mountains of southern italy came early and hard and the germans built nearly impregnable defenses time and again allied momentum stalled commanders public brio notwithstanding "the germans are in fact in the very condition in which we want them " montgomery declared on nov "the road to rome is open " as mr atkinson notes dryly "alas no " in the months that followed the americans would absorb some of their worst drubbings of the war battle lines fogged hills were seized and lost and allied casualties reached the tens of thousands by february the two sides were as the u s gen mark w clark said like "two boxers in the ring both about to collapse " doubts about the entire endeavor haunted london and washington then the boxers were roused for one last round for the almost medieval hand to hand battles at monte cassino that came to symbolize the bravery and misery of the entire campaign cassino would stand for controversy too following the allied bombing of the towns sixth century abbey even an american general lamented the "needless destruction " writes mr atkinson "war was whittling it all away civility and moderation youth and innocence mountains and men " this is not new ground for historians but "the day of battle" covers it with distinction mr atkinsons achievement is to marry prodigious research with a superbly organized narrative and then to overlay the whole with writing as powerful and elegant as any great narrative of war along the way we get richly drawn portraits gen theodore roosevelt jr who says of himself "im anti bluff anti faker anti coward thats all" gen clark the senior u s field commander who was disliked by many and controversial in the end but of whom eisenhower would say "the best organizer planner and trainer of troops that i have ever met" and montgomery brilliant and arrogant small of stature resembling "a rather unsuccessful drygoods shopkeeper " as a canadian reporter put it "do you know why i never have defeats " mr atkinson quotes montgomery asking a canadian unit and answering "my reputation as a great general means too much to me you cant be a great general and have defeats " and then of course there is patton it will come as no surprise that the general who believed that war "brings out all that is best" plays an oversize role in the narrative even if others figured more in the outcome patton is seen here timing his pulse as he comes ashore "disgusted to find it slightly elevated " moments later he hollers at some slow footed soldiers "get your asses off the beach and go kill those kraut bastards " italy would also bring out the worst in patton in one infamous incident he slapped two convalescing privates and berated them for cowardice "for decades " notes mr atkinson "his name could hardly be uttered without conjuring not only his battlefield panache but also his reprehensible behavior " but the most memorable players in "the day of battle" have lesser known names g i s camped on hillsides burrowed in trenches men numbed by sleeplessness deprivation and the seemingly endless carnage "theyre not young anymore " theodore roosevelt jr wrote of his soldiers "theyre not the fresh smooth cheeked boys you saw at a dance more than two years ago " mr atkinson introduces dozens of these newly hard bitten men among them a year old captain named henry t waskow of whom a classmate had said "he was never young not in a crazy high school kid way " mr atkinson picks up capt waskows story along a ridge near san pietro "the captain had a sudden craving for toast when we get back to the states waskow said im going to get me one of those smart aleck toasters where you put the bread in and it pops up those were among his last mortal thoughts machine guns cackled mortars crumped and henry waskow pitched over without a sound mortally wounded by a shell fragment that tore open his chest he had never been young and he would never be old " "the day of battle" requires stamina from the reader though the challenge has much to do with the complex nature of the italian campaign itself at times one loses a sense of place are we at point or back at cassino but helpful maps dot the manuscript and in any event such confusing moments are rare on occasion mr atkinson reaches too far for a word "narthex " "contumacious" and "nugacities " to name a few perhaps he shares a quirk with one of his subjects maj gen fred walker described as "the sort of man who jotted down unfamiliar words to memorize " but these are minor matters the readers persistence will be richly rewarded at nearly every turn with an understanding of the italian theater and the valor of the men who fought there mr atkinson writes this account of the death of lt col jack toffey struck on highway just outside rome "veiled with a blanket toffeys mortal remains were laid on a stretcher and driven by jeep to the rear since landing on the beaches of morocco months earlier he had fought as faithfully as any battle commander in the u s army now his war was over his battle spent one comrade wrote that there will never be his like again but that was incorrect the country had produced enough of his ilk to finish the war jack toffey had helped win " indeed the country had though v e day was still months away the allies were not finished neither is rick atkinson "the day of battle" is volume two in his "liberation trilogy" of the war volume three the liberation of europe is due in four years time mr nagorski is a senior producer at abc news and the author of "miracles on the water the heroic survivors of a world war ii u boat attack "
