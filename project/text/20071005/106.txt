weekend journal review film lust caution is sumptuous but frosty repetitive thriller short on thrills michael clayton goes from bleak to poignant ang lees "lust caution " set in shanghai during the japanese occupation of china in world war ii grew and grew out of a short story by the late eileen chang the story about a young spy for the resistance and her intended victim is remarkable for its complexity and density its almost freeze dried yet accessible to the imagination in a few dozen pages changs narrative suggests the intricacies and ambiguities of sexual and political conquest the shifting frontier between eroticism and love and the paradox of theatrical performance a process of becoming by way of pretending the minute film in mandarin with english subtitles expands on all those themes and adds explicit sex scenes that have earned an nc rating sumptuously produced and beautifully visualized this is a filmmakers meditation on the culture that nurtured him as a piece of entertainment however its hoist by its own paradox an almost thrill free thriller that seems seductive yet stays resolutely remote the heroine wong chia chih an impressive screen debut by tang wei is a movie fan with a gift for acting that she discovered as a college student since her story resonates with "notorious" and "suspicion " were treated to fleeting hitchcock clips the plot is also similar to paul verhoevens recent and shamelessly entertaining "black book " pressed into service by young activists who loathe the puppet government installed by japan wang pretends to be mrs mak the wife of a hong kong businessman insinuates herself into the household of a brutal government official mr yee and seduces him in order to set him up for assassination hes played by tony leung chiu wai the hong kong actor who was so hypnotically soulful in "in the mood for love " this time his character conceals the existence of a soul as best he can the caution of the title is just as important as the lust what he soon reveals of himself is a sexual ferocity that befits a man who does the lethal bidding of a brutal government but mr yee is not only a brute and wong chia chih is not only an apprentice pretender trying to pull off a layered role that of an ambitious materialistic adulteress who falls victim to her own passion human interactions the film says and by extension international relations are more tangled than we can know or imagine theres so much to ponder in the screen adaptation by wang hui ling and james schamus that i kept wondering while watching why i found the action so uninvolving and the rhythms so repetitive the answer for me lies in the movies relentlessly somber self serious tone "lust caution" is obviously not an occasion for frivolity its about urgent purposes closed off characters and fateful events still some emotional variety would have been welcome at least around the edges take that cell of revolutionary students the college kids who draft wong chia chih for her dangerous mission they are in reality foolish dabblers and screw ups who might have become overtly comic characters in an early movie by godard not here though apart from a couple of amusing lines theyre deadly earnest and quite lifeless and the heroines motivation is playful at first at least thats what were told if not shown like many shy introspective people she discovers that acting turns her on to the point of personal liberation indeed the performers high is essential to the films equation mr yee too is liberated by role playing his own as well as hers yet theres rarely a trace of zest in what she does and no relief from the impassive face he turns to the world except in their sexual encounters which are less erotic than athletic acrobatic or even geometric in their graphic intensity a freeze dried story has been only partially defrosted michael clayton michael clayton " with george clooney as a world weary fixer for a fancy corporate law firm takes a different tack in its dramatic development tony gilroys film which marks his feature debut as a director seems terribly abstract at first this is a story of disparate pieces that demands close attention but investing ones attention pays off the pieces come together into a stirring portrait of a man reclaiming his soul from a scrap heap of discarded principles mr gilroys script is a relatively literal minded companion piece to "the devils advocate " a delightfully spirited fantasy that he co wrote and taylor hackford directed but thats all right the mind at work on this film is a sharp one and al pacinos earlier extravagance as lucifer at law has its counterpart in mr clooneys affecting gravity given who clayton was an assistant district attorney from a blue collar family of cops and the compulsive gambler and haunted divorced father hes become he can never be a source of much extravagance but thats provided in abundance in overabundance actually by tom wilkinsons performance as the law firms star litigator arthur edens who is brilliant but explosively bipolar when edens threatens in an access of grandiosity to blow the lid off the firms expensive defense of an agrochemical company u north with blood on its hands its michael claytons task to reel the rogue colleague in and claytons fate to see his own moral squalor in the mirror of edenss principled dementia sydney pollack plays the firms co founder a lower key lucifer named marty bach while tilda swinton plays u norths in house chief counsel shes no angel either most of the people in "michael clayton" are on the edge and their intensity can be oppressive so too can the incessant drumming of the sound track its the curse of tan dun plus the prologue of "nypd blue " in a film of essential seriousness and considerable bleakness thats been juiced up with suspense elements and a conventional car chase but george clooneys film noir sensibility in the title role feels authentic and admirably solid "im not a miracle worker im a janitor " the fixer tells a client who suddenly finds himself in a terrible fix be that as it may clayton is a poignant pilgrim in warm pursuit of a state of grace a correction last week i mistakenly identified the director of "feast of love" as robert newman the film was directed by robert benton who with david newman wrote "bonnie and clyde " a movie i must still have too much in mind dvd tip in contrast to "lust caution " a larger universe that expanded from a small short story the magical minutes of wong kar wais "in the mood for love" were distilled down over several years from a much longer movie that the filmmaker had originally made theres a lot to be said for distillation that can yield such a heady brew the film which stars tony leung and maggie cheung as next door neighbors in a hong kong apartment building in is a mood story more than a love story its all about sustaining a state of exquisite melancholy in the face of desire
