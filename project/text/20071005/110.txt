weekend journal sports by the numbers clutch pitching with the baseball playoffs under way the importance of clutch hitting is sure to be the topic of much conversation a late inning home run by david ortiz of the boston red sox would almost surely be taken as proof of his status as a clutch hitter and if that homer won a game or series for the red sox that would serve for many as proof that clutch hitting is a pivotal factor in deciding the outcome of the postseason but theres an argument to be made that the postseasons real clutch performers arent the guys at the plate but the ones on the pitchers mound remember that a hitter spends a very short amount of time at the plate and that the difference between being a hitter and a hitter is small in the short term only one hit in at bats theres much more evidence to support the existence of clutch pitching exhibit a new york yankee reliever mariano rivera his career era in regular season work plummets to in the postseason in a playoff series mr rivera may not throw harder in a clutch situation than he does in a routine august game but he may have a more fully realized strategy for each hitter and may stick to it more stringently and if having a clutch pitcher like mr rivera gives a team a leg up in the postseason not having one makes a bigger difference many pitchers can be overwhelmed in the postseason and get wild or tentative serving up a hanging slider or batting practice fastball to a grateful hitter wholl likely get credit for a clutch performance even baseballs top starters arent immune to this for example cy young front runner jake peavy of san diego had a record and era this season but in the and playoffs he was abysmal going with a era so his poor performance in mondays play in game against the colorado rockies isnt all that uncharacteristic and playoff underachievement doesnt always even out over a career mr peavys teammate greg maddux has a cooperstown worthy regular season record but his postseason career mark is this postseason will be interesting because so many pitchers will experience postseason pressure for the first time the new guys would do well to follow the example of two red sox starters through wednesday nights playoff game josh beckett has a postseason era two runs better than his career mark of his teammate curt schilling has an equally impressive postseason resume a era and an record jamie moyer of the philadelphia phillies has also been very good in october era livan hernandez of the arizona diamondbacks has a postseason mark and a era players with less than stellar postseason resumes may see little or no action in the early rounds tim wakefield is off bostons postseason roster and for good reasons a sore back and a career postseason era mike mussina who has a career postseason record could go for the yankees in game four against cleveland so as you watch the playoffs throughout the month applaud the heroics of the hitters if you must but know that its the pitchers who really perform in the clutch or not
