spotlight on safety practices in the mining and minerals industries which have rushed to meet a four year surge in global demand for commodities it also raised questions about the turnaround at mine operator harmony gold mining co one of the worlds largest gold producers which is trying to rebound from management turmoil and declining production the last of the workers was released yesterday from the elandsrand mine near carletonville southwest of johannesburg with no reports of fatalities or serious injuries production will stay halted while the incident is investigated the mine accounted for about of harmonys production of million troy ounces in the fiscal year ended june the accident and rescue operation come amid the biggest surge in demand for commodities in a generation with oil metals minerals and grain prices soaring natural resource companies particularly oil and mining concerns have scrambled to take advantage of prices at the same time a rush for equipment and labor has sent costs soaring safety at large international miners has improved in recent years say mine safety and health consultants because of increased automation and better rescue equipment but overall fatalities in the mining industry have crept up in several nations the u s private mining industry saw fatalities last year up from in according to the bureau of labor statistics according to south africas department of minerals and energy there were fatalities reported at mines this year through july compared with in the same period last year reported fatalities for all of last year totaled the government said though south africas national union of mineworkers says deaths totaled the union which represents miners has asked the government to strengthen safety enforcement and raise penalties for violations some industry officials dispute any link between increased demand for commodities and accidents "we have no experience showing there is a relationship showing higher prices for commodities leads to lower safety " said luke popovich spokesman for the u s based national mining association he said increased prices lead to increased profits allowing the companies to invest more in safety "it may be counterintuitive but companies are willing to spend more money on safety equipment when the prices are higher " he said still international labor groups are pushing safety reform at the worlds mines and the adoption of global operating standards for certain minerals after high profile accidents in the u s south africa china and elsewhere the united nations international labor organization estimates that miners are killed on the job each year or about a day mining accounts for of the global work force but makes up about of job related fatalities the group says the group doesnt track changes over time "theres a rush into the investment of mining in general " says manfred warda general secretary of the international federation of chemical energy mine and general workers unions which represents million workers in countries quick development is difficult to manage even for companies and countries with good safety records he says the federation based in brussels is holding two meetings in coming months in india and russia to discuss safety and ways to organize more workers of particular concern is the coal industry in august a flood killed miners in two chinese coal mines and in march more than workers died in an explosion at a coal mine in russia the federation is pushing for the adoption of new global coal safety standards developed earlier this year by company worker and government representatives these set acceptable limits of explosive methane and guidelines for cleaning up highly combustible coal dust near conveyor belts among other changes in the u s the united mine workers of america is lobbying congress for legislation that would mandate quicker adoption of two way communications devices and other safety enhancements the deaths this summer of nine coal miners in utah following an accident drew widespread public attention though this years tally of fatalities in coal mining still trails last years which included an accident in west virginia that killed scrutiny is falling in particular on the way higher prices may affect conditions at older mines higher prices have made even older higher cost assets economically
