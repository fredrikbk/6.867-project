politics &amp economics farm bill withers in the absence of a strongman senate infighting stalls progress exposes gap in democrat leadership washington a stalled farm bill debate in congress exposes a gap in the democratic leadership there is no single strongman to force deals upon three senate committee chairmen who all want a hand in agriculture policy senate majority leader tom daschle played that role in the last big farm bill five years ago and even republicans who helped bring down the south dakota democrat in now miss him "when daschle walked in it was like gen patton everything sort of came together " says rep frank lucas r okla "theres no gen patton this time " theres no senate farm bill either two months after the house passed its version senate agriculture committee chairman tom harkin d iowa was forced to again postpone action yesterday for lack of a consensus among democrats last evening the senate finance committee approved a &# billion tax relief and disaster aid package dubbed the " h bill" that the panels chairman sen max baucus d mont will meld with the larger farm measure the tax writers voted to codify tighter federal rules for determining whether a tax shelter transaction that cuts a companys liabilities has true "economic substance " but more of the added revenues generated would go to funding a new &# billion disaster aid trust fund important for drought prone montana than to relieving budget problems facing mr harkin "im very insistent that this be paid for and its hard to do " said senate budget committee chairman kent conrad d n d the third major player in the farm debate "people are not going to be able to get everything theyd like to have this is just reality and we need to face up to it " together with mr harkin messrs baucus and conrad sit on the senates agriculture panel the forge where democratic leaders are still hoping a deal can be hammered out senate majority leader harry reid d nev who served under mr daschle but has little of his background in agriculture will face pressure to intercede if the delays persist already his hands off approach contrasts with that of house speaker nancy pelosi d calif who steeped herself in the details of the house bill brokering deals and directing tax writers to provide added revenue to keep her rural urban coalition together adopted in july the five year &# billion house bill extends major loan and price support programs for producers but also tightens subsidy payments and requires more program transparency fruit and vegetable growers are promised new assistance food stamp benefits would be updated and expanded nutrition aid provided for children in developing countries important to the house bill was an infusion of revenue from offshore oil leases and a tax provision raising an estimated &# billion from foreign corporations with u s subsidiaries such as sony corp and nissan motors co ms pelosi prevailed with largely democratic support but the threshold to avert a filibuster is higher in the senate and mr baucus appears reluctant to challenge the powerful multinationals that would be affected mr baucuss tax package provides modest budget relief for mr harkin by creating a new optional tax credit for farmers who put land in a conservation reserve program this could reduce government payments by several billion dollars but thats the equivalent of about half the extra revenues the house had in the first five years and the gap grows wider over time mr harkins problem then is he begins with less available money than the house rather than digging himself out of this hole he has antagonized colleagues by insisting that the senate add about &# billion more than the house for conservation and rural development programs mr conrad has walked him back from what appeared to be politically unrealistic cuts from commodity programs but differences remain and the senate is historically an arena where populist midwest demands for strict subsidy limits run into cotton and rice interests allied with southern democrats and republicans with a new fiscal year under way portions of the farm bill have already expired but the real crunch will come in december and january when farmers begin to talk to bankers about their next crop year mr harkin hopes to get his committee back together again in two weeks to produce a bill that can be moved quickly to the senate floor but supporters fear there will be growing pressure to simply reauthorize the current commodity programs without any change for another crop year going into the elections failure to produce a farm bill would be a setback for ms pelosis hopes of democratic gains in rural areas
