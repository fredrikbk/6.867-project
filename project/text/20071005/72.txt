politics &amp economics inter koreas pact is seen as light on substance seoul south korea south korean president roh moo hyun waited nearly five years and provided &# billion in aid for the chance to meet north korean leader kim jong il for all that mr roh got little more than fleeting smiles from a three day meeting with mr kim in pyongyang the two leaders ended their summit the second between korean leaders since the country was split years ago by signing an agreement to continue talking about economic opportunities and a peace treaty that would formally end the korean war of but the pact was worded so vaguely lacking deadlines incentives and penalties that the two men apparently committed to little more than having lower level officials talk again next month south korean officials who remained in seoul to distribute information about the events in pyongyang held no briefings and provided little elaboration on the eight point document the agreement said nothing about the issues that make many people angry about mr kims dictatorship such as its pursuit of nuclear weapons and its imprisonment of tens of thousands of north koreans in gulags and work camps the agreement required no substantive changes in the norths political or economic structure however north korea could reap construction projects and other benefits valued at hundreds of millions of dollars if it follows up on the agreement south korea said it is willing to help rebuild a highway and train line on the west side of north korea from the inter korean border to the norths border with china a project estimated at &# million south korea also said it is ready to help the north build shipbuilding complexes in two north korean cities and create a new tourist complex at mt baektu on the chinese border of north korea and a commercial fishing zone in a border area of the west sea government directed taxpayer funded projects were the hallmark of south koreas rise from poverty in the s and s by applying the same formula in an attempt to lift the impoverished north mr roh and his aides hope to appeal to the centralized nature of mr kims regime in the process south korean leaders hope that joint economic projects will teach ordinary north koreans about capitalism and democracy but with mr rohs term ending in february it is uncertain that the next south korean president will follow through on any of his economic offers lee myung bak the nominee in the conservative grand national party for decembers election issued a statement that praised the outreach to the north but criticized mr roh for not getting mr kim to commit to denuclearization the centrist liberal party to which mr roh belongs hasnt chosen a nominee and mr roh cant run again mr kim is unlikely to welcome projects that would undermine his grip on north korea his wariness of the souths overtures apparent in the sullen manner with which he greeted mr roh on tuesday remained visible to the end mr kim didnt smile when he signed the joint document yesterday or when the two men shared a toast afterward he did smile at their farewell lunch after their first lengthy meeting wednesday mr roh told members of the south korean delegation that he felt mr kim didnt trust his use of words like "reform" and "openness " in another sign of the norths cool reception of mr roh the picture that dominated the front page of the countrys four newspapers on wednesday showed little of his face and nearly all of mr kims at the first inter korean summit in the norths papers ran a picture of then south korean president kim dae jung and the norths mr kim from the same angle says brian myers a specialist on north korea propaganda at dongseo university in busan "this is part of the general effort to portray the summit as a meeting between kim jong il and the south korean masses " mr myers said "they downplay the importance of the south korean president whose legitimacy they do not recognize " sungha park contributed to this article
