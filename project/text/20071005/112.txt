weekend journal taste houses of worship up in alms burmas dictators exploit buddhism and the monks fight back aung san suu kyi burmas nobel peace prize laureate described the lessons she had learned from her countrys hsayadaws its buddhist holy teachers in an article for a japanese newspaper in one of them told her what it would be like to fight for democracy in burma "you will be attacked and reviled for engaging in honest politics but you must persevere lay down an investment in dukkha suffering and you will gain sukha bliss " last week saw hundreds of burmas monks investing in dukkha as they confronted the nations military regime at one point a large crowd of them gathered outside aung san suu kyis house in yangon where she has spent of the past years under house arrest she came to the gate in the pouring rain and was allowed to greet them this single poignant moment summed up all that was most extraordinary about the demonstrations as well as what was most frightening to burmas military junta within a few days scores of monks were in jail many had been beaten and the trickle of reports emanating from the country indicated that monasteries had been ransacked as the military hunted down the last rebellious elements reports in the new light of myanmar the official newspaper blamed a few bad seeds who had infiltrated the monastic orders for inciting the protests pro democracy activists have admitted to taking cover in the monasteries to avoid being jailed but these are footnotes in a much larger tussle in burma over the use and practice of buddhism which became visible to the world during the past week this boils down to the issue of which political ideology is a more fitting reflection of burmas theravada buddhism military dictatorship or democracy while the answer should be obvious the military has done all it can to tilt the balance its way burma is a patchwork of ethnicities languages and religious practices the struggle to keep it together has been the key narrative for the successive military governments dominated by majority ethnic burmans that have run the country since the military has used this struggle to justify economic and democratic deprivation furthermore despite the juntas flagrant disregard for the five principles of buddhism abstention from killing stealing engaging in sexual misconduct lying and using intoxicants its members seize every chance to depict themselves as buddhisms true guardians not a week goes by without the state media reporting a generals contribution or visit to a temple even as burma has slid into poverty the government has funded lavish new temples and the regilding of the famous golden pagodas the military has also built pagodas as a means of asserting ethnic burman sovereignty in areas where other groups live and islam or christianity is the prevailing religion this practice dates back to the burmese kings who built pagodas in neighboring kingdoms as a way of establishing a lasting claim to rule for most of the past century there have always been a few politically active monks under british rule monks were jailed for urging the burmese not to adopt british forms of dress and religious practice under military rule monks have been at the forefront of the opposition the extent of the monks role as the national conscience can be seen in the measures taken by the military to organize and co opt the monastic orders during the democracy protests of monks were among the people killed in on the second anniversary of those killings more than monks and novices walked through mandalay soldiers confronted them and opened fire killing two across the country monks responded by refusing to accept alms from members of the military or their families by denying the military the ability to give alms the monks were denying them the opportunity to make "merit" for their present and future lives monasteries were raided hundreds of monks were arrested and a new law was introduced placing the "sangha" the monastic orders under government regulation anyone setting up new orders or protesting or agitating within this new sangha framework could now be jailed for up to three years the military could have risked closing down the monasteries altogether but not only are the generals frightened and superstitious but they also use certain elements of buddhist philosophy to justify and strengthen their position one is "samsara " a complex idea involving the interplay of the mind and physical matter and the cycles of existence it has come to mean a view of life as fleeting and thus not worth complaining about everything is impermanent and life is hard so feeling powerless is not a consequence of a political situation which can be changed but an existential fact another element abused by the military is "dana " the act of giving without expecting a reward when accused of using forced labor to build infrastructure and pagodas the generals have said the unpaid workers are simply practicing dana since she returned to burma in aung san suu kyi has become a far more devout buddhist than she was before many of her imprisoned supporters practice buddhist meditation as a means of surviving burmas jails the monks of course know this just as well as they know the true natures of the generals who offer them tributes choosing between the two has put them in the center of the fight for burmas future mr delves broughton is a writer who lives in new york
