the pyongyang precedent president bush is hailing this weeks nuclear disarmament deal with north korea as a diplomatic triumph and even a precedent for negotiating with iran if he really believes that mr bush owes more of an explanation or the mullahs in tehran will have ample reason to relax when the white house announced this deal last february we called it "faith based nonproliferation " and events have only confirmed that judgment north korea is still only promising to disclose all of its nuclear program this time by the end of the year in february it promised the declaration in days meanwhile the bush administration is doing what it said in february it would never do provide aid and recognition to kim jong ils regime in advance of his keeping his side of the bargain more than "faith " this is hope and charity too the one tangible bit of progress is that pyongyang has agreed to "dismantle" its nuclear plant at yongbyon by the end of the year the u s will also be able to send its own inspectors to the site which is better than relying on verification provided by the international atomic energy agency but the world already knew about yongbyon which was "inspected" for years before the iaea was expelled in that still leaves the norths weapons as well as its stockpile of plutonium which was presumably used to make the nuclear device it exploded last year and it doesnt explain the status of the norths clandestine uranium program which it boasted about a few years ago but now denies having u s negotiator chris hill says those details will be on the agenda for the next round of talks but nothing in the accord suggests how any of this would be verified this may explain why no one is talking any longer about the "irreversible" shutdown of the norths nuclear program to use a word heard often in the first years of the bush administration meantime the u s will be busy aiding and rehabilitating kims regime energy aid worth &# million will soon flow joining cash and investment from south korea most puzzling the u s has agreed to begin the process of dropping north korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism it will do so even though as recently as last week treasury imposed new sanctions on a north korean company for illegal missile exports and despite credible reports that north korea is sharing nuclear knowledge with syria last month the washington post quoted government sources as saying that "israel shared intelligence with president bush this summer indicating that north korean nuclear personnel were in syria " north korea denies helping syria though a u s official presumably mr hill was quoted in the new york times yesterday as saying "we did not achieve clarity on this issue but that does not mean we do not intend to keep trying " in other words the u s is going to wink at the proliferation of nuclear know how to an american enemy in the middle east in the name of declaring a great "nonproliferation" victory all of this is startling enough that even former clinton administration officials are calling it too accommodating former nonproliferation aide gary samore told the washington post yesterday that hes puzzled by the "lack of a process to verify the declaration " and jack pritchard who left the bush administration in the first term because he thought it took too hard a line on north korea now says the north feels it can get anything it wants from a bush administration desperate for a diplomatic triumph wed like to think that isnt true that perhaps theres some larger calculation here that isnt obvious the only such strategy we can surmise is that mr bush has somehow come to believe he has bigger problems elsewhere and thus that containing north korea with diplomacy is the best that can be done in his final months as president china is next door to help keep north korea in line and in the best case opening the kim regime up to the world will hasten its demise thats taking a lot on faith especially given the news from syria thats also the same bet the clinton administration made with its agreed framework which kim eventually repudiated without opening up even to south korea much less to the world but at least it has some plausibility what isnt credible is mr bushs assertion that this is somehow a precedent for negotiating with tehran theres no other regional power to restrain iran the way china can influence north korea and tehran is far less isolated to the contrary the lesson the mullahs are likely to draw from the pyongyang precedent is that theyll be in a far stronger military and diplomatic position if they sprint to build a bomb if so mr bushs new faith in nonproliferation promises will prove to have been dangerously misplaced see related letter "letters to the editor payoff diplomacy" wsj oct
