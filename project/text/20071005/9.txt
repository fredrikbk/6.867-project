ahead of the tape weak economy doesnt always spell job losses schools in session and todays lesson is fun with employment statistics last month investors got a jolt from august jobs figures the labor department said that the economy had lost jobs the first decline in four years the dow jones industrial average fell points that day economists polled by dow jones newswires expect to see a rebound in todays report with jobs added to u s payrolls in september one wild card is the way the government counts teacher jobs the august report registered a loss of public school teaching jobs which came on top of lost teaching jobs in july "while it is possible that some school districts around the country have downsized this year we think it is more likely a number of districts have simply changed the timing of the start of their school year " economists at lehman brothers noted ahead of the report actually the number of districts that changed the start of their school years is texas size and then some this year texas mandated that its school districts begin school no earlier than aug a move popular with both parents and the tourism industry in florida schools werent allowed to open until aug between them the two states represent of the u s school age population when the labor department counts jobs it includes only those workers on the rolls for the pay period including the th of the month many teachers dont draw paychecks through the summer the labor department adjusts the figures for the summer months in recent years this adjustment has become progressively smaller as more schools moved toward early start dates now florida and texas are at the leading edge of a backlash against early start dates the labor departments adjustment model which is based on whats happened in the past likely hasnt picked it up yet the best way to deal with the teaching job confusion may be to ignore it and simply look at whats happening with private sector payrolls some commentators expect investors will do exactly that that brings up tomorrows lesson does it make sense to think the market is that rational despite all of the hubbub in the markets after last months report private sector employment was actually fairly stable soft but growing slightly the jobs report might resolve some other recent mysteries the august employment report showed a big drop in teenage employment which is odd when you consider that all those kids in texas and florida werent in school manufacturing jobs showed a big drop in august even though the institute for supply managements manufacturing report suggested that they were growing on the other side of the ledger construction and real estate jobs still dont seem to have caught up with the downturn in housing the bigger question is whether apparent weakness in the economy will translate into broader job losses it may not after the last recession hiring never grew the way past experience suggested it would one implication of companies still high profit margins is that they are running very lean in contrast to a jobless recovery we may be in for a job loss less downturn send comments to justin lahart wsj com
