weekend journal review television fever in the brain it may be that "chuck " nbcs new comedy action series mondays p m edt owes a part of its appeal to low expectations to appreciate just how low those might be its only necessary to know that the story concerns a computer geek who has trouble finding a girl thanks to problems in the self esteem department and that this characters already beclouded mind is to become the repository for the top secret files of u s intelligence agencies to appreciate how well this nerd within the cia and nsa nonsense actually works out its only necessary to watch the panache with which the cast of "chuck" carouses through the first episodes nor does it take much time to note the shows refreshingly unserious spirit and lack of pretension particularly as compared with the unrelenting high solemnity of "heroes " which "chuck" precedes the chuck in question portrayed by zachary levi holds a grim job at the buy more computer store he spends considerable time pondering his failures with women his weaknesses and general lack of a place in the world none of this the sort of thing that would make him an appealing figure its mr levi who manages that who imbues this character with a consistent effortless seeming charm that somehow never appears at odds with chucks hapless condition it doesnt hurt either that for all his characters worries about not getting a second date mr levis lanky good looks are always in evidence and effective despite the short sleeves and untucked shirt the producers have figured appropriate for the nerd look chucks worries about women soon give way to others far greater which descend when he opens a subliminally encoded email message that causes cia and nsa files to imprint themselves in his brain forget the billowing shirt this nerd now has secrets in his head that bring agents of both intelligence agencies to watch over him the result is often plain hilarious and when not hilarious there is plenty that is engaging as expert hands carry off wonderful deadpan spoofs of martial arts and james bond weaponry one lovely battle between chucks cia protector sara walker yvonne strahovski and a deadly enemy takes place in a restaurant kitchen where sara is undercover as a chef a struggle that employs a fabulous variety of weapons among them all the food in the kitchen including a french fried potato that ms strahovski slings with convincing deadly force chucks other protector nsa agent maj john casey is also undercover as a worker in the buy more computer store hes subjected to all the vicissitudes of employment that clerks have to endure including lectures on the use and nature of the price scanner adam baldwin steals every scene as the menacing casey the price scanner must be treated carefully its an expensive piece of hand held equipment his store trainer chuck instructs him "so is a stealth fighter " the seething casey cant help snarling "but i somehow managed to fly that " in short the writing is adroit the performances irresistible the sheer fun of it all unmistakable where this comedy series by josh schwartz and chris fedak goes from here is hard to know but it is surely now among the brighter spots on the nbc schedule the new five part miniseries "five days " which had its premiere on hbo earlier this week tuesdays p m carries unmistakable echoes of "prime suspect " none of them accidental for some time hbo executives and viewers have been looking for a dramatic series even remotely equal to that one which made helen mirren an overnight star in the u s work of that order doesnt come along often and it hasnt arrived in "five days" those who missed part one can catch an encore monday p m which bears in quality not the smallest resemblance to "prime suspect " this doesnt mean that it isnt a compelling diversion compelling enough that is to keep a viewer returning for the next segment notwithstanding persistent irritations among them one would have to include above all a script that attempts commentary on the sociology of suburban london on race on the media the broken family the sorrows of old age the plight of the abandoned young and more all within a complicated tale of a mysteriously disappeared woman a cheerful appearing and devoted mother leanne wellings one day crosses the road to buy flowers leaving her two small children and their newly adopted dog in the car that is the last her children see of her from here on the police move in all too slowly family members will later think the series is at its best in these early segments which capture eloquently the plight of family and intimates left to cope with an unaccountable sudden disappearance it is all grimly evident in the wellings family in their inventions of comforting possibilities nobody seriously believes their unappeasable anguish their rage at the police who can tell them nothing their certainty from the outset even before any indication that anything untoward has actually happened that life will never be the same again by the time the mystery ends with episode fives bordering on the silly improbable resolution weve had a persuasive immersion in the ways tragedy of this kind can destroy every tie that binds and ensure indeed that life is never the same again as a mystery "five days" is standard issue stuff packed to the gills with red herrings and ominous portents signifying nothing as a portrait of a kind of family agony so often chronicled in detail these days on all news cable networks its all the more powerful for its familiarity
