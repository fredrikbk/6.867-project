why two museums are now going at it hammer and tongs one in alaska shows tools one in los angeles art will mr pahl get nailed haines alaska in this picturesque fishing town sits a four room museum dedicated to hammers hammers used by cobblers woodworkers and bankers hammers for pounding sugar and pounding fences the specimens that line the walls range from everyday claw hammers to a roman battle ax from a d used to crush bones and cut flesh the hammer museum is a tribute by enthusiast dave pahl to the oldest human tool mr pahl created the museum in building on a personal collection but now the tiny hammer museum may have a big problem a much larger institution in los angeles that used to be called the armand hammer museum of art has dropped the "armand" and is also calling itself the hammer museum last year it filed an application to trademark the name when mr pahl found out about that this past summer he filed his own trademark application now both applications are pending at the u s patent and trademark office if one museum is granted the mark it could stop the other from using the name that could be a big blow to mr pahl who has already lost the domain rights to hammermuseum com to the bigger museum and who has little money and no lawyers to help him fight his case the los angeles museum has two dozen lawyers and millions in annual revenue "this little museum is trying hard to stay afloat " says mr pahl haines population is at the northern end of alaskas inside passage a town nestled among glaciers lakes and snowcapped mountains in the fall thousands of bald eagles descend to feed on the late salmon run summers bring tourists many of them from cruise ships the hammer museum admission &# is one of the few indoor tourist attractions one morning recently visitor jerry mccaw of cantrall ill asked mr pahl whether he had a hammer made by minneapolis moline for use with its tractors yup right on the wall "i thought i had him on that one " mr mccaw said the moline mr pahl piped up is indeed a rarity mr pahl who is years old moved to alaska from the cleveland area in to escape city life he greets museum visitors in a stained sweatshirt and baseball cap over the years he has worked as a shipwright he has run a one man sawmill and he has built three log cabins in the summer he helps tie up cruise ships that dock here mr pahl started his tool collection when he built his first log cabin and got serious when he checked out antique shops on a road trip across the south in he decided to specialize in hammers "it wasnt too bad in the beginning " said his wife carol then along came the internet "when we got a computer then he realized he could access antique stores ebay tool dealers it just opened up a world of hammers " by he owned hammers and began thinking about opening a little museum he bought a small house on main street and in formally opened for business those who visit the museum are often amazed by the variety of hammers on display more than others are in storage a wooden hammer feet tall stands outside there are quarryman hammers drilling hammers check canceling hammers bicycle hammers cattle stunning hammers log stamp hammers and an asian gong hammer there is a tiny hammer given as a political trinket urging upstate new yorkers to elect e watson gardiner to congress in he lost there is a wheel tapper hammer used by railroad workers to check for cracks as mr pahl prepared to close shop for the winter in september he worried that his tiny museum might lose its right to call itself what it is he found out about the art museums trademark application earlier this year after a friend sent him an article about the museum reaching a separation agreement with its governing body the hammer foundation until then the museum had to use its full name the armand hammer museum of art and cultural center the museum was created in from the personal collection of armand hammer the late chairman of occidental petroleum corp now it could just call itself "the hammer museum " on a hunch mr pahl searched the trademark offices web site and found the l a museums pending trademark application he then filed his own who wins the trademark ultimately will be decided by which museum first used the name "hammer museum" in commerce says lynne g beresford commissioner for trademarks the alaska museum says it began using the name in april when it received its business license the los angeles museum has yet to tell the trademark office when it first used the name but spokeswoman miranda carroll says the museum can date its first use of the name to a brochure refers to the "ucla hammer museum " once it files that date with the trademark office the los angeles museum is likely to be granted the trademark because there are no existing trademarks in its way if the alaska museum challenges the decision an appeals board would determine who used "hammer museum" first mr pahl is feeling outmuscled both museums are nonprofit corporations but the los angeles museum admission &# had &# million in revenue last year mr pahls museum brought in &# half from t shirt sales three top officials at the los angeles museum each earn more than &# mr pahl volunteers his time mr pahl couldnt afford a lawyer to file his application to the trademark office so he did it himself after reading the rules online on its application the los angeles museum lists lawyers ms carroll says her museum has no interest in stopping the alaska museum from calling itself the hammer museum "as we are a fine art museum in california not a museum of hammers in alaska we think we have very different audiences " she says but she adds "i believe we would defend our case from any challenge if we were granted the trademark " mr pahl has already suffered one setback at the hands of the los angeles museum he used to own the domain rights to both hammermuseum org and hammermuseum com but last fall when he failed to renew his rights to hammermuseum com the l a museum snapped it up and wont sell it back to him its lawyer offered to buy hammermuseum org and mr pahl refused so there it stands the museums lawyer stafford matthews of morrison &amp foerster llp in san francisco declined to comment for now the los angeles museum isnt using hammermuseum com ms carroll says its web site www hammer ucla edu must include the ucla name because the museum is affiliated with the university asked why the museum acquired hammermuseum com she said it is "good business practice" to acquire as many relevant domain names as possible in case plans change eric goldman an expert on trademark law at santa clara university school of law says the two museums could coexist with the same name if the appeals board determines there is no likelihood that they would be confused with each another but he adds web usage might add a complication "two hammer museums on the internet is confusing "
