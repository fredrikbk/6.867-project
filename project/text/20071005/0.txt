a bright line is needed between experimental and approved drugs i applaud the freedom of choice and patient engagement advocated by richard miller ceo of a company that makes cancer drugs "choice in health care " editorial page sept but i am concerned about his attempt to blur what should be a very bright line between experimental drugs not approved by the fda and approved drugs dr miller would have us believe there is little difference between using approved drugs for off label purposes and using experimental drugs not yet approved by the fda that glosses over a crucial point patients rely on the fda to vet their medications for safety and quality as well as efficacy even approved drugs used for off label purposes offer patients a minimal expectation of safety dr millers contention that terminally ill patients have a right to any experimental medications eliminates even that expectation we may also lose a key motivation for companies to undertake well designed drug trials the only way we have to develop science based data of efficacy we need this data for the sake of finding out whether promising medications are truly beneficial after the fact outcome research is a poor substitute because it takes so long for even serious problems to surface it took millions of doses of vioxx to result in the hundreds of deaths that persuaded its maker to withdraw it and that was for a drug that went through the fda process we support patients being involved in decisions about their care which is already difficult given the scarcity of information and we support the right to evidence based data even for terminally ill patients helen sherman r ph pharm d senior director chief pharmacy officer regencerx regence bluecross blueshield portland ore dr miller correctly argues that the fda is dangerously limiting the medication choices of cancer patients but he starts his argument by misrepresenting sen hillary clintons plan to set the record straight the clinton plan does not "seek to spur greater patient choice of insurers " sen clinton promises that everyone who is already insured will be able to keep the coverage they have today that is unlikely the clinton plan creates rules that all insurers must follow here are a few "excessive premiums" will not be allowed that sounds good until you realize that limits on what your health policy can cost become limits on how much is in the pot to take care of you when youre sick on the other hand your policy must include "coverage for preventive services " if you currently have a high deductible policy covering only large expenses such as a hospital stay youll have to change in fact your ability to stay with private insurance rather than a government program may not last long the clinton plan empowers government to limit health insurance profits limiting the profits of the most unpopular industry in america may sound good but if profits are pressed too low investors will flee to other industries and the choice of private insurance will become a thing of the past betsy mccaughey chairman committee to reduce infection deaths new york it is exciting that the upcoming presidential primary election has sparked so much interest and discussion concerning health care reform not since the creation of the medicare system in the s and the clinton administrations attempt at health care reform has there been such passion for the topic dr millers article addresses an important sidebar issue the disclosure of data related to reform but frequently in the background of discussion our right to information as stated in the freedom of information act should entitle us to access information from medical sources without violating privacy or confidentiality we are not able to make informed choices about our health care if information is withheld information contained in data bases like the medicare claims data base and the national practitioner data base npdb is kept off limits to the public withholding such information is self serving to a minority of people i applaud the consumer group consumers checkbook which successfully sued the department of health and human services to allow disclosure of specific data about physicians from the medicare claims data base i agree with judge emmet g sullivan who stated that release of the information would be a significant public benefit therese naimark r n pittsburgh
