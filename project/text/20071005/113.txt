weekend journal taste more but not merrier there is a spanish proverb that warns "life without a friend is death without a witness " in the world of online social networking web sites such as myspace and facebook the warning might be simpler "life without hundreds of friends is virtual death " on these sites friendship is the raison detre "a place for friends" is the slogan of myspace facebook describes itself as a "social utility that connects people with friends " friendsters name speaks for itself it is not unusual for users of online social networking sites to have hundreds or even thousands of "friends " but as a recent study suggests the multitudes of virtual acquaintances that people are eagerly acquiring are not likely to replace real world friendships evolutionary psychologist will reader of sheffield hallam university in britain described the results of the study which he presented at the british association festival of science "although the numbers of friends people have on these sites can be massive the actual number of close friends is approximately the same in the face to face real world " most people have five close friends mr readers research found that this number was no different among users of social networks in other words friendship in hypertext might provide the illusion of popularity and a wealth of online acquaintances but online friends are unlikely to transform your real world social life although friendship is notoriously difficult to define in its traditional sense it is a relationship that broadly speaking involves the sharing of interests reciprocity trust and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social and cultural contexts because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world it can flourish only within the boundaries of privacy the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron social networks foster a different form of friendship one that is public fluid and promiscuous yet oddly bureaucratized sites such as myspace or facebook dont allow users to distinguish among various types of personal relationships your lover your best friend your work colleague and your mother are all "friends" in this world and are all categorized in the same way online the sites encourage a form of relationship socialism abolishing class distinctions for the greater good of acquiring as many "friends" as possible friendship in the online social networking world also focuses a great deal on collecting managing and ranking the people you know everything about myspace for example is designed to encourage users to gather as many friends as possible as if friendship is a form of stamp collecting if you are so unfortunate as to have only one myspace friend for example your page reads "you have friends " and below there is a stretch of sad empty space where dozens of thumbnail photos of your acquaintances should appear this encourages a form of frantic friend procurement an associate dean at purdue university recently boasted to the christian science monitor that since establishing a facebook profile he had collected more than friends there are even services such as friendflood com that act as social networking pimps for a fee they will post messages on your page from an attractive person posing as your "friend " "to have in excess of friends is not uncommon" in the world of social networks mr reader told one british newspaper henry adamss observation "one friend in a lifetime is much two are many three are hardly possible " seems prehistoric in this context friendship is now about collection rather than cultivation the structure of social networking sites also encourages the bureaucratization of friendship each site has its own terminology but among the words that users employ most often is "managing " as a survey by the pew foundation found "teens say social networking sites help them manage their friendships " there is something orwellian about the management speak on social networking sites denizens of myspace make use of functions such as "change my top friends " "view all of my friends" and for those times when our inner stalins sense the need for a virtual purge "edit friends " with a few mouse clicks one can elevate or downgrade or entirely eliminate a relationship one can also advertise ones own desirability as a friend or more hence the t shirt that declares "im in your boyfriends top " to be sure we all rank our friends albeit in unspoken and intuitive ways but social networking sites allow us to rank our friends publicly and not only can we publicize our own preferences in people but we can also peruse the favorites among our other acquaintances we can learn all about the friends of our friends often without having ever met them in person and we can find out what our real life friends think of us without ever having to confront them of course one could argue that the clear documentation and ranking of friendships made possible by social networking sites leads to greater responsibility for ones behavior toward friends with logs of ims trails of emails and time stamped facebook personal news feeds not to mention that ubiquitous technological tether the cellphone we can no longer honestly claim to be unavailable to our many acquaintances the wealth of little excuses that allowed people to weasel out of social obligations has narrowed considerably nevertheless the use of the word "friend" on social networking sites is clearly a dilution and a debasement of the term surely no one with hundreds of myspace or facebook "friends" is so confused as to believe that they are all real friendships in his study mr reader found that among users of social networks nearly all of the friends that people considered to be close were people with whom they had face to face contact but particularly for younger generations weaned on facebook forging face to face contact is evidently a challenge nyu recently sponsored a "facebook in the flesh" seminar to tutor incoming freshmen on the fine art of real life social conversation the exercise was "harder than facebook " one student confessed to the new yorker to an increasing degree we find and form our friendships and communities in the virtual world as well as the real world these virtual networks greatly expand our opportunities to meet others but they do so by emphasizing quantity over quality true friendship requires not merely connection and face to face contact but risk the risk of disapproval of heartache of being thought a fool social networking web sites may make it easier to accumulate "friends " but as a medium for the cultivation of genuine friendship they are a poor substitute for the real thing ms rosen is a fellow at the ethics &amp public policy center in washington a longer version of this article appears in the summer issue of the new atlantis a journal of
