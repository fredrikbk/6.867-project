gop tax dilemma a few weeks ago republican leaders gathered on capitol hill to hear from their top pollsters and pundits about how they can win back the votes of independent voters some of the attendees are still in a state of cardiac arrest over what they learned americas swing voters especially the suburban "security moms " who abandoned the gop in droves in still hold republicans in very low regard what has party tacticians especially spooked is that these independents are apparently not much attracted to what the republicans are saying about taxes thats a bitter pill for party leaders to swallow because for years the anti tax banner has been a political trump card for conservative candidates a top strategist at the republican national committee who attended the meeting told me "our tax message has worn thin " well thats not exactly true it is true that the gop message on taxes needs a makeover perhaps a radical one and the partys congressional leaders had better figure this out soon the big tax fight starts as early as next week when house ways and means committee chairman charlie rangle unveils his multibillion dollar soak the rich tax hike plan to pay for middle class alternative minimum tax relief so lets review some of the key attitudinal shifts of voters on taxes as revealed in recent polls and focus group findings first the not so good news for the gop most voters are unpersuaded by the republican message that the bush tax cuts were a resounding success that pumped the economy back to life worse the key independent voters are actually repelled by that message "it crashes like the hindenburg " says richard thau who has been monitoring swing voter sentiments across the nation why because politicians who boast about the rosy economy seem out of touch even delusional given the rising costs of gasoline health insurance and college tuition the reality of course is that the investment tax cuts did help create seven million jobs and did steer the economy out of recession that doesnt matter to these "stressed out" voters as mr thau calls them the bush tax cuts are a bridge to the past not the future to borrow a clintonite term moreover because local property and school taxes have been skyrocketing many independent voters scratch their heads and wonder what tax cuts there is more deflating news unlike in the s and s voters are today less attracted to talk of new tax cuts which they think are pie in the sky given the current war costs and budget deficit nor are they averse to raising taxes on "the wealthy " a group they are persuaded is taking advantage of tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share that the richest already pay two thirds of the income taxes isnt well understood one strong defense mechanism against the lefts class warfare tax policy is that roughly half of voters are convinced that when politicians say they are only going to soak the rich they fear their own tax bills will go up there is another silver lining for the gop the democrats tax happy policies are an even less palatable message to voters sen jon kyl of arizona who has sat in the gop tax strategy sessions tells me that "an overriding concern of economically anxious voters today is that they dont see their own taxes rise " pollster david winston whos been testing the tax issue for republicans agrees with that assessment when mr winston asked a national sample of registered voters last month "do you believe or not believe this statement given the cost of living these days now is not the time to raise taxes " believe now isnt the time to raise taxes while only believe it is there is another gop imperative the anti tax message must be linked to wasteful government spending "theres no question that for seven out of american voters wasteful government spending is one of the largest problems in washington " says pollster tony fabrizio "for many of these voters its a bigger issue than taxes " all of the polling consistently finds that voters believe about cents of every dollar spent by washington is wasted so this widespread aversion to the way government mishandles money may be the best shield against tax hikes at all levels of government in mr winstons survey of respondents agreed that "taxes should not be increased as long as congress continues to waste the tax money it already receives " only did not perhaps the most encouraging poll finding is that americans fully understand the link between a strong economy and deficits in federal revenues increased by a world record &# billion because of surging employment corporate profits and stock values no hillary clinton tax hike could have possibly raised that kind of money this is a nation that instinctively gets the supply side message that putting people to work yields more tax revenues than a strategy of weighing down businesses and workers with tax hikes which explains this stunning finding when mr winstons poll asked "which approach is more likely to increase federal revenues " said "increasing economic growth" while only said "increasing taxes " so the tax issue is still radioactive with most voters and the gop would be foolhardy to run and hide from it thats especially true because if the economy slows down in the coming months due to the housing credit crunch aversion to higher taxes is likely to intensify "voters biggest economic concern is whether they will have enough money to meet their own needs " says sen kyl he says that if republicans are going to win in they have to persuade voters that democratic tax hikes "will make things worse" for the economy and their own personal finances fortunately this message has the added attraction that its not just pollster driven spin its the truth mr moore is senior economics writer for
