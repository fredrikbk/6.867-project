dumbing education down president george w bushs signature education reform the no child left behind act is coming in for a close inspection in congress and it seems members on both sides of the aisle have plenty of ideas of how to tinker with nclb but almost nobody is talking about the laws central flaw its mandate that every american schoolchild must become "proficient" in reading and math while not defining what "proficiency" is the result of this flaw is that we now have a patchwork of discrepant standards and expectations that will in fact leave millions of kids behind foster new state to state inequities in education quality and fail to give the united states the schools it needs to compete globally in the st century reduced to its essentials nclb works like this each state sets a "proficiency" bar over which it is supposed to drag all its children grades third through eighth by schools that fail to make steady progress toward that goal are slated for "improvement" of various sorts so far so good but while nclb circa is rigidly prescriptive about the "improvement" part its vague about where to set the bar as a result a fourth grader living in hamtramck or pueblo may be judged "proficient" according to michigans or colorados low standards yet fail by a mile to match the attainments of his or her peers in worcester mass or columbia s c places with far loftier notions of proficiency a new analysis of where states have set their bars conducted by northwest evaluation associates nwea and the thomas b fordham institute shows dizzying state to state variation in the math and reading skills that primary and middle school youngsters are expected to acquire with "passing" scores varying from the sixth to the th percentile on nweas rock solid scale unfortunately theres more the study also reveals that over the past few years intentionally or not more states have let their tests grow easier to pass than have made them harder the evidence is student gains appearing on state test results that are not borne out by independent measures few states peg their expectations consistently across the grades most set up thousands of children for unexpected trouble in middle school by aiming low in primary school states typically have far higher standards for math than for reading if "proficiency" has no stable or comparable meaning nclbs entire strategy for intervening in low performing schools and districts rests on quicksand and millions of parents are getting garbled and misleading information as to how their own children and their childrens schools and school systems are actually doing congress and the white house erred when they agreed in that each state would be obliged to set its own standards and score its own tests no matter what one thinks of americas history of state and local control of schooling we now see the folly of a big modern nation worried about its global competitiveness nodding with approval as wisconsin sets its eighth grade reading passing level at the th percentile while south carolina sets its at the st a youngster moving from middle school in milwaukee to high school in charleston would be grievously unprepared for what lies ahead so would a child moving from third grade in detroit to fourth grade in albuquerque yet official washington seemingly lacks the stomach to take this on the conventional wisdom is that "national standards and tests" are politically taboo because conservatives dont like "national" and liberals dont like standards and testing the gates and broad foundations are spending tens of millions to overturn that taboo during the upcoming election but few in the th congress seem to be listening nor is anybody ready to tackle the other part of nclbs core problem the quest for universal proficiency no educator in america believes this can be achieved anytime soon not with of the kids and by any reasonable standard of proficiency the truth is that boosting our students proficiency from todays to or would be a transformative accomplishment but no politician dares say that lest he instantly be skewered with "which of the kids dont you care about " meanwhile the federal mandate to produce proficiency fosters low standards game playing by states and districts and cynicism and rear end covering by educators tinkering with nclb as todays bills and plans would do may ease some of the current laws other problems but until lawmakers muster the intestinal fortitude to go after its central illusions americas needed education makeover is not going to occur mr finn is a senior fellow at stanfords hoover institution and president of the thomas b fordham institute
