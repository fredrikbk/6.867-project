beverly hills and surgeons face off over higher taxes beverly hills calif as a practitioner of the "vertical facelift" and other aesthetic surgical procedures renato calabria seems a perfect fit for this upscale enclave that is one of the worlds plastic surgery centers yet these days dr calabria says he is thinking about moving out of town the reason taxes beverly hills is squabbling with doctors who practice within the citys square miles after decades of collecting lower taxes from doctors than from other businesses beverly hills is trying to take a bigger cut of the revenue generated from so called surgery centers many of which specialize in cosmetic surgery the city contends the centers become a drain on resources relative to the taxes they pay that has angered beverly hills doctors who believe their businesses along with luxury shops and hotels are what give the city its sizzle many of the citys doctors are plastic surgeons cosmetic dermatologists and others who incorporate the citys lustrous name in their marketing their patients they point out are wealthy individuals who shell out thousands of dollars for procedures that arent covered by insurance "we have a lot of affluent people flying from all over the world they stay at the best hotels they go to restaurants they spend a lot of money " dr calabria says he says the city this year is demanding roughly times what he had been paying in taxes under &# beverly hills efforts to collect more revenue from its doctors show the pressures that even wealthy cities face to pay rising costs the challenges are particularly acute in california the seeds of the dispute were planted in the s after the state passed proposition which lowered property taxes in response beverly hills and other cities instituted a business license tax unlike other cities beverly hills created a separate lower tax for doctors lawyers accountants and other professionals the system worked until doctors offices began to morph into much bigger businesses and add surgery centers these vary widely ranging from an operating room attached to the office of an individual surgeon similar to dr calabrias practice to larger complexes of operating suites used by many doctors and sometimes owned by corporations it is a problem the city says because over the past decade the outpatient surgery centers have multiplied not just for plastic surgery but also for procedures such as eye surgeries and colonoscopies the city says it doesnt have an exact count but accrediting organizations records show there are at least surgery centers in beverly hills including many perched above boutiques in the citys ultrahigh rent "golden triangle" in the center of beverly hills real estate developers say the area has among the highest density of surgery centers anywhere in the world most of the surgery centers have been paying taxes under the citys lower rate called "professional office " which bases the annual fee on the number and type of employees that are in an office rather than a percentage of gross revenue the city now says the surgery centers should be paying commercial property taxes which are tied to revenue "its not a new tax it is enforcing existing code " says scott miller the citys chief financial officer the big surgery centers are making millions of dollars but are taxed at "a far below market rate " he adds the city began cracking down on surgery centers two years ago after it determined that many surgery centers are more like hospitals without an overnight stay than they are like old fashioned doctors offices last year surgery centers as well as some physicians and surgical assistants began receiving letters from the city or from mbia muniservices co a fresno calif based firm that the city had hired "all of my clients initially received a letter saying that if they didnt conform and remit the tax they could be subject to a criminal filing " says arthur barens a los angeles lawyer who was retained by a group of surgeons beverly hills initially demanded tax payments retroactive several years and substantially higher taxes going forward the additional taxes typically amount to tens of thousands of dollars a year for a surgery center mr barens said tamar singer a freelance anesthesiologist who received several of the letters calls the city "rapacious" and has stopped working and shopping there she says the city claimed she owed &# in business taxes for &# of professional fees that she earned from surgery centers over three years the notices scared her so she paid now she is fighting to get her money back the plan "puts a heavy strain on physicians and medicine which is unfair because we bring lots of income to the city " says gary lask a plastic surgeon and owner of the summit surgery center where e entertainment television films its dr program a reality show focusing on plastic surgery in recent months after meeting with fierce resistance from the medical community and its lawyers the city seems to have toned down its offensive mr miller says beverly hills doesnt want to be "punitive " whats at stake for the city is "probably less than " of the citys &# million of business tax collected in the current fiscal year he says the total city budget in the same period is about &# million city officials say they hope a compromise resolution can be reached before the end of the year after all says stephen p webb a beverly hills attorney who was the city mayor until earlier this year "beverly hills doesnt want residents to say we hate doctors here "
