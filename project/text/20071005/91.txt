the evening wrap pakistans volatile vote online edition incredibly pakistans presidential politics became even messier ahead of a vote tomorrow as the countrys top court further complicated president gen pervez musharrafs untidy bid for re election presiding justice javed iqbal announced today that the presidential vote by lawmakers can proceed and gen musharraf who is both president and army chief is still expected to win another five year term but now under the courts instructions the winner of the election cant be officially declared until the court has ruled on various legal challenges to gen musharrafs eligibility to run opponents say gen musharraf who seized power in a coup cant run as long as he remains military chief in late september the supreme court which is one of the only counterbalances to gen musharrafs rule dismissed some other petitions filed by opposition parties and lawyers seeking his disqualification but the other complaints are still pending gen musharraf a close u s ally in the fight against terrorism has said he plans to restore civilian rule and resign as army chief if he wins re election critics have called that offer politically opportunistic adding that his post election retirement from the army still wouldnt satisfy election laws at any rate the court said the winner of tomorrows vote cant be determined until those complaints get a hearing which it expects to provide on oct that means if gen musharraf receives the most votes he would have to wait at least days before knowing whether he could take up office his current presidential term runs out on nov "pakistan will be in a state of political limbo for quite some time " said analyst talat masood a retired pakistani officer and commentator on political issues in the country news of the elections speed bump came as gen musharraf edged closer to a possible power sharing deal with former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto who has been in self exile today he signed an amnesty agreement quashing corruption charges against her in the hope of heading off a mass boycott of the presidential vote that would have undermined the legitimacy of his likely victory ms bhutto who plans an oct return to pakistan also wants the constitution to be changed to allow her to seek a third term as prime minister and a drastic revision of the presidents sweeping powers officials from ms bhuttos party said those issues could be resolved later jobs data drives stocks higher stocks rose after the labor department released an upbeat jobs report the s&amp p hit a record gaining to above

quirky kickers for the evening wrap ive been following this story for a few days but now it seems the situation is coming to a head or leg let me start from the beginning on sept a man named shannon whisnant attended an auction of abandoned items at a storage facility in the town of maiden n c where he bought a barbecue smoker upon opening the item at home he found what he first thought was a piece of driftwood on closer examination it proved to be an embalmed human leg some of maiden n c s finest were summoned and after an inquiry it was determined that the leg in question was once attached to a man named john wood of simpsonville s c unfortunately it had been amputated after mr wood was in a plane crash three years ago following the procedure mr wood had decided to preserve it for his eventual cremation "i want to be cremated as a whole man " he told the charlotte observer "its nothing macabre " anyway mr whisnant who bought the smoker and leg package first turned the leg over to the police the associated press reported but after seeing how much attention it received he sought to retrieve it even telling the greenville news in south carolina that he was considering charging people to see it police however seemed to disagree with mr whisnants claim to the appendage saying that he gave up custody of the leg by asking police to take it away reuters reported today "the simple fact is that he said he didnt want it " capt tracy ledford of the maiden police department told reuters "the guy dont have a leg to stand on " the police officer said "hes not getting the leg back " so it seems mr wood will have his lost leg returned the associated press contributed to this report write to matt phillips at matt phillips wsj com
