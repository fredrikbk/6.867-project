the daily fix rockies d backs grab leads in national league playoffs online edition losing game of a five game series isnt the same as falling off the edge of the world but following that up by losing game here be dragons capn and whats that roaring sound fans of the philadelphia phillies were reduced to booing the teams parade of battered pitchers as the seemingly unbeatable rockies romped leaving the phils in an hole in the rocky mountain news dave krieger takes the "deeply sophisticated baseball experts here on the eastern seaboard" to task for ignoring the rockies and emphasizing the failures of the phillies and manager charlie manuel instead of the rockies successes "it cannot possibly be that these nobodies from the forgotten time zone are flat better " he fumes adding "the rocks led the national league in batting the rocks led all baseball in fielding even playing in coors field located as you know on the moon they had a better earned run average than the phillies so lets see thats batting fielding and pitching all better than the phillies hmmm so what do the phils lead in well experts paying attention to them for one thing " for another perspective the fix pried the philadelphia inquirers phil sheridan out of an eastern seaboard deeply sophisticated baseball experts meeting dont tell mr krieger about the awesome finger food in there he seems riled up as it is "lets get this out of the way right at the top " mr sheridan writes "charlie manuel is not to blame for the phillies being on the brink of elimination two teams arrived to this national league division series after improbable inspired septembers one team seized the moment got big performances from its stars and jumped out to a two games to none lead the other team was the phillies " mr sheridan then walks readers through mr manuels decisions in replacing starter kyle kendrick with reliever kyle lohse who gave up a fatal grand slam to colorados kaz matsui his conclusion "manuel made a tough decision in a bad situation and it didnt work thats not a team with a bad manager thats a manager with a team going bad " another member of the esdsbe the washington posts thomas boswell writes that "the rockies dont want you to know what they are feeling the heights theyve climbed without knowing how or the sense of the miraculous that envelops them as long as they dont examine it too closely and jinx the whole thing they dont even want you to know that they know whats happening to them theyre playing dumb hiding behind their mask of cliches you cant blame them even though the glint of secret knowledge peaks out around the edges of every word they say invisible is best " in phoenix cubs manager lou piniella didnt have to defend a pitching change he had to defend not making one the arizona diamondbacks battered ted lilly who allowed seven hits four walks and six runs in innings good for an d back win and a series lead the lasting image came moments after mr lilly gave up a foot home run to arizonas chris young on a pitch in the second "as the ball headed for the stands lilly slammed down his glove and it looked like the perfect picture of almost a century of cubs futility " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "expect to see it over and over again " in the sun times jay mariotti grabs the towel away from mr piniella and his team and throws it in on their behalf "i cannot sugarcoat or softpedal how awful the cubs look " he writes "they are playing like quitters imposters losers and all you need to know about their immediate future fifty teams have fallen behind and only seven have returned to win a best of five series as if it isnt hellish enough carrying the burden of championship less years legions of masochistic fans ron santo bartman bill murray the rest of the celebrity sector and the entire nation of cubdom the cubs also bear the weight of an ungodly sum of money spent on their roster since last offseason &# million to be blunt " a graphic shown early during game between the new york yankees and the cleveland indians revealed that the indians lineup had games of postseason experience but kenny lofton accounted for all of them it was enough mr lofton drove in five runs as the indians beat the yankees adding another chapter to the itinerant outfielders long baseball saga "as the folks in houston atlanta san francisco chicago pittsburgh new york philadelphia and texas can attest lofton usually doesnt hang around long enough to be more than a casual acquaintance " jerry crasnick writes on espn com "hell sign his one year deal contribute his hits steals and a little edge in the clubhouse then hit the road for another team in a different town if theres a port he can always call home its cleveland in the early s lofton was the fleet and daring catalyst wreaking havoc in front of jim thome manny ramirez and albert belle more than a decade later hes in his third tour with the franchise and evoking memories of powerhouse indians teams past its a role that suits him well " as for the yankees they sank because chien ming wangs sinker didnt "there was no mistaking the dejection in joe torres footsteps as he took that million mile walk to the mound in the fifth inning " bob klapisch writes in the bergen record "the manager had seen enough of chien ming wang to finally realize what had already become an open secret in the indians dugout the yankees ground ball specialist didnt have his sinker which is to say he was stark naked how why the yankees are still wondering what exactly sabotaged their ace and more to the point how to navigate through the rest of this suddenly dangerous series " dangerous mr klapisch suggests to not only their postseason hopes but torres prospects of continued employment "if you believe what some yankee people are saying about joe torres job security that he has to at least get to the world series to get another contract tonights game will be the equivalent of life and death to the manager if not the entire yankee community " sprinter marion jones has reportedly admitted to using steroids as she prepared for the olympic games and is expected to plead

in the letter she says she took the balco designed steroid known as "the clear" and believed her coach when he told her it was flaxseed oil gee that sounds familiar "a seven year race to stay ahead of the performance enhancement posse that long ago rounded up the flawed opportunistic men in marion joness life is over " writes harvey araton in the new york times "she was tripped up not by a snitch not by a drug test but by the floppy loose laces of her own face saving lie " in the age tim lane writes that ms joness admission "is neither disaster nor triumph the disaster has been happening for decades the outing of jones is merely confirmation of one more champion who succumbed within a global epidemic of corruption it is a disaster with no end in sight as for it being a triumph how we wish that this were true it is what i thought when ben johnson tested positive in seoul that such a big fish had been so conspicuously landed indicated that at least the olympic authorities were prepared to face the worst possible music now surely athletics and other corrupt sports were on their way to being cleansed that was years ago " tip of the fix cap to readers john falck and don hartline found
