weekend journal the wealth report the billionaire and the bookstore sam wyly buys left leaning aspen landmark and some locals fret aspen colo for more than years explore booksellers was a quiet refuge from aspens burgeoning wealth and development the bookstore and cafe located in a victorian house off main street remained locally owned even as other shops were replaced by chain stores or luxury retailers explores outspoken owner katherine thalberg railed against the mcmansions going up all over the resort town and the loss of "old aspen " with its bohemian artists beat up jeeps and counterculture heroes like writer hunter s thompson customers could curl up with a book on the oriental rugs chat with the staff about expressionist poets or eat at the upstairs bistro which features vegetarian fare such soy burgers carrot juice and vegan chocolate fudge cake the shop also was ms thalbergs political base where she organized crusades against fur coats george w bush and the iraq war she helped raise money for ralph nader and campaigned for john kerry during the election and she picked out all the shops books an assortment heavy on animal rights titles so it came as something of a shock to aspen when ms thalberg died last year and explore booksellers was sold even more surprising was the buyer sam wyly the texas billionaire who was a top supporter of george w bush and helped fund the "swift boat" ads that helped defeat mr kerry "you cant have sam wylys history and claim to want to continue katherines legacy at explore " says phyllis bronson a biochemist in aspen who was one of ms thalbergs closest friends "the history of explore is politically rich her politics and the store were closely intertwined " the ensuing war of words over explores fate highlights the larger drama taking place in aspen as it struggles to preserve its past while accommodating a huge influx of new money once a rocky mountain redoubt for ideologues ski bums bohemians and the occasional rich heiress the town today is filled with brash billionaires from the u s russia and latin america its downtown which used to house a cozy collection of mom and pop stores is lined with upscale retailers during the peak months of january and july the local airport is jammed with private jets and the streets are clogged with chauffeured escalades red mountain which overlooks the town and ski areas is covered with megamansions most with heated driveways and guest villas the average price of a single family house in town is &# million many aspenites were happy to see explore purchased and preserved yet others see it as just the latest sign that aspen is being sold off to the ultra wealthy they worry that mr wyly who paid &# million for the store will change its politics distrust of wealth among some longtime aspenites runs so deep that no matter what mr wyly does with the store he will be criticized earlier this year ms bronson wrote a letter to the aspen times arguing that the sale violated all that ms thalberg stood for ms thalberg she said "would not be happy seeing explore sold to someone who opposed her every value " another local resident jay cowan criticized plans to honor mr thompsons book "fear and loathing on the campaign trail " with an event this past summer at the wyly owned store the aspen daily news in its april fools issue lampooned the new ownership with a photo and caption purporting to show conservative writer anne coulter appearing at the store to christen the "anne coulter room " and several friends of ms thalberg say they are boycotting the store because of mr wylys ownership mr wyly says politics is irrelevant to his purchase and that he bought explore simply to save it a voracious reader he prefers history mr wyly has been vacationing in aspen for more than years and often walked to explore from his house nearby he says he liked to pore over a lincoln biography or tome about world war ii at the shop he also ate frequently at its bistro ordering his favorite mexican tostada bean soup and coffee if he didnt buy it he says explore might have been sold for condos or a real estate office "my motivation is that this was my favorite place to walk to in aspen " he says "i wanted to keep it its got such a good feeling its cozy and comfortable " the year old mr wyly who made his money from oil refining computers insurance retailing real estate and other investments says he is especially attached to independent bookstores he had two favorite stores near his main home in highland park texas but both closed "i didnt want that to happen to explore " he adds that calling him a "conservative" and mrs thalberg a "liberal" is oversimplifying "im interested in personalities not political parties " he says whats more he says its irrelevant to the bookstore "people go to a bookstore because they love books not because of politics " mr wyly and his wife cheryl gave &# to the republican party or republican candidates from to according to center for responsive politics they also gave &# to president bushs inauguration asked whether hed invite democratic icons such as al gore or bill clinton to appear at explore mr wyly says "id love for bill clinton to read at the store hed draw a crowd we want to sell books " so far theres no sign that the stores book selection has been altered to fit with mr wylys politics he says the assortment will remain as is along with the stores atmosphere "sam and his family love this bookstore and want it to remain the way it was if not better " says lynda schultz explores new general manager "thank god for people like the wylys because who else could afford &# million to buy a bookstore " ms thalberg the daughter of actress norma shearer and s movie mogul irving thalberg launched explore in she became a fixture in the shop with her oversized glasses flowing gray hair and pet malamute kanute at her side she also wrote frequent letters to local papers decrying development and cruelty to animals she led an unsuccessful campaign to ban fur sales in aspen after she died of cancer in january the business was inherited by her husband bill stirling and her three daughters ashley brooke and deva the daughters from a previous marriage had a controlling interest in the store after briefly running the store themselves they decided to put it up for sale their high asking price &# million reflected aspens rich property values mr stirling who is a local real estate agent and former aspen mayor put together a group of longtime locals and part timers to buy explore yet the daughters decided to sell to the wylys since the wyly bid was stronger and was made before mr stirlings offer according to people familiar with the discussions mr stirling says that despite their decision hes generally pleased by the new ownership "has it been a seamless transfer and is the community best served by it now absolutely " he said in fact mr stirling continues his old role of hosting author readings and discussions at the store aside from the owners another explore fixture has changed kanute the malamute has been replaced by a cat that cheryl wyly got from a local animal shelter to which the couple have been major donors the cats name cashmere
