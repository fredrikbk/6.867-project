the numbers guy understanding how a current kids flick can beat out de sica everyone is a critic online internet users are asked to rate beer restaurants board games and movies typically on a scale of one to five compiling all of that information into a single ranking is a provocative numbers question if the only two critics to rate cafe chris each awarded it the maximum five stars while diners rated its rival daves diner with an average of stars has chris really surpassed dave in culinary excellence or should we treat the much smaller number of voters for chris who could be chris and his brother with a grain of salt put another way which is better vittorio de sicas neorealist film "umberto d " or the green ogre epic "shrek" most web sites use a simple average add up the total number of stars and divide by the number of votes but several online rankings combine the number of votes with the number of stars in those votes to arrive at a weighted ranking by using a statistical method known as bayesian get out the salt shaker more complex doesnt necessarily mean more accurate philosophically the bayesian approach is very different from the usual averaging its more moderate more skeptical and more influenced by popularity every new subject be it a movie restaurant or beer is given the benefit of the doubt and assumed to be average then each new review is handled cautiously budging the rating up or down only slightly only a rush of positive or negative feedback can push a rating to great heights or depths in legal terms its presumption of averageness until proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt internet movie database the cinema site owned by amazon com approaches its list of users favorite films in this way a new release whose first two votes are enthusiastic doesnt push it past "the godfather " instead imdb assigns all new movies votes with a rating of the average rating for all films listed on the site then each actual vote is added to those this is how "umberto d " with an average user vote of can rank at no of all time while "shrek" is notches higher despite having an average user vote of just "shrek" wins because almost times as many people have voted for it than for "umberto d " adding more certainty to its acclaim this modified formula dates from the early days of imdb nearly a decade ago managing editor keith simanton says at first the site used a simple average but "it wasnt working out well " he says the current ratings system helps "to mitigate the fan boy aspect " in other words two die hard fans such as the director and his mother cant easily game the ratings a similar approach underlies player rankings on halo the xbox title released two weeks ago that lets players in multiple locations join the same game online the first day microsoft released the futuristic war game players joined a game million times some were playing with friends but others relied on the games matchmaking feature to find equally skilled strangers to compete against microsoft uses a bayesian formula similar to imdbs called trueskill to change players rankings slowly as they get more experience after all a single great result in a halo match could be the result of a fluke your opponent gave up because an urgent offline need took her from the game or a deliberate effort to game the system your friend threw the game so you could gain rating points getting the trueskill ranking right is crucial "if there is a great disparity in skills between competing players neither of them will have a lot of fun " says microsoft researcher thore graepel who helped develop trueskill the drawbacks to the bayesian approach are clear on beer advocate a web site that uses this approach to rank beers by user votes one taster complained that a beer was rated higher than the individual votes thats a potential numerical quirk in such formulas a new halo player who gets good quickly may have to wade through tiresome routs until trueskill catches up to his true skill and imdb users may not be able to discover highly regarded films that havent received enough votes to make the top chart which in turn makes it hard for those films to get more attention and so more votes many other sites such as the local reviews site yelp keep it simple and just show average ratings but thomas bayes likely would have preferred "shrek " the th century probability theorist for whom the formula is named believed we should use our prior knowledge when encountering new situations for the st century application of rating new movies that suggests we incorporate what we know about the ranking of older films rather than start from scratch "you mix this averageness with a particular good or bad experience " says aleks jakulin a research scientist studying bayesian statistics at columbia university "in this way you get closer to the truth " bad meals from restaurants with high ratings but few votes prompted him to call on his blog for more sites to go the way of bayes otherwise he says rankings are easily manipulated email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about numbers and join a discussion with readers at my free blog wsj
