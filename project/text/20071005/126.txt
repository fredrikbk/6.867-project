why price increases are brewing for craft beers that six pack of high brow beer is about to come at a higher price thanks to the sharpest surge in decades in the cost of the hops and barley that give each brew its distinctive taste consumers could pay cents to &# per six pack more in the coming months for many small batch "craft beers " as brewers pass on rising hops and barley costs from an unpalatable brew of poor harvests the weak dollar and farmers shift to more profitable crops other makers of craft beers the fastest growing segment of the u s brewing industry say they may eat the higher ingredient costs which will pare their profits "the hops are to samuel adams what grapes are to wine " says jim koch founder of boston beer co maker of samuel adams boston lager one of americas fastest growing beers the company has raised its prices just over this year to help offset the hops and barley costs mr koch says that for next year the company is "probably looking at the same or maybe more " "the cost increases have been the largest weve ever faced both in barley and in hops " says mr koch who founded the company in the company only buys hops that are grown on several thousand acres in bavaria and the crop has been smaller in the past two years making them more expensive mr koch says the cost pressures could slow the expansion of american craft brewers which account for about of u s beer revenue and even put some smaller ones out of business craft beer makers also are battling other cost increases including higher prices for glass cardboard gasoline and the stainless steel used to make beer kegs "people are very concerned " says kim jordan co founder of colorados new belgium brewing co which makes fat tire amber ale a top selling craft beer "it significantly affects profitability " big american brewers like anheuser busch cos and sabmiller plcs miller brewing co also face cost increases but the impact isnt nearly as great for them they use much less hops and barley in most of their beers which is why they are lighter in taste and calories a barrel of craft brew sierra nevada pale ale for example has about twice the malt and as many as five times the hops of a mass market brew like budweiser or miller high life large beer makers are also better able to secure long term contracts to mitigate the impact of rising ingredient costs most spirits makers such as diageo plc and fortune brands inc also face a relatively limited impact from global increases in the cost of grains such as corn the craft beer segment has been among the few bright spots in the slow growing u s beer industry the number of barrels of craft beers sold rose in the first half of this year against year earlier levels according to the brewers association a craft beer trade group in boulder colo meanwhile the beer institute a washington based industry group projects total u s beer sales by barrel will rise this year the boom in craft beers reflects heightened awareness of their brands and a willingness by american beer drinkers to pay an extra &# or &# per six pack to get a premium product craft beer makers have faced escalating costs over the past year prices for malting barley which accounts for a beers color and sweetness have jumped as farmers increasingly shifted to planting corn which has been bringing higher prices because of high demand from makers of biofuels like ethanol the weak dollar also has made it more expensive for u s brewers to buy commodities from europe the news worsened for craft brewers significantly in recent weeks firms that turn barley into brewing malt informed craft brewers of price increases ranging from to and hops suppliers announced increases ranging from to depending on the variety of hops the price of hops which give beers their bitterness and aroma has risen because of shortages across the globe due in part to poor crops in europe some european brewers are competing with american brewers for hops grown in the pacific northwest for years hops were cheap due to a glut that prompted growers over the past decade to replace hops with other crops such as apples now the amount of hops acres world wide is about half the total of years ago says ralph olson a hops dealer with hopunion cbs llc in yakima wash thats caused some hops varieties to quadruple in price over the past year he says to cope with higher malt and hops prices smaller brewers are trying to secure longer term contracts for the ingredients and in some cases theyre tweaking their recipes at bells brewery inc in comstock mich founder larry bell says he is substituting other varieties of hops into the brewers bells oberon ale and bells lager because he could only secure of a czech saaz hops that he normally uses in the beer mr bell says employees who test beers at his company havent been able to detect a change with the new hops and that he wont make any changes that will compromise quality starting next year he anticipates he will raise the price he charges beer wholesalers by cents to cents per case customers may see an even higher price increase because retailers typically mark up beer even further "i am concerned that there could be some small players out there that will fail because of this " says mr bell whose brewery sold its first beer in boston beer has inked long term contracts for some of its ingredient needs but many smaller brewers such as allagash brewing co in portland maine buy hops and malt on the open market exposing them to huge price swings rob tod president of allagash says the company expects to absorb some of the recent cost increases but it will likely impose some price increases resulting in a four pack of its allagash white costing about &# at retailers in the northeast up about cents "were getting hit on all sides " mr tod says ken grossman the founder of sierra nevada brewing co in chico calif says the brewer plans some price increases but its better positioned than others because a price spike for hops in the early s prompted him to sign long term contracts "ive gotten calls of panic from other brewers " he says dogfish head craft brewery inc in milton del is coping by trying to make its operations more efficient locking in commodity contracts as early as possible and weighing a price increase says brewmaster andy tveekrem whose company is known for "hoppy" beers like minute ipa or india pale ale "i think theres going to be some brewers out there " mr tveekrem says "if they havent looked that far ahead that actually might run out of malt or hops which would be a catastrophe "
