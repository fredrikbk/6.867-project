kremlin extends reach with new state firms the kremlin has begun creating a series of state corporations in sectors that include shipbuilding and atomic energy increasing the governments role in the economy and sparking criticism that it is turning back to soviet style industrial policies in recent weeks plans to forge state conglomerates in arms trading road building the nuclear industry drug manufacturing and the fishing industry have either been introduced as draft laws in parliament or publicly discussed by senior government officials officials are selling the concept as a rapid way to diversify the economy from its dependence on exports of natural resources backers argue that the experience of the s when many companies were privatized but failed to thrive shows that the government needs to take a greater role although many of the companies being grouped in the state corporations are already at least partly state owned critics warn the approach risks stifling private enterprise by creating government run giants that dwarf private competitors "the fashion is extremely dangerous " arkady dvorkovich a liberal kremlin aide said at a business conference this week "the government is not even trying to understand that private business can do all this this is the path to zero russian economic growth " despite such internal criticism the trend to create state corporations is accelerating some critics argue that the push is gathering steam as kremlin insiders try to lock up control over important assets before presidential elections next spring which might lead to shuffling within the inner circle "state corporations are the next potentially worrying stage in defining industry sectors as strategic " said roland nash head of research at renaissance capital a moscow investment house "the danger is that what is still an ineffectual government and bureaucracy will have influence over an economy that has been doing pretty well without undue interference " in tandem with a crackdown on political opponents and independent media president vladimir putin has restored state control over large sectors of the economy especially in the strategic oil industry in recent years the states role has expanded further even as mr putin and other top officials have insisted they support market based solutions whereas state controlled industrial giants such as oao gazprom have mixed government and private shareholder ownership and must provide investors with regular updates the new state corporations known as goskorporatsiya would have greater autonomy and could be less open draft laws have been proposed for state corporations to control the atomic energy industry as well as the multibillion dollar projects to prepare the black sea city of sochi for the winter olympics the government already has set up corporations to build ships exploit nanotechnology and manage the countrys housing stock the russian moves are likely to be closely watched by u s and european officials who have grown increasingly wary of investments being made around the world by such state controlled companies one of the biggest new russian state corporations will be rostekhnologii which means russian technology a sprawling military industrial conglomerate whose creation has been heavily promoted by a close presidential friend sergei chemezov head of state arms agency rosoboronexport rostekhnologii will absorb rosoboronexport mr putin has introduced legislation in parliament to establish rostekhnologii a pro putin party dominates parliament and nearly all kremlin proposals sail through with little change a copy of the draft law that was reviewed by the wall street journal indicates that rostekhnologii will own its assets be subject to minimum government scrutiny and that its top managers will be appointed by the president the corporation will be built on rosoboronexport though there have been no official estimates of its combined revenue its asset base suggests it will take its place among the top russian companies along with industrial giants such as gazprom and oao rosneft rosoboronexports assets include auto maker oao avtovaz russias largest car maker as well as titanium maker vsmpo avisma a crucial supplier to boeing co together with gun tank and missile and helicopter construction units all of these business units will be absorbed into the new corporation according to mr chemezov "experience has proven that our industry and in particular our industry that is run by private business cannot guarantee promising development without state control " he wrote in a recent issue of the parliaments newspaper
