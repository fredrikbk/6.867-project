hannah montana battles the bots ticketmaster tries to block software that lets resellers grab hot concert seats ticketing giant ticketmaster is taking aim at what it says is a new obstacle for fans hoping to attend concerts by hot acts like bruce springsteen van halen and hannah montana computer software that enables brokers and scalpers to swarm the companys web site and snap up tickets faster than consumers can iac interactivecorps ticketmaster earlier this year filed a federal lawsuit in u s district court in los angeles against rmg technologies inc a small pittsburgh based company that runs ticketbrokertools com according to papers filed with the lawsuit rmg rents to scalpers software that can inundate ticketmasters computers with thousands of requests for seats "in effect allowing them to cut in line " according to joe freeman a ticketmaster vice president last month ticketmaster filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would prohibit rmg from selling such software judge audrey b collins is expected to rule on the motion this month in a court filing of his own rmgs lawyer jay m coggan dismissed ticketmasters allegations "this may be the only time in the history of litigation that any seller sued its customers for paying them too much money " he wrote the internet era has brought speed and convenience to all sorts of consumer transactions for concertgoers however it has also led to ever faster sellouts for hot events ticketmaster deploys technology that is supposed to stop brokers from gaining access to large numbers of seats via online sales but it says brokers software circumvents the companys protections that has placed large numbers of seats in the hands of brokers who use ebay inc s stubhub craigslist and other online venues to resell the tickets at a big mark up one situation roiling consumers involves the concert "best of both worlds" tour in which singer actress miley cyrus is performing sets as herself and as her fictional alter ego hannah montana parents and children have found finding tickets for the shows difficult and expensive the issue is drawing the attention of government officials on thursday in a rare internet age example of authorities enforcing antiscalping laws the attorneys general of missouri and arkansas filed lawsuits against people accused of illegally reselling hannah montana tickets according to stubhub tickets for "best of both worlds" are currently selling for an average &# making them pricier than seats for the police &# justin timberlake &# and beyonce &# the highest face value for a ticket on the hannah montana tour &# at the time ticketmaster sued rmg it also sued a group of brokers who allegedly used the companys software to buy and resell larger quantities of tickets than would normally be allowed as part of a settlement with ticketmaster one of these brokers chris kovach submitted to the court a sworn declaration in which he outlined the way rmgs software works as detailed by mr kovach the software allows users among other things to search for tickets at specific price levels for particular events and to generate requests for tickets much more quickly than a human at a typical home computer could for instance companies like ticketmaster require customers searching for tickets online to replicate a set of the squiggly letters and numbers known as a "captcha " theoretically only human customers can correctly identify the characters despite the odd fonts screening out automated purchasing programs but rmgs software according to mr kovach can also "figure out the randomly generated characters and retype them automatically " mr kovach said rmg employees also gave him advice on fooling ticketmasters computers into thinking his requests were coming from different internet addresses neither mr kovach nor his lawyer could be reached for comment ticketmaster alleges that the software is a violation of its terms of service harms the ability of legitimate customers to get tickets and thus ultimately damages ticketmasters reputation and ability to do business in requesting an injunction to stop rmg from doing business ticketmaster says that the millions of requests generated by such "bot" software represents as much as of all ticket requests for some shows a "bot" is computer program that performs automated repetitive tasks on the internet rmg employees couldnt be reached in a court filing rmg president cipriano garibay denied that his companys software is a "bot " instead likening it to a specialized version of a web browser like internet explorer rmgs lawyer mr coggan declined to address the specifics of mr kovachs allegations other than to say they were not entirely accurate "what my client does is no different from my generation before the internet where one person would go sit in line and hold places for people " mr coggan said executives with the ticketing giant say they have no way of knowing how many companies are making similar software but the increasing difficulty that the average consumer faces in trying to get their hands on concert tickets is becoming a hot button issue ticketmaster is a beneficiary of the spiraling costs in the aftermarket thanks to its own secondary marketplace ticketexchange where seats for the tours nov stop at memphiss fedex forum range from &# to &# the services web site says it allows fans to buy tickets "without having to bid against other buyers without having to coordinate delivery from anonymous sellers and without the gamble that the tickets are legitimate " people involved in the tour say that tensions are running particularly high over the hannah montana tour because many of the parents who are trying to secure tickets for their children are buying their first concert tickets in years and thus are unaware of how difficult the internet has made getting tickets to hot concert tours on top of that many parents are wary of disappointing children to whom they have promised tickets the city council of kansas city held hearings last week on the issue after councilman bill skaggs and others received "dozens" of complaints from frustrated constituents representatives of ticketmaster and aeg were asked to explain local fans difficulties getting seats mr skaggs says their responses were "not particularly" satisfying "were not through with them yet " he says "im not sure what the fix is unless you go back to selling tickets at the box office and its first come first served " corrections &amp amplifciations the attorney general of
