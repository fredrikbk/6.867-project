m&amp a milestone &# billion deal for abn amro group set to dismember year old bank will buyers regret it the biggest banking deal ever is likely to conclude today resulting in the dismemberment of one of europes largest banks the significance of the deal goes beyond its &# billion price tag and the demise of year old abn amro holding nv of the netherlands depending on how the buyers fare it could become either a symbol of the overexuberance seen in the recent mergers and acquisitions boom or as some investment bankers hope a precedent for tackling breakups of big companies a three way consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc is expected today to garner enough support from abn amro shareholders to wrap up the deal sometime next year abn amro is set to split formally into three pieces with one piece going to each of the buyers though the companies involved arent household names among u s consumers the deal will reshape the power balance of european banks with global operations the triple split also demonstrates an unusual mechanism for getting big transactions done even as global credit market turmoil has darkened the deal making environment the bidding for abn amro started in the spring in the midst of an m&amp a boom and the deal survived the sudden freezing up of credit markets in august it took more than six months to complete and involved legal clashes that went to the dutch supreme court a lower offer from barclays group plc expired yesterday and people familiar with the situation said it fell short in a memo to employees abn amro chief executive rijkman groenink said the purchase by the rbs led consortium could close oct rbs chief executive fred goodwin battled through it all and is now poised to win the prize but he may be feeling some buyers remorse rbs shares have fallen this year some analysts say rbs ended up with the short straw keeping only the part of abn that was hardest hit by this summers credit market turmoil "its not the greatest thing that could possibly happen for rbs shareholders " said antony broadbent a bank analyst at sanford bernstein in london others are counting on mr goodwin known as "fred the shred" for his cost cutting prowess to make the deal work the rbs group which includes banco santander sa of spain and fortis nv a belgian dutch bank plans to break up the dutch banks global operations carving up an acquisition this large has never been attempted before and could take as long as three years a spokeswoman for rbs pointed to past comments by mr goodwin in which he said buying abns corporate bank was the "most substantial attraction" of the deal for rbs representatives of fortis and santander declined to comment the deals investment bankers who make some of their daily bread finding ways to pick apart the worlds unwieldy conglomerates describe the consortiums bid as a milestone in the field they say it allowed the buyers to pay a higher price by picking out the pieces of the target that were most valuable to them "abn is a breakthrough " said larry slaughter co head of european mergers and acquisitions at j p morgan chase &amp co one of five banks that advised barclays in the abn battle "we see the formation of consortiums of corporates as a big event " activist investors have been increasingly agitating for companies such as the united kingdoms mobile telephone giant vodafone group plc and anglo dutch consumer goods titan unilever to break themselves up europe has seen a few group bids in recent years they are rarer in the u s because tax laws make it costly to break up companies efficiently in french drinks firm pernod ricard sa teamed up with fortune brands inc of the u s to buy allied domecq plc of the u k for &# billion and divide its portfolio of brands between them a two way dutch german group bought imperial chemical industries plc of the u k for &# billion this year "each time something like this happens it provides a route for others to attempt the same thing " says susan kilsby chairman of european mergers and acquisitions at credit suisse ag and an adviser to fortune brands in the allied domecq deal she says the consortium setup allowed the buyers to avoid antitrust issues still ms kilsby thinks such deals will remain fairly rare because of the hurdles in getting so many parties sitting around a table to agree one investment banker in the deal andrea orcel of merrill lynch &amp co had experience in herding banks together the son of an italian father and french mother mr orcel years old advised all the parties in the merger of eight italian banks to form what is today italys biggest bank unicredito italiano sa the london based mr orcel saw his opportunity shortly after abn amro announced in march it was in preliminary talks with barclays over an acquisition mr orcel and another top london based merrill banker matthew greenburgh had worked with rbs and santander and knew they would be interested in parts of abns empire in the u s south america italy and the u k that left the core of abn amro a commercial and retail banking operation in the netherlands without a home mr orcel says bankers asked fortis the belgian dutch lender whether it wanted to join the buyers group eventually the three ceos in the proposed consortium agreed to meet over lunch at the four seasons hotel des bergues in geneva the three and mr orcel drank wine and jotted down a rough sketch of how abn would be split mr orcel recalls rbs would lead the bid and would acquire abn owned lasalle bank in chicago abns large london based investment banking division and other units santander would get brazil and italy fortis would acquire asset management and the netherlands mr orcel and others familiar with the deal say the buyers also formed pact to keep the group together the trio would all win or all lose together merrill took days to calculate the values each consortium member would pay for its piece each bank agreed at one point a banker from goldman sachs group inc spotted the tall silver haired mr orcel at londons heathrow airport traveling with a top santander executive according to three people with knowledge of the encounter andrew chisolm head of goldmans financial institutions group phoned mr goodwin the rbs chief executive to report the sighting saying that if rbs wanted to bid he should be prepared to compete with santander according to people familiar with the matter mr goodwin thanked him then asked a merrill banker to call mr chisolm and explain what was going on these people said representatives of goldman and mr goodwin declined to comment on april the rbs group sent a letter to abn requesting talks over a possible bid the consortiums first major test came days later when abn agreed to be acquired by barclays on april for &# billion in stock in a move widely seen as aimed at blocking the consortium abn at the same time announced it had agreed to sell its lasalle bank division to bank of america corp for &# billion the lasalle deal came as a blow to rbs which had coveted lasalle as a good fit with its own citizens financial group inc a commercial bank with branches in east coast and midwest states a group of dutch shareholders in abn amro sued to make the sale subject to a shareholder vote but the effort failed at the dutch supreme court the rbs group reshuffled the terms of its bid and made it formal in july the group made a mostly cash offer valued at nearly &# billion at the time &# billion more than barclays was then offering barclays later increased its bid by with the help of state backed investors from china and singapore but a swoon in the markets soon dashed the barclays cash and stock offer the deal looks promising for fortis and santander fortis until now a midtier player will become the largest bank in the netherlands belgium and luxembourg its private banking operation for wealthy clients will trail only the two swiss giants ubs ag and credit suisse santander by adding abns brazilian subsidiary will become one of the largest banks in brazil and it will gain access to affluent customers in northern italy santanders low profile in the deal belies its size the bank whose history dates to to handle trade between the port of santander in northern spain and latin america is europes second largest bank based on market value run by emilio botin whose father ran the bank before him it has expanded across latin america the u k and the u s in recent years "santander has been pretty quiet really in the whole process but it has i think the simplest task and is probably the biggest winner from this " says simon adamson an analyst at the research firm creditsights in london the brazil and italy operations "are pretty much separate from the rest of abn and therefore should be less cumbersome to split off " he says for rbs the outlook is cloudier mr goodwin the chief executive plans to oversee an integration that he expects to take until he could find himself sidelined from making acquisitions in europe or the u s in principle abn amros corporate bank provides a good fit for rbss current business in bonds and cash management but credit markets are in a slump making it tougher for companies to issue bonds and limiting profits for financiers who arrange bond issuance just as important is what rbs isnt getting the u s banking operation it had originally set its sights on "whatever sort of brave face theyre putting on it this is a big blow not to get lasalle " says mr adamson the analyst "im not sure that it would have been as attractive from day one if lasalle hadnt been available " mr goodwin and the other ceos face the task of taking apart abns offices telephone systems computers and staff of mr goodwin must disclose precise plans to break apart abn within about a day period after closing the purchase as required by dutch banking regulators the dutch regulators then will spend several months reviewing the plan the actual breakup will likely begin in the second quarter of next year summing up the abn deal merrill lynchs mr orcel says "size on its own is no longer a safety net for financial institutions " but he concedes "you need the right ingredients or your deal will fall apart "
