venture capital goes big start up angels fill void as buyout frenzy fades carlyles large fund wall streets buyout boom is ending because of the choppiness in the stock and credit markets so what are venture capital investors doing pushing into bigger private equity and buyout deals the strategy seems ill timed but venture capitalists say theyre targeting different deals than the multibillion dollar debt financed takeovers now causing problems for private equity firms such as kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and clayton dubilier &amp rice inc many venture investors say investing in larger firms private and public companies with established revenues and profits but smaller than the household names typically targeted by buyout shops can help sidestep the struggles in their traditional market of tiny start up companies venture capitalists generally make money only when the companies in which they invest go public or are sold this summers credit crunch doesnt seem to have deterred the venture firms today the venture arm of private equity firm carlyle group is expected to announce a &# million u s venture and "growth capital" fund that will focus mainly on later stage deals and buyouts including deals involving debt the funds later stage deals likely will involve &# million to &# million investments in mature companies that are producing revenues already compared with a typical initial investment of around &# million in a start up with little revenue that is just getting off the ground carlyle also expects to contribute around &# million to &# million to buyouts as large as &# million leveraging some of them at a ratio of two to three times debt to cash flow compared with a ratio of six to seven times for huge buyout deals this week ignition partners a venture firm in bellevue wash announced a &# million fund targeting profitable more mature companies and in february redpoint ventures raised a &# million fund to invest in larger companies and to fund more complex transactions other firms such as new enterprise associates and battery ventures switched gears a few years ago to add bigger deals and buyouts to their investment mix while many venture firms continue to invest in start ups the amount they are putting into larger deals is rising u s venture investors raised new funds valued at &# billion to target more mature companies in the first half of this year compared with just &# billion in all of according to thomson financial and the national venture capital association the numbers include investments in "later stage" companies which are usually profitable with a widely available product or service and "expansion stage" firms or slightly smaller companies with revenues but perhaps not profits though most venture firms try to distance themselves from large private equity firms painting themselves as hands on company creators and not slick deal makers "the distinction is rapidly disappearing for the larger venture funds " says bill burnham a former silicon valley venture capitalist who now runs his own hedge fund for acquisitions and late stage investments "were literally able to go to two times the number of venture firms that we could have a few years ago " because so many of these firms are setting aside money to do bigger deals adds peter falvey co founder of tech investment bank revolution partners robert e grady the co head of carlyle venture partners in san francisco carlyles venture capital arm says spreading investments among buyouts small and big companies is less risky than the "spray and pray" approach common in venture investing putting money in dozens of tiny unproven companies and hoping one or two will be huge money makers hits such as google inc which made billions for its venture investors are harder to come by these days he says with stock markets less receptive to small company ipos last year companies raised around &# billion from u s venture backed ipos compared with &# billion in at the height of the tech boom according to ventureone ventureone is owned by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal while some venture backed companies have sold themselves recently rather than go public valuations for those deals are also "not back to where they were in " mr grady says carlyle is playing it safe looking for high growth companies in industries such as tech medical devices and business services that already have "significant revenue traction" and are often profitable he says in smaller buyout transactions carlyle might borrow only a small amount of debt perhaps &# million or &# million not enough to be affected by the tightening credit market he adds carlyle expects to invest only about of its new fund in traditional early stage venture deals and if carlyle group moves to go public itself as many expect when market conditions improve an active venture arm with later stage deals would round out its portfolio and may make it more attractive to investors bankers agree that larger buyout shops not venture firms doing deals involving modest debt are feeling most of the credit crunchs pinch "i think its kind of a tale of two different markets " says david liu a managing director with investment bank jefferies broadview in foster city calif but some venture investors acknowledge their bigger deals are riskier now particularly if they involve debt ignition for example last year helped one of its early stage companies a provider of broadband internet and wireless phone services for cruise ships called seamobile inc to buy a competitor maritime telecommunications network inc for &# million including &# million in debt ignition declined to say how much it contributed "we couldnt do that deal today and we may not be able to do a deal like that in " says jon anderson an ignition partner others wonder whether venture investors who have largely focused on ferreting out start ups can handle bigger deals in a larger group of industries still mr anderson says his firm should succeed because it has solid relationships with entrepreneurs in the pacific northwest where it is focused and tom dyal a managing director at redpoint in menlo park calif says many of the bigger companies redpoint is targeting still need an "early stage skill set " in other words they may have revenues and profits but havent yet taken outside financing and still need active management help like a start up one example online ad company right media inc in which redpoint said it invested at least &# million in already had about &# million in revenue at the time but right media hadnt yet been funded by any venture firms and it needed help building its management team and forging business relationships in silicon valley "it felt like an early stage deal" but required more cash than a typical start up mr dyal says earlier this year yahoo inc agreed to buy the of right media that it didnt already own for &# million "it was a great outcome " mr dyal says
