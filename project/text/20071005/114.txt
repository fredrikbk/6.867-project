weekend journal tastings chateauneuf du papes warm side rustic french red makes cooler days feel positively cozy in the past couple of weeks weve written about two wines that might be new arrivals on many shelves gruner veltliner from austria and ribera del duero from spain if you missed either column drop us a note at wine wsj com this week we thought it would be fun to visit an old friend chateauneuf du pape the earthy red from the sun baked soil of the rhone valley of france at a time when so many wine bottles look sleek and modern chateauneuf du pape still makes us smile with its heavy embossed glass and old fashioned script have the wines themselves kept their antimodern charm we decided to find out now is a good time to be experimenting with chateauneuf du pape because of a nice run of good vintages following rain soaked including the well regarded s which are arriving at stores now we bought from and from stores in four states we planned to set our price limit at &# but there were so many available slightly above that figure that we raised our bar to &# one change from our youth was immediately apparent of our wines only two cost less than &# and they were &# and &# the last time we conducted a broad blind tasting of chateauneuf in the average price of all eight of our favorites was &# yes it was seven years ago but still at a time when there are so many great values in wine from around the world this gave us pause we especially enjoy the wines of the rhone valley in winter their earthy rawness seems the perfect complement to hearty meals and warm fires like many people in our generation weve always had a soft spot for chateauneuf du pape although its somewhat hard to say exactly what chateauneuf du pape really is the problem is that different grape types can be used in the wine so every bottle really does taste different that said what the good ones have always had in common for us is a kind of take me as i am charm a lack of pretension and a comfortable muscularity that remind us of the hero of an old western "gimme a shot of that guigal barkeep " we wanted to see if that was still the case we wish we were back from this particular roundup with unequivocally good news pardner but the results were mixed even after taking into account that these are young wines that need a little while to calm down and knit together we found too many of them truly harsh heavily alcoholic tasting and worst of all creamy from an overabundance of oak after our first flight we wondered what it was we used to love about chateauneuf du pape then we started tasting some winners that reminded us they were wines of balance and power with the kind of minerals that reminded us where they came from they were very dry and bursting with raspberry or blackberry fruit with a big splash of lemony acidity and then a long long finish that was slightly bitter in an attractive memorable way these were meaty wines that were proud to be a little rough not harsh but rough hewn eschewing the kind of easy smoothness thats so popular today the kind of wines that made us think of old fashioned words like "eschewing " these are truly unlike anything else with a very special brawn we felt we were doing the good ones an injustice by tasting them instead of drinking them with a big stew some sort of game or something similarly rustic in short they were wines that warmed our souls perfect indeed for cooler weather for now many of them are still quite challenging and hard because of their youth but they should soften somewhat with time our favorites showed the wide range of blends used in these wines domaine berthet rayne was grenache mourvedre cinsault and syrah while domaine raymond usseglio was grenache with some mourvedre cinsault and counoise our best of tasting which was grenache syrah and mourvedre was domaine grand veneur and it showed just what chateauneuf du pape can be dark juicy powerful and beautifully balanced a big confident wine the importer kysela pere &amp fils of winchester va says the winery made cases of which were imported and distributed in all states you might occasionally see a white chateauneuf du pape though it accounts for only a small percentage of total production we happened to see the white version of our best of tasting domaine grand veneur "la fontaine" and it was worth every penny of its &# a grand wine of real weight with rich tastes of melon honey and what john called "butter toasted peanuts" and dottie referred to as "like a toddy " made from roussanne grapes it would be awesome with pork or herbed fish dishes by the way because we open six to wines each night for our tastings we simply let some of these sit opened for a day to see what would happen and in many cases they were better the next day calmer more balanced and tightly knit at the very least if you do open a good and very young one you might think about leaving one glass in the bottom of the bottle to see how it is the next night unfortunately the average price of our nine favorites this year was about &# which means chateauneuf du pape wouldnt qualify as an everyday wine for most of us but on that first really cold day this winter bundle up get a chateauneuf du pape cook some hearty food and &# could seem a small price to pay for so much warmth melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones chateauneuf du pape index in a broad blind tasting of chateauneuf du pape from the and  vintages that cost less than &# these were our favorites these could generally use some age or at least decanting or some time in the glass after opening and are best served on cold days with big meals vineyard vintage domaine grand veneur alain jaume &amp fils
