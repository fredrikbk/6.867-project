sprint struggling in crowded market seeks replacement for ceo forsee sprint nextel corp is quietly seeking a replacement for chief executive gary forsee said people familiar with the matter just two years after he engineered the &# billion purchase of cellular operator nextel communications inc to keep pace with rapid consolidation in telecommunications the combined company has been plagued by high customer turnover merger hiccups and unhappy investors sprint now the nations third largest wireless carrier by subscribers has been lagging behind larger rivals at&amp t inc and verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc in the race to add new customers sprint board members hope to announce the companys new leader by early december the incoming ceo probably will be an outsider the people familiar with the matter said certain high profile telecom industry veterans have been approached and at least one of them has declined to be considered these people said a sprint spokeswoman declined to comment she said mr forsee was traveling and couldnt be reached because more than three out of four americans already own a cellphone there are fewer new customers to go around and wireless carriers have had to fight harder than ever for their market share they have done so by touting their strengths verizon boasts of having the best network quality and coverage at&amp t has been promoting apple inc s iphone which it offers exclusively in the u s and deutsche telekom ags t mobile usa has played up its affordability generally aiming for younger and cost conscious customers sprint meanwhile has been left searching for an identity in the second quarter sprints overall subscriber growth was just compared with the million customers added by at&amp t which leads the industry with million subscribers sprints net income for the quarter dropped to &# million or a penny a share from &# million or cents a share a year earlier many of the companys troubles stem from its reliance on customers with poor credit the cellphone industrys version of the subprime mortgage market the same kinds of people who now are having trouble paying their mortgages on time also are having trouble paying cellphone bills the year old mr forsee who has led sprint since and has been chairman since late last year had tried to calm restive investors by taking several steps during the past few months he made investments aimed at improving the companys creaky phone network and customer service revamped its advertising and outlined new initiatives related to the creation of a high speed wireless network using the new wimax technology however those efforts left him in no better standing on wall street sprint shares have fallen about since the completion of the nextel takeover the shares rose cents or to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday before news of the companys intention to replace mr forsee broke in after hours trading the stock rose cents to &# earlier this week activist investor ralph whitworth told the wall street journal that he had lost confidence in mr forsee mr whitworth threatened a proxy fight for board seats unless sprint directors "immediately" dealt with the companys leadership issue mr whitworths relational investors llc owns roughly of the sprint shares outstanding sprints board had already run out of patience directors began the ceo search in august because they felt dissatisfied with mr forsees performance one person with knowledge of the matter said the ceo and fellow executives "werent making the numbers "" this person added "everyone is just disappointed "" mr forsees successor will face a big task sprint plans to invest heavily in wimax which offers wireless internet access at much faster speeds than do other carriers that could give consumers on the go better access to the web on their laptops cellphones and even cameras or music players but in the short term and for the foreseeable future sprints fortunes are likely to rise and fall with its core cellphone business the company could become a buyout target if its stock falls precipitously in coming months cable operators and private equity firms in the past have considered making a run at the wireless carrier but none of them has been eager to take on the problems created by the sprint nextel merger this summers credit crunch makes it less likely that a private buyer will be willing or able to swallow sprint which has a market capitalization of roughly &# billion during an early august board meeting mr forsee whose years in the industry have included stints at southwestern bell at&amp t and bellsouth corp discussed succession planning at sprint and his protracted search for a chief operating officer people familiar with the matter said he previously had told wall street that he would get the post filled during the first quarter talks with the companys top choice for the job former vodafone executive bill morrow had fallen apart after mr morrow sought a guarantee that he would succeed mr forsee as ceo within months knowledgeable people said at the august gathering sprints independent directors met without mr forsee during this executive session they decided to kill the search for a no executive and instead find a replacement for mr forsee according to people close to the situation "the board just reached a point where it said we have to make a ceo move "" one informed person recalled that same day sprints board sounded out daniel akerson a former nextel ceo about taking over from mr forsee mr akerson now co head of the u s buyout team at private equity firm carlyle group rejected the feeler because he liked working for the washington based firm another knowledgeable person said a spokeswoman for carlyle declined to comment telecom industry recruiters not involved in the ceo search expect sprint to approach mr morrow again as well as other industry veterans such as andrew sukawaty a former sprint official who now runs inmarsat plc a satellite communications company based in london mr morrow now is president and chief operating officer of pacific gas &amp electric co a unit of san francisco based pg&amp e corp an inmarsat spokesman declined to comment the company recently granted mr sukawaty a long term incentive plan there will be a new ceo in place at sprint as early as november one knowledgeable person predicted the new chief also may get the chairmans title now held by mr forsee according to another person familiar with the situation earlier this year mr whitworth and other sprint investors began to call for major changes at the company such as a review of its planned multibillion dollar investment in wimax and the possible spinoff of certain business units by june mr forsee was mulling various options for the wimax project he told investors he would look for strategic partners he approached cable operators and private equity firms about the idea people familiar with the matter said he also considered spinning off the wimax unit entirely but none of those scenarios materialized in july mr forsee entered a deal with start up clearwire corp to build a nationwide wimax network with each company giving the others customers roaming rights but investors wanted more clarity about how much money the deal would save sprint and whether the relatively untested wimax technology would attract consumers sprint held a summit in mid august near its reston va headquarters to address those concerns officials laid out financial projections lowering estimated wimax spending by about &# million the savings and the overall presentation werent enough to appease mr whitworth and some other investors adding to the frustration on wall street was the fact that sprints share price somewhat buoyed by speculation about a leveraged buyout of the company earlier in the year sagged again as tighter credit markets made such a deal less likely a bigger problem for some shareholders was the uncertainty about sprints longer term prospects the company made good on its promise to achieve modest subscriber gains in the second quarter but since then mr forsee has been hesitant about setting specific milestones for judging sprints progress chief financial officer paul saleh said after the second quarter results he expected customer turnover to increase in the third quarter a standard trend in the industry
