politics &amp economics for pakistan a tenuous accord musharraf bhutto reach deal but pacts durability is uncertain pakistans president gen pervez musharraf and former prime minister benazir bhutto struck an agreement designed to allow them to shepherd the country from military rule to civilian government after months of on again off again talks on sharing power the question remains whether the two old foes will be able to work together as president and premier the agreement would permit ms bhutto leader in exile of the nations largest political party to return to pakistan this month to run for prime minister in general elections in about three months in dealing with ms bhutto gen musharraf has among other things sought to avoid the embarrassment of a mass resignation of lawmakers before an electoral college vote saturday in which he is expected to win a second term as president farooq naik a leader of ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party said yesterday that ms bhutto has approved the presidential ordinance of "national reconciliation" prepared by the government "it is now back with president musharraf to sign it " mr naik said a government official familiar with the talks said the two sides had an agreement the deal comes amid escalating political and security tensions that may threaten pakistans flourishing economy in the past three months islamist militants have killed more than pakistani soldiers in suicide attacks in a country that is at the front line of an international battle against terrorism "pakistan is in a lot of trouble " says daniel markey a south asia expert at the council on foreign relations in washington "the internal challenge of militancy and terrorism is gradually being recognized as one that may be beyond the governments capacity to manage " while gen musharraf maintains broad backing among pakistans business community the militant attacks threaten to undermine the economic growth that has helped cushion months of political shocks gen musharraf has faced stiff opposition within his own party to engaging ms bhutto such resistance isnt expected to affect gen musharrafs re election to another five year term the vote is cast by secret ballot in an electoral college of lawmakers where gen musharraf enjoys a majority if re elected gen musharraf has pledged to retire from the military next month and return pakistan to a civilian led democracy for the first time since a military coup brought him to power eight years ago this week gen musharraf appointed a close aide to replace him as army chief when he steps down from the post for ms bhutto the prospect of an alliance with gen musharraf has damaged her popularity at home and sealing the deal could see her support diminish to the point where her party doesnt do well enough in the national vote to install her as prime minister even if the two are chosen as president and prime minister there are doubts about the durability of a political union both are known as headstrong leaders unaccustomed to sharing power gen musharraf years old is a former commando who toppled the countrys last civilian government in a coup ms bhutto spent years in jail or house arrest during a previous military regime under which her father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto was put to death aides to gen musharraf and ms bhutto say their unlikely alliance is due in part to nudging from a few western governments including the u s the two share similar qualities that backers believe can make an agreement work both are considered social and political moderates in an islamic nation where extremism is on the rise and both continue to believe they have a role leading pakistan a volatile state armed with nuclear weapons to seal the deal gen musharraf has to guarantee ms bhutto that his government would drop corruption and other charges against her according to people who have been involved in the talks the government also intends to overturn a law passed during gen musharrafs time in office that prohibits former prime ministers from serving more than two terms according to a person familiar with the talks some have expressed skepticism that an ex general can help navigate pakistan which has spent more than half its year life under military rule toward genuine democracy "the larger issue for pakistan is whether the civilian government is going to be supreme or whether we are going to stay subservient to the military " said asma jahangir chairwoman of the human rights commission of pakistan and a persistent musharraf critic another risk is that a ruptured relationship between the two at the top of government could stall pakistans rapid economic growth over the past five years pakistan has averaged growth and the economy is expected to expand about as fast this year the growth has widened pakistans middle class while a new generation of consumers has surfaced in the wake of the countrys economic opening the benchmark karachi stock exchange has risen from a year ago since the terrorist attacks of sept gen musharraf has steered pakistan away from afghanistans taliban and toward the u s in the six years since a new u s alliance has brought more than &# billion in assistance to pakistan most of it extended to the military closer u s ties have brought pressure to clamp down on pro taliban and al qaeda militants operating inside pakistan osama bin laden is believed to be living in the lawless border region between pakistan and afghanistan but pakistans army has had only mixed success the situation has left gen musharraf with few good options apart from intensifying a military campaign to stamp out militants and increasing aid to help rebuild battleground areas for both he needs u s support the u s military is helping to train a corps of frontier fighters and the u s government recently agreed to extend &# million in development aid over five years for pakistans tribal areas for ms bhutto the prospect of a return to pakistan marks another change in a life almost operatic for its heavy doses of drama after her fathers death in and her imprisonment ms bhutto rose to power in supplanting a military led government with a democratic one but allegations of corruption and confrontational ties to the military marred her two periods in office in during the second term the berlin based transparency international rated pakistan the second most corrupt country in the world after nigeria her governments poor record of economic management prompted the international monetary fund to temporarily freeze emergency loans to pakistan when a hand picked president constitutionally dismissed her government in ms bhuttos rival nawaz sharif came to power she stayed abroad in when orders came for her arrest that same year mr sharif joined her in exile after the army led by gen musharraf toppled his government mr sharif tried to return to pakistan last month but never managed to leave the airport before pakistani authorities dispatched him on a flight back to exile in saudi arabia
