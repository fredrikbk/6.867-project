weekend journal review theater oldest living southern playwright tells all dividing the estate primary stages e theatres e th st &# closes oct mauritius manhattan theatre club biltmore theatre w th st &# &# closes nov new york horton foote is one of those much admired writers who has never quite gotten his due yes he won a pulitzer prize for "the young man from atlanta" and a pair of best screenplay oscars for "tender mercies" and "to kill a mockingbird " but none of his odd plays has had a decent broadway run and i know a not inconsiderable number of otherwise avid playgoers to whom he is barely more than a name to be sure signature theatre companys revival of "the trip to bountiful" was so successful that it stirred up talk of a broadway transfer but no theaters were open that spring so it disappeared into the memory hole fortunately chicagos goodman theatre is remounting signatures production of "the trip to bountiful" in march while "dividing the estate " which was first seen in princeton n j in but never made it to new york is now being performed off broadway by primary stages a company that has a record of taking mr footes work seriously about time too "dividing the estate" is one of the best american plays to open on or off broadway since i started covering theater for the journal four years ago and the fact that it is only just now receiving its new york premiere is downright scandalous mr foote gets compared to chekhov a lot with good reason his plays are bittersweet loosely plotted snapshots of small town southern life in which the comedy of which theres plenty is flavored with the sharp aftertaste of regret in "dividing the estate" the regret is shared by a family whose middle aged members have squandered the best years of their lives feeding off the fast shrinking bounty of stella elizabeth ashley a land rich cash poor texas matriarch stella we learn chose to continue living on her late husbands farm instead of selling it off after his death and splitting the profits with her resentful children and grandchildren whose souls have been soured by waiting too long to divvy up the spoils part of what makes "dividing the estate" so effective is that mr foote has shrewdly chosen to play this horrible situation for laughs letting the underlying pain and suffering emerge between the lines nor does he make the mistake of turning his characters into gargoyles of greed even the shrewish mary jo played to perfection by hallie foote mr footes daughter is given her due as a human being and though you wouldnt want to spend a minute more with her than absolutely necessary its easy to see how she and her neer do well husband bob james demarse fell into the confidence shriveling trap of waiting for stella to divide the family estate instead of choosing to make their own way in the world director michael wilson has put together a cast of so fine that youll pinch yourself every few minutes to make sure youre not dreaming ms ashley has the showiest role and makes the most of it exhaling her lines in a bass baritone voice that sounds as though it had been aged in a barrel of drano ms foote and devon abner who in real life are husband and wife are just as good in their quieter way though while the other members of the cast are all so believable that the word "acting" fails to do justice to the collective impression of truthfulness that they make i come from a small town on the northern edge of the deep south and i can tell you that this production like mr footes play gets everything absolutely right horton foote as it happens is years old and since drama critics are as sentimental as anyone else i wondered whether i would feel obliged to make allowances for his advanced age in writing about "dividing the estate " nothing doing this wonderful play reminds me of something that the great and long lived japanese painter hokusai once said "at i shall penetrate the mystery of things at i shall certainly have reached a marvelous stage and when i am everything i do be it a dot or a line will be alive " id say mr foote is a couple of decades ahead of schedule theresa rebeck writes plays with glib cute first acts that fall apart after intermission so i suppose that "mauritius " her broadway debut could be said to be a step forward its glib and cute all the way through this time around ms rebeck has given us the story of two half sisters katie finneran and alison pill who are fighting over the contents of a valuable stamp album they inherited from their mother in short order they fall among thieves a vulpine trio of philatelist scamsters f murray abraham dylan baker and bobby cannavale who will tell any lie necessary in order to get their hands on the sisters stamps the plot resembles one of those con artist confections that have lately become series tv staples not surprisingly either since ms rebecks resume includes stints spent working on "law &amp order criminal intent" and "nypd blue" the mens roles are written in the screw you style of david mamet while the women appear to have wandered in from some unrelated six hankie domestic weeper playing across the alley good acting good staging good sets all wasted mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
