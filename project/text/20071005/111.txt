weekend journal taste de gustibus clear eyed optimists im old enough to recall the days in the late s when people wore those trendy buttons that read "stop the planet i want to get off " and i will never forget that eras "educational" films of what life would be like in the year played on clanky millimeter projectors they showed images of people walking down the streets of manhattan with masks on so they could avoid breathing the poison gases our industrial society was spewing the future seemed mighty bleak back then and you merely had to open the newspapers for the latest story confirming how the human species was speeding down a congested highway to extinction a group of scientists calling themselves the club of rome issued a report called "limits to growth " it explained that lifeboat earth had become so weighed down with humans that we were running out of food minerals forests water energy and just about everything else that we need for survival paul ehrlichs best selling book "the population bomb" gave england a chance of surviving into the st century in jimmy carter released the "global report " which declared that life on earth was getting worse in every measurable way so imagine how shocked i was to learn officially that were not doomed after all a new united nations report called "state of the future" concludes "people around the world are becoming healthier wealthier better educated more peaceful more connected and they are living longer " yes of course there was the obligatory bad news global warming is said to be getting worse and income disparities are widening but the joyous trends in health and wealth documented in the report indicate a gigantic leap forward for humanity this is probably the first time youve heard any of this because while the grim "global " and "limits to growth" reports were deemed worthy of headlines across the country the media mostly ignored the good news and the upbeat predictions of "state of the future " but here they are world wide illiteracy rates have fallen by half since and now stand at an all time low of more people live in free countries than ever before the average human being today will live longer in than one born in to what do we owe this improvement capitalism according to the u n free trade is rightly recognized as the engine of global prosperity in recent years in of the worlds population lived on less than &# a day now that percentage is only adjusted for inflation and at current rates of growth "world poverty will be cut in half between and " which is arguably one of the greatest triumphs in human history trade and technology are closing the global "digital divide " and the report notes hopefully that soon laptop computers will cost &# and almost every schoolchild will be a mouse click away from the internet and regrettably those interminable computer games it also turns out that the malthusians who worried that we would overpopulate the planet got the story wrong human beings arent reproducing like norwegian field mice demographers now say that in the second half of this century the human population will stabilize and then fall if we use the same absurd extrapolation techniques demographers used in the s japan with its current low birth rate will have only a few thousand citizens left in years i take special pleasure in reciting all of this global betterment because my first professional job was working with the "doom slaying" economist julian simon starting years ago simon who died in told anyone who would listen which wasnt many people that the faddish declinism of that era was bunk he called the "global " report "globaloney " armed with an arsenal of factual missiles he showed that life on earth was getting better and that the combination of free markets and human ingenuity was the recipe for solving environmental and economic problems mr ehrlich in response said simon proved that the one thing the world isnt running out of "is lunatics " mr ehrlich whose every prediction turned out wrong won a macarthur foundation "genius award" simon who got the story right never won so much as a mcdonalds hamburger but now who looks like the lunatic this latest survey of the planet is certainly sweet vindication of simon and others like herman kahn who in the s dared challenge the "settled science " are you listening global warming alarmists the medias collective yawn over "state of the future" is typical of the reaction to just about any good news when was declared the hottest year on record there were thousands of news stories but last months revised data indicating that was actually warmer barely warranted a paragraph long correction in most papers so im happy to report that the worlds six billion people are living longer healthier and more comfortably than ever before if only it were easy to fit that on a button mr moore is a member of the wall street journal editorial board
