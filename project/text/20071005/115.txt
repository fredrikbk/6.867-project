weekend journal the drivers seat infiniti g &amp nissan altima coupe nissans sibling rivalry forgive me if you already know and if you count yourself among the sports car cognoscenti you must but oct at the tokyo motor show nissan will unveil its new gt r coupe also known as the skyline with a rumored liter twin turbocharged v producing some horsepower this all wheel drive monster is the kind of car that can single handedly build a performance reputation prototypes spied during track testing are said to be faster than the awesome porsche turbo yet the gt r is expected to cost &# less when it goes on sale next summer while speculation about an as yet unreleased model is just that no one should be surprised if nissan delivers the goods already the japanese manufacturer has pulled off a similar trick not once but twice in the past year with a redesigned infiniti g coupe and the new nissan altima coupe like the forthcoming gt r both of these new models are objects of beauty while offering plenty of power and performance and selling for more reasonable sums than the competition but like many nissans past each car has some rough edges the infiniti g is a complete redesign of the g the highly successful rival to bmws series that debuted five years ago the previous generation infiniti g was praised as the only legitimate contender to the bimmers primacy among driving enthusiasts and the new infiniti raises the competitive bar even more than bmw did with its own model year redesign the g is now rated at horsepower and pound feet of torque thanks to a new version of nissans ubiquitous v stroked to increase displacement to liters those are robust v like numbers and they give the rear wheel drive g the attitude of a muscle car extra heavy clutch included but with excellent brakes to match its blossoming weight the g is a more evolved beast an extremely stiff suspension means it can really corner despite its pounds though it isnt the most comfortable car to drive on rough pavement at least the front seats are well bolstered and the rest of the interior has undergone a major upgrade from the cheap plastics that marred the old model the interior space hasnt grown though its as claustrophobia inducing as ever the g looks similar to the car it replaces but with a bit more curvature in its lines and a more aggressive front end its an undeniably striking vehicle that looks as japanese as the bmw seems german the competition between these two models is closer than ever but the infiniti is the clear winner when price is factored into the equation the g sport with a six speed manual transmission lists for &# including destination charge while in the alternate reality of bmw pricing this kind of cash buys only a horsepower i coupe bmws hot horsepower i will set you back at least &# making the g seem like a phenomenal bargain that is until you take a long hard look at nissans altima coupe its not just better looking than the infiniti but an even better value while the &# base model powered by a horsepower liter four cylinder engine is a true sheep in wolfs clothing opting for the liter v makes for a surprisingly competent performance machine testing by road &amp track magazine shows the v altima coupe can go from zero to mph in seconds just two tenths slower than the g even better the nissans quarter mile time of seconds halves that difference the caveat here is that horsepower or not the altima coupe is still a front wheel drive vehicle which hurts its handling thats part of the reason the g is nearly two miles per hour faster through road &amp tracks slalom course the question is whether that little bit of speed is worth the &# difference in price since the v altima coupe can be had for as little as &# of course youre not just giving up a bit of speed to keep that grand in your pocket the altima looks like a less expensive car too at least from the inside thats not to say its monochromatic interior is low grade just plasticky then theres the altimas abysmal on center steering feel id gladly trade the cars gee whiz standard keyless entry and push button ignition system to be able to cruise down the freeway without constantly adjusting the steering wheel while the altima comes with a typical complement of standard features the notable exception being stability control adding luxury amenities like leather seats and a navigation system will drive the price north of &# at that threshold its time to start calculating just how much more the monthly payment on the g would be and start shopping for a portable navigation system at best buy
