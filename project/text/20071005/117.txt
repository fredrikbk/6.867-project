great estates broker based in savannah ga encourages her agents to do personal favors that arent too time consuming three weeks ago for example one agent retrieved a set of false teeth that had been

comfortable with one agent who specializes in seniors for example calls them to remind them of their doctors appointments agents are also advised to keep a list handy of the things they are willing to do plus referrals to service providers according to shaun white a spokesman for the denver based company the need to please is part of a larger diminution of the agents role in the age of zillow

felt bad in a way " says ms warner who offered to pay ms brown for her time ms brown declined because she hoped that ms warner would use her services in the future and recommend her to her friends "its not always about an immediate profit " she says some clients ask for favors even after the sale closes in august liz dameron a homemaker closed on a three bedroom craftsman style house in roanoke

ms dykstra whom she has come to consider a friend "i know shes there for me " says ms dameron but this time she wasnt ms dykstra who was driving around another client when the call came gently
