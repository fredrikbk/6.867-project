pursuits sports &amp recreation gardening the race to break the squash barrier competitive horticulture hits a rough patch as growers try to produce a ton pumpkin dick wallace flipped a switch on the gallon plastic tank labeled "soil soup " and the motor rumbled into life with a low vibrating hum the switch turned on an electric pump that gurgled air through the tank mixing a microbe rich brew of water manure compost and just about anything else a grower cared to throw in molasses seaweed banana peels dicks son ron filled his heavy duty backpack sprayer with the organic fertilizer then strapped the awkward contraption onto his back he paused for a moment at the edge of his pumpkin patch like an astronaut preparing to leave the ship on a space walk his gaze swept over the garden in a critical survey the vines were huge each one from feet long and feet across at the base they were planted back to back their triangular forms pointing toward the outside edges of the garden like the prows of battleships lined up at a dock with the brownish greenish black compost tea sloshing in the tank on his back ron stepped into the pumpkin patch fired up the sprayers engine and blasted out a nutrient packed mist that soaked the plant leaves and dripped down into the dirt below for the past years ron a year old country club manager in rhode island and his father dick wallace a retired factory superintendent had run a race against hundreds of other growers around the world trying to grow a pumpkin big enough to set a world record i first met the wallaces in october when i was reporting a story for this newspaper about the extraordinary effort that went into growing a championship giant pumpkin the father and son impressed me with their dedication their growing skills and their monumental bad luck while shadowing the wallaces and other giant pumpkin growers for my book about the growing season the most striking aspect of their quest was the daunting odds they face competition has been getting stiffer each year as more people discovered the hobby and the secrets of giant pumpkin growing spread around the world from the u s to europe to australia and japan scientific and technological advances are giving a turbo boost to the "sport" of competitive gardening transforming a once obscure hobby and attracting a whole new crop of devotees men and women who had never given a thought to growing their own dahlias or tomatoes are drawn to the challenge of learning complex biochemistry plant genetics and microbiology to produce new generations of super plants airplane pilots and housewives architects and truck drivers are diversifying the pursuit of competitive gardening far beyond the genteel realm of the chelsea flower show technology also has spread the hobby geographically a computerized watering and cooling system helps one grower to produce giant pumpkins in the plus temperatures of phoenix timed heaters and a greenhouse with an automated ventilation system allowed j d megchelsen to become the first person to grow a pound pumpkin nearly a half ton in the frozen tundra of alaska in a remarkable blitz of one upmanship the world record weight for a giant pumpkin had been broken times between and but the hot tub sized three quarter ton fruit were growing so freakishly large even the growers had begun to wonder how much bigger could they get each season launched a new war between good and evil in the garden they invested thousands of dollars on soil supplements fertilizers special equipment and a chemical arsenal to combat insects and disease they spent long hours in hard physical labor pruning and weeding and feeding and watering mathematical formulae were used to calculate pumpkin weights based on size dirt samples were boxed up and sent to university laboratories for analysis and leading scientists were hired to diagnose slimy diseased plant pieces the dream was that by the time the harvest moon rose in the late september sky all that sacrifice would produce at least one giant pumpkin with a chance to set a world record in their steady march to a one ton pumpkin growers owed much to the farmers who came before them farmers long ago learned how to manipulate nature to create plants that are more suitable for eating modern food crops have been genetically tuned through decades sometimes centuries of cross breeding to bring out desirable traits such as sweeter juicier flesh better color larger size and disease resistance thats how grasses became grain crops and tiny green berries became plump red tomatoes left to her own devices mother nature never intended pumpkins to grow as big as a small car giant pumpkins are cultivated from an elite seed stock and the genetic programming locked inside each seed dictates what kind of pumpkin it will grow the most hotly sought after seeds are those engineered to grow the very biggest and heaviest fruit and which have proven their pedigree by already producing several world class specimens but all that genetic tinkering has yielded some giant pumpkins with mottled grey white and pink skin and rough cantaloupe like veining across the shell gravity pulls on these monsters as they grow shaping them into great lopsided lumps the effect can be disturbing as if a huge cancerous tumor has sprouted in the garden now growers face even tougher challenges as their genetically pumped pumpkins grow so fast and so big that many are splitting open or rotting on the vine before they can get to a weigh off in the quest for ever bigger pumpkins growers must figure out what it is thats holding them back says texas a&amp m university horticultural professor stephen king do the plants need thicker stems to carry more nutrients to the pumpkin stronger root systems to support the rapid growth "once you reach a plateau in order to make another jump you have to find something to change " dr king says like most competitors pumpkin growers are always looking for new techniques that will give them an edge over their rivals larry checkon the world champion decided to try aspirin after reading several recent agricultural studies proving that the acetylsalicylic acid in aspirin stimulates a plants defense systems making it more disease resistant the prescription one to two aspirins dissolved in a couple of gallons of water then sprinkled over the plants leaves in ron wallace was seized by the potential of beneficial fungus his research in soil chemistry had led him to a scientist at the usdas horticultural crops research laboratory in corvallis ore named dr robert linderman dr lindermans specialty was something called mycorrhizal fungi many fungi live symbiotically with plants and animals and mycorrhizal fungi specialize in roots it acts as a bridge between soil and plant penetrating into nooks and crannies of the dirt where the bigger roots cant reach and ferrying nutrients and water back to the plant the fungi produce stronger more disease resistant plants that grow bigger and yield more fruit this was the secret weapon ron and dick wallace hoped would launch them into the winners circle in the growing season had officially begun when the plants went into the ground in early may but pollination in early july was the starting gun for the race that really counted growers hand pollinated the female flowers on every plant to control the genetic parentage and to make sure each selected female was thoroughly fertilized ultimately just one pumpkin would be grown on each plant so that all the energy would be poured into a single fruit to be a world champion contender a pumpkin needed growth accelerating to to pounds a day in early august putting on a total of pounds during that month alone ron emerged from his barn and squinted up at the sky the rain had lightened to a mist it was time to pollinate while he had the chance with a bouquet of male flowers in one hand he walked carefully down a slippery wet plank kneeling down over the female flower he stripped the petals off one of the male flowers to expose its pollen laden stamen many growers use the exposed stamen like a paint brush gently rubbing its pollen off onto the female flowers stigma but ron preferred to knock the pollen off by flicking his finger against the stem of the male "i like to get that nice gentle pollen flying down on there " with his pumpkins pollinated rons biggest worry was the rainy weather the soggy conditions were ripe for disease ron wasnt sure he could stomach another season of losing his best pumpkins to rot "granted youre always going to lose a pumpkin or two but you know what me and my father deserve a little luck " he said growing pensive as he thought about their history of disasters in the pumpkin patch ron plodded back toward the house staring down at his boots squishing through the wet grass "well " he mused "i guess its like clint eastwood said in the unforgiven deservins got nothing to do with it all you can really ask for is opportunity " ron like every other giant pumpkin grower wanted to be the one to crash through the pound barrier if he could manage that then anything was possible maybe even one day a one ton pumpkin copyright by susan warren backyard giants the passionate heartbreaking and glorious quest to grow the biggest pumpkin ever will be published
