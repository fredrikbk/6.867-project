pursuits books oil powered ambition the life of venezuelas u s baiting socialist leader hugo chavez by cristina marcano and alberto barrera tyszka random house pages &# hugo by bart jones steerforth pages &# in december former army colonel and political outsider hugo chavez frias was elected president of venezuela his popular appeal was not hard to divine in a country where more than of the population struggled in miserable poverty he promised to dethrone the ruling elite end corruption and deliver justice almost nine years later mr chavez is still in charge and the government has been enriched by oil prices four times higher than in but venezuelans still suffer terrible privation graft is worse than ever and mr chavez himself who has destroyed nearly all institutional checks on his power says that he wont step down from the presidency until more worrisome still mr chavez has used his countrys oil wealth to engage in a weapons buildup and to fund subversion in neighboring latin american countries his public rhetoric notoriously on display at the united nations in september is provocatively anti american he has made friends with the "axis of evil " cozying up to iran and north korea on both the political and the economic front not surprisingly he has garnered more attention from the u s than any latin leader since daniel ortega and the days of soviet meddling in nicaragua two books now strive to explain the chavez phenomenon and what is often called his bolivarian revolution named after simon bolivar the hero of south americas struggle to win independence from spain in the early th century mr chavez is promising to deliver latin american independence again this time supposedly from u s hegemony "hugo chavez " by venezuelan journalists cristina marcano and alberto barrera tyszka shows that mr chavez is no accidental president for more than a decade right under the nose of his commanding officers and the civilian government col chavez and his band of hard left conspirators plotted rebellion the seeds of his revolutionary fervor were planted much earlier young hugo was schooled in communism in his home state of barinas by the father of his two best friends vladmir named after lenin and federico as in engels when he went off to the military academy in caracas at the age of he carried a copy of "the diary of che guevara " at the academy mr chavez read voraciously "i liked mao a lot " ms marcano and mr barrera tyszka quote him saying after he graduated they write "he began to make contact with recalcitrant members of the military and prominent figures of the venezuelan left the most radical of whom maintained clandestine ties with the governments of libya iraq north korea and algeria " the government of president carlos andres perez elected in december gave the rebel soldiers all the justification they felt they needed to make a move the january inauguration itself was an event so "extravagant that the press nicknamed it the coronation " it was followed three weeks later by the announcement of a painful economic austerity package which touched off massive riots and looting in caracas on feb mr chavez and his followers initiated the coup detat they had long yearned for assaulting a variety of strategic locations around the country and driving a tank up the steps of miraflores the presidential palace in the end the coup failed but it gave mr chavez a chance to unleash his charisma on the venezuelan public in a live nationally televised surrender speech he came out of the whole episode a hero when he ran for president six years later he was a symbol of justice and courage to a demoralized population one of the great frustrations of president chavezs adversaries has been his skillful use of the law under the guise of democracy to thwart his opposition from the outset he led the effort to rewrite the constitution with broader powers for the executive and he later grabbed control of the national electoral council in he proposed new powers for himself that meant in essence his ruling by decree the core of his program was the destruction of property rights the transfer of wealth from the old ruling elite to the underclass and the strangulation of the private sector his rhetoric was filled with class warfare militancy but it may have been the threat to nationalize education a la cuba that provoked the greatest outcry venezuelan society became deeply polarized on april at least protesters took to the streets to push back when mr chavez ordered the military to use force against them the officer corps refused and mr chavez was unseated but he still had ideological allies inside the military working to outmaneuver his enemies and the chavista machine soon called its own protesters to the streets two days later he was restored to power though few know exactly how it happened today his government is ever more authoritarian seizing major assets in may he took over venezuelas last privately held oil fields revoking the license of important opposition media and tamping down political opposition by threatening the employment of those who oppose him more and more mr chavezs venezuela resembles perons argentina if not the china of mao whom mr chavez once so admired ms marcano and mr barrera tyszka have compiled an impressive amount of facts and they give a reliable narrative of events up to when their book first appeared in spanish they have written an epilogue for this english language edition intended to take us through december but their analysis is weakened by a tendency to balance criticism of mr chavez with what they see as compensating judgments yes we read about the rampant corruption under chavismo the crackdown on civil liberties and the ailing economy but we are also told for instance that mr chavez has enormous appeal in the bronx where he has provided subsidized heating oil as if such "generosity" offsets his destruction of venezuelan freedoms the authors also blame failed "neo liberal economic policies" meaning free market policies and the "increasing inequality they brought about" for the popularity of left wing extremism in latin america but with the exception of chile latin america has never really enjoyed free market economics rather its model has been corporatism with some half measures like mr perezs austerity package amazingly ms marcano and mr barrera tyszka write that "in washington after more than five years of verbal attacks people realize that hugo chavez is not as evil as he seems " if this was true in the and i doubt it it is certainly no longer true if anything mr chavez is viewed today as more dangerous than ever by other latin american countries as well as by the u s for bart jones in "hugo " evil has nothing to do with it mr chavez is a force for good mr joness chronicle is a sustained homage to mr chavez and his brand of authoritarianism by mr joness lights cuba has "excelled" at health care and performed wonders in education and mr chavezs efforts to import the cuban model are admirable chavez social programs are improving the lives of the venezuelan poor his habit of confiscating property and nationalizing businesses is merely the best way of making the country more just and prosperous as for all the tinkering with venezuelas constitution mr chavez has not consolidated power any more than has george w bush who after all nominated two supreme court justices in mr joness opinion members of a powerful anti chavez clique with at least tacit u s approval engineered the removal of the president in april they set up snipers fired on the crowd and used the violence that followed as a pretext for unseating mr chavez the right wing american press then gave a distorted version of events portraying it as a genuine populist uprising i have written about mr chavez in the journal in recent years and mr jones calls me a "rabid" anti chavez critic but he lists plenty of others who have supposedly judged mr chavez unfairly including madeleine albright and the editors of the new york times whatever else hugo chavez may be he is the product of his countrys troubled recent history for more than two decades before he came to power venezuelas oil wealth was in the hands of the state as such it was a corrupting force channeling money and power to political favorites and corrupt oligarchs little surprise then that venezuelas democracy collapsed under such an arrangement and that an egomaniacal military officer schooled in communist ideology stepped into the breach whether mr chavezs opponents since then have learned anything about the importance of limited government remains to be seen ms ogrady edits the journals weekly americas column
