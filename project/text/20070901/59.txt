pursuits sports baseball game called on account of plane in the minor leagues a summer of travel delays has left many teams and fans up in the air airline delays this summer have disappointed millions of u s travelers on a recent tuesday night they also threw a curveball at thousands of minor league baseball fans who showed up to watch a game between the fresno grizzlies and the tacoma rainiers the rainiers had just flown in from colorado on a united flight but their luggage including uniforms bats and gloves never made it the grizzlies executive vice president andrew stuebner says he had no choice but to cancel the game about minutes after the first pitch was supposed to be thrown "it was a no win situation " he says for the players in professional triple a minor league baseball the summers travel crunch has presented a particular challenge minor league teams dont have the immense budgets and private jets of their big league parents at the triple a level just below the majors they depend almost entirely on commercial flights and unlike other sports they play a grueling schedule of six or seven games a week half of them on the road leaving little margin for error making things worse teams typically shuttle between small cities that are served by connecting flights on regional jets which lack the frequency that the big hubs have this summer those tricky logistics have collided head on with the airlines woes a game between the durham bulls and the ottawa lynx was cancelled this season when some of the team landed five hours after the scheduled first pitch when the las vegas s missed a connection to nashville in may the team spent &# to rebook everyone and then showed up an hour late after connecting in denver and chicago in may a salt lake bees oklahoma redhawks game was delayed by two and a half hours because the bees incoming plane had mechanical problems bees pitcher henry bonilla was later hailed as a hero for allowing only one run in the first six innings despite having little time to warm up "this season its been so frustrating " says mike birling general manager of the durham bulls a triple a team affiliated with the tampa bay devil rays the team was made famous in the film "bull durham " mr birling oversees the teams business operations including corporate sponsorships and endorsements but these days one of the most complicated parts of his job is coordinating roughly two dozen separate trips for away games each trip involves getting players coaches trainers a radio broadcaster and about pieces of heavy luggage between cities such as ottawa toledo and buffalo the teams entire travel budget including hotels is roughly &# mr birling says this seasons airline hassles have been the worst in his nine years working for the bulls he says he has stopped taking chances and now ships luggage ahead of time by truck when he knows the team is flying a small jet on some routes such as toledo durham the team now takes a bus not every player likes it "there are some times when they want to fly and i say guys we cant " mr birling says dave kaval ceo of golden baseball league an independent league of six teams says he also has switched to buses because theyre more reliable this season that has meant rides as long as hours between games in cities such as yuma ariz and chico calif "its a real pr nightmare canceling a game " mr kaval says iowa cubs player eric patterson says road games mean cramped seats and luggage delays and lots of red eye flights and a m wakeup calls the iowa cubs also started taking buses this year when they travel between des moines and memphis a hour ride "it definitely takes some getting used to " says mr patterson he got a taste of the good life when he was called up for a week with the major league chicago cubs direct charter flights with catered meals and movies and often a whole row of the plane to himself in fresno calif grizzlies fans greg and grace lally and their year old son sean already had eaten hamburgers and hot dogs at the stadium when the game against the rainiers was called the family has season tickets and goes to almost every home game at fresnos chukchansi park sean knows the names of all the pitchers whove been called up to play in the majors he says he didnt mind when he thought the game was delayed but when it was called off entirely he was bummed "i said oh man " recalls sean "i wanted to see a game " in july of flights to the busiest u s airports were on time compared with the previous july according to flightstats com excessively late flights defined as those delayed minutes or more were up over the previous july the air transport association says the squeeze might not let up any time soon labor day weekend travel for example is estimated to be up over last year adding to the complexity this weekend marks the annual ritual of major league teams expanding their roster to players for the seasons waning weeks and the playoffs meaning dozens of minor league players will be in transit to their major league parent clubs going into their own playoffs minor league managers are scrambling to minimize the impact of future delays george king vice president of business and baseball operations for the pacific coast league which spans three time zones from sacramento to nashville says he now insists all teams follow the leagues "first flight" rule the rule created after the sept attacks requires teams to take the earliest flights possible in the morning because they are the least likely to be delayed john traub general manager of the albuquerque isotopes says he is still haunted by a game in april the topes a five year old team affiliated with the florida marlins were up against the iowa cubs in the sixth inning mr traub got word that the teams flight to omaha the following morning had been cancelled the next available flight was two days away which would mean missing two games including the season opener against the omaha royals mr traub huddled with the teams two coaches near the foul line to discuss the options he says spending &# to charter a plane wasnt in the budget the only other possibility he says was to grab seats on a commercial flight that would leave albuquerque that night at p m about three hours after the sixth inning so in the middle of the sixth he walked out to home plate and made the announcement that the game would end suddenly the team needed to rush home to gather their bags and then run to the airport to catch that flight "i was booed mercilessly " recalls mr traub he now refers to that day as "black thursday "
