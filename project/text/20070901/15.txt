cross country this side of paradise kauai hawaii the island of kauai has long been a magnet for visitors from the mainland as well as the main island with white sand beaches and turquoise blue water the island on the northern edge of the hawaiian chain looks like a picture perfect hollywood set but there is trouble brewing on this island paradise last month the states supreme court declared that voters do not have the power to amend kauais county charter to bring soaring property taxes down to a manageable level that power is to be reserved for the countys mayor and governing council the ruling serves as a warning for anyone fresh from the beach who is tempted to buy that vacation home or retire to that ocean front property in kauai owning a slice of heaven can be a tax hell the nightmare for kauais homeowners began innocently enough in the late s as the island was beginning to enjoy the fruits of the nationwide housing boom and the local economy finally recovered from iniki a devastating category hurricane that struck on sept iniki inflicted some &# billion in damages and it left many residents without municipal water or electricity for weeks some went without these government services for months by with little help from the outside world residents had rebuilt their island and the local real estate market had begun to turn around with the reconstruction new residents began moving in and hollywood took notice recognizing kauais raw beauty producers shot movies here and celebrities bought homes on the islands world class beaches and emerald valleys by the close of the s kauai was becoming a major hot spot and local real estate was in high demand not surprisingly kauais real estate prices skyrocketed outstripping even the most competitive mainland markets today the subprime crisis notwithstanding the average price of a home on kauai is &# thats up sharply from &# in with this meteoric rise came a similar rise in property taxes homeowners here as elsewhere pay a percentage of their homes value in annual property taxes many residents have seen their property taxes double or even triple since arnold nurock a local pediatrician who worked for decades in the islands public health clinics is one of them in he paid &# three years later the bill grew to a staggering &# so he decided like many of his neighbors to do something about it kauai county derives two thirds of its income from property taxes by with only a modest increase in population the county collected some &# million in property taxes up from &# million in mr nurock and other residents formed an advocacy group called ohana kauai ohana is hawaiian for "family" and began pushing tax reform its not been easy in they collected signatures and put on the ballot an amendment to the countys charter that would do two things first it would roll property taxes back to what residents paid in second it would limit future property tax increases to a year the mayor of kauai republican bryan baptiste and democratic council members immediately opposed the amendment and campaigned against it they lost two out of every three voters on the island voted for the amendment kauai officials responded by trying to kill the amendment spending &# in tax dollars to hire a lawyer from the main island and suing to have the election overturned and here they won starting in when state judge george masuoko ruled in county of kauai ex rel nakazawa v baptiste that the amendment was actually a ballot initiative that repealed a tax something not permitted by the county charter the pacific legal foundations robert thomas stepped in arguing the case before the hawaii supreme court on feb on behalf of four property owners honolulu attorney gary slovin for the county countered that allowing people to vote on taxes would create "chaos " a few members of the county council publicly agreed the hawaii government employees association fearing government jobs held by union members might be cut issued a statement to say that giving residents power over taxes was an "absurd proposition " last month despite mr thomass valiant efforts hawaiis state supreme court ruled against kauai taxpayers to support his page majority decision chief justice ronald moon argued that property taxpayers have no right to determine how much they are taxed in dissent justices simeon acoba and james duffy said mr moons "manipulation" created an "unwise and dangerous precedent " mr acoba wrote "with all due respect our role is to protect the judicial process not to subvert it " theres little doubt here that the supreme courts decision is a blow to citizens who want to hold our states elected officials accountable but with a major victory at the ballot box blocked by the courts the only recourse is a constitutional convention hawaii is the only state that reviews its state constitution periodically and in next years general election hawaiian voters must decide whether to hold a convention within the next decade but things dont bode well for this option either hawaiis last constitutional convention was held in a landmark event which laid the groundwork for todays modern hawaiian state there was almost another in when voters approved holding a convention only to be over ruled by you guessed it the state supreme court it decided that ballots left "blank" on the question of a constitutional convention should be counted as "no " is it any wonder then that hawaii has the dubious distinction of having the nations highest overall tax burden the national small business survival index has rated hawaii the "worst" place to operate a business some here joke that state officials no longer agree with the founding fathers when it comes to "taxation without representation " still many understand that even in paradise power to the people not the government is worth the fight ms zimmerman is president of hawaii reporter see related letter "letters to the editor its simple vote them out" wsj sept
