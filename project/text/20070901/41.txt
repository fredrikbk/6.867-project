over the internet into my moms heart unlocking a parents passion and the community that sustained her finding mr bellavia new york on sept in a chaotic intensive care ward just before being medically induced into a coma my mother summoned all of her energy and whatever oxygen she could to make one request "take care of my ebay " for over a year my mom suzanne rosin had been buying venetian steuben and depression art glass and tableware at auction online she paid her bills on time and was rewarded with glowing buyer ratings on her ebay home page from various glass dealers "great buyer smooth transaction a++++++" said one "suzyrosin is the best of the best " raved another in the days leading up to the sept operation meant to remove a malignant tumor from her lung her second such surgery in six months she had not slowed her ebay bidding and as her lungs filled with fluid due to post operative pneumonia her mind filled with thoughts of the auctions she might win while lying unconscious the bills that would go unpaid and the ensuing negative feedback from sellers that would tarnish her superstar status in the past four years i have replayed that moment again and again the beeping machines the manic bustle of nurses doctors spouting terms like "lung failure " and ultimately my mom toiling to draw a breath so that she could ask that my sister lizzie and i safeguard her ebay reputation how could that have been her foremost concern at some point we all have to confront and deal with the detritus of an ended life the difficulty in doing so is greater than the sum of the stuff after a death every tchotchke can take on heartbreaking meaning and in todays world there are often a lot of virtual threads from email accounts to blogs to unwind my mom was the linchpin of our family her life had been built around "her girls" as she called me and lizzie later the focus shifted to her and my stepfather bobs grandchildren she was a pilates instructor who treated her work as a calling giving free instruction to teenagers with scoliosis overweight people who couldnt afford regular lessons or anyone else whose "energy" she liked she took better care of herself than anyone ive ever known she loved all physical activity she was a beautiful woman and she knew it when she was diagnosed with lung cancer in february mom showed an instant and often myopic determination to survive she did not want to die and she made it clear to her doctors that no regimen should be considered too aggressive she set out on a course of treatment that ultimately spanned three surgeries at least five rounds of chemotherapy and radiation and a two month coma from which we were told she would not awake she did dispersed on opposite coasts my sister and i traveled constantly to our mothers house in tucson ariz we barely kept our marriages intact moms illness became our life mom radiated fear throughout her illness yet she cut off any discussion that did not assume a complete and total recovery once when my sister brought to my moms bedside an old photo album my mom told her she didnt want to look through it and then mom slid her mac onto her lap and logged on to ebay it was obvious to me lizzie and bob that she was retreating into her computer a lot she died on june she was my sister and i have sifted through our moms clothes jewelry and purses but we hadnt touched her glass or any of her glass collecting tools my stepfather still lives in the tucson house where it is all displayed and we are loath to disrupt his home we also feel that if we were to move her cobalt blue candlesticks from where she placed them we would be accepting the finality of her absence and we consider the idea of discontinuing her email and ebay accounts unthinkable we are treating moms glass as her sacred legacy in anticipating the second anniversary of her death it occurred to me that i really knew nothing about these heirlooms so i decided to educate myself my sister and my stepfather who married my mother when i was two encouraged my quest armed with her saved email correspondence and ebay account i jumped into the world my mom created for herself as she journeyed toward the end in the process of spending &# my mother amassed a vintage collection including steuben verre de soie "glass of silk" dessert plates acid etched wine and port goblets and delicate vases made by venetian artisans she also joined a vibrant and competitive community of dealers collectors and even perhaps a few hucksters she haggled for better prices unjustly picked a nasty fight and forged a close friendship with the unlikeliest of strangers she was dying but with her imac and wireless internet connection she found life from the onset of my investigation i knew there would be a few keys to opening this world the most important my moms email and ebay password no sweat out of necessity my sister and i both had memorized it long ago an unrepentant e addict mom called us frequently while waiting for doctors appointments or in the middle of treatment to ask for a report on any recent activity on her email and ebay accounts the password i had typed again and again "satanama " which i learned from google is a yoga meditation chant the other essential guide a man named carl bellavia he is an avid collector of venetian glass whom my mom had met online she spoke of him frequently as a sort of glass world guru "carl told me this was a very important piece " she would say while liberating a recently purchased bauble from layers of bubble wrap she invoked him enough to make me include him in blast emails i sent to update her friends about her health and i had a vague recollection of contacting him with the news of her death i searched my personal email account found his address and sent him a note "dear carl " i wrote "im hoping youll remember me or at least remember my mom suzy " "of course i remember you " he replied "and think of your mother often " the next day i called him initially the conversation was awkward he and my mom knew each other only for a few years and only in the context of collecting glass my unease quickly turned to shock when i realized that in her own way my mom had confided in this man "she bought a lot of things that she wanted to leave for you guys " he said of me and lizzie we first met several days later at a restaurant in greenwich village again i felt pulled between familiarity and strangeness i wasnt sure if i should hug him or shake his hand we shook hands in many ways mr bellavia seemed the opposite of my mom he is a large man with a wild mess of gray curls and a shaggy beard he chain smokes dunhill cigarettes when we met at a restaurant at about p m he settled in over a huge bowl of pasta born in mr bellavia was raised in corona n y near the grounds of the worlds fair his father gave him a camera when he was years old since then mr bellavia has lived as he puts it "on the fringe of the arts " he maintains a successful freelance career as a commercial photographer and location scout for print and television advertisements and films like s "king kong " when his aging parents were ill he moved back to his childhood home for one year to care for them after they died he began collecting glass in earnest his large bright apartment is littered with stacks of design magazines venetian glass and other art objects in the den off his bedroom he spends hours on his computer combing through venetian glass listings on ebay while smoking one cigarette after another it was sitting in this room that mr bellavia met my mom she perched on her couch in tucson it was early and they were bidding on the same item a straw colored venetian compote mr bellavia won the auction my mom the next highest bidder wrote him an email telling him that if he changed his mind about the compote she would buy it from him within a few weeks they were frequently discussing venetian items being auctioned on ebay "we probably were in touch six days a week " he says mom told mr bellavia about her illness soon after being diagnosed he says in their discussions of wine stems she would drop mention of a new course of chemotherapy she was about to start or a doctors report she had just received "your mom was angry " mr bellavia told me "she was surprised she was devastated she had been dealt a very bad hand at the same time she was adamant about beating it " buying vintage glass fragile but resilient was her escape from a life that quickly became defined by disease the glass "gave her focus " mr bellavia told me "it was a release something she could do something that she had power over she said that to me she said that it gave her a sense of being normal " i asked him if he felt uncomfortable by my moms confiding in him was it surreal that some woman across the country whom he had never met was telling him about the emotional isolation brought by cancer was he burdened by her needs "i went to church and lit candles for her " he said then he grabbed my hand and sobbed for hours over the course of days i burrowed into my moms web based msn email account snooping through her files i was happy to see she had saved various emails of love encouragement and jokes from lizzie and me luckily she had saved electronic paypal receipts of the money she had sent to sellers one of the earliest saved records was dated oct just as a persistent cough was causing my moms doctor to order an increasingly invasive set of tests the last purchase a &# murano venini dresser mirror tray is from march less than three months before she died i began noticing clusters of buying that i considered noteworthy for example in the month before her first surgery there was a notable up tick in activity in days she spent more than &# to win auctions pieces including items described as a s barovier &amp toso clam bowl and a topaz steuben compote later after she emerged from the coma to learn that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes she began to routinely spend larger chunks of money than she had previously in the first purchase she made after learning about the metastasis she spent &# on a set of buzzi glassware then there was the &# decanter and the &# platter of all the receipts only one showed any indication of my moms intentions for an individual purchase it was a vase described on the receipt as "mezza filigrana venini murano scarpa vase " she paid &# for it it was bought on feb the very day she was officially diagnosed with cancer in the subject line of the document she had typed "katies vase " i had stashed this vase on the very top shelf of a kitchen cabinet since it arrived in the mail four and a half years ago i had no clue that on the very day her life started to end my mom bought me a light green bud vase in october as the cancer coursed through the bones of her hips and sacrum my mother expanded her hobby into a different realm of ebay the live auction it proved to be a mistake the mechanics of a live auction offered on ebay are slightly different than those of the average auction my mom forayed onto an auction site manned by a company in indianapolis ind and bought two murano vases for nearly &# inadvertently she also bought a large black wooden desk my sister and i remember well when my mom received an email alerting her that she had "won" this table mom instantly told us that she was being billed for an item that she had not bid upon obviously the dealer was in error she told us angrily she then reported to us that she had made this contention to the company itself but the company insisted that she had in fact submitted the winning bid my mom was terribly upset after days of cursing the dealer she began to acknowledge that maybe the oxycodone she was taking to help dull the pain from the bone tumors had compromised her bidding precision she indicated to me that the table had been very expensive about &# she was worried my stepfather would be angry with her for spending so much money we suggested that she alert the antique dealer if not ebays administration that medication taken to ease the pain of cancer had resulted in an accidentally placed bid mom adamantly rebuffed that idea she insisted that ebay rules stipulated that such a disclosure would result in her privileges being rescinded she was beside herself about this for weeks mom never told me how she resolved the table incident i located jeb banner a year old web developer in indianapolis who had been a co owner of antique helper the auction house from which my mom bought the table mr banner remembered the incident my moms winning bid was &# far less than the &# she had mentioned to me mr banner said he sold the table on consignment and my mom made up the difference between what she had promised to pay and what a new buyer offered in the end her errant bid ended up costing less than &# yet to my mom the toll was incalculable the cancer had spread to her ebay world i told mr banner about my moms glass collection her attachment to ebay her illness the bone tumors the oxycodone he was shocked "if she had told me about the cancer i would have let her off the hook immediately " he says i also contacted ebay a spokeswoman said the company has policies to help deal with disagreements between buyers and sellers "we would not have revoked your moms privileges " she says my moms buying significantly tapered off after the table ordeal according to the archived receipts she only bought three items in the seven months between this incident and her death after marking the second anniversary of her death this past june i flew to tucson i left my husband and son at home i asked my stepfather to allow me a day alone with moms glass and i looked at the collection as i hadnt before i spent the entire day examining each piece from every angle admiring its design and feeling its fragility when i was curious to learn a bit about a slew of wine glasses that are a part of my moms collection i contacting a glass collectors association a member suggested i contact rosemary trietsch a dealer who writes a glass identification column for antiqueweek then i found receipts showing that my mom had bought water goblets from her mrs trietsch remembered my mom by the pieces she bought mom was solely interested in pieces she could match with other pieces she might only wanted eight acid etched red wine glasses made in mid century if they would look elegant on a table next to the port glasses made in the same era that she had bought after seeing lizzies husband order port after dinner one night "she was putting sets together " says mrs trietsch "she wanted to make sure she had enough to entertain " i suppose her motivation was to leave lizzie and me a gift to use and enjoy while spending time with friends and family looking through the armoire in her bedroom stacked with steuben glassware i could visualize what my mom might have been imagining lizzie and i are serving our eight dinner guests an amuse bouche in translucent iridescent sherbet glasses designed by frederick carder for steuben in the s as i flew back to new york the next morning i felt almost giddy for the first time i was able to look at the glass as a representation of how my mom wanted me to live not merely as a reminder of her death when i got home i climbed onto a stepladder and fished a vase out of the cabinet it was the little green vase my mom had found beauty in on the day she was told she had a fatal disease i wiped it clean of dust i poured in some water i put in five pink roses and set it in the family room
