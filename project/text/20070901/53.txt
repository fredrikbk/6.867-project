pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings jammin with toscaninis hep cats in praise of jazzed up classics its early yet but i expect my nominee for most charming record of will be "the new friends of rhythm performances " who they the new friends of rhythm was an instrumental septet led by alan shulman a cellist and composer who was a charter member of arturo toscaninis nbc symphony it consisted of a harpist a string quartet and a jazz rhythm section and it played very hip arrangements of well known pieces of classical music to which shulman affixed such zany titles as "bach bay blues" and "shoot the schubert to me hubert " the groups records were so successful that in the new friends of rhythm got written up in time which revealed that its members were known at nbc as "toscaninis hep cats " in those days of course the classics got jazzed on a regular basis some of the most popular songs of the s and s including "the lamp is low" and "my reverie " were based on such classical compositions as ravels "pavane for a dead princess" and debussys "reverie " the practice became so common that ayn rand whose virtues are not known to have included a sense of humor took a shot at it in "atlas shrugged " where she grumpily described an imaginary pop record based on a piano concerto by a fictional composer named richard halley "it was as if a handful of mud and pebbles had been flung at the music and what followed was the sound of the rolling and the dripping it was halleys melody torn apart its holes stuffed with hiccoughs the great statement of joy had become the giggling of a barroom " the real life record rand undoubtedly had in mind was freddy martins "concerto in b flat " based on the first movement of the tchaikovsky b flat minor piano concerto which was one of the biggest sellers of it is if truth be told pretty sappy but when bona fide jazz musicians reworked the classics the results could be delightful art tatums dapper stride piano version of dvoraks "humoresque" which you can see him playing on youtube is as elegant as a tightly rolled umbrella while the king cole trios recording of rachmaninoffs prelude in c sharp minor is one of the most ingenious jazz arrangements of a classic ever to be committed to disc what inspired these artists to swing the classics i once speculated that it reflected the desire of class conscious musicians to prove their "legitimacy" at a time when jazz was not yet regarded as art music i still think theres something to that notion especially in the case of such oh so polite records as the john kirby sextets "minute waltz " now though im more inclined to believe that most of these performances were simply admiring tributes from one great musician to another whatever the reason the practice continued well into the s and in certain quarters it goes on to this day the centerpiece of miles daviss "sketches of spain " for instance is a resplendent version by gil evans of the slow movement from joaquin rodrigos "concierto de aranjuez" that is arguably superior to the original "bill evans trio with symphony orchestra " recorded in contains exquisitely wrought arrangements by claus ogerman of works by bach chopin faure granados and scriabin more recently the jazz singer kate mcgarry included a haunting bossa nova version of "the lamp is low" on her latest cd "the target " time was when rockers were also known to dip into the classics emerson lake &amp palmer turned bela bartoks "allegro barbaro" into an explosive instrumental called "the barbarian " while several pop songs of the s and s were similarly derived often on the sly from classical sources remember "never gonna fall in love again" its the slow movement of rachmaninoffs second symphony but such tributes have grown less common in recent years and the reason why is all too clear americas popular culture has withdrawn its attention from classical music just as our animators no longer make cartoons like "whats opera doc " or "the cat concerto " so are our pop stars indifferent to if not unaware of the great music that was being played long before they came on the scene might the decline and fall of jazzed up classics be yet another early warning signal of trouble ahead for our beleaguered symphony orchestras i wouldnt be surprised anyone who cares about the fate of classical music in america must remember that it cannot survive without the support of a democratic public that appreciates its beauty and believes in its significance in the days of middlebrow culture there were any number of ways for ordinary folks to dip a toe into the classical stream including the witty recordings of such groups as the new friends of rhythm now they belong to the ages and so much the worse for us mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
