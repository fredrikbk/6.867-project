texas cat fight bird lover on trial for feline felony i had to choose who dies mr stevenson says the toll taker gives chase galveston texas before he pulled the trigger before the car chase before the cops ran him down and threw him in jail jim stevenson had a calm look at the texas penal code and judged that it would permit radical measures in defense of a piping plover this month a jury may decide if the year old founder of the galveston ornithological society was acting within his rights when he impeded the progress of a bird stalking predator by means of a bullet mr stevenson is due to stand trial for felony cat murder "there are people with the wrong perception of this " he said in his chevy compact on a stormy morning driving along a wide beach at galveston islands western tip where curlews egrets stilts and herons strut in the tide pools he stopped at the pilings beneath the san luis pass bridge the scene of the crime "they see it as a choice " said mr stevenson "does jim shoot the cat or not shoot the cat " a kitten poked its head out from behind a boulder bigger cats streaked away "but thats not the choice " he said "its a choice of who dies the cat or the bird by acting or not acting i had to choose who dies " so mr stevenson made his choice and let fly his bird watchers fury at the national plague of feral cats the american bird conservancy numbers kitties gone wild at close to million and claims they kill hundreds of millions of birds it wants more wild cats euthanized and all house cats kept in the house a cat activist movement led by a group called alley cat allies traps and fixes feral cats and lets them loose again it claims cats dont threaten birds any more than other hazards like tall buildings and windmills and that sterilized colonies fade away its against euthanizing on principle but birders say fixed cats kill birds too and newly abandoned cats make new kittens anyway for mr stevenson who has followed the argument for years it finally came down to this are feral cats pets or pests "its not like i didnt think about that all night " he says the night was last nov tiring of the election returns mr stevenson drove to the beach minutes from his house his headlights picked up a pod of piping plovers an endangered shore bird they were asleep and a lame cat was creeping up on them mr stevenson flushed the birds the cat skittered into the dunes he drove home and went online galvestons city code required pets to have tags it banned them from the beaches that cat had no tags and it was on the beach texas penal law made it a crime to kill animals but only those "belonging to another " mr stevenson slept on it next morning he picked up his caliber rifle got into his ornithological society van and went cat hunting not for the first time a bird watchers bird watcher mr stevenson has species on his life list he moved here from florida in to lead bird tours put out a bird newspaper and write bird books he built a house in a copse where birds find food and so do bird eating cats on his own property and therefore within the law he has picked off at least a dozen "point blank right in the ear " mr stevenson says on that morning as he tells it it only took a minute for him to spot the limping cat under the bridge he rolled down his van window part way rested the rifle barrel on the edge of the glass and squeezed off a shot "that cat dropped like a rock " says mr stevenson who then heard a "spewing of profane language" from up on the bridge it was the toll taker john newland mr newland who is and a former real estate broker picks up the story "i ran out and hollered " he says and while another toll taker called the cops "that idiot took off i said im gonna get him so i jumped into my truck and ran him down all the way to jamaica beach " which is where mr stevenson was met by four police cars mr newland is now the prosecutions star witness the grand jury indictment handed up in april identifies him as the "owner of said cat " mr stevensons victim under texas law killing somebody elses animal without permission no matter how can buy two years in the pen but the states case depends on proving that the cats under the san luis pass bridge are mr newlands pets he is down there with them most days after his toll booth shift ends sprinkling food from sacks into plastic trays "nobody else takes care of them " he said one afternoon at feeding time "ive got to think of them as my cats " mr newland has buried the cat at issue beside a pillar and marked the grave with paper flowers "heres maggie " he said as a black cat approached he bent to pick her up maggie snarled and scratched at his face "shes not real tame " said mr newland brushing away the blood on his cheek some cats under the bridge are cuddlier because they are house cats that people dumped but most are born on the spot and most die young mr newland doesnt get any of them vaccinated or licensed he hasnt heard of the feral cat plague or programs to stem it the only cats he gets neutered or spayed are the few he can catch "theyre leery of those traps " he said eyeing a stripy tom on the prowl "thats the daddy hes the one id like to fix but i cant corner him worse than bin laden " he emptied a can of cat food into a bowl and called out for his kitties "theyll probably kill a bird " said mr newland "thats just a cats instinct but all im doing " he added "is feeding some homeless orphans " galvestons assistant district attorney paige santell is positive a jury will agree that mr stevenson killed mr newlands cat "i understand ownership as being care custody and control " she says mr stevensons lawyer tad nelson points out that people who feed pigeons in the park cant claim to own them to which ms santell replies "they dont always feed the same pigeons " the larger issue mr nelson says is how "a person like jim stevenson who has based his life on the preservation of birds" can be accused of cruelty at all mr newland has an answer "i dont shoot owls and hawks that kill my kittens it doesnt work that way hes got no right to go out and just shoot any creature " yet when the legislature passed the cruelty law in it was only after somebody gouged out a puppys eyeballs in toughening the law this year members said they were mainly thinking of the sort of person who might run over a cat with a lawnmower "in the minds of texans " says shannon edmonds a lobbyist for state prosecutors who helped draft the statute "if you shoot something thats not being cruel " in his chevy tallying birds on the beach at san luis pass mr stevenson had his own definition of cruelty to animals "turning a house pet loose in the wild " as for mr newland he said "i dont fault him for feeding cats he sees as hungry all i fault him for is trying to run me off the road in his pickup truck " just then mr stevenson spotted a reddish egret wading in a tide pool he lowered his window rested his camera lens on the edge of the glass and squeezed off a shot
