on the road more than people were killed and million injured in traffic accidents last year the economic cost of these crashes was approximately &# billion a substantial number of the crashes involved drivers and vehicles that shouldnt have been on the road many solutions to the carnage have been offered over many years one obvious solution has been avoided assign responsibility for vehicle safety inspections and licensing drivers to the one institution with the most to gain from keeping bad drivers and unsafe cars off the road the insurance industry if we truly believe that only capable responsible drivers and safe cars should be on the road then its time to try a new approach employees at the state any state motor vehicle division good people all will give virtually anyone with two forms of identification a drivers license so long as they are not seriously vision impaired and are able to pass a multiple choice exam and minimum proficiency driving test their responsibility ends there they have no stake in what happens after those drivers hit the road auto insurers on the other hand care only about what happens when those drivers get behind the wheel if auto insurers had the job of licensing drivers and registering vehicles a role incidentally that insurers have in the maritime industry they would be forced to adopt what i refer to as the "disneyland" model in disneyland customers are covered by the companys liability insurance consequently to reduce risk the management restricts who may use which facilities and under what circumstances for instance in order to ride the california screamin roller coaster you must be at least four feet tall and should not be pregnant have high blood pressure or suffer from heart back or neck problems since the business is held strictly liable for any injuries suffered by those entering the park management makes every effort to enforce the parks safety rules private licensing and registration would work the same way because they would be insuring the drivers and cars they license insurance companies would be vigorous in their testing and car safety requirements letting only qualified individuals venture out onto the roadways they would be more likely to ferret out those unqualified to drive from those whose driving abilities have become compromised with age or habitual substance abuse to those who have been ticketed on more than one occasion for reckless or aggressive driving such high risk individuals are now cut far too much slack in most states insurers also would be more likely to develop methods to allow such drivers back on the road when specific criteria are met for instance insurers might re license and insure reformed dwi abusers if they use only vehicles equipped with devices that disable the ignition when alcohol is detected in the driving cabin the "disneyland" model would also reduce the number of uninsured and underinsured driving on the roads by reducing the ambiguity concerning who will be responsible for damages today an estimated of all motorists operate uninsured vehicles an even larger number of vehicles are grossly underinsured most of the states requiring auto liability insurance alabama mississippi new hampshire tennessee virginia and wisconsin do not allow absurdly low minimum coverage in arizona where i live the minimum is &# &# &# this means an insurer will cover bodily injury damages only up to &# for a single victim &# for multiple victims and &# for vehicle property damage considering that of crashes involve multiple vehicles and that a single fatality costs an estimated &# million or more this is woefully inadequate under the current system private insurance companies have little incentive to stop people from buying inadequate levels of insurance since damages caused by underinsured drivers are capped and damages caused by uninsured drivers are borne by either the uninsured driver or the victim under a private licensing registration and insurance system insurers would make sure that all vehicles have adequate insurance coverage highway crashes remain the leading cause of death for the age group four through ranking above everything else from cancer and hiv to poisoning drowning and suicide we can and should do better right now we rely on government employees and contractors"devotion to duty" as the main motivation for licensing only qualified drivers registering only safe and properly functioning cars and enforcing mandatory auto insurance laws they are no doubt devoted to duty but the result is a system in which the primary incentive is to follow procedure and rules not reduce unnecessary risk the markets "pursuit of profit" would introduce a different and better set of incentives why not give it a try mr semmens is a research fellow at the independent institute and a research project manager in the arizona department of transportation see related letter "letters to the editor louisiana lassitude" wsj sept
