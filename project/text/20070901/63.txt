remembrances arthur jones nautilus inventor pumped up fitness but lost women planes crocodiles paunchy and chain smoking pall malls arthur jones was an unlikely model for physical fitness yet his nautilus exercise machines introduced in became the byword for bodybuilding at a time when fitness was becoming fashionable by the mid s mr jones was wealthy enough to be on the forbes list of ultrarich americans he had a menagerie of rattlesnakes crocodiles and elephants on his florida game preserve a fleet of s parked at what he claimed was the worlds largest private airport and a brand new wife his fifth by the end of the s his empire was gone mr jones sold nautilus abruptly in to a dallas businessman who took it into bankruptcy before the decade was out the herd of elephants and fleet of planes had been sold to raise funds for his next venture a lumbar rehabilitation machine wife no decamped amid bitter allegations the tycoon whose oft stated personal motto had been "younger women faster planes bigger crocodiles" was bereft of all three mr jones who died aug at his ocala fla home at age was a child of the depression and a high school dropout who began his quest for what he once called "a thinking persons barbell" at a tulsa okla ymca gym in in ensuing decades he pursued careers as a rattlesnake wrangler crocodile trapper tropical fish importer and bush airline entrepreneur in africa and south america selling animals to zoos and pet shops he also produced "wild cargo " a series of tv nature documentaries wherever he went he continued to tinker with ideas for better exercise machines in the late s after he was expelled from rhodesia in murky circumstances he began writing articles for the fitness magazine "iron man " a california entrepreneur commissioned mr jones to build a machine featuring mr joness newest gizmo a cam a wheel on a shaft with segments like the shell of a nautilus to let users progressively vary the amount of weight hefted the machine was a hit at a los angeles weightlifters convention and got an even bigger boost after the aau mr america casey viator revealed he had trained under mr jones on one "he showed me how we could do it with much less exercise " says mr viator of the intense jones technique mr viator who worked for mr jones developing nautilus for much of the s and is now a personal trainer credits him with transforming weightlifting "arthur showed it didnt have to be a greasy little gym on the corner with hooligans inside " mr viator says "arthur made it happen that the average man wouldnt feel uncomfortable the equipment builders are still copying him today " top flight athletes including running back mercury morris of the miami dolphins and tennis pro chris evert said their careers benefited from working out on a nautilus celebrities including victoria principal and bo derek endorsed it too clubs with nautilus in their name and featuring the companys equipment but which were otherwise independent began popping up across the country at the center of the juggernaut stood arthur jones "contradictory bombastic and tinged with menace" as an article in the wall street journal once described him he would brief physicians insisting his machines were based on millions of dollars worth of scientific research he had funded yet he delighted in giving interviews in which he darkly alluded to men he had killed the buzz on privately held nautilus was tremendous its annual revenues in the mid s were said by time magazine to exceed &# million but the reality was less than a quarter of that the wall street journal reported in revenues began declining after as competitors like the cybex eagle emerged mr jones seemed less interested in propping things up than in using his

joness last decade was morose "he became very discouraged and said to hell with this " says mr johnston "he was bitter in his last decade just waiting to die is what he said to everybody " nautilus inc now reorganized as owner of stairmaster and bowflex equipment says it is once again the largest seller of gym machines this year it is introducing a new line but says a spokesman "arthurs cams can still be found inside maximizing muscle activation " paul maccready innovated the impossible from bicycle plane to solar car "the revenge of icarus " a paris newspaper headlined in the day after paul maccreadys gossamer albatross flew across the english channel powered by a furiously pedaling bicyclist the mile cross channel effort was a bookend to the flight of the gossamer condor two years before which established that human powered flight was possible on a one mile course the gossamer flights were perhaps the apotheosis of mr maccreadys career as an imaginative engineer few of his inventions were ever commercialized but he was an influential designer with a cadre of impressive inventions among them the gm sunraycer a solar car that crossed australia averaging miles per hour the gossamer penguin the first piloted plane to fly solely by solar power and the pathfinder and helios solar powered planes that flew as high as feet he also invented the "speed ring airspeed selector " standard equipment on sailplanes everywhere "although the airplanes themselves are trivial we have learned much that has application to smaller cheaper forms of transportation on the ground anything that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and other nonreplenishable resources seems worthwhile " mr maccready told u s news &amp world report in the cross channel flight wasnt the first time mr maccready made waves crossing a strait aged he shocked his parents by piloting his sailing dingy from their connecticut home across long island sound by his early teens he was building model aircraft not from kits but exotic contraptions like ornithopers with flapping wings a la icarus and autogyros plane plus helicopter shy and ungainly in high school he excelled as an aviation engineer shortly after world war ii he attended navy flight school and yale during the war mr maccready bought a war surplus glider he soon began setting height records and winning a series of national soaring championships he married in and that year also gave up sailplanes after a close call his most famous achievement was born of necessity when a new design he came up with for catamarans lost &# he was determined to recoup his investors losses so he decided to vie for the henry kremer prize established by a british industrialist in for sustained human powered flight "the kremer prize in which id had no interest was just about equal to my debt " he told the authors of "inventing modern america" in "suddenly human powered flight seemed important " his first entry into the field the gossamer condor consisted of aluminum tubing cardboard balsa plastic and mylar at feet tall with a foot wingspan it was really big its pilot once compared it to "pedaling a house " typical for a maccready project it was inspired by a daydream epiphany this one made while observing the wing shapes of turkey vultures while on a family vacation in the desert the testing process was typically low tech repeatedly crashing the craft and rebuilding it the gossamer albatross followed and then even more ambitious craft spending time among the updrafts and clouds helped make mr maccready an expert meteorologist as well his company aerovironment inc had been founded in to monitor air pollution aerovironment which went public in january of this year also later got into the business of manufacturing tiny drones equipped with video cameras for the department of defense grave and understated mr maccready cherished creative thinking and became expert at gathering teams of world class specialists "we had to have complete redundancy " with all staff qualified as engineers pilots builders and athletes says morton grosser a member of the team that built the gossamer albatross in england and author of "gossamer odyssey " the gossamer condors staff held a reunion in shafter calif last weekend mr maccready who died tuesday at age at his home in pasadena calif was too weak to attend but sent a message of congratulation in recent years he stepped back from design work and often addressed groups of schoolchildren on the wonders of science and the work of imagination email remembrances wsj com
