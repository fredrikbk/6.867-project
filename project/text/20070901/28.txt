fed stands ready if turmoil persists the federal reserve wont bail investors out of their bad decisions but will act if recent market turmoil threatens economic growth chairman ben bernanke said friday mr bernankes much anticipated speech solidified investor expectations the fed will cut its target for the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks from when policy makers meet sept markets see some probability the rate will drop to but several economists said a drop to is more likely accompanied by a statement suggesting more cuts could come those expectations helped boost stocks the speech was mr bernankes first since credit market turmoil erupted shortly after the feds latest policy meeting on aug he sought to delineate the feds separate responsibilities for keeping the financial system operating smoothly and maintaining economic growth at the same time he made clear that financial instability also affects growth and thus the feds interest rate deliberations "it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions " mr bernanke told the audience of academics central bankers and wall street economists from around the world gathered at the kansas city feds annual symposium in jackson hole wyo "but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy " the market turmoil began last month when long festering concerns about rising delinquencies on subprime mortgages suddenly spread to other markets including for securities backed by so called jumbo mortgages for commercial paper and even short term dollar loans between non u s banks the turmoil has triggered conflicting demands some on wall street want mr bernanke to cut rates to restore confidence while others want him to hold firm to teach investors not to expect a bailout for reckless behavior in the future on aug the fed cut its little used discount rate to from which is charged on direct fed loans to banks and eased the terms on such loans the purpose "was to assure depositories of the ready availability of a backstop source of liquidity " mr bernanke said friday adding the fed is ready to "take additional actions" to "promote the orderly functioning of markets " those steps represent the feds fulfilling its longstanding role as lender of last resort mr bernanke has tried to separate that function from the feds other duty of maintaining economic growth in part to counter perceptions perhaps unmerited that the central bank in the past has been quick to cut rates and cushion investors but mr bernanke and his colleagues also know that unstable markets can at a point threaten growth requiring a broader response with lower interest rates the fed made that point aug saying risks to growth had "increased appreciably " and it would "act as needed to mitigate" the effects of market turmoil on the economy elaborating friday mr bernanke said financial markets reflect not just a concern about the eventual economic impact of a weaker housing market but also a rise in uncertainty and risk aversion generally risk premiums the additional return lenders and investors require for dicey investments had been "exceptionally low" so some increase "is probably healthy " but he said heightened risk aversion when mixed with "heightened concerns about credit risks and uncertainty about how to evaluate those risks " created "significant market stress " while not explicitly signaling the feds plans the speech did make clear according to some economists that mr bernanke is intimately aware of what has gone on in markets and the implications that alone some say can help confidence "there was a time when a lot of wall streeters were referring to bernanke as an academic who had no clue what was going on out in the real world " said stephen stanley of rbs greenwich capital markets "he has done his best to disabuse market participants of that impression over the last few weeks without giving in to their pleas for immediate help "
