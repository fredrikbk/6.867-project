act one readers ponder san francisco and retirement planning online edition my recent column about college graduates struggling in san francisco drew a range of keen responses several readers pointed out that there is still demand in the city for young hires with specific and sophisticated job skills in the tech industry these readers and others questioned the liberal arts curricula that so many students earnestly pursue only to face bleak job prospects after graduating plenty of readers blamed san franciscos government for the citys spotty job market "sf is about as listless as a european city " wrote one former resident here is a selection of responses as well as a look at emails i received on spend now save later and what to do with &# emails have been edited for length and clarity chris lien of san francisco writes as the ceo of a tech start up in downtown san francisco with many friends who also are ceos at their own start ups we are all hiring as fast as we can there is a massive labor shortage and a lot of high quality jobs in san francisco if you are an average liberal arts major with no skills and no demonstrated excellence in anything i can understand it being hard to break into the job market you should send a message to young people that they have to be driven and have skills hope is not a strategy ed abbott of miami writes as a plus entrepreneur who lived in san francisco from i well remember all the young people in the marina during the s but things have changed san franciscos antibusiness attitudes have kept businesses from headquartering or moving there the result fewer jobs for people who are not entrepreneurs and merely want to have a good productive job that pays well san francisco will continue to be a city of trust fund babies and entrepreneurs while being inhospitable to business operations of all types but alas that is what the people who live there want a rich disconnected city surrounded by a moat and they profess to feel for the less fortunate hypocrisy thy name is san francisco cissy jones of redwood city calif writes i moved here five years ago with two undergraduate degrees and got my first job waiting tables at a high class sushi joint in palo alto within six months i had met some ceos and venture capital partners and went on to work for sequoia capital now im at one of their portfolio companies its not easy to make it in this area but it can be done will hu of san francisco writes you neglected to mention the reverse commuters there are a ton of twentysomethings that live in san francisco and commute all over the bay just look at the fact that google and yahoo both have shuttles that bring employees down from the city to their respective campuses i have been driving from san francisco to menlo park every day for the past four years matt rensen of west hartford conn writes high taxes fueled by excessive socialism is the cause of san franciscos situation the city is not a business friendly environment plain and simple the reaction to spend now save later about young adults who dont want to save for retirement now or retire period was more positive than i expected still some parents wrote in to say how concerned they are about their childrens saving habits one reader said i was irresponsible to indicate that its fine not to save for retirement a financial planner shared his hunch about married twentysomethings theyre more comfortable with getting old because they assume they wont be doing it alone thus he concluded theyre more amenable to retirement planning as a single lady i assured him that his hunch might be accurate edward schmitz of vienna va writes as the father of a twentysomething son and someone who was twentysomething once and now is planning for retirement i believe that few young people in the past saved for retirement unless they happened to be in a government job such as teaching police etc very few worked for one employer long enough to vest for anything significant i worked for one company for six years and my vesting towards my pension amounted to about &# it is more important for young people to learn how to live within their means work on getting out of debt marriage maybe buying a home you can start your retirement saving in your s and still do fine richard m rosso of houston writes i noticed that the married twentysomethings i work with are more apt to discuss the "r" word could have something to do with the comforting feelings behind aging with the one you love norman hicks of gardena calif writes many people in their s see that our society is becoming ever more stratified more quickly than in the past so while theres risk involved it still seems to make sense to invest in ourselves that could leave us stranded like aspiring actors and actresses but id be curious to see the numbers on that owning a delicatessen or building a real estate firm arent exactly wildly ambitious pursuits james r sargent of auburn maine writes i am hopeful that our family can build on the experiences of earlier generations my immigrant grandfather made great progress in his plus year career in u s manufacturing management from his mid s until he died at his wealth evaporated in the great depression my parents were savers the largest lesson i learned from them is to live within your means the flood of emails i received in response to a column on how to invest &# was encouraging a lot of people asked for advice but my colleague jonathan clements is our resident guru check out a column he wrote refuting the wisdom of emergency savings for people with meager earnings michael ritger of new york writes you judge advisers and funds by their performance since this is a dangerous approach as it does not take into account their performance during bear markets which can erase most or all of their gains during the bull the five year winners in were all growth technology funds but most of these lost much more than half of their value in the next two years angie robinson of rockford ill writes i know that all the advice was from financial planners and brokers but none of them mentioned drip dividend reinvestment plans these plans are typically pretty stable and the returns are pretty good not only that but it is a low cost option and may spark a younger persons interest in the stock in the past we have chosen companies that we know and use on a daily basis or our friends do with automatically reinvesting the dividends we have managed to grow the accounts and our stock holdings substantially while paying little or no brokerage fees "
