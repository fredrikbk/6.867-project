the illiberal college one of the more momentous cases in supreme court history dartmouth college v woodward involved an attempt by the state of new hampshire to wrest control of the privately chartered school from its board of trustees but a corporate charter like dartmouths the marshall court ruled is the same as a private contract the state could not simply annex the school the sanctity of contract has preserved the independence of not a few colleges and universities but institutions of higher learning now shy from the same oversight their faculties have demanded of the corporate world and some of the lessons learned in that case are being unlearned consider the dartmouth of today still serenely humming on the banks of the connecticut river but home to what appears to be a power play against its own alumni in dartmouth agreed to a pact that instituted a novel scheme of democratic governance alumni the schools financial underwriters won the right to elect half of its non administrative or ex officio trustees who oversee the school and hire and fire its president the remaining seats are filled by appointment and typically go to big donors the candidates for elected trusteeships have traditionally been vetted by a small committee ensuring quiescence over the last four years however no fewer than four reform minded candidates won seats on the board using a provision allowing nomination by petition they include silicon valley ceo t j rodgers and virginia law professor stephen smith who have raised the profile of such issues as academic standards bureaucratic bloat and free speech their presence has proven to be a tremendous offense to dartmouths inner circles like administrators at most universities these academic elites expect only money not opinion and oversight from their alumni donors a year ago the administration worked with a small committee of alumni to alter the petition process to make it less likely that outsiders could win they lost in a rout in an alumni referendum but rather than accept that rebuke and seek some common ground the schools president james wright and his trustee allies now seem prepared to overhaul the schools governance more or less by fiat the scheme the boards governance committee is most likely to adopt next week has been dubbed "the harvard plan" because it would preserve the faint form of democracy while arrogating most power to an unelected internal committee at harvard this is called the "corporation" a larger elected body the overseers has little power former harvard dean harry lewis recently recounted the disposition of the corporation during the larry summers debacle "it was a leadership vacuum if harvard were a public corporation the shareholders would have been up in arms about the failure of the directors to care responsibly for the institution " it is not surprising that the "best practice" dartmouth seeks to emulate is precisely the practice that enabled harvards expulsion of mr summers should the board decide to vitiate dartmouths own experiment in democracy it will be a departure from standards of good governance now required in the marketplace as t j rodgers explains nearby worse it will be one more sign of a widening crevice between the real world and life on the nations campuses the endowments of the wealthiest institutions of higher learning total &# billion and a college education is one of the largest investments a person will ever make in tuition and donations as an alumnus it isnt a surprise that alumni stakeholders have begun to show interest and exert influence the only surprise is the lengths to which academic elites will go in order to keep out the light of day see related letters "letters to the editor in the ivy league entrenched trustees stiff arm the competition" wsj sep
