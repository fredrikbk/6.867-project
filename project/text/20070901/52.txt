pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece the house barragan built each room in the late architects home is a calculated surprise anatomy of a classic mexico city luis barragan was arguably mexicos greatest th century architect he developed a truly mexican style of modern architecture notable for its traditional materials rich spaces broad planar forms and unheard of for modernist architecture bright colors in he received the pritzker prize architectures highest honor yet almost two decades after his death the house he called home in mexico city and which is now open to the public remains a well kept secret surrounded by industrial gray facades it has almost no windows facing the street nor are there balconies or a front garden a passerby might not even notice it barragan was born in guadalajara in working there for several years before establishing his practice in mexico city about in after working on it for many years he moved into the house on general francisco ramirez street in the relatively quiet tacubaya neighborhood it would be his home until his death in at the age of now administered by the fundacion de arquitectura tapatia luis barragan the house can be toured weekday mornings by appointment the web site is casaluisbarragan org because there is no way to view the house from a distance you cannot imagine what the layout is like that means you cannot know what to expect as you move from room to room each is its own calculated surprise the entryway is bare and dim as if barragan wanted his guests to experience some measure of sensory deprivation on entering from the sunlit street then a door opens to the vestibule a high ceilinged space where a warm yellow light pours forth over a floor of dark rough volcanic stone the space is magnificent on one side a deep pink almost fuchsia wall makes you want to stay right there on the left a narrow stone staircase with no handrail trademark barragan leads your gaze floating upward to a gold leaf square by the mexican german artist mathias goeritz on the landing a low threshold and a parchment screen separate the vestibule from the living room the latter a space so dramatic that chatting visitors immediately lower their voices as they enter there is a double height ceiling of wooden beams and a floor of pine planks the walls are of rough white stucco and tiny little doors blend in hiding secret passages to service spaces an enormous window looks over a wild yet tranquil garden everyday objects are on display throughout the house a plain square table a lamp by a reading chair numerous candles that once burned during the long silences that the very private barragan enjoyed the religious imagery that watched over his cloistered quasimonastic life in front of a worktable there is a church lectern where barragan displayed items that would stir his creativity photographs of purebred horses a rooster sketch by his painter friend chucho reyes or a book of photographs of a moorish garden the dining area a separate room with a low ceiling is more intimate decorated with a festive sensual fuchsia wall and with ceramic bowls from all parts of mexico on display this room cannot hide the barragan who enjoyed the pleasures of life from the studio space we can hear the soothing trickle of an outdoor fountain our sight tries to follow a path through the jungle undergrowth of the garden in a country where there sometimes seems to be too much light the hanging foliage and mysteriously crooked trees create a lush green shaded enclosure the upper floor is the houses private space thick wood doors close over the windows transforming the rooms into bunkers the original white tiles and fixtures in the bathroom have the feel of an asylum the rooms seek dimness as a means of shelter finally we ascend to the houses spellbinding roof terrace "the facade that looks to the sky " as barragan told louis kahn when the latter was thinking about how to landscape the main plaza of the salk institute in la jolla calif for this outdoor space at his own home barragan experimented with size and color until he chose high walls of blood red dark brownish gray and white and flooring of red ceramic tiles the control over the elements is so obsessive that even his little piece of mexican sky has a frame to it like one of james turrells "skyspaces " barragan loved mexico but separated himself from it inside his urban fortress he could look into mexico but it was mexico seen from a distance through the prism of his mind in his house he highlighted certain favorite aspects of his native country folk art objects the impact of light and water on architecture the warm embrace of different spaces be they exterior or interior and he quietly critiqued the architectural establishment using tools well rooted in his indigenous tradition like the sight of a wall contrasted against the sky the rhythm of the thresholds the differentiation between materials and surfaces a visit to the barragan house is a rare pleasure where the miesian credo "less is more" is made manifest so powerfully personal is it that we come out thinking we saw the architect strolling around at some point on the tour not only showing us his oeuvre but displaying his serene yet rich and playful inner world mr perez gil is an architect in mexico city who teaches at the autonomous national university of mexico
