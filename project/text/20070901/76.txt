the week ahead our take on coming events taxes pain of pay as you go rules is about to strike congress by sarah lueck so far congressional democrats have largely kept their campaign vow to live under strict "pay as you go" budget rules but "paygo" is about to become a lot more painful when congress returns this coming week a few must do tax items will force lawmakers to confront a harsh reality passing tax cuts for one group likely means making others pay more and while the democratic majorities in the house and senate want to make good on their promise of fiscal responsibility theyre wary of being labeled tax raisers under paygo rules new spending or tax cuts must be offset with spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere the costliest item on the to do list is fixing the alternative minimum tax or amt which is intended to keep wealthy people from avoiding income taxes but will hit millions of middle income taxpayers beyond that some popular tax breaks such as college tuition and sales tax deductions are set to expire at years end some house democrats have been floating a plan for permanent amt relief that would help as many as million taxpayers but would cut projected revenue by perhaps &# billion to &# billion over five years it likely would be offset as required under paygo by raising taxes on top earners and by increasing the taxes paid by managers of private equity and hedge funds on the slice of profits known as carried interest the senate is on a different track sen max baucus d mont tax committee chairman has said paygos demands make a one or two year "patch" more realistic still a patch would cut &# billion in projected revenue this year and &# billion more in house democrats will vet their approach at a hearing set for thursday and are certain to make the point that amt is greatly reducing the benefit of the and tax cuts backed by president bush and theyll provide their first public airing of views on whether to increase taxes on carried interest democrats say increasing taxes on carried interest or limiting hedge fund managers ability to defer their income another idea being discussed arent the same as tax increases "closing tax loopholes is not raising taxes " says rep rahm emanuel d ill "thats a standard scare tactic " the house has tangled with paygo far more than the senate and house democrats take particular umbrage at republicans tax and spend label saying they have cut spending far more than they have raised taxes for example they cut subsidies to tuition lenders to fund an education bill and trimmed medicare payments to providers mostly private health insurers to help pay for health legislation republicans say some bills have relied on budget gimmicks and they oppose democrats main spending cut a decrease in medicare payments to health insurers many republicans say democrats brand of paygo constrains congresss ability to pass tax cuts that fuel economic growth and spurs the need for tax increases to pay for priorities such as fixing the amt "its narrow minded and very strict " says pat toomey a former republican congressman who now heads the anti tax club for growth politics thompsons best ally may be primary calendar chaos by john harwood fred thompson next week begins something that would seem implausible limping into a presidential race long after competitors set off with a running head start few would bet the ex tennessee senator will overtake them his hope is that the chaotic shifting guideposts offer precisely the kind of course that a chaotic shifting campaign can navigate it wont take long after next weeks webcast announcement to start learning whether hes right during months of hesitation mr thompson has appeared determined to prove that as detractors maintain he lacks the drive necessary to win the white house his wife jeri kehn thompson herself a political consultant has fueled stereotypes about meddling candidate spouses by taking an active role as one manager and two press aides cycled in and out perhaps more consequential is uncertainty over what mr thompsons message will be conservative true believers have spent much of dreaming that the man who plays arthur branch on "law and order" might turn into a st century version of ronald reagan yet he hasnt quelled the doubts of republican antitax mavens such as grover norquist and dan mitchell about his tax cutting bona fides it is useful to remember why those conservatives lifted him to second place in the polls though he stood for little more than "none of the above " in a political party defined in the bush era by its unalloyed conservatism there remains no consensus champion of the right that represents one opening for mr thompson another is that the primary track keeps changing michigan has taken steps to accelerate its nomination contest to jan yet another threat following floridas move to jan to the traditional primacy of iowa and new hampshire the more the primary calendar changes the greater the opening for a latecomer even a wobbly one like mr thompson housing credits crunch harder on some by james r hagerty theres plenty of pain in the home loan market but it isnt spread evenly a new index of mortgage pain devised by independent housing economist thomas lawler shows that the recent drastic tightening of credit will hurt worst in california nevada florida hawaii arizona rhode island and new york state those states have a higher dependence on the types of mortgages that lenders are now refusing to make or offering only to select buyers and at higher rates in parts of those states the autumn home shopping season which kicks off after labor day for buyers eager to install themselves in fancier quarters before the holidays is likely to be a "disaster " says mr lawler who is based in vienna va mortgage lenders finding they can no longer sell off many types of loans now deemed too risky by nervous investors have grown far more cautious over the past few weeks theyre still happy to make "conforming loans " ones for &# or less to people with good credit records and enough savings for a down payment thats because such loans fit the criteria for sale to government sponsored investors freddie mac and fannie mae but lenders are making very few subprime loans those to people with weak credit records and have cut way back on alt a mortgages a category between prime and subprime that often involves credit for people who cant or dont want to fully document their incomes and assets lenders have jacked up rates on prime "jumbo" loans those above &# which exceed regulatory limits on mortgages that can be sold to fannie and freddie jumbo year fixed rate loans last week were being offered for an average of around or about percentage point above those on conforming loans according to hsh associates a financial publisher that surveys lenders daily usually jumbo rates are only around a quarter point above conforming mr lawler studied loans that have been packaged into securities and determined which states have the highest proportions of subprime alt a and jumbo loans those states are likely to have more would be buyers who are unable to get loans or cant get an affordable rate california and nevada he found have a dependence on such loans or "pain" index of about of the national average florida is at hawaii and arizona around and new york and rhode island at in connecticut with a score just under michael menatian president of sanborn mortgage is calling customers who previously qualified for low down payment loans and warning them they now will need to dig deeper into their savings if they want a mortgage at the other end of the spectrum is north dakota with a pain index of narrowly besting south dakota iowa and vermont all at
