barclays copes with a stall in cash engine capital markets unit a key profit generator gets hit by credit woes london the engine behind barclays plcs growth and a major reason the british bank has the fuel to bid for dutch bank abn amro holding nv is its capital markets business when barclays needed extra cash last month to fend off a european consortium also bidding for abn barclays capital helped bring in investors from china and singapore the unit reported a increase in six month pretax profit compared with the same period a year earlier but over the past two weeks the barclays capital machine has sputtered on friday the unit said it is providing &# billion in financing to an investment vehicle it helped set up last year that had run into financial difficulties barclays capital also is facing losses estimated at &# million relating to investments in two bear stearns cos hedge funds that had bet heavily in the u s subprime mortgage market fridays bailout followed news a day earlier that its parent had been forced to tap a bank of england lending facility because of technical difficulties with a securities clearing system that meant it faced a shortfall at its central bank account in an interview on friday barclays president robert diamond jr acknowledged it has been a frustrating few weeks but said there were no big losses for investors to fear "you should expect to see us outperform whatever environment were in " mr diamond said by telephone "if there was a black hole exposure in barcap we would have to make an announcement and i am looking you in the eyes as much as i can through a conference phone and saying that i still expect us to outperform in this market environment " the problems have been one of several drags on barclayss stock price in london trading friday barclays shares rose pence cents to pence but the stock is down for august its also off since mid march when the bank and abn announced they were in talks over a deal valued at billion euros or &# billion that means the stock price is far below the pence price that would put barclayss offer on par with that of a bank consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc whose bid is valued at billion euros a decision by abn shareholders could come in october mr diamond joined the bank in the summer of and helped turn barclays capital into a business that contributes about of barclayss profit and competes aggressively with wall street firms in the debt markets but barclayss expertise in structuring and financing complex products or affiliates for clients has come back to haunt the bank the capital markets unit helped set up and finance for hedge funds and banks a type of structured investment vehicle known as an siv lite but with the turmoil in credit markets some vehicles have been unable to tap their main money source the commercial paper market at the same time there has been a sharp drop in the value of assets the structures owned on aug ratings agency standard &amp poors said it was downgrading the notes of structures called mainsail ii ltd and golden key ltd separately s&amp p said it had placed the notes of sachsen funding i ltd and cairn high grade funding i ltd on creditwatch with negative implications barclays helped arrange or finance all four according to ratings agency reports barclays capital on friday said it agreed to provide cairn high funding i with the &# billion of funding which the bank says it has hedged the move relieves pressure on cairn an affiliate of a london money manager and means the structure doesnt have to unload its assets which are securities tied to u s residential mortgages at a time when there are few buyers barclays officials say barclays capital is working with two of the other structured vehicles mainsail ii an affiliate of a london hedge fund and golden key an affiliate of a geneva money manager but no deal is imminent "barcap in no way walked away from this nor was there an obligation to fund " mr diamond says "but there is an obligation to continue working with our clients in constructive solutions " standard &amp poors bank analyst nick hill says the funding provided to cairn salvages what could have been an ugly dumping of assets "when they step in and fund an entire conduit like that it could actually be the optimal strategy for minimizing the loss even though you are actually extending more credit in the short term " says mr hill of s&amp p which this week said it was maintaining its long term double a rating on barclays bank plc what has been the biggest surprise is that a bank skilled at structuring the most complex products is getting tripped up by the daily plumbing of banking twice in the past two weeks the bank has had to tap a little used bank of england credit line to cover shortfalls the so called standing lending facility has been used more than a dozen times since may investors are hypersensitive to its use because it could signal a bank is having funding problems on thursday news surfaced that one or more banks had tapped gbp billion on wednesday sending bank analysts and media on a chase to identify the borrowing party barclays capital now says that a breakdown at around p m wednesday at the securities settling system operated by euroclear sa meant that it didnt have enough time to see what trades had settled and then balance its books at the bank of england because other banks also had the same troubles they werent willing to lend to barclays so it could cover its shortfall on wednesday afternoon barclays tapped the lending facility even though it says it is "flush with liquidity " it borrowed most of the gbp billion taken that day although other banks also tapped the line according to people familiar with the situation still no other bank has surfaced with problems "it seems to have affected one bank which is peculiar " says euroclear spokesman denis peters "if this was systemic every bank in the u k would have been crawling on their hands and knees to the bank of england on wednesday evening " mr diamond is expected to appear at a lehman brothers holdings inc financial services investor conference on sept in new york
