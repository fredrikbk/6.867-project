craig is expected to resign republicans worries about intensify warner plans to retire washington amid growing pressure from within his own party idaho sen larry craig was expected to announce his resignation saturday according to senior republicans in the senate magnifying the anxiety of republicans about their standing in the elections republican sen john warner of virginia said he would retire after leaving the seat he has held for nearly years open to a challenge by a democrat if mr craig resigns idahos republican governor would name a successor who would have to run in in order to keep the seat republicans spent the past week attempting to contain the damage from news that mr craig had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after his arrest in an airport restroom by an undercover agent several prominent republicans called for mr craig to step down a strong indication of the partys desire to avoid taking on more baggage heading into an election already looking difficult especially amid several other scandals swirling around the party in november republicans lost both their senate and house majorities as voters revolted against their record in congress and the white house on the war federal spending and scandals now they face a election offering few openings to regain control of the senate and the prospect of further losses republicans have senate seats to defend next year compared with for democrats more republican incumbents including sens john sununu of new hampshire and norm coleman of minnesota face tough contests while most democrats hold safe seats republicans also will have to contend with more retirements which typically provide opponents with easier shots at capturing seats than theyd have against well financed well known incumbents next year "is going to be another good democratic year " said nonpartisan political analyst stuart rothenberg "the question is how good " if mr craig leaves his seat it likely will remain in republican hands because idaho is so solidly republican but his travails arent without broader costs to his party republicans say the embarrassment for the self professed "family values" republican serves to further demoralize republicans grass roots still in a funk over last years sex and corruption scandals as well as white house spending and the iraq war the national republican party also would have to spend money on the idaho senate race that wouldnt have been needed if mr craig had been able to run for re election untarnished dan whiting a spokesman for mr craig said friday that the senator was "trying to decide whats best for idaho its obviously not an easy decision and its not something hes going to be rushed into " mr craig has denied any wrongdoing in the encounter with the police officer who was investigating reports of public sex in the minneapolis st paul international airport the officer said mr craigs gestures were a proposition for sex mr craig said his actions were misread but his guilty plea was the infraction most republicans cited as they urged him publicly to leave the senate another prominent republican spoke against mr craig on thursday senate republican leader mitch mcconnell who is up for re election in called mr craigs conduct "unforgivable" and acknowledged that other senators believed their colleague should resign "we have acted promptly to begin the process of dealing with this conduct " mr mcconnell said thursday in lexington ky according to the associated press "we will see what happens in the coming days " with sen warners planned exit and the earlier retirement announcement from colorados republican sen wayne allard democrats now are widely considered to have good chances at seizing two republican held seats in colorado democrats leading contender is rep mark udall who is from a well known western political dynasty in virginia democrats say popular former gov mark warner who last year explored a presidential candidacy is likely to run and both parties strategists agree he would have a strong shot for democrats to win the colorado and virginia senate races next year would give them both the senate seats and governorships in two states once heavily republican other republicans are considered possibilities to give up their seats including new mexicos pete domenici who recently has been drawn into an investigation of the bush administrations firing of u s attorneys and more likely nebraskas chuck hagel democrats maintain they could take both seats if vacated even in solidly republican red nebraska where popular former governor and democratic sen bob kerrey is interested so far none of the senate democrats up for re election have indicated retirement plans delaware sen joe biden is running for the partys presidential nomination but could run for re election if he doesnt succeed "we expect that all of our incumbents are running for re election " said j b poersch executive director of the senate democrats campaign committee new york sen chuck schumer head of that committee has worked to dissuade anyone said to be thinking about retirement such as iowa sen tom harkin
