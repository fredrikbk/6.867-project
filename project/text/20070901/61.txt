pursuits style return of the dress code eclectic looks have defined fashion in recent years now retailers want to bring back carefully matched ensembles the risk of reviving the old rules after years of successfully convincing women to break the rules of fashion by mixing casual and dressy clothes this fall designers and retailers are reversing course they are once again trying to sell the idea of carefully put together ensembles complete with tailored jackets matching skirts and high heeled pumps stores from saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus to banana republic and target are promoting this more formal look as a big trend this season bloomingdales is prominently displaying mannequins in matching outfits that include s style hats and gloves even trendy boutiques like intermix which has stores and also sells online are calling the fitted jacket and the traditional pump some of the most important fashion items this season "we call it the chic revival " says stephanie solomon fashion director for womens ready to wear and accessories at bloomingdales "its no longer the just got out of bed look " this could be a tough sell the iconoclastic mix and match approach has been one of fashions big success stories of recent years and has brought about a sea change in shopping habits women especially those in their s and s have grown accustomed to bypassing single designer looks in favor of tossing together disparate pieces to create an eclectic outfit that expresses their personality or mood "individuality continues to be one of the emotional drivers for many women and with that comes creativity of wardrobe and apparel " says tom julian director of trends at ad agency mccann erickson "rules tend to put off shoppers " the fashion industry of course benefits when styles change dramatically and women buy more clothes to avoid looking out of date if women turn toward more formal attire en masse this could mean a significant bump in sales shoppers with closets full of mismatched jackets and pants who were planning to buy a few more separates this season may now feel the need to buy new suits in order to look trendy the industry is betting that more formal looks will give a boost to sales of womens apparel where growth has slowed lately in the year ended in may sales rose to &# billion according to market researcher npd group that compares with a increase in the previous months to nudge women to spend retailers and designers are pushing an array of new head to toe ensembles that often include extras such as formal hats and long gloves theyre betting that many women especially younger shoppers may not have these items since they havent been in style for several years if the fashion industry succeeds in converting shoppers several recent style staples could be deemed passe low rise pants and skirts will be replaced by higher waisted versions fitted coats could be taken over by oversized cocoon shaped styles and with classic pumps and ankle high lace up boots with slender heels now ubiquitous in stores and fashion magazine spreads the chunky wedge and platform shoes that have been popular for several seasons could look out of place for a sampling of the new look take the marc jacobs fall items that have recently hit stores a &# cashmere coat with a graduated cocoon shape a &# high waisted pencil skirt and a body skimming tailored dress that retails for &# that is currently shown on saksfifthavenue com paired with a formal looking &# narrow brimmed hat these polished and put together looks have been a fashion fixture through the decades in the s jacqueline kennedy inspired a nation of copycats who coveted her elegant oleg cassini suits often paired with pillbox hats mod and hippie styles eventually edged this out but the s saw a resurgence of uniformity as power suits became a trend since the late s fashion has been dominated by offbeat tossed together ensembles popularized in part by trend setting celebrities such as sarah jessica parker and shows such as "sex and the city " designers too fueled the trend by showing these styles on runways inspiring women to embrace the idea of breaking away from the formal dictates of fashion and taking pieces from various collections to create unique looks victoria marble a year old realtor from ashby mass says shes tired of the youthful baby doll look and is eager to buy some of the more formal fall clothes but she still wont be matching head to toe "i like to tweak things a little bit " she says there are downsides for the consumer some of the more eclectic styles that worked well in outfits that had a thrown together feel may have to be relegated to the back of the closet for a while also those who have become used to looking more individualistic may think the traditional matched look makes them look like their mothers theres also the risk of stepping out in ensembles that are so highly matched that they may closely resemble someone else to reach customers like ms marble luca orlandi who designs the luca luca label has been careful to create pants skirt and dress options for his jackets "if someone buys the jacket with the dress the salesperson can go oh it also goes with this skirt and it creates a different look " he says "it helps us make a multiple sale " eveningwear designer carmen marc valvo who also designs daywear says that even while adopting the mix and match fashion sensibility many women have still largely worn uniforms "women get overwhelmed and confused with too many choices " he says "when theyve mixed and matched and put an outfit together for them in their heads thats their costume thats their ensemble theyll always wear that shirt with that pair of pants that outfit is never broken up " retailers and designers have been paving the way for this look for months now starting with the runway shows in february and more recently through ads and web pages fashion forward shoppers are already adopting the new rules retailers say customers at olive &amp bettes a new york based chain of boutiques have lately begun asking for more polished looks says owner stacey pecor some have mentioned wanting to look like english import victoria beckham pop star and wife of soccer star david beckham who has been photographed lately in tailored ensembles with matching pumps and handbags "they see stacks of jeans and stacks of t shirts and they just want something different " ms pecor says designer nanette lepore says she started getting calls this spring from retailers asking if she could make skirts to match her jackets because shoppers were requesting them the result of ms lepores fall jackets and coats come with matching bottoms compared with less than in the spring "its a need right now " she says but even some in the industry arent following all of the new rules kohls for instance is stocking up on matching suits hats gloves and high heeled ankle boots but it is steering clear of dressy high waisted pants "you have to be very thin for that to look nice " says david hacker the chains vice president of trend and color "anything thats high waisted shows every flaw " banana republic is selling hats and long gloves intended to be worn with short sleeved jackets deborah lloyd executive vice president of design encourages women to display personal flair by adding a striking necklace or by wearing shoes with a handbag and belt that are the same color but arent all of the same shade hats arent striking a chord with some in the industry while bloomingdales is pushing structured hats like the s style cloches and fedoras that designers marc jacobs and proenza schouler showed on the runways in february neiman marcus fashion director ken downing doesnt think women will run out to buy them this fall on the runways he says hats worked as a "punctuation point " but he believes women wont want to make that much of a fashion statement another strike against hats "were a hair obsessed
