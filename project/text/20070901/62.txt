famed dancing girls belong mostly to a bygone era many like mr hussains mother and aunt arrived from india in after pakistans independence in recent years efforts to develop old lahore have pushed up land prices and pushed out many of the women who either couldnt afford rents or chose to cash in on property they owned that should be good news for officials eager to beautify a city that bears the
