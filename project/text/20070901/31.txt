hot topic presidential leapfrog the way things are going the first votes in the presidential election may yet be cast in more than months before the national elections next november this is not an improvement in a little noticed move this week wyoming republicans moved their party conventions to january beating out michigan which just moved its primaries to january state laws in iowa and new hampshire require those states in turn to leapfrog michigan and wyoming potentially pushing one or both elections into december so voters in those two states might have to interrupt their holidays to participate in a presidential primary campaign better held during a much less busy season this maneuvering continues a presidential election process that is changing in ways that make it both longer yet paradoxically less reflective than ever sixty years ago presidential nominees were chosen largely by delegates to conventions held in late summer between to days before the actual vote that system gave us fdr truman and ike to name three better than average presidents it also gave us warren harding but then no system is perfect in any event this was deemed too beholden to insiders so the progressives lobbied for primaries to open the nominating process to more voters yet those primaries were also spread out from march through the early summer allowing candidates to adjust to a defeat raise money between primaries and even to enter at a late date president lyndon johnson didnt drop out of the race in until march after eugene mccarthys surprise showing in the new hampshire primary bobby kennedy entered the race that same month and he only emerged as a real threat to the nomination after winning in california in early june he was assassinated on the night of that victory on the republican side ronald reagan lost to president gerald ford in new hampshire in but he turned his campaign around with a victory in north carolina in late march based in part on his opposition to the panama canal treaty that began a series of primary victories that left him only a handful of delegates short of winning the gop nomination both scenarios would be impossible this election cycle when the party nominees will be decided in a flurry of primaries that may transpire over less than a month the big states have tired of the attention devoted to puny iowa and new hampshire and so have elbowed themselves into an earlier and they hope more decisive role the candidates have responded by kicking off their campaigns even earlier some have been running for a year already republican fred thompson expected to formally announce next week will test the proposition that you have to start that early but hes going to have to raise a lot of money very fast under restrictive campaign finance laws to be competitive in so many states so quickly after new hampshire and iowa only someone already famous al gore or newt gingrich could still decide to enter later this fall and have a chance to put it another way this process is both too long and too constricted it is too long in the sense that it starts the presidential race more than two years before the actual vote this shrinks the time for actual "governing " to the extent this still happens in washington with senators like hillary clinton and joe biden having to calibrate every utterance for its impact on their nomination chances this has only made it harder this year for the parties to find any bipartisan common ground on iraq for example then once the nominees are all but picked next year on february we will have another long months of campaigning before november no wonder the political pros call this "the permanent campaign " but the process is also too constricted because once the primary voting starts it will be over in a flash this makes it harder for a dark horse candidate to break through even with an early victory it might be too late to raise enough money to compete in the fast following giant states it also gives americans less chance to scrutinize the nominees once the actual balloting begins sure voters may know the names of most of those who are running but average rational citizens lack the time or interest to focus until an election is nigh a nominating primary gantlet of three to four weeks is the political equivalent of a blur this means that crucial facts about a candidates experience and character may not be discovered until he has already wrapped up the nomination were not sure what can be done about all this both parties have conspired in the past in moving up the primary dates for their own competitive reasons such as getting the intra party disputes out of the way early when taking on a sitting president and this year both parties have threatened to punish state parties that move up their primaries to crowd the early small states to no avail perhaps it will all turn out for the best this time around but if the process leaves one or both parties lukewarm about their nominees it could also open the field for a third party candidate to make a run this is the scenario that new yorks billionaire mayor michael bloomberg has been eyeing pressure could also build for congress to intervene and set some new campaign limits which in the usual congressional fashion could make things worse its not too early for the parties to start thinking how to organize things better for the campaign on present course they are making us nostalgic for conventions and smoke filled rooms
