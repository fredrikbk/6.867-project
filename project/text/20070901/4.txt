art loans get hung up credit crunch raises concern of defaults in a lucrative market the credit crunch shaking up wall street is now hitting the big money world of art backed loans for years art loans ones with a borrowers raphael or rothko as collateral were the purview of large banks serving wealthy clients but as the art market boomed in recent years other firms have pushed into this lucrative business today hedge funds auction houses and specialty lenders all offer rival services often they cater to less wealthy borrowers dabbling in the big leagues some loans are like reverse mortgages letting borrowers receive monthly payments against the value of their art rather than selling it outright and taking a capital gains tax hit other lenders essentially act as high end pawnbrokers taking possession of the artwork itself during the loan period a practice that banks with more high end clients sniff at theyre inclined to let you keep the art on your wall as these newer kinds of loans proliferate concerns are rising in the art world that some borrowers could default or find themselves in over their heads art is notoriously tough to value so if prices fall sharply lenders could find that theyre holding collateral worth less than the loan it is backing that hasnt happened yet but experts say theres a precedent for worries like these hope tate a banker at fine art capital a subsidiary of emigrant savings bank points out that there was a spate of defaults on art backed loans in the early s triggered by "a very serious correction in both the real estate and art markets " back then "the people who defaulted on their art loans for the most part had real estate as their primary business " says ms tate who worked on a handful of defaults like these at citibank at the time "when people have calls on other loans such as real estate loans it increases the risk that they will default on their art loans " she says already the market volatility of the past few months is changing the art lending landscape as traditional lenders scale back on noncore activities like art lending a spokesman for first republic bank one of the major players in the niche business says that while art lending is a very small part of its portfolio "we have recently tightened somewhat in this area of our business " rivals like fine art capital based in new york say they have seen a burst in loan applications as a result of the pullback among bigger banks "the subprime market is triggering a general tightening " says andy augenblick the firms president "we have been a beneficiary of this market disruption " a "significant percentage" of the inquiries that have come his way during the past couple of months have come in the form of referrals from other financial institutions he says meanwhile art capital group says it has seen referrals of loans that institutions like lehman brothers holdings ubs hsbc holdings merrill lynch and bank of america declined to do karl schweizer head of art banking at ubs says the bank doesnt lend against art but is studying its policies bank of america said it hasnt made changes to its credit policies regarding art loans other institutions didnt return phone calls seeking comment even collectors aiming to borrow against their art are taking additional measures to obtain a loan asher edelman a collector and businessman says he recently advised a friend taking out a loan against his art to put up three times the loan value rather than the usual double because he will get a better interest rate terms on these loans vary widely based on the quality of the art the lenders policies and the borrowers financial condition generally interest rates range from to as high as making it a lucrative if risky game for lenders the potential for outsize returns like that is one reason hedge funds have pushed into the business in recent years to protect themselves some lenders require what are essentially margin call provisions the lender reserves the right to reappraise the collateral and if theres a drop in value to ask for more collateral or partial payback of the loan for instance "if there were a significant drop in the warhol market and you had a loan out on a series of warhols we could use this mark to market provision " says ian peck president of art capital group an independent art lender in new york with provisions like these while that can protect the lender it carries obvious risks for borrowers "would you buy a house with a one year mortgage that had a margin call so you were forced to sell your home when the market was depressed " says mr augenblick of fine art capital which doesnt require margin calls "i dont think so " the perils to lenders of art backed loans are many for one thing by the time a lender forecloses on such a loan the borrower has usually tried aggressively to sell the art "so by the time the lender gets it the art is already stale in the market " says ms tate in the notoriously murky art market the prospect of defaults is particularly unnerving fears were renewed in with an incident involving sagecrest a hedge fund that loaned &# million to art capital group which in turn lent &# million to berry hill galleries a new york art gallery berry hill filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in triggering a wave of alleged loan defaults followed by several suits and countersuits in new york state supreme court sagecrests attorney robert friedman says the hedge fund sued art capital group after it failed to meet its obligations under the loan including payments due late last year mr peck art capital groups president says sagecrests claim is "total nonsense " berry hill didnt returns calls seeking comment its particularly tough to get loans backed by contemporary art one of the hottest parts of the art market now art advisers say banks have become more skittish about betting on a segment of the market that doesnt have a long track record joel beck who runs roebling hall a gallery specializing in contemporary art in new yorks booming chelsea arts district says banks and loan firms "just dont know what to make of us " mr beck who sells work by ivan navarro such as a chair made out of light bulbs says that when he attempted to get an art backed loan years ago the bank asked him instead to put up his house as collateral something he didnt want to do "they might believe the work is worth a lot but they have no idea how to value it " he says
