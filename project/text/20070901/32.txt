its still the same love thy neighbor arthur c brookss aug editorial page commentary "our religious destiny" implies that europeans are more sophisticated than we are in their lack of religiosity and that we should follow their example this follows a litany of references to europeans that we have heard over time from politicians and pundits who would like the u s to be more "left" in its policies and programs i learned when i started working that if i wanted to achieve the same level of success as others all i had to do was follow their example if i wanted to achieve more i would have to be different thank god that the u s has been different from europe because its the differences that have led us to become the worlds leader in every respect one of those differences has been a religious foundation that the left has been increasingly successful in denying and eroding but which at the grass roots level according to prof brooks will remain due to projected demographics americans equate religiosity with the values we admire and aspire to practice in our daily lives love thy neighbor do unto others as you would have them do unto you etc even if our elected leaders fall short of achieving these goals having them reinforce and support these values can only produce good and help the u s maintain its leadership role john payne spokane wash prof brooks is mistaken in his assumption that reproduction is destiny when he predicts the growth of religion in the u s europe became relatively secular through enlightenment education especially through the teaching of natural sciences which taught children to question religion is not monolithic especially in the u s with surveys consistently showing that religion is in decline here with the exception of fundamentalist evangelicalism it is probably no coincidence that fundamentalist religion is strongest where school education in sciences is being deliberately crippled by local school boards it is reasonable to expect that the trends in religious belief will depend more on the availability of good education and employment that requires this education than any reproductive differentials alex tolley los gatos calif it takes more than an ordinary person of faith like myself to explain to those about me that my god loves me and them when we are constantly bombarded with the muslims chant of "god is great praise god" as they are leaping among us as human bombs ray c fleming wichita kan
