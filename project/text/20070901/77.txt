the weekend interview with t j rodgers mr rodgers goes to dartmouth san jose calif t j rodgers does not seem pleased his gelid stare intensifying at a recent project meeting "youre not being aggressive enough on the transistors so im going to help you " rumbles the chief executive of cypress semiconductor a silicon valley chip maker this leads into a technical debate with one of his senior engineers "are you serious about using indium instead of boron " mr rodgers founded cypress in and now a lifetime later in the hypercompetitive semiconductor business it is an industry leader mr rodgers for his part has reached that phase where success purchases new opportunities some men of his means and achievement buy a yacht or turn to philanthropic work or join other corporate boards mr rodgers went back to school he became a trustee of his alma mater dartmouth college and not a recumbent one he has now served for three years and though he notes some positives overall mr rodgers says "its been a horrible experience im a respected person here in silicon valley nobody calls me names nobody demeans me in board meetings thats not the way im treated at dartmouth the behavior has been pretty shabby " now the colleges establishment is working to ensure that the likes of t j rodgers never again intrude where theyre not welcome what follows is a cautionary tale about what happens when the business world crosses over into the alternative academic one founded in hanover n h in dartmouth has long been famous for the intensity of its alumnis loyalty it is not unfair or an exaggeration to call it half college and half cult in part this devotion is because of what the school does well "dartmouth is the best undergraduate school in the world " says mr rodgers who graduated in as salutatorian with degrees in chemistry and physics there were "small classes taught by real professors not graduate students " he says "and i never realized how that was heaven on earth until i went on to my next school " mr rodgers earned a ph d in electrical engineering from stanford in partly too dartmouths alumni fidelity is a result of engaging graduates in the life of the college it is one of a few schools in the u s that allow alumni to elect leaders directly eight of the members of dartmouths governing board of trustees are chosen by the popular vote of some graduates the other seats are reserved mostly for major donors along with ex officio positions for the governor of new hampshire and the college president this arrangement has been in place since until recently though dartmouths elections have been indifferent affairs with the alumni choosing from a largely homogeneous slate handpicked by a committee closely aligned with the administration in things got interesting mr rodgers bypassed the official nomination channels and was named to the ballot by collecting alumni signatures he needed and ended up acquiring more than times that he was dissatisfied with the colleges direction and resolved to either "do something or stop griping about it " he was elected by of the voters although there were a lot of political issues churning about the campus mr rodgers decided "that i would pursue just one issue and my one issue the one substantive issue is the quality of education at dartmouth i decided that if i started debating the political argument du jour it would reduce my effectiveness " that kind of pragmatism however didnt inhibit a highly political response from the aggrieved including the college administration and some of the faculty mr rodgers notes that certain professors "seemed to specialize" in accusing him of being retrograde racist sexist opposed to "diversity" and so forth or in the academic shorthand a conservative a curious label for a man who is in favor of gay marriage against the iraq war and thinks bill clinton was a better president than george w bush mr rodgerss sensibility rather is libertarian and ruggedly western he is also a famously aggressive demanding ceo with technical expertise a strong entrepreneurial bent and an emphasis on empirics and analytics his lodestars he says are "data and reason and logic " at dartmouth he remarks he has produced dozens of long systematic papers on the issues his first priority was to improve its "very poor record of freedom of speech " soon enough the college president james wright overturned a speech code the foundation for individual rights in education a watchdog group elevated dartmouths rating from "red" to its highest "green " one of only seven schools in the country with that status "we made progress and i was feeling pretty good " mr rodgers says he intended to move on to quality of education next but the political situation at dartmouth degenerated mr rodgerss candidacy was followed by two further elections in which petition candidates peter robinson a fellow at the hoover institution and todd zywicki a professor of law at george mason university were also elected mr rodgers says that like him theyre "independent people willing to challenge the status quo " perhaps sensing that a critical mass was building dartmouths establishment then tried to skew the petition trustee process the details are complex and tedious but last autumn they cooked up a new alumni constitution that would have "reformed" the way trustees were elected in practice it would have stacked the odds like those in a casino in favor of the house the measure needed two thirds of alumni approval to pass and in an election with the highest turnout in dartmouths history it was voted down by "it lost big time " mr rodgers says earlier this year another petition trustee stephen smith of the university of virginia law school was elected with of the voters quite naturally dartmouths insular leadership has loathed all of this a former trustee and a current chair of dartmouths &# billion capital campaign publicly charged that the petition process had initiated a "downward death spiral" in which a "radical minority cabal" was attempting to hijack the board of trustees that was among the more charitable commentaries curious again that mr rodgers has been cast as the leader of some sinister conservative faction since he is open about what his actual goals are "they attack things that dont matter because they cant attack you for what you stand for quality of education the attacks become ad hominem we get called the problem the fact is that were a response to the problem " in mr rodgerss judgment the increasingly political denigration the "rancor " he calls it has seriously impinged on his effectiveness as a trustee and on the effectiveness of the board in general "before i ever went to my first board meeting " he says "i did what any decent manager in silicon valley does management by walking around you actually go and talk to people and ask how theyre doing and what they need to get their jobs done " he noted trends over enrollment wait lists and an increased percentage of classes taught by visiting or non tenure track faculty he concluded that many departments economics government psychology and brain sciences in particular were "suffering from a shortage of teaching " "its a simple problem " mr rodgers says "you hire more professors " his effort to get an objective grip on the problem would be comic were it not so unfathomable "ive had to scrounge to get data " he says the administration not being forthcoming "my best sources of data come from faculty members and students " while he cant discuss internal figures he says theres been "a modest improvement since its about professors net gain " thats "going in the right direction but not nearly as fast as i would like " while the college has added faculty per year over the last decade at the same time its overall expenses have increased by "so the inevitable mathematical conclusion of those numbers is that the percentage of money we spend on faculty is going down and it has gone down consistently for a long time " "in general i dont have a prescription " he says "im not trying to micromanage the place what im saying is take the huge amount of money that an institution like dartmouth has and focus it on your core business which is undergraduate education and make it really really good if you want to pinch pennies pinch pennies somewhere else and not on the core business thats all im saying " trustee politics is the reason that this problem with "the core business " as he puts it has not been addressed "i dont think we pay enough attention to it and care enough about it we have time to worry about other things and somehow the main business of the college which is to educate doesnt dominate our meetings "i obviously dont want to talk a lot about what happens in board meetings but i keep pushing to spend time on it and that makes me an annoyance the priority has been if you look at it changing the rules to get rid of the petition trustees who are willing to criticize the administration "basically " he continues "i find the meetings to be pro forma this is an overstatement but almost scripted no we dont roll up our sleeves and think real hard i certainly dont feel like that what i have to offer to any organization is being used by the board of dartmouth college " now mr rodgers says the argument has come to its endgame "this is not a conservative liberal conflict this is a libertarian totalitarian conflict " one of the main criticisms leveled at the petition trustee process is that it is polarizing divisive and somehow detrimental to the college mr rodgers replies "if divisive means there are issues and we debate the issues and move forward according to a consensus then divisive equals democracy and democracy is good the alternative which i fear is what the administration and board of trustees chairman ed haldeman are after right now is a politburo one party rule " and so after losing four consecutive democratic contests the dartmouth administration has evidently decided to do away with democracy altogether "now im working on the existence question " mr rodgers notes mordantly though he cannot say for sure "ill be kept in the dark until a couple of days before the meeting on what theyre planning on doing" a five member subcommittee which conducts its business in secret and includes the chair and the president has embarked on a "governance review" that will consolidate power "it looks like theyre just going to abandon or make ineffectual the ability of alumni to elect half the trustees at dartmouth " mr rodgers says he believes that the model is the harvard corporation where a small group "makes all the decisions they elect themselves in secret they elect themselves in secret for a life term hows that for democracy " the rest of the dartmouth trustees mr rodgers says "will go to the board meetings to have a couple of banquets and meet a few students and feel good about ourselves and brag to our compatriots that were indeed on the board of trustees of dartmouth college " this drastic action he says is unnecessary "these are small problems that are fixable " mr rodgers argues "instead of making them major political wars we simply ought to go solve the problems and get on with it " the alternative remedy he continues is poor corporate governance for one "this is committees working in secret which is a very bad way to run any organization " besides transparency it may also present conflicts of interest in which the college president would dominate those who ultimately evaluate his performance but he contrasts the situation especially with his experience at cypress "silicon is a very tough master it operates to the laws of physics there are no politics you cant vote or will or committee your way around it therefore the culture of silicon valley where winning and losing is being technologically successful or not is an objective nonpolitical culture its just different on the dartmouth board " mr rodgers expects to be "severely criticized unfairly and personally " for talking to the journal he may even be removed from his post entirely "its worth it " he says "doing what is right for the college that i love is more important than holding what is largely a ceremonial position " mr rago a dartmouth graduate is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal
