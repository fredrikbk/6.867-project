pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink make mine a for vodka sellers these are the best of times in that sales of high priced vodkas continue to grow and they are the worst too in that just about anyone can and is getting into the vodka marketing game "go into a liquor store or a bar and there are vodkas on the shelf " says vic morrison marketing veep at mccormick distilling the challenge is to come up with some clever gimmick to set ones vodka apart the salesman who thinks he can crack the market with claims of superior taste will be sorely disappointed i went to a vodka tasting hosted by the head of a prominent luxury liquor house it was an exercise meant to dispel the notion that the differences among vodkas are illusory but after being walked through the vodkas on the table with elaborate descriptions of the characteristics of each i found myself hard pressed to discern much difference so i asked the executive to demonstrate the differences by tasting the vodkas blind he couldnt even identify his own flagship brand eyeing the crowded premium vodka field mccormick decided to market its new vodka as the choice for those who care about the planet the bottle is made with a high proportion of recycled glass the recycled paper label is printed with soy and water inks the shipping boxes are designed to be reused and the vodka itself is made on an exceptionally efficient column still that captures all the carbon dioxide that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere this last claim is made possible because the contract distillery that makes vodka for mccormick mgp ingredients of atchison kan recently installed a new high tech still while mccormick is pushing the green credentials of its energy efficient vodka other brands are selling "organic" vodkas they also rely on the manufacturing skills of contract distilleries square one organic vodka is made by idahos distilled resources inc or drinc which does the manufacturing for more than a dozen brands among them is ocean vodka a hawaiian brand that takes drincs organic vodka in high proof bulk and cuts it with desalinated seawater another organic vodka positions itself as a colorado vodka but it too is a product of the idaho still an organic brand made from soy vodka also comes from that factory as does a brand called zygo zygo is one of a handful of "energy vodkas " including p i n k that spike alcohol with fashionable stimulants such as guarana and taurine if there has been a drink of the decade it is the clubbers red bull and vodka caffeinated vodkas obviate the need for stimulant packed red bull or amplify its hyperactive effect the clutter has left vodka marketers struggling to distinguish their products one of the most reliable strategies the celebrity tie in has proved problematic last spring svedka vodka was in talks with lindsay lohans management to sponsor her st birthday party at caesars palace and then the not quite ms lohan crashed her mercedes while under the influence the swedish brand sagely decided to opt out of the vegas festivities it has since focused its marketing efforts on a more reliable spokesmodel a naughty animatronic "fembot fatale" named "svedka grl " their slogan "the future of adult entertainment " nudity is the theme for christianias new campaign the norwegian brand hasnt abandoned its trademarked phrase "the worlds smoothest vodka " but its emphasis on dishabille shows just how hard it is for a vodka to get any traction in the muddy and crowded field christiania is sponsoring a nude art contest and invited fleshy submissions at its web site the winning entry will be flaunted on a downtown new york billboard a few days from now no doubt the marketing execs are counting on the publicity that will come should mrs grundy be sufficiently mortified to complain christiania it should be noted equates nudity with a highfalutin philosophy the company calls "purism " and what is that its not clear though christiana does offer a quote from albert camus "with integrity there is no need for rules " the next page on the web site however displays this bold heading "rules for submission " which i guess is as it should be given that the camus quote comes from an essay "the myth of sisyphus " extolling lifes inescapable absurdity for all the sexy come ons vodka isnt a very sexy product achieving the "purity" so essential to the spirit is almost impossible on an artisanal pot still making pure ethanol is what industrial stills do best which is why two of the other major players producing vodka in the u s are archer daniels midland and grain processing corp of muscatine iowa adm sells its proof beverage alcohol product code packaged one of three ways "bulk truck bulk rail tank " cut it with water preferably from a source that will lend itself to a pretty picture on the label bottle it and youre in the vodka business over at grain processing corp the "focus in producing ethyl alcohol is directed to the distilled spirits and beverage industries " but its web site brags that "this same high quality grain neutral spirit is used to produce a variety of proof and benzene free anhydrous industrial ethyl alcohol products " that is industrial solvents mouthwash hairspray astringents and such the serious cocktail crowd is turning away from vodka as too bland and too easy but drink it if you like its up to you whether you choose from the essentially interchangeable products on the basis of a brands boasts of superior quality its organic spud goodness its small carbon footprint or the gyrations of its fembot or if you cant decide just order product code email me at eric felten wsj com
