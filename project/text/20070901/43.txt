protecting property in big wind country regarding "before the next big one hits" by jay s fishman ceo of travelers editorial page aug i welcome mr fishman to the party that has been going on here in florida and elsewhere since andrew hit in its nice to see that he wants to have a high risk "coastal zone" to take the brunt of the premiums that he sees rolling his way and the rest of the private insurance industry of course after andrew we were all looking for a bit of leadership from the carriers but rather than sharing the risks over a wider area what we got was the very uncreative risk minimizing model where carriers set up subsidiaries on the state level to protect themselves from payouts if they could have driven the insurable risk universe to the county level they probably would have done that too mr fishmans piece is an attempt to head off the creation of a federal windstorm program which would cut out the private carriers from what they now see as a potentially lucrative piece of business if they can just jack the rates through the roof and have a "subsidiary" laid on while all of this happens the creation of such a regional pool or pools is not a new idea but the carriers shunned it for the longest time and now that it has some legs at the federal level we get letters like mr fishmans when the average joe finds out that while his local carriers rates are regulated by the state but that the same carrier has a captive re insurance arm that is not and can charge the local operating company anything it wants then something somewhere is out of whack kenneth orzel pompano beach fla as mr fishman so clearly reveals property casualty insurers are committed to finding creative and durable solutions based upon time tested private market principles to the ongoing coastal property insurance challenges in coastal areas one of the key principles that should guide a thoughtful search for solutions by policymakers is that our private property protection system has served our country exceptionally well for a long period of time with that in mind it should not be irretrievably compromised by the strong political pressures currently at play in some of our coastal states like florida and louisiana as a society we have to come to grips with the fact that someone has to pay for the costs of some of us living in dangerous areas managing that risk by requiring the private market through rate suppression to absorb its costs or by expecting taxpayers who dont live in dangerous areas to address it by providing large subsidies through government programs just wont work over the long run in our search for durable and principled solutions we have to balance the need to expand insurance availability with the imperative of ensuring risk based pricing for the trillions of dollars worth of coastal property stretching from maine to texas if we instead follow the path of least resistance today we will deeply regret it tomorrow marc racicot president american insurance association washington
