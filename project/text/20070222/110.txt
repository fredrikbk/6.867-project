the fatal history of misplaced faith sacred causes by michael burleigh harper collins pages &# although many observers predicted that religion would enter a pattern of terminal decline in the th century events took a different course religion not only revived but found expression in unexpected forms the theologian paul tillich noted the way in which people invested worldly things especially politics with transcendent meaning in a speech winston churchill described communism and nazism as "non god religions" that aimed to reignite old religious wars in "sacred causes " michael burleigh tracks the fate of religious and secular forces in the th century registering their collisions and their effects on the culture we live in today by undermining european stability mr burleigh notes world war i created a space for radical alternatives to the bourgeois norms that had gone before he shows how the protestant middle classes in germany for instance distanced themselves from their churches viewing traditional religious observance as the remnant of a discredited past science and culture along with militant nationalism filled the role that churches had once played and the pattern replicated itself beyond germany a traditional outlook gave way to cultural pessimism intensifying throughout the s in such a cultural atmosphere adolf hitler emerged as a prophet of neo paganism mr burleigh highlights the sheer weirdness of dropouts in germany who seized upon social disruption to make their fortunes playing to an apocalyptic mood and crying for a purifying upheaval once hitler took power the nazi party became a new civil religion marxist revolution marked a more direct challenge to the bourgeois order and traditional belief communism explicitly sought to destroy religion an enemy to the new society and enshrine itself as an alternative faith soviet leaders seized the property of the churches including consecrated objects and corrupted the church hierarchy by requiring political obeisance with its promethean faith in mans capacity for progress the communist party made itself into a secular church setting up its own "sacred" hierarchy and instituting its own rituals its opponents though were beyond redemption the th centurys political religions mr burleigh argues challenged the very existence of their god centered rivals and vicious anticlericalism often drove churches toward accommodation with brutal regimes but he reveals a more complex reality churches that held fast to christian teaching resisted corruption more effectively than their appeasing counterparts government reports on public opinion in the s showed that many german christians resisted nazism opposing state control some protestant theologians insisted that "the church must remain the church " international ties gave roman catholics a stronger position from which to resist mr burleigh defends the catholic response to nazism noting that recent attacks on pope pius xii and the churchs wartime role typically recycle anticlerical propaganda from the early cold war and owe more to current anger over church teaching than to the historical record the vatican he shows regarded both nazism and communism as alien ideologies opposed to christian morality it never saw nazism as a barrier to godless bolshevism encyclicals denounced nazi policies and more than a few prelates and pastors openly resisted them catholics denounced the holocaust and aided its victims those like slovakias father tiso who aided the nazis did so against vatican instructions tiso faced the humiliation of being required to read a pastoral letter from the pulpit condemning his own actions mr burleigh contrasts the orthodox hierarchys accommodating response to romanian anti semitism with catholic actions elsewhere to show what collaboration really meant germanys protestant hierarchy it should be said is much more open to criticism often showing a willingness to truckle to its nazi overlords and an eagerness to promote their racial views even so dietrich bonhoffer and martin niemoller provide examples of resistance noted at the time such opposition mr burleigh argues gave churches moral credibility in the aftermath of defeat after the war religion played a key role in stabilizing western europe christian democratic parties gave a structure to political activity that went beyond confessional boundaries they also helped to anchor italy and germany in the atlantic alliance communist repression strained the churches in eastern europe but eventually they survived as the only sphere for independent civil society rather than become fading anachronisms the churches challenged communist regimes especially when the material underpinnings of the soviet order eroded "we want god" became the opposition rallying cry in the s dialectical materialism offered a weak substitute for transcendent belief by the s mr burleigh argues consumerism in western europe and the u s had become a substitute faith the effect was the kind of debased popular culture that we are all familiar with but mr burleigh is more concerned about another postwar development he describes sectarian conflict in northern ireland as a portent for europes future in the s and s rival gangs in northern ireland seized the mantle of community leadership with appeals to atavistic religiously based quarrels violence and rhetoric borrowed from the civil rights movement led the state to withdraw from the province ceding authority to leaders who radicalized their communities religion became a marker for tribal identity in a struggle for power what might seem to be a mere local echo of conflicts from oliver cromwells day mr burleigh says has a current parallel in muslim ghettos across europe alienated youths find meaning in islam and governments leave such communities to their own devices allowing radical subcultures to grow the attacks of course brought political islam into focus for many who had not given the matter any thought before mr burleigh asks why no one questioned the implications of introducing large muslim populations into a secularizing west absolute tolerance mr burleigh believes makes western societies particularly vulnerable to those who play by other rules particularly when self doubt hobbles western leaders mr burleigh ends his fascinating chronicle by suggesting the new "sacred causes" are no less potent than the old ones a truly troubling thought mr hay is a historian at mississippi state university and the author of "the whig revival " see
