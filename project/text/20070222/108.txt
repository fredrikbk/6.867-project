the daily fix nfl combine kicks off in indy so better mind your ps and qs online edition the nfl combine has begun at the rca dome in indianapolis with more than draft eligible players undergoing medical physical and psychological tests under the eyes of nfl coaches and staff considering them before the april draft in the rocky mountain news jeff legwold offers a nice primer on the combine including why the expected top picks generally sit it out and what invitees have to endure would you look forward to seven consecutive physicals some of them involving five doctors at once neither would the fix one secret to success at the combine its manners saying please writing thank you notes and the like thats whats taught by ken herock a former nfl executive who now runs a mini charm school eight hours of teaching potential draft picks how to conduct themselves in interviews at the combine players tend to find mr herock impressive hes got the track record a former tight end for the oakland raiders cincinnati bengals and new england patriots he was a player personnel director for four teams after his on field days and ran the nfls first combine back in and as youll see when you read les carpenters article in the washington post hes tough and unsparing dont get mr herock started on maurice clarett "in a league climate where more than ever a players time in handcuffs matters more than his time in a shuttle drill character will have an impact on the draft " mr carpenter writes adding that "teams cant afford to make mistakes at the combine with many first impressions being made at the combine as teams interview prospects in the evening after workouts the right walk answer or handshake could send a candidate zooming up the draft board in a coachs mind " in the newark star ledger steve politi has entirely too much fun with the infamous wonderlic test noting that the first question a few years back was "is p m before or after midnight " punter pat mcinally whose harvard education presumably helped him with tricksy riddles like that one saw that and concluded things would be ok "he scored a the only perfect score in nfl history on the test which made most gms think he was too smart his stock plummeted in the draft " mr politi writes "so if you can understand what team officials are looking for well youre probably too smart too truth is they might not know vince young reportedly scored a then a on the test he was the top rookie in the nfl last year eli manning meanwhile scored a " mr politi then concocts some new more topical questions for the wonderlic at the end of february zack greinke a promising young pitcher for the kansas city royals left camp to deal with what the team called personal problems he returned in september and got a win in his final appearance of the year and now finally is willing to talk about what happened "it is time zack greinke believes to try to explain what plunged the royals most promising pitching prospect in more than a decade into such despair that he ran away from the game in hopes of saving his sanity and restoring his soul " bob dutton begins in the kansas city star adding that "right now greinke says hes comfortable that hes doing ok then he sketches a past that was anything but he tells how baseball made him so miserable that he nearly quit before his summons to the big leagues deceptive success as a rookie hid the demons that seized control in when his on field performance mirrored his private nightmare " chief illiniwek nee dan maloney has danced his final dance at the university of illinois controversy over the native american mascot will undoubtedly continue says mike downey of the chicago tribune but it shouldnt because illinois has much graver matters to attend to "if i were a university of illinois student alumnus or administrator i wouldnt worry why a guy who proudly wears an indian costume has danced his last dance " mr downey writes "i would worry why a guy who proudly wears a fighting illini basketball uniform would crash a car and then apparently leave a teammate for dead " what happened after year old jamar smith crashed into a tree earlier this month is just the first in a long list of things mr downey sees as wrongs needing righting at illinois from athlete misbehavior to allegations of recruiting violations "university of illinois students alumni and administrators are true to their school " he writes "it would be to their great credit to demand integrity on a matter far more substantial than a costumed symbols right to dance they need to call for a higher standard of behavior you want to pay tribute to a native american way of life fine act accordingly live by a code of honor take a stand " the volatile gary sheffield reported to spring training with the detroit tigers managed by the indomitable jim leyland which is just fine with sheff as he tells drew sharp of the detroit free press once of his prized possessions is a baseball card showing mr leyland then skipper of the florida marlins in the outfield with his arm around mr sheffield "i keep that card with me all the time " mr sheffield says "because i still appreciate that moment he was new there just like im the new guy here and he came out to the outfield where i was and walked around with me he took me aside and just plainly laid out what was expected of me " "leyland is sheffields yoda the wise patriarch who distinguishes the correct path to follow " mr sharp writes adding that "sheffield and leyland get along because they share the same direct approach ask them a pointed question and theyll give you a straight answer " the gyroball supposedly the handiwork of daisuke matsuzaka now of the boston red sox seems to defy characterization by sportswriters at least on this side of the pacific what is it descriptions vary is it real mr matsuzaka says he doesnt use it in games and can it change american baseball maybe the latest to try and take the gyroballs measure lee jenkins of the new york times who watched the man credited with inventing the pitch kazushi tezuka throw gyroballs at scottsdale stadium in arizona last week "tezuka used a standard fastball grip " mr jenkins writes "he went into a basic motion only at the end of his delivery did he deviate he turned the inside of his throwing arm away from his body and released the ball as if it were a football making it spiral toward home plate the pitch started on the same course as a changeup but it barely dipped it looked like a slider but it did not break the gyroball despite its zany name is supposed to stay perfectly straight " mr jenkins diagnosis "the gyroball is not going to revolutionize the sport like a four seam fastball a four seam gyroball is designed to surprise hitters with its speed like a changeup a two seam gyroball is designed to fool hitters with its slower pace " regardless when mr tezuka visited the texas rangers akinori otsuka who doesnt throw a gyro but says his nine year old son does he was approached by rangers pitchers who wanted to learn how to throw the mystery pitch if mr tezuka wants his creation to catch on the fix suggests a new name rather than discussing something that sounds like a spitter using souvlaki grease go back to the translation used in a book co written by mr tezuka call it the "demon miracle pitch " tip of the fix cap to reader garey g ris found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
