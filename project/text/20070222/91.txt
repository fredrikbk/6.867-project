politics &amp economics u s weighs extra steps on iran sanctions targeting guard corps may add pressure in nuclear debate washington amid signs of economic unease in iran the u s and its european partners are weighing another set of financial restrictions on tehran including the possibility of targeting companies run by the countrys elite revolutionary guard corps u s and european officials say that the move toward a second round of united nations sanctions which would likely involve freezing the overseas assets of certain iranian companies or individuals reflects their cautious optimism that sustained pressure on tehran might succeed in bringing the country to the negotiating table over its nuclear program international financial restrictions including a u n package in december have stirred significant debate within iran about the wisdom of confrontation with the outside world as the economy there begins to show signs of distress bush administration officials say they are also considering ways for the u s to ramp up pressure on its own if countries within the u n security council balk at sterner steps as is likely the administration is particularly keen to find ways to home in on the growing business operations of the revolutionary guard the countrys secretive paramilitary force also known as the irgc keeping up the pressure may not be easy of the five permanent members of the security council france britain and the u s are eager to push ahead on a second resolution and have already begun to consider some potential targets but china and above all russia are wary of pushing too hard "russia will control the pace of things going forward " said one u s official the december resolution gave iran a day ultimatum to freeze its uranium enrichment work or face stiffer economic sanctions the west alleges iran is pursuing nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear program iran insists it is developing an independent energy source the u n deadline lapsed yesterday without any signs of compromise from iran despite rising friction among various factions in iran over how to proceed on the nuclear front there are few suggestions so far that the iranian government plans to bend president mahmoud ahmadinejad said earlier this week that iran might be willing to suspend its uranium enrichment work if other countries did the same an offer the u s quickly rejected yesterday he said in a speech that the u s and others will not "thwart the will of the iranian nation to achieve the peaceful use of nuclear technology " still the combination of u n sanctions and more focused u s financial actions has already scared away some international business from iran and increased the cost for iran of conducting international trade recent u s moves to isolate iranian banks and companies from international financial circles have led several major european banks to cut off their operations in iran so far european trade with iran hasnt slumped substantially current and former u s officials say they are now focusing on how to combat the irgc which is seen as the power base behind mr ahmadinejads presidency and the central iranian player supporting militant islamist groups such as hezbollah and hamas the irgc is also central to tehrans pursuit of unconventional weaponry and it has increasingly taken a leading role in tehrans business activities particularly gaining concessions in lucrative oil and gas deposits u s officials say the december u n resolution singled out the financial assets of two of the irgcs top leaders major gen yahya rahim safavi and irgc air force chief gen hosein salimi it alleged that both are aiding irans pursuit of nuclear technologies and long range missiles some u s officials now want to expand these sanctions to target the financial assets of the irgc these officials argue that the listing of the two irgc leaders in the december resolution gives the international community legal grounds to try to freeze all irgc assets internationally the irgcs oil and gas investments are seen as particularly vulnerable because they often would involve foreign partners or foreign financing to succeed some u s officials believe many iranians would support sanctions against the irgc because the organization is gaining a greater hold over irans overall economy singling out the irgc "buttresses domestic criticism of the regimes cronyism and it pulls at the purse strings of the specific element of the iranian bureaucracy responsible for the regions most egregious behavior " said matthew levitt who served as the treasurys deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis until last month some u s and european officials working on iran said there isnt yet a consensus internationally or in washington to challenge the irgc directly others disagree over whether the u n mandate provides the legal grounds to try to freeze the irgcs assets while some u s diplomats worry that taking a confrontational stance against the irgc risks undermining continuing efforts to find a negotiated settlement over irans nuclear program a second u n sanctions resolution would most likely seek to expand the list of targeted iranian companies and individuals whose assets abroad would be frozen u s and european officials said the u s may try to include more irgc officials or even irgc companies on an expanded list although that debate has yet to begin among u n security council members which would need to approve any new sanctions on iran the december resolution demanded that countries freeze the assets of companies and organizations and individuals involved in irans nuclear and ballistic missile programs that list was the result of months of debate between the u s britain france and germany on one side and russia on the other china was less involved in the negotiations moscow in particular resisted the imposition of any restrictions that would take aim at irans economy generally or that would impede its continuing construction of a nuclear energy plant in iran
