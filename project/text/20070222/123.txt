would you like an aisle seat in your suv configuration of second row becomes big issue for drivers older children to the rear forget about fuel economy and four wheel drive many suv buyers are more concerned with getting an aisle seat for a while now families shopping for a sport utility vehicle have factored in seating arrangements in their buying decisions typically demanding a third row seat that boosts passenger capacity to at least six or seven but as consumers pursue a wider range of activities away from home from car pooling to soccer team chauffeuring they have become pickier about how those three rows are arranged more car buyers are looking for suvs with two seats or captains chairs in the second row with enough space between them to allow passengers to pass through to the third row its a feature that has long been available in minivans car makers are responding by turning out more vehicles that at least offer a pass through as an option consumers will see several suvs entering the market now or later this year including general motors corp s gmc acadia and toyota motor corp s redesigned toyota highlander have the aisle seat layout where previous models used a solid bench seat in the second row seating is one of many new considerations for car buyers as their needs call for more flexibility in how they use their vehicles also entering the equation are satellite navigation systems rear seat dvd entertainment and laser guided cruise control such features might have seemed far fetched a decade ago but are now available in mass market cars seemingly simple features like electric sliding doors on minivans and powered rear cargo hatches on suvs vans and a few luxury station wagons make life easier for parents whose arms are often so laden with groceries and children that they cant easily swing open a door the rise of the two seat second row is being driven by growing families particularly those with three young children and parents who want to cut travel time in part by speeding up loading and unloading a continued push toward fitting suvs with more upscale interiors has also helped increase the popularity of this type of seating arrangement which some buyers found more attractive the space between the second row seats also makes room for consoles and tray tables favored by other customers when daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz began selling its van like r class which was new for a feature that made it attractive was a second row console that could be removed to form an aisle in large families parents often wind up shuttling two children in large child safety seats while a third is large enough to use a simpler booster seat often the older child is able to fasten himself into the booster while the parent secures the other two typically an infant and a toddler parents say three row vans and suvs without the aisle such as the mercedes benz gl honda pilot and lexus gx all have full width bench seats require them to fold second row seats to give the third child access to the rearmost seat a time wasting and sometimes strenuous ritual for some buyers the number of suvs available with the pass through feature is lagging behind demand and the second row bench alone can be a deal breaker sophia spehar a montclair n j mother of three says she spent much of last year debating with her husband about the merits of different three row suvs her husband is a fan of high performance sports cars and liked suvs that promised sportier handling and crisp acceleration but mrs spehar cared more about everyday convenience than performance and insisted on a seating layout that included an aisle to the third row "it was most important to find an suv that had an easily accessible third row for a child in a booster while having two other car seats secured in the second row " she says the spehars finally settled earlier this month on a gmc yukon xl but said they would have liked to have had more choices a mercedes spokesman says the segment of buyers for whom the aisle specifically is important "is very small" and that the car makers r class comes with captains chairs in the second row still some survey data suggest the aisle has a rapidly growing following "right now its most important to in two segments growing young families and among older buyers " says art spinella of cnw research in bandon ore the percentage of three child families who say the aisle is important has more than doubled in the past year according to cnw survey data the third row seat joins a broad range of so called convenience features that have become selling points on vehicles but may not fit everyones needs sensors that chirp when a vehicle comes close to obstacles while backing up seems like a great safety features but many are so sensitive that they seem to sound off incessantly even when nothings really in the way so drivers ignore them or turn them off several vehicles have started offering rear mounted cameras for the same purpose but often the screen on the dashboard hesitates for several seconds before an image appears in that time most drivers have already backed out of their parking spaces the trend toward a wider range of options extends from the simplest items to advanced systems flip down dvd screens often protrude from the ceiling just enough for parents to bump their heads on them while leaning in to secure small children in their safety seats some powered rear cargo hatches move quickly and swing surprisingly far outward and can swat unsuspecting bystanders certain automatic sliding minivan doors dont operate well when someone unwittingly tries to open or close them manually meanwhile intricate technology like bmw ags i drive and similar systems from audi mercedes benz and others meant to centralize control of a vehicles stereo climate control navigation and other systems can in some cases puzzle users with layers of menus the result is a neat attractive interior with fewer buttons cluttering the dashboard but the driver may have to toggle and press a control knob several times to switch the radio from fm to am while makers of suvs have focused on making second row seats that fold out of the way with greater ease minivans have helped make the even simpler second row pass through popular manufacturers from chrysler to toyota have been offering captains chairs in the second row for years honda motor co s odyssey minivan has offered second row flexibility for years "we think the minivan is the best option for families who want flexibility and efficiency " a honda spokesman says "but we also know there are some buyers who will not go near a minivan " see related letter "letters to the editor suv and grandkids third row squeeze" wsj mar
