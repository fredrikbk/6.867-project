blind ambition genentechs big drug for eyes faces a rival intended for other use cheaper injection is one of its own products san francisco for some of her patients at risk of blindness retinal specialist anne fung injects the drug lucentis which costs nearly &# a shot for those who have less health coverage she offers a shot of another drug avastin that costs around &# the two drugs are both made by genentech inc they work similarly doctors say both can be effective in preventing or even reversing vision loss but only lucentis is approved by the food and drug administration to treat eye problems over the recommended two year course of monthly injections into the eye the bill for lucentis reaches nearly &# while medicare covers of the treatment cost for the elderly some patients must pay the rest themselves the lucentis avastin showdown has thrown the pharmaceutical world into a tizzy genentech fearful that a potential billion dollar a year product could be headed down the tubes is urging doctors to stick to lucentis and its proven efficacy in treating age related macular degeneration doctors are weighing benefit and cost and often choosing to roll the dice with avastin although it is approved only as a cancer treatment to ensure that less well off patients get treatment now the federal government is hoping to settle the dispute by funding a head to head comparison of the two biotechnology drugs the first such trial by the national institutes of health if avastin works as well as lucentis the governments medicare program for the elderly could save &# billion or more a year officials say the mutiny by doctors nationwide against a high priced drug and washingtons willingness to go to bat for them is triggering alarms in the drug industry "industry doesnt want an equivalency trial where there could be decisions on coverage they are terrified " says william l rich director of health policy at the american academy of ophthalmology which backs the nih trial some say the trial is the first step toward making the u s resemble britain there the government studies the cost of drugs versus their effectiveness and refuses to pay for those that fail to make the grade "its a backdoor to what the u k does " says anthony adamis chief scientific officer for a unit of osi pharmaceuticals inc that makes macugen a similar eye drug for genentech the worlds second largest biotechnology company by revenue after amgen inc the stakes are high lucentis was a surprise hit after its june launch logging &# million in sales on its first day and &# million in the second half of eric schmidt an analyst at cowen &amp co estimates the figure could reach &# million this year and rise to &# billion by genentech has refused to provide any funding or drugs for the nih trial scheduled to start in april the biotech industry organization says the nih should be studying cutting edge science not comparing two approved drugs genentechs head of business development joseph mccracken adds "if i were trying to decide how to spend nihs money i might not think this is the best way " age related macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss in people over age in the u s between million and million people have lost vision due to amd and some million are at risk "the prevalence of disease is going to increase as life expectancy increases " says frederick ferris clinical director of the national eye institute part of the nih "this all points to an epidemic of amd years from now " doctors are using lucentis and avastin to treat "wet amd " a type of the disease in which overgrowth of blood vessels and leakage of fluid cause gross swelling of the macula a part of the retina on a recent visit yevgeniya erlikh a year old russian immigrant stared stoically her eye numbed and propped open as dr fung in san francisco injected lucentis to try to save her sight "one two three finished " said dr fung scans showed mrs erlikhs fluid swollen retina returning to normal she now can see the big "e" on the eye chart from feet away avastin fights cancer by halting the growth of blood vessels that sustain tumors the fda approved it as a cancer treatment in more than a decade ago research suggested that taming vessel overgrowth might also be used to treat diseases of the eye but based on early tests in monkeys using a similarly sized molecule genentech thought the avastin molecule was too big to penetrate the retina its scientists spent two years re engineering it to create lucentis which then underwent seven years of testing later doctors would say that genentech was wrong to reject avastin for the retina so quickly but after the companys painstaking work to make lucentis it had little incentive to re evaluate avastin as an eye treatment in july genentech reported the results of a big phase iii study of lucentis before a hushed crowd of at a medical meeting in montreal the studies showed it halted blindness in of people with amd and improved vision in "there was an audible gasp " recalls george williams chairman of ophthalmology at the beaumont eye institute in royal oak mich lucentis "was so much better than anything else " previously the disease was treated with less effective drugs photodynamic therapy and lasers "like using a blowtorch to stop weeds " says dr fung in san francisco the only problem approval would take another year then came an apparent solution at the same meeting retinal specialist philip rosenfeld of miami presented a case of an eye patient who had been going blind and was injected with avastin the patients retinal scans dramatically improved a week after treatment and vision began to regain sharpness over six months "we got to rejoice for all of seconds " recalls genentechs charles semba the development leader for lucentis rather than wait until lucentis was approved by the fda many doctors grasped at the next best thing with the help of compounding pharmacists who siphoned tiny doses of avastin into small syringes eye doctors tried it in thousands of patients in large doses for cancer avastin costs &# a year the dose used in the eye costs just &# to &# "people thought we were cowboys but we were doing it in our patients interests " says robert avery an ophthalmologist in santa barbara calif "when people are going blind theyre willing to take risks " even after lucentis received fda approval last year many doctors stuck to avastin because a comparable lucentis injection costs &# "this is a public health issue " says dr rosenfeld of miami "i believe in profit but things are out of proportion " in december the fda sent a warning letter to one compounding pharmacy in new england saying the practice of splitting avastin doses carries a risk of contamination and other problems the fda said it may seek an injunction to stop that pharmacy from splitting avastin if it doesnt fix problems l d king executive director of the international academy of compounding pharmacists says he considers the letter "overreaching" and part of a broader crackdown on compounding pharmacists though he knows of no other moves involving avastin so far last month the american society of retina specialists found in a survey that doctors preferred avastin over lucentis to for their medicare patients even when patients had supplemental insurance policies that covered the patients cost the margin was to genentech argues lucentis is the only product shown to safely restore vision and avastin remains unproven as an eye treatment "ive seen anecdotal reports theyre impressive but theyre still single case reports " says susan desmond hellmann the companys president of product development she cites the mom test "if my mom had amd id want her to get the drug that is safe and effective " retired san francisco businessman h william jansen recently took his fourth injection of lucentis and minutes later confidently took the wheel of his silver jaguar "i think weve got this thing on the run " says his doctor h richard mcdonald who is a consultant to genentech but has publicly questioned lucentiss price others swear by avastin harry ulmer an year old retired mechanic on a fixed income in bakersfield calif says he can play gin rummy and drive his toyota thanks to the drug "avastin does the job and it is priced right " says mr ulmer a patient of dr avery in santa barbara genentech in justifying the cost of lucentis says its trials of the drug included more than patients who received vision tests retinal scans and monthly doctor checkups it was "one of the more expensive clinical trials weve run " says ronald park team leader for pricing he notes that older drugs for amd cost nearly &# a dose without improving vision lucentis "is a breakthrough drug for a very bad disease " says dr park the company also reasons that lucentis could prevent disability falls broken hips and depression associated with blindness the elderly blind "become more dependent on those they love to drive get food help around the house until youve seen someone who was independent go blind and ive treated these folks you dont understand how terrible this can be " dr park says the american academy of ophthalmology this month said blindness costs the health care system more than &# billion a year including nursing home care finally genentech says it is happy to help those who cant afford lucentis since lucentiss approval last summer patients have called the companys assistance programs asking about the drug a spokeswoman says the scientist who made the discovery behind both the avastin and lucentis programs is napoleone ferrara after medical school at the university of catania in sicily dr ferrara came to the university of california san francisco to study how blood vessels feed tumor growth there he got interested in a growth factor for vessels joining genentech in dr ferrara and colleagues reported they had isolated the vessel stimulant vegf or vascular endothelial growth factor later they sequenced the gene for vegf and worked on protein molecules called monoclonal antibodies that block it that led to avastin in addition to the monkey studies that suggested avastin molecules couldnt reach the retina there were other reasons genentech didnt push the drug hard as an eye treatment avastin was designed for cancer patients who need the drug to stick around in their bodies to do its work although that could raise the risk of cardiovascular problems associated with avastin it was worth it for cancer patients facing a terminal disease for elderly people with eye disease genentech wanted a drug that would home in on the retina do its work and quickly get eliminated from the body the drug it found lucentis binds times better to vegf in retinal cells and is safer dr ferrara says "this isnt avastin jr " insists dr semba the lucentis development leader but some specialists say the two drugs despite their differences might be equally effective dr avery who has a research appointment at the university of california santa barbara decided in to do the kind of study genentech had long ago lost interest in performing he and israeli colleague anat loewenstein injected avastin into rabbits eyes the conclusion says dr avery "hey this does get through the retina " they published the findings in the journal retina in february moreover in a safety challenge to genentech dr fung in san francisco teamed up with dr rosenfeld in miami devising an internet survey to seek swift reports of serious side effects from avastin in a snapshot of more than eye patients on avastin their survey found four strokes including one death in a person with risk factors an unsurprising rate for older people the doctors reported in the british journal of ophthalmology in november lucentis itself may raise stroke risk in late january genentech sent out a "dear doctor" letter noting that patients taking the recommended dose of lucentis had a higher rate of strokes than patients taking a smaller dose with billions of dollars at stake and medical questions unanswered the national eye institute plans to start a two year trial in may or june to compare safety and efficacy of avastin versus lucentis while the nih has previously run tests comparing newer brand name drugs against older and cheaper generics this is the first time it is pitting two brand name biotech drugs against each other dr ferris the eye institutes clinical director says the government has no choice but to conduct the study because it needs to ensure that the widespread use of avastin is safe daniel martin chair of ophthalmology at emory university school of medicine is leading the nih trial and has selected test sites for it he offers his own mom test "if i were treating your mom youd want me to know which drug is better " he says "and if theyre equal why not use the less expensive one " however funding for the trial remains uncertain in part because the government has to purchase all of its lucentis and avastin supplies the eye institute says it cant afford to fund the trial on its own and is seeking help from medicare barry straube chief medical officer of the center for medicare and medicaid services says he welcomes the trial as a guide for reimbursement policy but lawyers for the agency have said it lacks legal authority to use the medicare trust fund for such research expenses dr martin says the nih has awarded &# million for the trial and hell seek additional funds elsewhere if needed officials at the center which administers medicare project that lucentis could over time cost taxpayers more than &# billion a year and possibly as much as &# billion annually dr straube says he would be pleased if that figure can be reduced "not only are we interested in preserving the medicare trust fund but were sensitive to the higher co insurance payment medicare beneficiaries would have to pay " he says genentech says some of the projections of the medicare impact are too high noting analysts estimates that this years total sales will fall short of &# billion for the moment the companys data suggest lucentis has captured about of the amd market with avastin taking much of the rest that "unique situation " executive vice president ian clark recently told analysts "will challenge our rate of growth of lucentis in "
