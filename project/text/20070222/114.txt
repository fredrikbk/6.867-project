the story of photography as told on both coasts new york and los angeles once or twice a year the museum of modern art revises the story of photography with a rehanging of its peerless collection in the blueprint for the expanded building that reopened in five of the photography departments six galleries were set aside for the display of its selections from its vast holdings while one gallery showcases more fleeting exhibitions this might not be worth noting were moma not the only place in the country where tickets to such a whirlwind history tour the daguerreotype to cindy sherman and beyond are always on sale though museums nationwide over the past years have devoted increased resources to art made with a camera only moma has committed prime real estate to surveying more than years of photography the boundaries of which it redraws on a periodic basis the museums unique position in the world of art derives as much from its mission to present a coherent and discriminating view of history as it does from its warehouses of expensive objects whos in and whos out of the canon which obscure portraitist has emerged from storage why did the curators end their chronology with this unfashionable s artist such questions lead critics and photographers to monitor subtle changes in the permanent galleries with a weather eye the department has no icons on the magnitude of van goghs "starry night" or picassos "les demoiselles davignon " whose absence from the walls in the painting galleries might have the public demanding a refund of the &# entrance fee but the absence of crowd pleasing masterworks in photography allows its curators uncommon leeway when they reshuffle the deck the nearly prints in this latest interpretation organized by associate curator sarah hermanson meister will hang for the next four months it is not as bracing as the version that went up last summer no unfamiliar names from photographys early years are submitted for reconsideration and the first half of the th century features too many of the museums darlings helen levitts pictures from the s of children at play in the streets of new york spread across a wall in the third gallery have been so widely celebrated of late they are in danger of being loved to death ms meister has better luck in finding new contexts for old favorites she wittily revivifies william bells portrait of an arizona boulder by mounting it next to william henry jacksons view of pikes peak from inside the garden of the gods in colorado side by side the rock in the same shape as the cave entrance they could be an academic exercise in positive and negative space another unexpected pleasure is bill brandts "east end morning " a portrait of a young london woman in a shadowy doorway her bucket near her bended knees its an unusually tender print from a photographer best known for harsh contrasts roy decaravas blurry close up of a bed from is as dark and soft as sleep the actors in a color ad for kodak are so inflated with bliss about their product they seem about to explode enrique metinides is a previously unseen name at moma his grainy black and white news shot of a half dead man lying on a mexico city street after being hit by a stray electric cable has affinities with weegees new york disasters as well as the s urban turmoil witnessed by manuel alvarez bravo a countryman of mr metinides john harding and stephen milanowski are unheralded artists given a chance to catch the publics eye with a single image each mr hardings picture of a crowded urban bus stop abuts mr milanowskis of a staged confrontation between a tow truck driver and a police officer photographers still tend to divide between an unposed documentary or a fabricated studio approach and this pair of images both taken in the early s nicely illustrates the problems of making sharp distinctions between the two styles moma has not usually had to compete for this sort of contemporary material with the j paul getty museum the getty the wealthiest art institution in the world has been an uncertain player in the art photography market since when it stunned curators and dealers by announcing that it had secretly bought up six major international photograph collections the prints they bought were mainly th century and early modernist whats more for the first years of its existence the getty photographs department had an unusual policy it did not collect post photographs the founding curator weston naef argued that the period was too inchoate to judge which artists were major figures and thus whose work they should amass in quantity their preferred archival method this rigid line visibly slackened in with "william eggleston and the color tradition " a large exhibition of post photographs by the influential southerner and his scattered artistic progeny and the fences are down for good with "the way we live " the group show about the american social landscape that opened in october and runs through sunday it inaugurates the museums new center for photographs in the west pavilion high ceiling galleries that more than quadruple the departments exhibition space to from square feet a majority of the nearly prints selected by curators judith keller and anne lamotte from a gift of donated to the museum by nancy and bruce berman a los angeles couple are in color they date from the early s to many were taken by documentary photographers who have shown at moma doug dubois mary kocol sheron rupp but have not yet established widespread commercial reputations given the gettys former aversion to contemporary reality in photography the pictures here of suburban housing developments trash in the streets of rust belt slums latino churches shacks in rural alabama and the california desert people commuting to work in their cars or waiting for the next chapter of their lives to begin dont yet look at home in these spacious halls the work is nonetheless of a high order the burnished gray tones in george tices photographs of new jersey lend a somber elegance to its barber shops and gas stations mitch epstein has documented his fathers failing business in mount holyoke mass in grim detail that neither sugarcoats nor exploits the rituals of backyard gardeners have probably never been so carefully notated as by ms rupp mr eggleston again emerges as a tireless investigator of the everyday no one alive has his poets eye for the simple thing a wool ski sweater on a dryer top or a chevrolets rear axle chained to a telephone pole that triggers buried memories and sums up an american era the handsome page accompanying book is typical of the getty museum which despite the history of problems at the getty trust and within the antiquities department has been a model of generosity in preserving its shows in scholarly catalogs opening its photographs collections to researchers and lending to other institutions so why have repeated trips to architect richard meiers palace in the hills never quieted my sense shared by many since the getty opened in of unrealized potential commendable exhibitions like "where we live" only exaggerate the emptiness of a building that awaits its fulfillment with art as majestic as the setting cultural weightlessness is a distinguishing feature of los angeles it is a source of the citys artistic freedom and at the same time a bedeviling stereotype loyalists have hoped the getty might serve as a magnetizing source of civic pride and force easterners to retract their sneering view of the place as a disordered set of clogged freeways "nineteen suburbs in search of a megalopolis " in the words of h l mencken a history of photography as a permanent attraction at the museum could add needed and appropriate gravitas in an arts capital that more than any other was built on images filtered through the camera the getty now has the room to provide a complete view of photography to rival momas all it lacks now is the nerve mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
