politics &amp economics politics meets intelligence at trial libby case feeds calls for study on use of findings washington as jurors began deliberating the fate of i lewis "scooter" libby one outcome of his perjury trial seemed clear the case has added fuel to calls for a broader examination of how intelligence was used in political arguments in the past six years moreover some current and former administration officials say the trials airing of the use of intelligence especially over the iraq war threatens to further undermine confidence in american claims on other sensitive matters that could be a particular problem in the u s campaign to convince the world to curb irans nuclear program the libby trial which focused on efforts to leak classified information to the press comes amid revived debate over intelligence in the newly democratic congress senate and house democrats are pursuing new inquiries after a recent defense department inspector generals report criticized the pre war pentagon intelligence program run by former defense undersecretary douglas j feith already the senate intelligence committee has requested documents and interview transcripts from the inspector generals office while the senate armed services committee seeks further interviews with mr libby the former chief of staff for vice president dick cheney and national security adviser stephen hadley "the bottom line is that the intelligence relating to the iraq al qaeda relationship was manipulated by high ranking officials in the department of defense to support the administrations decision to invade iraq " committee chairman carl levin d mich said at a recent hearing the libby trial put an especially bright spotlight on the debate yesterday a jury of eight women and four men began weighing a month of testimony from witnesses in a case that began as a probe into the outing of former central intelligence agency operative valerie plame and three years later ended up focusing on the trustworthiness of recall and the semantics of lying in court special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald told jurors that mr libby deliberately lied to federal bureau of investigation agents and a grand jury to try to cover up the administrations efforts to respond to criticism of the iraq war in response mr libbys attorneys highlighted "mis recollections" by a number of prosecution witness including several reporters to bolster their argument that mr libby didnt lie but simply had faulty memory when he made erroneous statements to investigators the roots of the libby case lie in a debate over use of intelligence in the buildup to the iraq war it began when ms plames husband former u s ambassador joseph wilson complained publicly that the bush administration had misused or ignored intelligence he gathered that cast doubt on iraqs alleged efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction mr wilson in july went public with his story of taking a cia sponsored trip to africa to check out claims of connections to iraqs weapons program in interviews and in an opinion article he called into question mr bushs use of since discreditedintelligence that alleged iraq sought weapons materials in the african nation of niger in retaliation prosecutors say mr libby and other officials sought to disclose ms plames identity to reporters making the argument that her intelligence job was the only reason mr wilson looked into iraqs weapons efforts in the first place the administration subsequently backed off the niger claim however mr libby told the grand jury in the case that he continued trying to leak selective portions of intelligence reports to journalists in order to portray the niger iraq link as true under orders from mr cheney administration officials complain that mr wilson was the one misusing his role in the intelligence process by talking publicly about his findings in any case the trial has provided congressional intelligence officials with extensive information on how the vice presidents office functioned semi autonomously in pushing foreign policy initiatives these officials said the information could prove helpful in continuing investigations into how public statements made by the president and vice president differed from the underlying intelligence provided by the cia and other intelligence agencies richard ben veniste former democratic counsel to the senate whitewater committee and head of the watergate special prosecutors office says the trial has served "to reveal the inner workings of the vice presidents office and particularly the willingness to declassify information to assist in the damage control effort that appeared to be entirely political in nature " meanwhile the pentagon report said that as mr feith assembled his intelligence reports highlighting in particular alleged links between iraq and al qaeda terrorists his office briefed four key officials mr libby among them the report said the pentagon office presented its findings to the white house as a conclusive intelligence assessment though the cia strongly opposed those findings mr feith has complained bitterly that the report and the congressional response to it distorts what was a legitimate effort to raise questions about intelligence conclusions not to distort them the latest controversies come as the administration faces challenges from foreign governments and u s lawmakers skeptical of its recent claims that tehran is supplying shiite militias in iraq with munitions and arms critics accuse the white house of mimicking the tactics used in building the case for war against iraq in and administration officials voice exasperation over the response saying u s intelligence agencies have developed extensive evidence of irans involvement in iraq they also say that changes in the intelligence community since the iraq war have significantly improved u s intelligence "its frustrating for the entire process " says one intelligence official working on iran "the whole message is being challenged "
