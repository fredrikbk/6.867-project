bill would punish retailers for leaks of personal data boston in a move that could set a precedent for other states lawmakers in massachusetts are about to consider a bill that would require retailers to pay for losses when hackers and thieves breach their security systems to steal consumers credit card and other financial information right now banks generally get stuck with credit card fraud losses which last year totaled more than &# billion if passed the massachusetts bill a first of its kind would make any company be it retailer bank or data processor financially liable if it is operator of the system that is hacked the bill doesnt cover other types of credit card fraud such as those perpetrated by means of a lost or stolen card more than states have data breach and consumer protection laws but they are relatively tame merely requiring companies to warn consumers of possible theft when their computer systems have been breached the massachusetts bill sponsored by rep michael a costello goes one step further it would mandate that companies whose security systems are breached assume full financial responsibility for any fraud related losses costs associated with the canceling and reissuing of cards and in cases of identity theft the freezing of accounts and credit information the bill would apply to any company doing business in massachusetts wherever it may be based massachusetts rep barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee said yesterday that he believes congress also will pursue data security legislation that would require the entity responsible for a breach to bear the costs incurred from customer notification and card reissuance he also favors a "national trigger" for notification about such a breach retailers would be the main target of the massachusetts bill since their network security systems are "at best patchwork " says rep costello as things stand he says merchants have little incentive to protect consumer data since the credit card issuing banks are the ones that currently pick up the tab "we need to put the retailer on the hook " mr costello says banks which have had to bear a vast majority of the costs incurred by breaches already have instituted an assortment of computer security systems including encryption to thwart computer thieves the massachusetts bill is being considered at a time when computer data theft has commanded much public attention just this past weekend officials of the stop &amp shop supermarket chain reported that credit and debit card information belonging to certain customers recently was stolen by high tech thieves who tampered with the grocers keypad machines stop &amp shop based in quincy mass is a unit of ahold nv of the netherlands last month tjx cos based in framingham mass reported that hackers had gained access to the financial records of its consumers by breaking into its computer systems at first the exposure was thought to be limited to customers who had done business with the off price retailer in and part of last year but the company said yesterday that the hacking was more extensive than previously reported including security breaches of customer data in and as a result millions of credit and debit cards were exposed the breach was followed by a rash of fraudulent charges to the checking and debit accounts of tjx customers some by criminals as far away as hong kong and sweden to blunt the widespread pilfering banks and credit unions had to cancel hundreds of thousands of credit cards belonging to tjx shoppers for their part retailers argue that they already are paying dearly for potential fraud through whats known as an interchange fee a charge assessed by the bank and credit card company for each transaction that roughly equals &# for every &# retail purchase typically the credit card issuing bank receives to of the fee with the credit card company receiving the rest the nilson report an industry newsletter reported that last year the card industry processed more than &# trillion in consumer transactions and rang up nearly &# billion in fees amounting to &# billion to &# billion for card issuing banks "fraud is part of the reason why those fees are becoming outrageously high " says jon b hurst president of a member massachusetts retailers association which opposes the state bill credit card companies last year imposed an additional &# billion in fines on merchants failing to comply with security standards a liability law instituted by the government "would only be a pyramiding of fees " says mr hurst he further says that retailers may never be able to stop computer hacking criminals "these breaches are the work of sophisticated criminals who are always one step ahead of the technology " mr hurst says javelin strategy &amp research inc a publisher of banking and other financial reports in pleasanton ca which conducts an annual survey of u s households on identity and credit card fraud estimates that banks suffered losses of approximately &# billion over the past two years in data breach related activity among those who would benefit the most from a statutory law

security breach in at bjs wholesale club inc in natick mass the pennsylvania state employees credit union asked a federal court to order the retailer to pay &# the financial institutions tab to cancel and reissue visa credit cards but a federal judge threw out the case arguing that the credit union wasnt a party to a private contract between visa international inc bjs and its processing bank fifth third corp which outlines who is liable for fraud two other banks td banknorth inc of portland me andsovereign bank of philadelphia also sued and lost their case against bjs on similar grounds some of the private contracts do require retailers to reimburse the credit card issuing bank for losses when financial data of customers are breached and their cards are compromised but banks say that the recovery process is so cumbersome that it is nearly impossible for them to recover their full losses mastercard inc has had such written agreements for years and visa usa inc began incorporating a similar policy late last year "under that process banks end up recovering &# a card on average " says bruce spitzer spokesman for the massachusetts bankers association card replacement costs range from &# to &# per card "thats why were pushing for a state law " he says visa says under its new process banks should be able to recoup their losses in about seven months massachusetts legislators says that representatives from the banks retailers and credit card companies have made their respective positions known in private meetings with them in recent weeks a bill introduced during the last legislative session forcing retailers to disclose breaches didnt go very far its failure was partly due to competing motions including a time consuming health bill but proponents are more confident about the outlook of the current massachusetts proposal which has backing both in the house and senate the states attorney generals office also is taking an active role advocating legislative changes to address the data breach problem massachusettss new attorney general martha coakley herself a victim of credit card fraud earlier this year is leading a civil investigation involving as many as
