a dangerous partnership financial pressure by the u s and other western governments in recent weeks is beginning to have a real impact chilling investment into irans energy sector and ratcheting up the costs of the regimes atomic effort but these gains are in danger of being erased thanks to the growing economic partnership between tehran and beijing in late december chinas third largest national energy conglomerate the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc signed a memorandum of understanding to develop irans massive north pars natural gas field under the prospective deal worth a whopping &# billion cnooc would cooperate with the national iranian oil company to develop and liquefy the fields estimated trillion cubic feet of natural gas at around the same time another chinese firm petrochina inked a deal to annually import some three million tons of liquefied natural gas from iran over a quarter century petrochinas parent company the china national petroleum corporation cnpc has followed suit finalizing a &# billion project to explore and exploit irans south pars gas field in the process beijing has put the bush administration on the horns of a major policy dilemma the first part of the problem is practical cnooc is a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange so is petrochina as such both potentially are subject to the provisions of the iran libya sanctions act ilsa which is intended to curb irans "ability to support acts of international terrorism and to fund the development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them " it does so by authorizing the white house to impose a number of concrete economic penalties from prohibitions on large scale u s bank loans to restrictions on the procurement of goods on foreign corporations engaged in commerce in the u s which also do more than &# million annually in business with tehran the message of the law as written by congress was clear you can trade with us or with iran but not with both but when it comes to china the situation is not so simple cnooc petrochina and cnpc are not just private entities they are appendages of the chinese communist party and de facto instruments of its foreign policy the application of sanctions against them therefore would be tantamount to an act of economic warfare and the bush administration has little stomach for a trade war or worse with china the second issue is strategic already other foreign multinationals have begun to take their cues from beijing royal dutch shell has along with spains repsol just concluded a preliminary agreement with the iranian regime worth an estimated &# billion for the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant and port terminal in the islamic republic malaysias l meanwhile recently signed a deal worth nearly &# billion to build a refinery in irans khuzestan province needless to say these deals have struck a body blow to the recent progress made by washington in isolating the islamic republic financially reversing this trend is bound to be an uphill battle over the past decade ilsa has been honored entirely in the breach with the u s consistently failing to apply its provisions to foreign violators the one time that it came even remotely close to doing so was in against russias gazprom frances totalfinaelf and malaysias petronas but the clinton administration ultimately chose to waive ilsa provisions in the spirit of international cooperation and as a sop to the new "reformist" government in tehran that decision became the model for subsequent violations by companies such as italys eni canadas sheer energy and norways statoil each time washingtons calculus has been the same bilateral trade over international security this is a major miscalculation bilateral sanctions are a critical tool in the u s economic arsenal by actively enforcing such measures policy makers in washington have the ability to hammer home the point that trade with an increasingly intransigent iranian regime is not cost free and to force irans trading partners to choose between doing business with tehran and conducting commerce with the u s at the end of the day chinas economic interests are understandable runaway economic growth has brought with it a voracious appetite for energy and iran has emerged as one of chinas largest oil suppliers as a result policy makers in beijing have studiously avoided making a choice on irans nuclear program even as they provide the iranian regime with the economic tools to accelerate it the failure of the bush administration to take beijing to task however is far less comprehensible u s policy must be geared toward making china and its economic fellow travelers aware of the gravity of the unfolding iranian nuclear crisis and providing them with the political rationale to make the right choices about partnership with tehran raising the costs for china to do business in the islamic republic seems like a very good place to start mr berman vice president for policy at the american foreign policy council is the author of "tehran rising irans challenge to the united states" rowman
