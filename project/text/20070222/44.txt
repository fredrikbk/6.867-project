fashion journal the red carpet runway how designers woo stars to wear their creations the mascara ms miller wore when all eyes are on best actor nominee forest whitaker at sundays oscars at least one pair of eyes will be staring not at his face but at his long torso menswear designer arnold brant is hoping that mr whitakers bulky physique might be the charm that launches the canadian mr brant as the new armani in hopes that mr whitaker might wear one of his suits under the klieg lights mr brant has sent a half dozen to the actors stylist but hes also hedging his bets which is why traci young spent a recent weekend at a so called luxury lounge at the four seasons here manning a table laden with arnold brant jackets scarves and ties as mr brants vice president of marketing ms young has the job of fishing for more celebrities a list b or c "were making our investment in hollywood " she said this weekend we approach the finish line of the hollywood awards season a months long marathon of critics choice peoples choice golden globe screen actors guild grammy and so on and so forth awards and of course the oscars which have been distracting designers this week just as theyre sending models down milan runways to sell their fall collections planes from milans malpensa to lax are packed with fashion folk jetting from the runway to the red carpet hollywood is an important element in the fashion food chain feeding expensive clothing to the masses with the help of magazines and television shows whose coverage of red carpet events amounts to free advertising bigger fashion designers have set up shop permanently in los angeles employing "entertainment relations" people some of whom specialize in red carpet wear designers start building relationships with hollywood stylists months before the awards shows begin then offer goodies to nominees and presenters in hopes that theyll not only wear them but also mention the designers name this has its risks one sympathizes with the jewelry designer whose bracelet on the arm of a giddy starlet was held to a golden globes tv camera interviewer ryan seacrest dutifully asked the name of the designer to which the ingenue replied "sophia sophia umm sophia umm " in the days prior to an awards show splendid los angeles hotels take on the aspect of moroccan souks at luxury lounges all over town invitees may pick up anything from jewels from the platinum guild to homeopathic drugs no success is too trivial to trumpet loreal paris announced that actress sienna miller attended the golden globes in loreal paris voluminous mascara it seems no one has been left out of this freebie binge at least thats what i thought until i watched several men exit the platinum guild lounge loath to leave empty handed they took what was available thong panties silk scarves and zebra striped handbags poor guys many male actors attend award shows in their own tuxedos and that arnold brants ms young told me is a big opportunity for menswear designers for award shows this season mr brant has been giving out soft dinner jackets of blended cashmere and mink and even a supple velvet jacket made partly of bamboo fibers these are no small gift priced generally just under &# his thing is "modern luxury" a phrase intended to suggest that his label is more ashton kutcher than clint eastwood without hollywoods help the year old mr brant has been selling &# million a year of his canadian made clothes but his label was purchased recently by apparel giant oxford industries inc with a new goal in mind &# million in annual sales runway shows like those recently concluded in new york and now under way in milan are expensive and less effective at garnering buzz than red carpets ms young says so they started out late last summer hiring hollywood publicists who know a celebrity from a has been they flew out to los angeles every few weeks to court stylists to the stars they met brad pitts stylist and mr whitakers leisel "q" quamie this paid off in the early rounds when mr whitaker wore a long arnold brant dinner jacket with thin vivid blue stripes to the gq men of the year awards in november that was cause for celebration mr whitaker is a strong contender for a best actor oscar for "the last king of scotland " in december mr whitakers stylist asked for five more arnold brant outfits this led to high hopes among the designers staff that the actor might wear one to a bigger award show like the golden globes or the oscars ms young set up camp for the golden globes at the hbo luxury lounge at the four seasons hotel she spent three days manning her folding table while her publicist helped identify targets worthy of their largess ms young was loaded for bear among suits and dozens of shirts ties and cashmere scarves she included a size long cashmere mink jacket "because thats a man with a good body " her bet paid off when terrence howard who was in the movies "crash" and "ray " walked out with the jacket for the screen actors guild awards kevin dillon from hbos "entourage " left in a regular which he promised to wear to a party that weekend "you just spread the name of arnold brant and ill dress you " ms young told a young actor from "heroes " her catch of the day was adam beach a perfect regular who recently joined "law &amp order svu " "i presume hell be the next thing to be talked about " ms young said hopefully mr whitaker dealt them a disappointment he wore an arnold brant to a few lesser events but for the golden globes he settled on a domenico vacca couture shawl collar tuxedo in midnight blue while actors are famous for changing their designer of choice at the last minute as of yesterday mr whitakers stylist said hed be wearing domenico vacca again on sunday mr brant lamented a lack of resources in his assault on tinsel town "if i could marry the overhead of armani with my product " he said "wed be plastered all over hollywood " ray a smith contributed to
