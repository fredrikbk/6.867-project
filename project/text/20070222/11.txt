bank of america plans nationwide push major marketing shift follows acquisitions spending to jump having established itself as the only truly nationwide bank through a string of acquisitions in recent years bank of america is now taking steps to become more of a national advertiser it plans a sharp increase in ad spending this year with its first new ad campaign since hoping to catch up to bigger spending rivals such as citigroup and j p morgan chase bank of america will begin advertising regularly on prime time television rather than relying on cable spots in targeted markets as it has in the past it also plans new magazine newspaper billboard and online ads as part of the campaign which kicks off during sundays academy awards broadcast on abc the bank plans to adopt a new tagline "bank of opportunity " replacing the four year old slogan "higher standards " a marketing blitz will follow including street teams in red barista aprons passing out "wake up to opportunity" coffee gift cards on monday in the banks biggest markets including new york boston and los angeles the new campaign reflects a major shift in marketing strategy for bank of america when its last significant marketing push launched in it was a large regional player serving million households national tv ads didnt make sense particularly as the bank didnt have a presence in the northeast one of the costliest media markets in the country today its a different story after expanding into the northeast with the acquisition of fleetboston financial bank of america serves million households making it by far the biggest retail bank by both deposits and number of branches acquiring mbna last year also made it the biggest u s credit card issuer in terms of market value bank of america is no after citigroup its rivals have long spent much more heavily on advertising for the first nine months of last year bank of america spent &# million compared with citigroups &# million according to tns media intelligence even the no bank by market value j p morgan chase spent more at the same time spending by banks on advertising has been growing faster than most other industries according to tns bank of america says it expects to spend as much or more on advertising this year as its top rivals and more than it spent last year much of it on prime time tv it will maintain the same overall marketing budget as last year &# billion but make up the difference by spending far less on direct mail solicitations for credit cards which are now sold largely through its branches the campaign underscores the companys strategic need to squeeze more business from existing customers while it has grown through acquisition in the past bank of america is now pressed up against a regulatory cap that bars any u s bank from an acquisition that would give it more than of the nations total bank deposits that means the company must court new customers and persuade existing customers with checking accounts to apply for credit cards and small businesses with equipment loans to use payroll services for instance thats where the new tagline comes in chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis says the old slogan built pride and helped knit together disparate cultures of acquired banks but had begun to give customers the unintended impression that the bank prized employees and internal controls above all "we were coming to the realization that higher standards was more about how we did things than about the customer " mr lewis said in an interview the bank acknowledges it has hit a plateau in improving customer satisfaction scores after years of seeing them rise and is hoping that a new marketing campaign can rejuvenate its image with that in mind some of the new ads promote unique programs the bank has introduced one highlights "keep the change " a program in which the bank rounds up any debit card purchase to the nearest dollar and deposits the difference in a customers savings account in the ad a man covered head to toe in silver paint wanders city streets collecting change when he buys coffee then silver sunglasses and a silver tie the silver man then takes his place as a street performer as a voiceover describes him as someone who understands how loose change can add up "weve infused a little humor warmth and humanity " said susan smith ellis an executive vice president of omnicom group who supervises the bank of america business the new campaign represents the first strategically significant marketing effort for bank of america since it moved its ad business to omnicom from interpublic group in after an intensely competitive account review the costly campaign is also an early test for anne m finucane who was tapped last year to oversee marketing communications governmental affairs and philanthropy for the company ms finucane previously worked with ms ellis at interpublic groups hill holliday agency winning the account signaled a change in strategy for omnicom unlike most other big marketers bank of america keeps nearly all its marketing work traditional advertising media buying public relations and sports marketing at the one ad concern and while rivals such as wpp often try to coordinate holdings to go after large accounts omnicom typically lets its individual agencies compete for business on their own to woo bank of america however omnicom put together a multiagency team coordinated by ms ellis a corporate level executive in january bank of america shifted marketing duties for its global wealth and investment management business to hill holliday from omnicoms doremus agency ms finucane says the shift was made because that particular business is different from the rest of the banks marketing activities and that hill holliday will still coordinate with omnicom she says she is happy with the current business setup and doesnt anticipate major changes
