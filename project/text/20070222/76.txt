nokias marriage to small computers still has its problems if apple can make a cellphone can nokia make a computer yes sort of the convergence of the computer and consumer electronics businesses including the mobile phone business is accelerating apple dropped the word "computer" from its corporate name last month and announced its new iphone big screen cellphone to ship in june hewlett packard quietly announced its first real mobile phone last week smart phone makers palm and research in motion are really hybrids of cellphone and computer companies meanwhile traditional mobile phone makers like motorola nokia and samsung have all turned out smart phones which are in effect little computers with the ability to handle email multimedia web browsing and more nokia long the leading mobile phone company has been pursuing an even more radical project a hand held computer that isnt a cellphone at all it has just brought out the latest version of this product the &# n internet tablet and ive been testing it the n is part of a long term strategy by nokia to evolve into a company thats more a maker of small multimedia devices with connectivity rather than primarily a maker of phones the n is an overhauled version of the i reviewed last year that model priced at &# was so underpowered as to be almost useless the new one is speedier more powerful thinner and lighter albeit a bit longer like the the n is designed to connect to the internet via a wi fi wireless network though it can use a cellphone as a modem like the it uses a touch screen and virtual keyboard the new model has some nice features the lacked like a pop out video camera and the ability to make voice calls over the internet it can take two standard memory cards rather than the one oddball card the accepted like the it does a far better job of browsing the web than any smart phone on the market today the screen like the s is huge inches diagonally and with a stunning resolution of x significantly larger and sharper than the much touted iphone screen but like the the new n is a good example of how hard it is for a company that grew up in one business to migrate successfully to another i cant imagine many people carrying around this device for one thing the n is a tweener smaller than a laptop but too big for a pocket its inches long inches wide and inch thick it weighs ounces the iphone is smaller and lighter more importantly the ns software seems unpolished and unfinished theres no calendar application no method for synchronizing data from a pc no software for using the camera to record videos or snap still pictures though nokia says thats coming and theres no simple way to use the camera for video conferencing with a pc unless you get somebody else to download a special nokia program the company hopes to solve this later with a skype program for the device you can make a video call to another n nokia is hoping that open source developers will help polish the ns software and add functions this is an idealistic goal and has won the hearts of some techies but mainstream consumers expect complete functions on the device out of the box third party software is a great thing but it isnt a substitute for strong software from the manufacturer still the n does some things well web browsing is a pleasure because pages render much like they do on a real pc and you can see a much larger portion of each page than you can on a typical phone even a windows mobile or palm model handy buttons on the top of the nokia make this even better by zooming in or out on the web page or instantly hiding the navigation controls so the page can claim the whole screen instant messaging also worked well although the only prominent service bundled with the n is google talk i also successfully made and received internet voice calls via google talk these were clear and easy though they dont fully compensate for the lack of a built in cellphone an rss feed reader which sucked in headlines from various web sites was also good as was the photo viewing program the email program is fair if pretty bare bones and sometimes slow blackberry addicts are unlikely to accept the onscreen keyboard in place of a real one some attachments such as pictures or pdf files open easily but word documents never even showed up in my tests we wont know until june whether apple has been able to successfully invade nokias turf and make a decent cellphone but so far nokia is struggling to go the other way email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
