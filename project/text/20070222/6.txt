ahead of the tape why investors still get caught in subprime trap novastar financial is the latest player in the "subprime" mortgage market to catch investors off guard but by now one has to wonder why investors keep getting surprised by subprime turmoil like other subprime lenders novastar financial specializes in making mortgage loans to the least creditworthy borrowers the company reported a loss of &# million for the fourth quarter and said its considering shedding its status as a real estate investment trust meaning its large dividend could be at risk investors responded by knocking the shares of the kansas city mo company down yesterday it seems hardly shocking now last week resmae mortgage said it was filing for bankruptcy protection accredited home lenders holding reported a steep loss and the week before new century financial another subprime lending reit warned of a fourth quarter loss and said it would restate results for the first three quarters of of course its easy to say novastar was an accident waiting to happen after the accident occurred but one might think the recent subprime carnage would have tipped investors off this is where a little investor psychology comes in handy novastar has been a battleground stock maybe bulls on the company accustomed to bear attacks were susceptible to something known as confirmation bias they heard only the good news they believed and ignored the bad another possibility is investors misread the market thinking the bad news was already priced in this can happen when investors dont feel they have adequate information "if i think everyone thinks its ok then i think its ok " says wharton professor justin wolfers investors also have a tendency to avoid selling loser stocks even before yesterday novastar shares were down on the year and they were well below their peak hanging on to such a stock "might not be the proper financial choice but its an emotionally appealing one " says terry odean professor at the university of california berkeley psychologists call it loss aversion it also suggests there may be more grim realizations to come on the subprime shakeout numbers may suggest chances of broader fallout the bigger question on subprime mortgages is whether the shakeout is a broad threat to the economy that depends in part on the size of the subprime market and the answer isnt always clear federal reserve governor susan bies said in a speech that subprime adjustable rate mortgages originated in the past to months account for to of total mortgages outstanding the sector is troubled but it is just a "sliver" of the broader mortgage market her figures based on staff analysis of first american loanperformance data are a subset of the overall subprime business shes not including fixed rate subprime mortgages in her calculation inside mortgage finance a trade publication has a bigger number taking adjustable and fixed rate mortgages together subprimes account for of all mortgages outstanding or &# trillion out of &# trillion as of the third quarter if youre worried about the worst case scenario it might make sense to look at the bigger number scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
