even now big miners dig away despite commodity price fall firms spend billions to expand prices for some of the worlds commodities have slipped in recent months but big mining companies continue to pump up investment and make plans to carve out more mines moves that could bring prices down further in the years ahead anglo australian giants bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto plc and other megaminers collectively have projects valued at tens of billions of dollars in the works among them are large expansions in production of iron ore coal nickel and other raw materials whose prices have soared in recent years amid demand from china and elsewhere the spending spree could mark a turnaround in the past mining companies touted their desire to move slowly in adding supplies mining executives have said they wanted more time to gauge the strength and durability of chinas economic boom those executives remembered past busts when mining companies moved too quickly to approve projects leading to a glut of metals now after several years of hefty profits shareholders are pressuring mining companies to show they have projects in the pipeline to sustain growth over the next decade at the same time banks and other providers of capital are becoming more comfortable financing mining ventures including higher risk projects developed by lesser known "junior" companies these include outfits like nautilus minerals inc a vancouver british columbia company that said it has raised &# million for a project to mine gold and copper from the ocean floor near papua new guinea with backing from several major mining houses "it almost seems at the moment if you have a piece of paper that has an outline for a project you can" get money said mark tyler head of mining and resources at nedbank group ltd a south african bank some metals prices have continued to climb in recent months but others such as copper and zinc have dropped copper topped &# a metric ton in may a high since then it has fallen more than in part because of concerns of a weakening u s housing market and slightly slower growth world wide also some speculators have opted to exit from the market because they fear the global commodity boom may have peaked mining executives as well as many industry analysts believe the full slate of new projects wont bring mineral prices down to their historic averages soon they cite the continued growth of the chinese economy which expanded in executives also point to shortages of workers and specialized equipment as well as the long lead times and generally higher costs involved in starting new mines a u s economy that is expanding more robustly than expected could reverse the recent downward trend in some commodity prices such as copper many analysts predict that prices for copper zinc and other metals will rebound in the second half "the industrys ability to turn intentions into physical production remains constrained by access to new large ore bodies and the scarcity of equipment and skills around the world " paul skinner rio tintos chairman said in a presentation to investors this month those constraints "will continue in " he said it also is possible big companies will cancel some expansion plans especially if commodity prices fall further other projects may be delayed for any number of reasons and past predictions of excess supply have proved wrong still the rush to develop new mines should at least ease some of the supply shortages that have helped drive prices upward in recent years analysts dont expect prices to return to the levels of a few years ago but new supplies will increase the odds that prices decline somewhat over the next several years if demand cools more than expected the declines could be steeper the international monetary fund last year projected prices for aluminum and copper would fall and respectively by in large part because of new production capacity still the imf noted profits from new mines are much greater today than in the past even after a recent surge in construction costs giving miners added incentive to rush projects into development access economics an australian consulting firm that follows natural resources likewise predicted long term declines in commodity prices in a report released in december its survey of world wide commodity price forecasters found analysts expected all but three of raw materials including alumina to decline in value between now and june the biggest price declines were projected for cobalt lead nickel and zinc all of which were expected to fall by more than while iron ore gold and platinum were expected to see somewhat smaller declines demand is likely to remain robust but "it strongly remains our view that increased supply will come " bringing prices back to earth said chris richardson director of access economics "people can make so much money everyone is out there digging with spoons " bhp billiton the worlds largest mining company by market capitalization is among the leading investors with some &# billion of projects in various stages of development an increase of nearly from months ago anglo american plc of london has &# billion in projects under way or under consideration while rio tinto has more than &# billion in projects some of which are in what it calls the "advanced study phase " among rios efforts an australian project that could boost iron ore capacity to as much as million metric tons a year from a little more than million in western mining companies arent the only ones turning over more dirt in china local miners are ramping up production of iron ore and other commodities as a means of reducing reliance on overseas producers russias oao rusal whose aluminum output rivals u s giant alcoa inc said it plans to double production in the coming years with more than &# billion in investments by nowhere is the spending surge more evident than in australia one of the worlds most resource rich nations and a supplier of raw materials to china the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics said capital spending in australias mining industry topped &# billion in the year ended june a record and higher than the year before the figure was more than double the average annual expenditure for the past years other parts of the world could see similar record investment after collapsing in the late s world wide minerals exploration spending in rocketed to an all time high of &# billion in part because of a flood of capital heading into smaller companies as those companies succeed in identifying more mineral deposits bigger companies will have more opportunities for growth especially in higher risk regions such as africa there is always a lag in the development of new supplies during a resource boom and this time has been no different said mr tyler at nedbank sooner or later "there will be new production coming online " he said "and lots of it "
