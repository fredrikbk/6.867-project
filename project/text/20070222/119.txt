urban withdrawal a retreat from big cities hurts rotc recruiting though army seeks more ethnic officers it shuns northeast queens n y the rotc program at st johns university here seems perfectly placed for an army thats desperate for officers who are bilingual and comfortable in foreign lands about of the students speak second languages including turkish korean mandarin hindi albanian and gujarati "i had never even heard of gujarati until i learned i had a cadet who spoke it " says lt col timothy walter who heads the program but instead of being hailed as a model for the armys future the st johns reserve officer training corps program is a lonely outpost of diversity in the past few decades the army has pulled its officer training and recruiting programs out of the northeast and big ethnically diverse urban centers choosing to concentrate on campuses in the south and midwest there is no army rotc program in the detroit area with its large middle class muslim population and only one in miami and chicago in new york city which produced more than military officers a year in the s and early s the two remaining rotc programs last year yielded army officers in contrast alabama which has a student population that is about one fourth the size of the state of new york has rotc programs that last year produced army officers the south generates about of all army officers according to pentagon statistics an officers background didnt matter so much when the u s was focused on fighting big armies in large conventional battles these days though u s success in places like iraq and afghanistan hinges on the ability of army officers to win the trust of a suspicious and often culturally alien population officers must court sheiks and warlords and work closely with indigenous security forces at a time when the country is growing more and more diverse the army is struggling to build an officer corps that takes full advantage of americas multiethnic society there are only about muslims in a force of about soldiers arabic speakers are in critically short supply throughout the force say senior army officials even in those cities like new york where the army maintains rotc it is undermanned and culturally out of synch with the people it is trying to recruit "weve been very shortsighted " says retired gen jack keane who served as the armys vice chief of staff until he retired in "we have leaders in the army who are uncomfortable in big urban areas they feel awkward there " the armys retreat from urban areas has complex roots from antimilitary sentiment in big cities in the wake of the vietnam war to simple economics urban rotc programs have generally produced fewer cadets and are considered poorer investments than programs at large campuses in the south internal army studies say the best rotc candidates are students whose parents have served in the military and enjoy physical activity "they may have rafted canoed rock climbed or sky dived " an internal army report states prime candidates also have served in leadership positions at school rotc which is open to full time college students produces officers who are the professional and intellectual core of the army the program graduates about officers a year and supplies two thirds of the armys officer corps cadets must attend classes at least twice a week and work out in the mornings three times a week the other officers come from west point which produces about graduates a year and the armys officer candidate school at fort benning ga rotc graduates typically agree to serve eight years in the military after they graduate the time can either be spent on active duty or in the reserves to prepare soldiers better for dealing with local populations the army has added language and cultural awareness classes at west point for example cadets in the social sciences department spend three days each year in jersey city n j a city of about that includes large numbers of muslims hindus and egyptian coptic christians the west point cadets meet with local political and religious leaders they spend the night in a mosque meet with the imam there and observe evening and morning prayers during their last trip they were treated to a homemade feast from hindu egyptian and coptic christian communities "the goal is to help cadets understand how a big diverse ethnic population works " says maj stephanie ahern who oversees the trip but when it comes to recruiting officers from jersey city the army has taken a pass it closed its only two rotc programs in jersey city in the mid s because they werent producing many officers the armys shift south began in the late s at a time when anger over the war in vietnam was prevalent on many northeastern campuses at some high profile schools like harvard yale and columbia disagreements between the military and school administrators drove rotc off campus many small southern schools actively courted the military by setting aside new buildings for rotc programs as the army shrunk after the cold war it also shuttered large numbers of bases in the northeast and relocated troops to sprawling facilities in the south and midwest which were far from population centers and offered big training ranges as a result urban students today have far less exposure to the military making them harder and more costly to recruit and retain in rotc programs "we want to produce an officer corps that is fully reflective of the rich ethnicity and cultural diversity of our country " says maj gen montague winfield who oversees the armys rotc programs nationwide but he says the army must also focus its money and personnel on areas that are likely to produce the largest number of high quality officers at the least cost to taxpayers last year cadet command which oversees training and recruitment of rotc officers came up officers short of its goal of producing second lieutenants this year the command will get about &# million for scholarships to bring in more cadets twice what it received in but it wont get additional officers and sergeants to expand programs to more campuses in urban markets "we are in a resource constrained environment " says gen winfield no place shows the shortcomings and the potential of urban rotc programs better than new york created after world war ii rotc was a big presence on campuses throughout new york city the city college of new york for example swelled with more than cadets in the s making it among the largest in america its most famous graduate is gen colin powell in the early s the army began to leave the city from to the army closed rotc programs in the northeast and opened new programs in the south in the early s when the army was downsizing at the end of the cold war it closed more programs including its remaining programs in manhattan and brooklyn for many army officers and senior sergeants today new york is an alien place master sgt darrel jolley got his papers sending him to teach at st johns university while he was in iraq the official army order listed his assignment as "jamaica queens " "i thought i was going to the island of jamaica " he says when he found out he was going to new york the year old sergeant says he tried to get out of the assignment he failed driving through brooklyn and queens sgt jolley said he was initially taken aback by the clamor and the large number of people who looked as if they recently arrived from the middle east "there were times when i felt like i was back in iraq there were people dressed in those man dresses that they wear in iraq the women had veils i know i shouldnt say this but it made me want to look for ieds " he says referring to improvised explosive devices it wasnt just the city that felt foreign the rotc students were also different many spoke with heavy accents and struggled with their english about half of the cadets were female a big change from fort bragg in fayetteville n c where he served in all male units standing before his first class sgt jolley says he felt compelled to preemptively apologize for anything he might say to offend the students three years into his st johns assignment where he teaches courses in military science sgt jolley has formed strong bonds with his cadets among those with whom he has formed closest ties is yesim yaktubay a year old junior who attends st johns on a rotc scholarship ms yaktubay who migrated to the u s at age from turkey says she was drawn to rotc because she needed money for school and wanted to travel her father works as a carpenter in queens and her mother is a homemaker her parents initially tried to talk her out of joining the military and remain troubled by the iraq war she says "they are from the middle east they have family over there and they were worried the war would spread to turkey " she says her mother "kept saying i was going to get hurt or killed " ms yaktubay says like many of the st johns cadets ms yaktubay says she has her doubts about the wisdom of the war but "i support our troops " as one of a handful of muslims in the st johns program ms yaktubay says she frequently finds herself answering sgt jolley and her fellow cadets questions about islamic culture the questions range from mundane queries about dietary laws to more serious ones about the role of jihad in the religion ms yaktubay says she hopes her background growing up as an immigrant and a muslim will make her a better officer she plans to go into military intelligence "i think it will help me understand people better particularly their cultural differences and their background " she says initially ms yaktubay had her doubts about sgt jolley a broad shouldered infantry soldier from western pennsylvania "we all expected him to be meaner and really push us " she says although her grades are strong ms yaktubay struggled with the army physical fitness test sgt jolley skipped lunch and took extra time in the evenings to help her and other recruits cut their time in the mile run "he has become like a second dad to me " she says jessica jurj came to the u s from romania at age and attends john jay college of criminal justice part of the city university of new york system in manhattan she struggled with her grades her freshman and sophomore years because she was working as much as hours a week to support herself today she is one of the leaders of the fordham rotc program in the bronx her teacher lt col randy powell who runs the program recalls how several years ago he took the unit he was leading to an exercise with the bulgarian military "i was unprepared for the level of poverty " he says "having jurj on my staff would have been a huge help " the two remaining new york city programs at st johns and fordham are both fragile cadets often have long commutes involving buses and trains to reach them ms jurj says she has to get up at a m to make it from queens to her a m mandatory saturday rotc class at fordham on days when she sleeps late she has to pay &# in cab fare without aggressive leadership the programs can also quickly falter in the rotc program at fordham university in the bronx was producing about five officers a year and was on the verge of being shut down the officers who ran the program rarely left the fordham campus to recruit cadets today it yields about officers a year a key player in the turnaround is maj mike hoblin a fordham rotc grad and native new yorker who was assigned to the program at its low ebb shortly after he arrived maj hoblin began offering rotc classes at fordhams campus in lincoln center easing the commute for students who attend colleges in manhattan such as columbia and new york university today the fordham program has nine cadets from nyu up from none in but maj hoblin also looked beyond the elite campuses he focused attention on john jay and city college of new york two of some schools in the student cuny system at the time the cuny system was producing virtually no rotc candidates he started attending career days and built relationships with professors and administrators who had connections to the military today about of the cadets attending the rotc program based at fordham are from cuny schools even as he was expanding the fordham program maj hoblin says he was struck by the missed opportunities in new york particularly on the immigrant heavy cuny campuses where there is no rotc presence "i have always found that first generation immigrants in new york city are eager to serve " he says
