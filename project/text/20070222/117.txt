virginia tax half penny here half penny there soon become millions in response to stephen moores feb editorial page commentary "tax chambers " let me offer a few observations on behalf of the virginia chamber of commerce in we endorsed a half penny increase to the state sales tax which when enacted that year raised the rate from to the half penny was the key ingredient to &# billion in additional revenues for education public safety and healthcare while keeping virginias sales tax rate well below the national average and having no negative impact on our regional competitiveness the resulting revenues are improving the quality of life for millions of virginians in the virginia business community rallied behind two regional referenda designed to produce funds dedicated to transportation infrastructure improvements by raising the sales tax a half penny in the washington d c suburbs of northern virginia and a full penny in hampton roads norfolk virginia beach the referenda supported by regional chambers and my own failed in both regions largely because of a lack of trust that the money would be spent as designed by policymakers in richmond nevertheless the notion that chambers generated &# million in support of the referenda is beyond comprehension the virginia chamber for example generated none now in virginia finds itself with a long developing and severe need for additional transportation infrastructure an area that has not been treated fiscally since legislation crafted by the republican majority would address the matter in a substantial way by use of bonds surpluses certain fee increases and tapping of the general fund but without any statewide tax increase virginias need for &# billion a year in transportation funding for the foreseeable future is well documented and generally accepted by all vested parties there are elements of this proposal that we like and some we dont nevertheless we are hopeful that this package or one very much like it will emerge this year finally and perhaps most egregiously the allegation that chambers in virginia are recruiting candidates to run against fiscal conservatives is balderdash we have neither the capability the funds nor the motivation to pursue such a course it is ironic that what is happening in virginia is that in certain districts candidates are being recruited to oppose republican legislators that voted for the half penny three years ago virginia has recently been cited by multiple sources as the number one state in the nation for business that ranking is underscored by our high per capita income and extremely low unemployment rate our attractiveness as a business location extends to businesses of all sizes and economic sectors we are proud of that distinction and equally proud of the role of the virginia chamber of commerce and the local and regional chambers in our commonwealth in achieving it hugh d keogh president &amp ceo virginia chamber of commerce richmond va see related letters "letters to the editor tax getting stiffed a little at a time" wsj mar
