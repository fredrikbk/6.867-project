when neighbors become rivals rochesters xerox kodak are moving into each others turf for most of their years of coexistence as the two biggest companies in rochester n y xerox corp and eastman kodak co have been friendly neighbors avoiding poaching on each others territory xerox copiers ruled the office kodak film owned the consumer but digital convergence and financial travails are increasingly turning the two imaging companies into rivals in a sign of the growing competitiveness xerox today plans to announce a deal with fuji photo film co kodaks longtime nemesis in traditional film to put high quality xerox printers into retailers photo minilabs the devices will let consumers create calendars greeting cards and photo books at store kiosks rather than going online to web sites like kodakgallery com the enhanced machines may also lure some retailers from using kodak made photo kiosks one of the companys most successful businesses xerox and kodak are already competing to sell color digital presses to commercial printers a market that xerox now leads and that kodak entered through a string of acquisitions beginning three years ago both regard the commercial printing industry as a key strategic market accounting for one quarter or more of their revenue but their product overlap remains limited the new competition illustrates how rapidly changing technology can force companies to challenge corporations that once moved in parallel universes telephone carriers and cable television companies are now battling it out while cellphone makers will soon compete with apple inc for a mobile music market once dominated by sony corp s walkman xerox and kodak both owe their fortunes to products that place images on media xerox whose roots and biggest plants are in rochester though its headquarters is in stamford conn ruled the office market with copiers that fused toner to paper kodak which long ago abandoned its copier business has built a consumer brand selling film and photo finishing services but the digital revolution hit both companies hard first inkjet printers slashed demand for xerox copiers then digital cameras devastated kodaks film business xerox skirted bankruptcy in before beginning a painful turnaround kodak is still in the midst of a restructuring that will see world wide employment cut to by the end of this year from a peak of in many ways each company is a shadow of its former self xerox stock which hit a high of &# in closed yesterday at &# a share kodaks high was &# in yesterday it closed at &# a share in a search for new markets the companies have adapted their technology to digital color printing in the hope that growing sales of ink and toner will provide the kind of recurring revenue that black toner used to give xerox and film once gave kodak "increasingly the two will be facing off " says matt troy an analyst with citigroup who follows the imaging market as the rivalry heats up it "will be a battle of the titans" in rochester says frank romano professor emeritus of printing at rochester institute of technology the population of the upstate new york city currently has been shrinking because of layoffs at kodak and xerox keeping secrets from each other is difficult because "people go back and forth routinely " mr romano says "its hard to get talented people to move to rochester " to be sure the two companies face even stiffer competition from hewlett packard co and canon inc which are much larger and more profitable and boast bigger research and development budgets the biggest battleground for xerox and kodak is selling to commercial printers a big but deeply troubled industry mr troy of citigroup says "there are commercial printers and theyre going bankrupt at a rate of over a year with profit margins of to its a dismal business " even though traditional offset printing is stagnant digital color printing of customized catalogs and brochures is growing rapidly so kodak and xerox are

slower digital presses used in print shops quincy allen president of xeroxs production systems group says that last year xerox captured &# billion out of what it views as an &# billion market for digital presses and printing supplies he says that his goal is to capture a large portion of the &# billion color market now handled by aging offset presses "our page volume would dwarf nexpress or indigo in terms of pages produced " he adds kodak has long sold ink film and other supplies to printers since it has gone heavily into debt spending &# billion to broaden its printing portfolio and enter the digital printing market jeffrey hayzlett chief marketing officer for kodak graphic communications says that most print shops already buy kodak supplies for their offset presses giving kodak an entree to sell its high end presses "were the only ones playing in both the conventional and the digital side " he says "weve been in this print business for over years weve seen a lot of competitors come and go " today analysts say xeroxs broad portfolio of digital printers gives it an advantage for example cash strapped printers that want to enter the digital press business at a lower price point can buy its docucolor line for less than &# but mr romano says he expects kodak will soon start to resell some cheaper digital presses made by canon mr hayzlett declines to comment on that but says kodak will announce an expanded line in april xeroxs new deal with fuji takes it into the heart of kodaks traditional business consumer photo printing kodak has installed some photo kiosks where photographers can make prints in retail stores around the world it also sells home photo printers and offers online photo printing and overnight lab photofinishing fuji which divided up the snapshot market with kodak in the film days provides digital prints only through retailers building on its success with one hour photo labs at wal mart stores inc and walgreen co that has proved
