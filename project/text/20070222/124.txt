what chrysler could add to gm bargaining leverage car lines would increase but costs are an obstacle general motors corp is flirting with the idea of acquiring daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group but it would face massive challenges if it were to take over its longtime rival both gm and chrysler have excess manufacturing capacity in north america more u s dealers than they need and enormous and rising health care bills for union workers and retirees for gm a purchase of chrysler "makes no sense to me " said peter nesvold an auto industry analyst at bear stearns cos a potential gm chrysler alliance has drawn intense scrutiny since daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche last week said that "all options are open" for its u s arm and after subsequent reports of gms interest speculation over potential buyers has also included private equity investors as well as other auto makers interested in staking a claim to the massive u s market but any chrysler buyer also would inherit the troubles plaguing detroit and gm already has its share david cole president of the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich said a gm takeover of chrysler "would be a stretch " in a feb report goldman sachs group inc called the idea "illogical " nevertheless people familiar with the matter said gm has had discussions about buying chrysler and hasnt ruled out the idea the two companies also are considering working together under a less intensive relationship in a few specific areas such as sport utility vehicles and minivans these people said gm has made progress in the past year on streamlining its global operations and cutting costs an effort that could be knocked off course if management has to focus on integrating and righting an unprofitable operation such as chrysler said mr nesvold "right now gms objective is to make its business less complex not more complex " he said analysts say gm could gain advantages from buying chrysler a purchase would eliminate a direct competitor from gms biggest market chryslers jeep brand could be a nice complement to gms hummer chrysler is also strong in minivans a segment gm has left a deal might also give gm the additional leverage to negotiate health care cuts with the united auto workers union both gm and chrysler are obligated to set aside billions of dollars to pay for pensions and health care coverage for workers retirees and their dependents by taking over chrysler and threatening to close chrysler plants gm might be able to push the union to accept cuts that would lower the health care liabilities "thats the one big carrot i can see " mr cole said a uaw spokesman declined to comment but the unions president ron gettelfinger told detroit radio station wjr yesterday that he had "no opinion" on a potential gm takeover of chrysler he discounted reports of a potential deal saying "ive talked to a lot of people a lot of people about this and its pure speculation right now " he added "it may end up that its not sold who knows " analysts say the cost and difficulty of putting gm and chrysler together would outweigh any savings on those costs a legacy of past labor agreements gm has auto assembly plants in north america and is closing five but chrysler would add to the fold chrysler plans to close one in newark del gm has eight brands too many according to many critics and chrysler would add three the gm and chrysler product lines overlap in many areas and both derive much of their profit from pickup trucks "for anyone who has a nice truck portfolio and is looking to build car brands chrysler would not make sense " said rich kwas vice president of equity research at wachovia securities because of this concentration a gm chrysler combination would almost certainly face intense regulatory scrutiny eric selle a credit analyst at j p morgan chase &amp co told investors on a conference call tuesday that a deal would delay a realization of savings in gms global organization he said the deal would make sense to gm only if the price were right and the company could get a quick return on its investment in the past few months mr nesvold noted gm has touted its growth in overseas markets such as china and russia but buying chrysler "would make them even more concentrated in north america " he said paring the combined dealer networks of chrysler and gm would probably prove highly expensive gm has u s dealers chrysler would give it more at a recent conference sponsored by j d power &amp associates in las vegas troy clarke president of gm north america said gm is trimming the ranks of its dealers as part of a strategy to consolidate buick pontiac and gmc into a single sales channel mr clarke indicated it is unlikely gm would try to slash its dealer ranks rapidly through some sort of buyout "we know exactly how much that costs " mr clarke said alluding to gms &# billion shutdown of the oldsmobile brand "where we need to put our money is product " last week daimlerchrysler reported fourth quarter earnings fell because of a million euros &# million loss by chrysler the company has hired j p morgan to explore options for chrysler including selling all or part of the division partners renault sa and nissan motor co have said they arent interested in buying or partnering with chrysler as has south koreas hyundai motor co
