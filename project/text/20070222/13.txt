burberry branded its unfortunate that about workers will lose their jobs next month with the closing of a small clothing factory in the south of wales but whats unusual is that this closing has elicited protests from as far away as las vegas new york and the alsace because the plant is operated by burberry the protesters who include celebrities tom jones and emma thompson appear to concede that theres no economic rationale for burberry to keep making a quarter of its knit polo shirts in wales when the rest are already stitched less expensively in asia theirs is a more ahem high brow appeal that a company that relies heavily on its status as a symbol of "britishness" ought not to dilute its brand by shifting more production from the british isles give the workers union and celebrities points for creativity if not persuasiveness their claim on burberrys britishness rests largely on emotion and presumably on the idea that the united kingdom is home to a superior breed of tailors and seamstresses but thats plainly not true judging by its sales a burberry shirt made in asia still meets the high standards of a discerning englishman just as a mercedes built in alabama can represent fine german engineering "made in china" is not now a byword for "cheap quality " if it ever was if there is a notion of britishness that has a certain cachet with consumers it stems from the nations cosmopolitanism its openness to and even embrace of the world beyond the english channel this liberal spirit has made britain one of the big winners from globalization that bodes well in the long run even for those who lose jobs with burberry or any other company
