homeowners builders tackle water scarcity low use communities spring up around country encouraged by new technologies epa program landscaping au naturel now that many home builders have embraced "green" design and begun using energy saving materials developers and government regulators are focusing on another environmental concern saving water so called low water use communities neighborhoods that use new technologies to save water are springing up from california to the carolinas two new communities by kb home in riverside calif feature standard water saving devices like low flow toilets as well as irrigation systems that sense moisture and dont over water and natural landscaping that requires a minimum amount of water crescent communities in raleigh n c has put a number of water saving features into recent projects including the use of mulch or native prairie grass instead of traditional lawns and focus property group in las vegas has three new projects under way in the area that both minimize yard size and use similar high tech sprinklers that water according to local weather patterns the company is even using faux grass in two of its projects the projects come as local water supplies around the country are becoming more burdened by drought and development and as homeowners are becoming more environmentally conscious at the same time the federal government and local communities are promoting water saving residential design the environmental protection agency last year launched a new program dubbed watersense to encourage water efficient landscaping and products saving water is also a way for builders to earn points toward green building certification which will be available for homes through the u s green building council in july many municipalities facing water shortages are beginning to act too earlier this month florida water officials declared that the everglades water body a source that supplies more than million gallons a day could no longer support additional demand and cities like fort lauderdale and miami must explore alternate sources to meet future water needs in austin texas city officials are looking at long term water capacity and will soon vote on proposals that would ban midday lawn watering and require builders to choose from a variety of low water use grasses "communities around the country are recognizing the importance of water efficiency "says benjamin grumbles assistant administrator for water with the environmental protection agency "were going from the green wave to the blue wave " advances in low water technologies are also making the approach more appealing for homeowners while low water landscaping has been around for decades especially in dry environments it has moved beyond merely cactus and gravel the latest in irrigation systems allows for maximum water savings and a wider availability and variety of low water plants and even fake turf can better create lush looking yards with less water meanwhile the latest in low flow toilets promise more water savings minus the need for multiple flushes developers are finding that including low water features can help them more easily secure building permits they also are using the features to differentiate themselves in a slowing housing market and to market their projects to environmentally conscious buyers kb home for example tells buyers they can save as much as on their water bills bill flanigan a security consultant from vienna va recently bought property in the hidden lake development by crescent communities outside of wake forest n c he and his wife were drawn to the location and the communitys green features "we were impressed by the idea of low water landscape use " he says he hopes the communitys detailed covenants on what can and cannot be planted maintain the natural feel of the place without proving too onerous for homeowners "its a bit of a mixed blessing " he says the epas new watersense program aims to encourage water conservation among manufacturers consumers and developers the program similar to the governments energy savings incentive program energy star this year began offering certification for landscape and irrigation professionals that ensure they use water efficient standards according to the epa the average household uses as much as of all water outdoors and more in drier climates nearly half of that water can be wasted through runoff or evaporation the program is also encouraging development of water friendly products several weeks ago it finalized labeling specifications for super low flow toilets manufacturers can earn a watersense label if the toilet has a gallon flush or less the epa says watersense certified toilets can save at least gallons of water a year current low flow toilets flush with gallons and older toilets can use between four to six gallons of water per flush the agency says while they have installed low flow showerheads and toilets in most projects developers say the real water savings comes from curbing waste outdoors many feature high tech irrigation systems in the common areas of their developments and offer them as upgrades to homeowners for example mcstain neighborhoods in colorado will offer homeowners an upgrade to a "smart" system in its three new projects that senses rain and will cut back on water accordingly they can also add a so called weather station that will calculate local weather data for more precise watering the systems run about &# each some companies are pushing grass that doesnt require water at all synthetic turf traditionally the bright green stuff of professional football fields is being marketed to residential lawns synlawn based in dalton georgia offers several polyethylene and nylon turfs that replicate grasses such as bermuda rye and bluegrass its latest products use blades of varying lengths and tufts of imitation thatch to make the grass look more realistic the residential side of the business has been growing at about for the past several years says michael king the companys head of operations dennis swartzell marketing director mountain states wholesale nursery in glendale ariz makes frequent trips to the mexican desert to research low water plants that can add texture and color to a yard such as new types of long coarse bear grass or red yucca which has spiky red or yellow flowers low water landscaping doesnt have to be "a bunch of rocks with a cow skull and wagon wheel " says mr swartzell pia ruigrok moved into a native landscaping focus property community in las vegas about two years ago though she was attracted to the idea of living surrounded by desert flora she was used to the lush yards of northern california and said figuring out a low water landscape for her yard was at first "kind of overwhelming " but the year old homemaker studied a booklet on desert landscaping provided by focus and checked out the developments demonstration garden eventually she put in trees like the green stemmed palo verde and flowering texas mountain laurel as well as a small swath of fake grass for her year old daughter to play on "its not like im miss environmental " she says "but its the desert we have to try and do our best to conserve " saving water the epas new watersense program labels products and services that meet efficiency standards a few details certifies super low flow toilets that use gallons or less per flush is developing standards for bathroom sink faucets that use no more than gallons per minute is starting certification programs for irrigation
