journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources economics despite the expansion of globalization borderless society remains out of reach national borders still exert a strong enough force to prevent the world from becoming fully globalized says pankaj ghemawat a professor at iese business school in barcelona spain he says globalization prophets like thomas friedman author of "the world is flat " focus too heavily on conspicuous symbols a hungarian manager servicing american banks for an indian company from an office in uruguay rather than on overarching economic and political realities in fact the world is far from being borderless mr ghemawat estimates that generally only of any given activity in the world that could occur across borders from charitable giving to phone calls to portfolio investment actually does so despite the globalization mantra that "investment knows no boundaries " less than of the worlds capital formation was generated by foreign direct investment between and trade might have grown between countries but biases toward trading with fellow countrymen stubbornly persist despite the creation of the north american free trade agreement in trade between canadian provinces is five times larger than their trade with similarly sized and similarly distant u s states even in the apparently borderless realm of cyberspace internet traffic within countries is rising at a faster rate than traffic across borders however impressive the power of globalization seems political pressures still have the power to reverse it mr ghemawat calculates that people who had migrated from one country to another made up of the worlds population in roughly the same proportion as in following world war i a series of

church some million people belong to the anglican church which broke from rome in the th century during the reign of englands henry viii today both churches have a strong global reach but are struggling with sluggish growth and increased competition with evangelicals and pentecostals the economist likens the catholic and anglican churches difficulties to that of the newspaper business they are having trouble replacing their elderly customers as younger practitioners eschew traditional forms of worship for hipper megachurches joining forces would yield savings the merged church could sell surplus assets including some choice real estate in city centers and the anglican leadership which is embroiled in a bitter dispute with its u s episcopalian branch over gay bishops and gay marriage could benefit from the catholics clear chain of command still doctrinal differences over the ordination of women and the nature of the eucharist would be very hard to square instead anglicans might prefer to form a looser bond with the catholic church working together where their consciences allow and embracing the economist suggests "something akin to the code sharing agreements between
