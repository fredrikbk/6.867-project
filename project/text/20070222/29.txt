cold case keeping snowmobilers off straight and narrow railway cops hunt riders who use tracks as trails speed traps in snowdrifts holland n y railroad policeman matthew galas eased his cruiser behind a snowbank near a norfolk southern corp train line hed seen what he was looking for fresh snowmobile tracks on the right of way lawbreakers had been there that morning he settled in to await his prey an hour later a snowmobile slid to a stop at the edge of the woods its driver nosed toward the train track as if about to follow alongside it through railroad property then he spotted mr galas and disappeared back into the snowy forest "i thought we had a taker " said mr galas after waiting a half hour more he figured the word of his presence was out clad in a black snowsuit emblazoned "police " he jumped on the railroad forces own snowmobile outfitted with red flashing lights and inspected the illegal trail which at one point came within inches of the railroad track mr galas is one of more than a thousand police officers employed by u s railroads a couple hundred of them spend at least part of their winters on a unique mission chasing snowmobilers illegally on the train tracks mr galas once ticketed a man whose snowmobile was demolished after it had gotten caught in a snow covered track the driver dismounted shortly before a freight train smashed into his snowmobile as well as a second snowmobile that was trying to tow his off the track another time mr galas says he was dragged perhaps feet across the snow at a m by a snowmobiler he stopped for trespassing and suspected of being under the influence when the snowmobiler decided to run for it his vehicles handlebars caught on mr galass jacket and gun belt "some of them are out as long as the bars are open " notes the year old who has worked for eight years for norfolk southern "and they are open until a m in erie county " after a slow start this year winter has hit the northeast with a vengeance where mr galas works in the buffalo suburbs that has meant frigid temperatures heavy snowfall and an escalation of the annual fight between railroad police and the areas legions of snowmobile fanatics so far this month mr galas has issued warnings to eight snowmobilers on the right of way in holland just one of many freight lines crisscrossing the area police have given out tickets that can carry fines of &# snowmobiling is important to the regions economy and culture the state government provides funds to local snowmobile clubs to groom and mark their trails local shops gas stations restaurants and bars rely on snowmobile business both from tourists and locals some aficionados resent the railroad getting aggressive about patrolling the right of way along its tracks which can be as wide as feet and tends to have some of the flattest smoothest paths among the hilly and treacherous woods "it is like a speed trap on the highway and i dont agree with it " says larry snyder a board member of the holland sno rascals the local snowmobile club the club which uses a raccoons face as its logo has members the town of hollands total population is the club advises its members not to trespass on the railroads private property and certainly not to ride on the rails themselves but it is fighting the norfolk southern lines recent efforts to cut off crossings that snowmobilers use to follow their trails from one side of the tracks to the other the railroad wants the snowmobilers away from its tracks as much as possible snowmobilers in northern new york and new england have crashed into railroad equipment and trains train companies fear snowmobiles can strike dangerous objects buried under snow on railroad property such as long sections of rail or stacks of railroad ties the companies also fear expensive jury awards if accident victims or their families sue in late january a year old snowmobiler died when he lost control and ran into a csx corp signal shed near erie pa several years ago an amtrak train killed a snowmobile operator who was riding on the narrow cake of snow between the rails near albany commercial railroads have had their own police forces going back to the civil war famous agents included bat masterson a wyatt earp crony and allan pinkerton founder of the pinkerton detective agency that chased train robbers in the old west railroad cops are granted full enforcement powers by state governments and also deal with cargo theft vandalism and lately terrorism concerns municipal and state police also make arrests for violating railroad territory but railroad companies say thats not enough in its battle with the snowmobilers norfolk southern has dismantled a crossing used by a farmer with property on each side of the track and wants to cut off more such unofficial crossings taking apart the farmers crossing made up of stones between the rails severed a well traveled trail for a while snowmobilers tried to laboriously lift their machines over the track the railroad then piled up brush and dug six foot deep ditches on each side to stop them "most of the railroads you can deal with but it just happens norfolk southern is the biggest pain and thats the one we have here " says gerald cummins president of the sno rascals the club has had to reroute about of its miles of trails away from the railroad tracks he says which cost more than &# for culverts labor dirt and signs about half the state grant the club got last year to maintain trails the farmer who lost his crossing has sued the railroad but snowmobilers dont expect to regain their access the sno rascals rerouted that trail an extra eight miles through the center of the community but that created noise and other issues with local property owners the reroute also bypassed two regular snowmobiler stops the valley a restaurant and bar and the yellow goose gas station "its getting so they cant get to us " says kelly kensy owner of the valley and a sno rascals board member in nearby attica snowmobilers have virtually taken over an unused spur track when norfolk southern agent murray haines went to inspect he found they had posted a mph speed limit sign next to a rusting railroad signal pole a trail grooming rake was parked nearby snowmobilers used to traveling along the spur include a byron town justice daniel dimatteo who also is an attorney for two snowmobile clubs he said the previous owner of the spur conrail was more permissive mr haines said the railroad would try to get snowmobilers to reroute their trail for the moment he walked through a company parking lot next to an active track noting a dozen snowmobiles parked there he took down their vehicle id numbers and asked their owners to move on
