anglo american boss put to test new ceo faces challenge of going it alone as takeover threat hovers cape town south africa a week from today cynthia carroll will take over as the top boss of anglo american plc one of the worlds oldest and most prestigious mining companies her biggest challenge going it alone anglo is often cited along with aluminum giant alcoa inc as the next big takeover target in a resources sector that is experiencing a huge wave of consolidation big mining companies are awash in cash after five years of robust commodity prices now many of them are looking to cement their positions by gobbling up their rivals anglo could be a juicy target as the industrys third largest mining company by market capitalization it holds a full deck of assets including large platinum and coal operations as well as investments in copper zinc nickel and diamonds but compared with bigger industry giants like bhp billiton and rio tinto plc it has struggled to find the right strategy to capitalize on chinas soaring demand for raw materials in for example anglo and rio tinto reported roughly the same earnings about &# billion each by rio tinto earned &# billion compared with about &# billion at anglo in part because of its relatively high costs and higher inflation in some of its key countries ms carroll an american and previously a senior executive at montreal based alcan inc was unavailable for an interview a company official said the official said she is still trying to get her arms around the business and develop her own priorities still "cynthias stated intention has been to drive anglo forward focusing on its core mining businesses " said nick von schirnding anglos head of investor affairs "what she isnt doing is dressing the company up for sale " founded in by german born industrialist sir ernest oppenheimer anglo made its initial fortunes in gold diamonds and platinum but because of its role as an icon of apartheid era south africa the company found it difficult to invest its growing cash pile overseas so it diversified into other domestic industries including banking brewing paper and steel when apartheid ended the strategy left anglo with a grab bag of businesses that didnt complement its mining core this became an even bigger liability when commodity prices began to take off because international investors preferred companies with more direct exposure to the raw materials china needs to fuel its growth in late outgoing anglo chief executive tony trahar unveiled the latest of many restructuring efforts that called for anglo to ditch some remaining steel and paper operations the company also reduced its stake in anglogold ashanti ltd the worlds third largest gold producer and plans to reduce it further the plan which hasnt been completely implemented has nonetheless helped make anglo more focused but the restructuring has also made anglo a more attractive takeover target analysts cite a number of potential bidders including bhp billiton rio tinto switzerland based xstrata plc and chinese state backed conglomerate citic group rival companies have declined to comment on potential acquisition plans anglo certainly has sources of strength it reported a jump in full year net profit to &# billion boosted by partially selling its anglogold ashanti stake increased production across most of its businesses and higher prices revenue rose to &# billion in late london trading yesterday anglo american shares were down to gbp &# anglo also has more than &# billion in new projects in the pipeline including a &# billion brazilian nickel mine at roughly &# per metric ton nickel carries a price more than six times what it was in even so ms carroll has her work cut out for her anglo employs some people compared with about at rio tinto and is regarded by some investors to be far less efficient than its competitors in a report last year citigroup global markets inc estimated that anglo could slash between &# million and &# billion in annual costs by trimming staff and boosting productivity among other measures another issue more than one third of anglos assets are in south africa where companies face legislation that aims to boost the economic presence of black and other historically disadvantaged south africans by ensuring they have bigger equity stakes in the countrys key businesses for mining companies the new rules mean that such south africans must have ownership stakes by and stakes by anglo hasnt yet satisfied all the requirements leaving some uncertainty over whether it will face distractions and continue full operations there analysts also believe anglo could have a hard time finding buyers for the rest of its gold holdings and it continues to own its unwanted paper and packaging business although anglo says it intends to conclude those divestments soon analysts had expected most if not all of the restructuring to be completed long before now many analysts and investors questioned the ability of ms carroll whom they felt lacked experience running a mining company the companys stock fell after her appointment but it has since recovered as investors have become more familiar with her resume at alcan where she headed its primary metals division ms carroll earned a reputation as a cost cutter able to streamline operations "shes certainly what anglo needed in terms of instilling a culture of cost reduction and best management " says heath jansen a london based analyst at citigroup investors in south africa have started to warm up too one of them is peter major a portfolio manager at cadiz holdings a cape town based financial services firm that holds a large position in anglo shares he says that hiring a female ceo without deep ties to the companys older and somewhat staid culture signals anglo is serious about cleaning up its businesses and improving its relationship with the south african government although "we dont have much to run on" in terms of her future plans he says "i think the south african government is going to give her the benefit of the doubt " in the end whether ms carroll can stave off other mining companies could be out of her control she could decide to go on the offensive by engineering some kind of takeover of her own but many analysts say they suspect shell probably focus more narrowly on streamlining the companys business "were very excited about going back to our mining roots " says mr von schirnding the head of investor affairs as for what other companies might have in mind for anglo "we dont lose any sleep " jackie range contributed to this article
