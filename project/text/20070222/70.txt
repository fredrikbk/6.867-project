microsoft at&amp t argue software patent case washington the supreme court in the latest in a series of cases revisiting the application of patent protections in the high tech era heard arguments over where software fits within intellectual property law in general patents are only enforceable in the country that issues them thus it is no infringement for a foreign firm to manufacture and sell a rivals u s patented device abroad to extend their monopolies overseas u s companies must obtain a patent in each nation where they wish to protect their inventions under a special exception though it is an infringement to ship u s made components of a patented device for assembly overseas at&amp t inc holds a patent for voice compression technology that makes it easier to transmit and store speech on personal computers and other devices microsoft corp concedes installing the technology on u s built computers would infringe the patent but it says it isnt a violation to ship a master disk of the software overseas where it duplicates the software for installation on computers assembled in germany belgium and other countries microsoft argues the "component" is a physical disk containing the software and it is free to duplicate it overseas much as it could duplicate any other patented device overseas at&amp t contends the software itself is the component regardless of the medium lower courts including the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit a panel that hears patent appeals have agreed with at&amp t but the supreme court has repeatedly reversed the panel in decisions the justices concluded tipped too much power to patent holders critics joined by the bush administration have argued federal circuit doctrine frustrates the aim of patent law by impeding innovation the high court has never held that software itself can be patented and in oral arguments yesterday the justices struggled to conceptualize what sort of product source code is the importance could be seen in the advocates microsoft and at&amp t which have reached a confidential deal whose terms depend on the case outcome each hired a former solicitor general to make its argument the issue could have implications for other high tech products that can easily be duplicated such as bioengineered organisms justice anthony kennedy called it "odd" that microsoft would be the party contending that a computer disk rather than the software is product "i mean microsoft doesnt say please buy our disc because its the prettiest disc in the business " he said "it says buy our program because the program means something " he said "but the program is nothing until made into a physical manifestation that can be read by the computer " replied former bush solicitor general theodore olson representing microsoft "an idea or a principle cant be patented it has to be put together with a machine and made into a usable device " in this case "the components that make the machines run that are produced abroad are not supplied from the united states " former clinton solicitor general seth waxman representing at&amp t argued that the means of transmitting software code whether on a master disk shipped overseas and duplicated or through photons streamed through an undersea cable was irrelevant justice david souter said the source code might be better understood less as a product than a blueprint which can be taken overseas and used to replicate a design under at&amp ts view he suggested "any export of a blueprint " or simply sending a patent itself overseas "would be a violation "
