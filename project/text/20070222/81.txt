peer pressure london in britain there is a constitutional convention that the monarch is "the fountain of honor " from whom all titles orders and decorations are received even though everyone knows that in fact the prime minister chooses who gets almost all of them of late the fountain has been deeply muddied and the scandal has led to tony blair being questioned by the police not once but twice in the course of their official investigations the police have arrested two of mr blairs key aides including the labour partys former chief fund raiser lord michael levy no political dinner party in london is complete without intense speculation as to which senior downing street figure is likely to be next indeed it is not inconceivable that rather than the issues of iraq or afghanistan it will actually be "cash for peerages" that forces the prime minister from office earlier than his presently mooted departure date of early summer if so it will be a peculiarly british coup advertising to the world that our notorious obsession with class is very much alive and well in the st century just as britains ranking of peerages in descending order princes royal dukes dukes marquesses earls viscounts and barons glories in being arcane and ancient so too is the system by which people are appointed to fill the red benches of the house of lords new labour came to power years ago promising to make the system both rational and transparent but apart from expelling most but not all of the hereditary peers from parliament they signally failed to reform what is still deferentially known as the upper house instead new labour decided to cash in mr blairs friend and confidant lord levy nickname lord cashpoint has been widely accused of letting potential labour party donors get the distinct impression that they might be ennobled were they to translate their verbal support for the party into something a touch more useful as well as radically increasing the number of lords the names of labour party donors and new peers of the realm turned out to overlap suspiciously since life peers have the right to vote on legislation the issue swiftly became intensely political when no fewer than four prospective peers in one batch were revealed as having lent large sums usually seven figures to the labour party the police investigated a possible contravention of the honors prevention of abuses act of the age of the act is not itself indicative of how long the sale of honors in some form or another has quietly gone on in britain king james i in order to raise funds for the colonization of ulster invented baronetcies and then demanded gbp apiece for them a very significant amount in landed gentry were obliged to pay this ingenious form of wealth tax in order to maintain family precedence in counties where hitherto their status had been taken for granted their direct male descendants still use the prefix "sir" to their names to this day and their wives take on the title "lady " it was the british prime minister william pitt the younger in who laid down the dictum that "any man who is master of ten thousand pounds has a right to a peerage " but it was j maundy gregory a clergymans son and former theatrical agent who most brazenly applied the practice to th century british politics he undertook the blithe sale of baronies and baronetcies and even the occasional viscountcy on a secret commission basis and unbeknownst to customer and provider alike took a very substantial rake off from every "donation" that was given to premier david lloyd georges political fund the problem came when gregory sold honors to nouveaux riche businessmen who were suspected of profiteering out of the great war and who wanted to cloak their activities with the respectability that goes with a title it was to curb gregorys activities that the act was passed gregory was imprisoned but the lesson does not seem to have been learned today there seems to have been an attempted cover up involving vanishing emails from word processors inside no downing street and although no one accuses mr blair of doing anything illegal personally and his staff emphasize that he was questioned by the police both times as a witness rather than a suspect if anyone close to him is convicted of a criminal offense from which his party profited it will be hard for him honorably to continue in office for someone who has dominated the political world for a decade finally to be brought down because of the sale of peerages which has after all been going on in britain for several centuries might strike many non britons as the quintessence of bad luck even absurdity of course many of mr blairs political enemies dont care what humiliates and weakens him so long as something does several anti blair senior labour figures have been expressing their surprise at the discovery that honors might have been hawked to the highest bidders by downing street it is rather reminiscent of claude rains expressing his shock that gambling might have been taking place in ricks bar in the movie casablanca while accepting his own winnings from the croupier although all political parties have sold honors ever since the th century with margaret thatcher being the only prime minister of modern times to be guiltless of the practice this is the first time that a scandal has actually rocked a ministry since david lloyd georges coalition in the s it is quite true that mr blair did appoint far more peers than normal or was politically necessary to get legislation through the house of lords but for him to be hounded from office for such an offence is a wholly disproportionate response in the future of course politicians should cede their right to dispense honors to an institution that is comprehensively above politics such as the monarchy they also ought to raise money from people who give it solely because they approve of their political programs and not because of a desire for social advancement the fountain of honor would then become as pure as crystal and pigs might also fly mr roberts is author of "a history of the english speaking peoples since " just out from harper
