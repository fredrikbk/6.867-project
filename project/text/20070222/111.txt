the morning brief a long muddy road to election online edition the wall street journal online the race to become the democratic partys presidential candidate took a sharp turn into negative territory as sen hillary rodham clinton and sen barack obama traded criticism pushing tension between the two candidates into the spotlight and raising concerns about party infighting at such an early stage of the campaign sparking the hostilities were comments by hollywood executive and former clinton supporter david geffen in a new york times column by maureen dowd in which mr geffen said the clintons "lie with such ease its troubling " the column also quoted mr geffen as calling former president bill clinton "reckless " the comments apparently struck a nerve in the clinton camp which called on mr obama to return money mr geffen had raised for him at an event in beverly hills the times writes mr obamas spokesman in turn said "the clintons had no problem with david geffen when he was raising them &# million and sleeping at their invitation in the lincoln bedroom " a reference to the clinton era controversy over using the white house as a fund raising tool the wall street journal notes the exchange highlights the clinton campaigns discomfort with mr obama whose fresh image contrasts with the political baggage that mrs clinton carries from her vote on the iraq war and her eight years as first lady the times notes it also underscores the competition between the two candidates for funding hollywood backers such as mr geffen have deep pockets and mrs clinton had been counting on support from the entertainment industry the los angeles times writes and the episode raised concerns among many democrats about party infighting nearly a year before the first nominating votes are cast the

to share our toys as ceos we sometimes have to share the names of our toys and so cisco agreed to drop a lawsuit against apple and the two companies will each use the iphone name for products throughout the world the wall street journal writes the deal likely brought sighs of relief at apple as it headed off a court battle that could have potentially lasted years and led to an injunction blocking apple from using the iphone name the journal says apple plans to begin selling its iphone which combines its ipod music player with a cellphone in june while ciscos iphone which enables web based calls through skype and yahoos messenger service is already on the market bloomberg notes the deal could also be a sign of further cooperation between apple and cisco which said they will explore opportunities for making their products work better together "in the areas of security and consumer and enterprise communications " the journal says a deadly new tactic in iraq a truck bombing in iraq using explosives and chlorine gas the third such attack in a month could point to a new tactic by insurgents of adding a chemical component to their arsenal while the recent attacks using chlorine havent been executed well more sophisticated weapons could injure hundreds and cause panic the new york times writes chlorine can burn the eyes nose and throat and cause dizziness nausea and vomiting in higher doses it can damage enough lung tissue to be fatal the los angeles times says u s military officials expect to see more such attacks because insurgents perceive the tactic is working lt col christopher garver tells the new york times adding that the enemy is "adaptive " meanwhile national guard troops returning from iraq may find their home stays shortened as the pentagon
