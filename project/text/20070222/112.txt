the numbers guy coming soon the number online edition fade in setting a dimly lit bookshop will ferrell idly browses the shelves before picking up a book titled "the number " he flips through the

was born nov and executed jan and is also the number of elders john saw seated on thrones in heaven in the book of revelation the new testament volume that describes the apocalypse what a mysterious powerful number " will buys the book cut to a montage of sightings and alongside each other in the elevator of his apartment building a blackboard filled with mathematical scribbles including the finding that xxx equals a jewelry catalog on the living room table left open by his wife to the page featuring carat gold rings an alarm clock flashing the time with + equaling a copy of the nursery rhyme "sing a song of sixpence " with this passage highlighted "four and twenty naughty boys bakd in a pye " camera returns to a shot of will looking increasingly deranged and his frightened family thats my stab at writing an imagined sequel for "the number " a movie starring jim carrey that opens nationwide today in the film mr carrey plays a man "spiraling into a dark obsession with the number " after reading a book on the numbers ominous properties among the "evidence " nirvana frontman kurt cobain was born in and died in the digits in both years add up to caesar was stabbed times even the date of the sept terror attacks has a connection +++++ and so on the movie like my proposed sequel shows how just about any number can seem to have all sorts of eerie properties if you look hard enough the choice of as the source of mr carreys mania wasnt arbitrary that number has long been a favorite of conspiracy theorists and the intrigue around the number captured the imagination of "the number " screenwriter fernley phillips mr phillips told me he developed a "healthy sort of obsession or fascination" with the number in while studying screenwriting at the university of california los angeles a classmate introduced him to the belief that the number has powerful possibly sinister properties mr phillips turned to books by the futurist robert anton wilson depicting the so called enigma mr wilson called the number "cosmic " the connections were enough to prompt mr phillips who already had an interest in the paranormal to write a screenplay on the number i asked him if his next film would be a sequel titled "the number " he replied laughing "if the studio wants it " and offered that hed also be game to write a prequel "the number " mr phillips a native of england said hes a agnostic he pointed out that the number turns up frequently in nature its the number of pairs of chromosomes in human dna and the percentage of dark matter in the universe more personally after being introduced to the enigma he noticed that often when he looked at a digital clock the time would seem to be minutes past an hour or license plates would contain the string " " newspaper headlines chronicling disasters with mass casualties would count victims "not always but more times than i would have liked " mr phillips said you could also say that led to marriage for mr phillips he met his wife alissa ferguson through the movie she read the script and advised her boss producer beau flynn to buy it even though she knew about mr phillipss fascination with the number she reacted rather strongly when he urged her in december to hold off a day on delivering their child because would be a special birthday ++ "you probably couldnt print what she said to me " mr phillips said their daughter was born on dec before being cast as the movies star mr carrey already had his own predilection for like mr phillips he was turned on to the numbers mysteries by a friend his production company is named jc some of the movies claims about the numbers properties are dubious for instance it notes that the invasion of iraq began on march with + at while the date is correct reports differ on exactly what time the attack began another claim is that it takes seconds for blood to circulate throughout the entire body even though the requisite time can vary widely for different people and in an example perhaps not governed by fate the movie began filming on jan and is opening today on the rd of february there are other s they missed dr pepper "is a unique blend of flavors " and i dont think theyll be updating the list with references to critics pans such as rolling stones sentence one star review and the hollywood reporters comment that "there are probably at least reasons why this thriller doesnt work " all numbers can be shown to have interesting properties and to emerge in unexpected places if we look hard enough that makes any one numbers claim of enigmatic properties rather suspect "human beings are not as good as we imagine at discerning which events are random and which ones fall into a pattern " sylvain cappell professor of mathematics at new york universitys courant institute of mathematical sciences told me for a graphical representation of this concept i recommend a web project by golan levin who teaches electronic art at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh the secret lives of numbers displays in chart form the number of search engine hits for every whole number between one and lower numbers have more hits not surprisingly other numbers with spikes on the chart include those around powers of crucial and current years and numbers with other meanings ive questioned the value of the reported search engine hits but mr levins project is nonetheless an interesting graphical representation of the persistence of certain numerals in our lives in the most recent year for which he crawled the search engine results was ranked just where you might expect rd was ranked nd "one thing that my project does point out is that there are tons of meanings for every number " mr levin told me he added "wherever youll want meaning youll get it " you can also check out this list of "special" numbers maintained by erich friedman an associate professor of mathematics at stetson university in florida and for a less rigorous demonstration that just about any numbers can be manipulated to demonstrate just about anything listen to "south park" character cartmans explanation for why kyle was behind the sept attacks even mr wilson the novelist and inspiration for mr phillips as he pursued his interest in is read by some fans as intending the enigma around the number as a satire of the human tendency toward paranoia and false pattern spotting he died last month if mr wilson had survived to see the film mr phillips thinks "he would get a kick out of it the idea that does maybe wield its inexplicable power " mr phillips also acknowledged that any number can be granted these special properties if youre looking for it "that may well be true or it may not " thanks to numbers gurus george bergman jan de leeuw keith devlin ivo dinov mark h
