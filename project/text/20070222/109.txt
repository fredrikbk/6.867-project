might spread for now theyre mostly inclined to let the market limit the damage the presidents working group on financial markets said hedge funds should be closely monitored but found theres no need to slap any new rules on the fashionable investment vehicles government regulators have had hedge funds on the brain at least since the implosion of long term capital management during that fund steered by a pair of nobel prize winning economists and other finance gurus lost billions of dollars in a relative blink of an eye and its struggles reverberated through the world of finance the

amid the rubble of the stock market crash with the treasury secretary the federal reserve chairman and other senior regulators as members believes the current regulatory structure is up to the task of keeping hedge funds from behaving badly henry paulson the treasury secretary said the governments policies on hedge funds should be governed by consistent principles "that set out a uniform approach

increasingly "reflected in best practices " the report proclaimed that the current regulatory regime "which is also based on these principles is working well " the group recommended that fund managers keep investors and regulators well informed about the risks that they take such pronouncements dont figure to surprise those whove been listening to what members of the group have been saying about hedge funds in their solo appearances recently fed chairman ben bernanke had told lawmakers last week that the government shouldnt be compiling reams of data on hedge fund positions and that shackling hedge funds with lots of heavy handed rules would bollix up their nimble trading strategies of course a few critics scoff that some so called hedge funds do very little "hedging" at all and that some funds have been piling leverage up to their eyeballs without paying very much attention to how such a "strategy" could unravel but regulators appear content to let the market punish malefactors last
