affirming military tribunals the d c circuit court of appeals decision on tuesday upholding the military commissions act passed by congress last year is a welcome victory for common sense in the war on terror now well find out if the supreme court meant what it said last year about deferring to the two elected branches on the handling of enemy combatants we never had a problem with the bush administrations plan to set up military commissions shortly after it is the duty of the executive branch which can act with dispatch and be held accountable by voters to conduct wars and military tribunals have been successfully employed by past presidents including washington lincoln and fdr nevertheless the administrations critics kept insisting that enemy combatants captured in the war on terror were entitled to due process considerations while hostilities continued and they took their arguments all the way to the supreme court the result was last years decision in hamdan v rumsfeld that ruling chief justice john roberts was recused did not as many on the left believe question the governments right to set up military tribunals or hold unlawful combatants for the duration of the war rather the court held that the pentagons tribunals in place at the time violated certain rules in the uniform code of military justice furthermore the court invited congress to revise these rules in his concurring opinion justice stephen breyer reiterated that the majority took issue not with the existence of these tribunals but with the way they had come into being "nothing prevents the president from returning to congress to seek the authority he believes necessary " wrote justice breyer in a separate concurrence justice anthony kennedy said that "as presently structured hamdans military commission exceeds the bounds congress has placed on the presidents authority " but he added "because congress has prescribed these limits congress can change them " thats exactly what lawmakers did in passing the military commissions act that president bush signed into law last october the appellate courts ruling this week which held that guantanamo detainees dont have the right to challenge their imprisonment in federal courts affirms the constitutionality of that law a supreme court appeal is likely but a reversal would require the justices not only to defy the will of the other two branches but also to ignore their own instructions to congress in hamdan not that some wont be urging such a course of action in her dissent judge judith rogers argues that the military commissions act which effectively suspends habeas corpus for terrorist detainees is unconstitutional but the majority opinion written by judge a raymond randolph is solidly anchored in supreme court jurisprudence and the court has long held that aliens held overseas have no constitutional rights unless congress decides to confer them statutorily "precedent in this court and the supreme court holds that the constitution does not confer rights on aliens without property or presence within the united states " wrote judge randolph he cited as the "controlling case" the supreme courts johnson v eisentrager decision the ruling rejecting the proposition that aliens are entitled to fifth amendment rights outside of the u s the court in eisentrager went on to explain why its prudent not to confer constitutional rights on enemy combatants "if the fifth amendment confers its rights on all the world it would mean that during military occupation irreconcilable enemy elements guerrilla fighters and werewolves could require the american judiciary to assure them freedoms of speech press and assembly as in the first amendment right to bear arms as in the second security against unreasonable searches and seizures as in the fourth as well as rights to jury trial as in the fifth and sixth amendments " we dont doubt that antiwar activists and lawyers at the aclu would have no problem granting such protections to suspected al qaeda members and their allies and such critics in congress of tribunals as senate judiciary chairman pat leahy have every right to try to rewrite the military commissions act if they have the political nerve but were also sure that prosecuting a war on terror would be significantly more difficult as a result having so ostentatiously invited congress to act in hamdan the supreme court could also now help the country and its own reputation by agreeing with judge randolph
