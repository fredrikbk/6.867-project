global economy shrugs off oil housing strains central banks confident of more steady growth excessive risk a concern the bank of japans move to raise interest rates for the first time since july underscores the surprisingly upbeat state of the worlds major economies which continue to perk along despite the damage done by high energy prices and sagging housing markets the worlds central bankers are so confident that growth will remain steady and inflation under control that their main worry is less the immediate future than whether conditions are breeding excessive speculation in financial markets yesterdays move by the bank of japan reflected that confidence in its own economy as well as the broader world economy lifting rates to a still very low the bank said it "judged that our economy is likely to continue its virtuous circle of production income and spending " and that "uncertainties over the future course of overseas economies including that of the united states are abating " indeed though the u s economy has slowed substantially from its torrid pace of a year ago it has kept growing fast enough to keep unemployment down despite the housing slump in the countries that use the euro growth is expected to abate from last years six year high but remain well above the sluggish pace of prior years data released yesterday show spain joined germany and italy as standouts in the fourth quarter globally inflation is still low by recent historical standards though higher than some central bankers would prefer u s consumer prices excluding food and energy rose over the past months the government said yesterday oil prices are off their peaks global stock markets are buoyant "its a pretty benign picture " said nariman behravesh chief economist at u s forecaster global insight "youve got at least moderate growth and inflation that looks for the moment like its not out of control " the biggest risk he sees too much of a good thing namely a global economy so robust that it pushes up prices and prompts the u s and european central banks to boost interest rates despite the rise of china the u s japan and europe account for more than of the global economy according to j p morgan chase economists central bankers latest concern is that investors are underpricing risk and bidding up prices of assets from corporate bonds to houses and in the process driving down returns on those assets such as long term interest rates while for now that fosters global growth some policy makers worry this cant last and that an abrupt reversal in market perceptions about risk could trigger a drop in asset prices as investors pull back that could threaten growth concerns about excessive risk taking are being aired more frequently "we want markets to be aware of the risks in one way bets in general " european central bank president jean claude trichet said after meeting with his counterparts from other banks earlier this month "we in particular think of carry trades" borrowing in countries like japan with low rates to invest at higher rates in europe and the u s "but not only carry trades " mr trichet and other policy makers also have expressed concern about a herd mentality in markets possibly exacerbated by hedge funds piling onto similar trades increasing the potential for excessive loss if the bets go bad most central bankers remain more inclined to deem complacency a risk than a reason to raise rates but in tokyo while attributing yesterdays rate increase primarily to confidence in the japanese economy bank of japan officials expressed concern that persistently low interest rates could fuel the carry trade distorting markets in ways that could produce convulsive impacts on currencies interest rates and global growth the boj governor toshihiko fukui said at a news conference that "extremely distorted movements in the financial market " including the yen carry trade could "eventually have a negative impact on the real economy and prices " the central bank wanted to squelch expectations that japanese rates would stay so low for very long in order to discourage investors from taking "extreme positions " he said u s federal reserve officials offer differing interpretations of markets recent calm chairman ben bernanke attributes much to fundamental factors such as emerging countries funneling plentiful savings to the u s but vice chairman donald kohn sees more cause for worry "it would be imprudent to rule out sharp movements in asset prices and deterioration in market liquidity that would test the resiliency of market infrastructure and financial institutions " mr kohn said in a speech in washington afterward mr kohn said markets are currently priced for "a very benign situation i do get a little concerned or i wonder maybe at some of the low levels of volatility and the low levels of expected volatility " fed officials generally dont see market speculation as a reason to tighten monetary policy or even keep it tight rather they have cited the lack of spare economic capacity and an elevated inflation rate as a reason to maintain short term interest rates at with a bias to raising them further minutes from the feds jan meeting released yesterday after the customary lag indicate that fed officials had become less worried about the prospect for both growth and inflation data show "somewhat smaller risks to economic growth as well as improved prospects for core inflation " the minutes said data released since that meeting show retail sales housing starts and industrial production all weakened in january and the strong fourth quarter growth number is likely to be revised down substantially next week if unemployment also starts to edge higher as fed officials expect they may begin to signal more concern about slowing growth and less about rising inflation in coming months the minutes suggest there was more debate than usual in january about whether to continue saying inflation risks might yet require higher interest rates as the fed statement ultimately did in the european economy recent surprises have nearly all been on the upside lately "the euro area really surprised on all levels late last year weathering both a downturn in demand from the u s and a rise in the euro and we expect the positive momentum to continue this year " says julian callow chief european economist with barclays capital in london exports remain the nation blocs mainstay but the labor market is also improving and that could bolster consumer spending the number of people at work in germany which has the regions largest economy reached a five year high in despite signs that this years growth wont match last years the signs of strength are likely to push the ecb to raise interest rates this year with many analysts predicting a boost to by june from todays political uncertainty is a risk as well with the surprise resignation yesterday of italian premier romano prodi elections approaching in france and britain facing a change in leadership as well yesterdays move in tokyo was the first since the boj in july ended its five year old stance of keeping its benchmark rate at zero an emergency measure taken to nurse japan out of a long period of low growth and falling prices prices are hardly rising today japans core consumer price index which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes energy rose just in december from a year earlier economists think the index could fall over the next several months because of declines in oil prices the japanese economy surged at an annualized growth rate of in the final three months of but economists say much of that was due to an unsustainable bounce back of consumer spending after six months of very slow growth christopher conkey in washington contributed to this article
