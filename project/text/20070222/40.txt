eurolinks daily view italian rifts impact will ripple through europe and beyond online edition with nine parties in his governing coalition including two separate communist parties italian prime minister romani prodi who resigned wednesday after only eight months in office has been walking a tightrope now however his governments collapse has crippled its ability to push forward on its economic agenda and on foreign policy measures like the continued presence of italian troops in afghanistan as part of the nato mission which is unpopular with the far left the collapse harkens back to a previous era of italian politics when for the half century following the ratification of the countrys constitution in governments lasted less than a year on average as gabriel kahn and luca di leo report that often led to caretaker governments and early elections the catalyst of wednesdays events was a vote in the senate that was supposed to affirm the main tenets of italys foreign policy including the afghan mission and expansion of a u s military base in vicenza in northern italy despite his narrow majority mr prodis government had approved controversial measures that have pried open sectors of the economy from pharmacies to legal services that had long been buffered from competition his government also approved a budget bill that succeeded in improving italys public accounts after several consecutive years of runaway deficit spending under silvio berlusconis previous government those measures have helped increase business confidence and italys economy has begun to sputter forward growing by last year after recording zero growth in now it seems unlikely that any serious overhaul of italys bloated pension system or a change in the retirement age both staunchly opposed by the coalitions left wing parties will be achieved the confusion might also deepen a political stasis afflicting two other core european economies france and germany frances efforts to open up its rigid labor market have been stalled since president jacques chirac backed down last year from a controversial labor reform bill while german chancellor angela merkels bipartisan coalition has

wednesday raising its target for short term rates by percentage point to a still very low was so small that the so called carry trade that it says it intends the move to curb will barely be affected thats the trade in which investors borrow money at japans low rates and invest it elsewhere where returns are far higher creating such distortions as inflated asset values so while the central banks move throws a bone to the european finance ministers who complained about this impact of japans low rates at the recent group of seven leading industrialized nations meeting can the bank raise rates more quickly sure japans prices are only just edging higher after having fallen as recently as last year and they could fall again because of the decline in oil prices but its gross domestic product surged at an annualized growth rate of in the final three months of the central banks move was its first since it ended in july its five year old stance of keeping its benchmark rate at zero an emergency measure taken to nurse japan out of a long period of low growth and falling prices but the gap between japanese interest rates and rates in other major nations is expected to remain wide a condition that has sent investors away from yen based assets and pushed down the yens value against the dollar and the euro over the past year indeed the yen continued to weaken wednesday after the banks move nonetheless the move reflected confidence in both the japanese and global economies with the bank saying japans economy "is likely to continue its virtuous circle of production income and spending" and that "uncertainties over the future course of overseas economies including that of the united states are abating " yes though the u s economy has slowed substantially from its torrid pace of a year ago it has kept growing fast enough to hold unemployment down despite the countrys housing slump and though growth in the euro zone countries is expected to abate from last years six
