politics &amp economics an israeli chasm widens tensions strain coexistence of jewish arab citizens jerusalem growing mistrust between israels jews and its million arab citizens is testing a political and social fabric already strained by six years of violence and war between israel and its arab neighbors including the palestinians the deepening divide has come into sharper focus here since an israeli arab cleric sent chills across the nation last weekend by calling for a new "intifada " or uprising in response to construction work near one of the most revered holy sites for both muslims and jews as a result controversy over raad salah a bespectacled islamist whose sharp jaw is framed by a white tipped silver beard he wears sans moustache is casting both a spotlight and a shadow on israeli arabs the nations biggest minority group long tolerated though neglected has begun to buck what many feel is its second class status in a state where public life is suffused with jewish identity unlike palestinians in the gaza strip and west bank territories long controlled by israel the arabs within israel itself are legally entitled to full citizenship and all the rights that carries israeli jews find questions about the fundamental identity of their state jarring though they are also increasingly fearful of growing religiosity and radicalism among arab citizens "most organizations dealing with coexistence are now motivated by a deep sense that things have gotten worse and are on the edge " says avi melamed a former counterterrorism official who was an adviser on arab affairs to two jerusalem mayors including ehud olmert now israels prime minister more disturbing to others is what they dont see "there is almost no institutionalized dialogue between the arab community and the state of israel " says mohammad darawshe a director at the abraham fund initiatives an israeli nonprofit group that works to bring arabs and jews together to many jewish leaders the rise of mr salah who heads a growing faction of the islamist movement in israel confirms their worst fears about a "fifth column" attacking from within this notion now seems to be part of the mainstream political dialogue although it was once thought by some to be too impolitic to utter in polite conversation but israeli arab leaders and many jews working for coexistence recoil from the idea that roughly one fifth of israels population could be broadly brushed as a security threat they also say mr salah and other islamists are able to capitalize on decades of discrimination within israeli society and the resulting inequities which islamists fill through their own social programs leaders say tensions now appear to be higher than at any time since october that is when pressure swirling around the temple mount almost identical in nature though not scope to protests mr salah has been leading for two weeks sparked what became known as the al aqsa intifada or the second intifada the ensuing war between palestinian militant groups and israel left thousands dead in the galilee region of the north where arab cities are concentrated a dozen unarmed israeli arab citizens were killed by police gunfire during eight days of protests and riots as the intifada began "it was a major break point and things have gotten worse " mr melamed says a government investigative panel looked behind the troubles concluding in that israels relationship with its arab minority was "primarily neglectful and discriminatory " it also said israel home to nearly five million jews didnt do nearly enough to allocate equal resources to arab towns where it said there were substantially defective infrastructures and "serious problems in the education system " there was also a communal loss of faith according to mr darawshe and baker awawdy who lives in an arab village near nazareth and is executive director of the all volunteer center for the struggle against racism jews stopped shopping in arab cities and villages wounding local arab economies and straining personal ties between the two communities on a political level israeli jews also increasingly saw arabs as disloyal says mr melamed because so many arabs expressed sympathy with palestinians in the territories during the intifada arabs remain outraged that no israeli police officer ever faced charges for the killings of unarmed citizens in galilee mr salah was arrested and imprisoned in for his own alleged disloyalty after authorities accused him of having contact with a foreign agent and giving money to hamas the palestinian islamist movement mr salah was released from prison in and immediately resumed his fiery condemnations of israel while his venom was extreme he was hardly alone among israeli arabs criticizing state policies divisions deepened last summer when arabs objected to the day war with hezbollah in lebanon even as arab towns in northern israel were among those showered by hezbollah rockets some israeli arab politicians were even seen as backing hezbollah a shiite muslim group with political militant and social services wings mr olmert the israeli prime minister then seemingly confirmed the worst fears of arabs politically weakened by the war he formed a ruling coalition with the right wing yisrael beiteinu party it literally translates into "israel is our home " and the partys leaders have publicly advocated the forced removal of israeli arab citizens to the palestinian territories last year more than three dozen of the israeli arab communitys most prominent leaders fired a new salvo in a rare show of unity they issued a document called the future vision it demanded that israel shed its existence as a "jewish state" in order to become a truly inclusive and consensual democracy for arabs and jews "it was the first time we as a community came together not to say what we didnt want but to declare what we did want " says mr awawdy the report almost immediately drew ire from jews many condemned arab leaders for rejecting the fundamental basis of the nation as a jewish state but one prominent israeli arab group publicly declared that the report didnt represent its views mr salahs islamic movement more and more his group is tending to social needs primarily in education and health care that the state of israel has left unattended "after years of our crying and wailing we in the islamic movement moved to do something about this " explains marwan jabareh a representative of the group in tamra a galilee arab city of roughly people evidence of that commitment stands at the bottom of a slope within the maze of the citys narrow streets a square foot hospital built with &# million of charitable funds set to open in march meanwhile mr salah is under investigation for alleged incitement for his fiery words it seems highly unlikely that israeli arab citizens will respond to his entreaty with violence akin to that experienced here during the height of intifada although there have been several instances of providing support for terrorists the number of israeli arabs who have actually engaged in terrorist acts is negligible according to mr melamed and others
