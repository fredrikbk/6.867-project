mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q last week you advised using an easy transfer cable to transfer files from a windows xp computer to a new windows vista computer but what about those of us still using windows who want to get a new vista machine a the belkin easy transfer cable i discussed only works fully when the old pc is running the latest version of windows xp although it will work partially with windows but there are other methods for people using older consumer versions of windows such as windows and windows me you can of course use a two step process copying your files to recordable cds or to an external hard disk and then inserting the cds into the vista pc or attaching the hard disk to it and moving the files over you could also use a usb flash drive in the same manner or if you are skilled at networking you could move the files over a network however there are also some cable solutions that will work with windows and windows me for instance the tornado the cable with the built in manual file copying software i discussed last week works with versions of windows back to the se edition of windows though you need to install driver software for that version more information is at www thetornado com another product i reviewed last week pcmover from laplink also works with older versions of windows albeit with different cables that laplink sells not the easy transfer cable information is at laplink com another similar product that has worked for me in past tests is intellimover by detto at detto com which also comes with cables q i am a macintosh user and plan to buy a new dell with windows vista how can i move my programs and files from the old mac to the new dell a well first of all you cant switch your mac programs to the dell they wont run on windows but nearly all of the common files used on a mac such as microsoft office documents text files pictures songs and adobe pdf files will work fine on your dell i dont know of a simple integrated cable and software solution for such a mac to windows migration so youll likely have to use recordable cds or an external hard disk or usb flash drive just make sure to use drives that are formatted for windows macs can read and write to such windows drives but windows pcs cant natively read or write to mac formatted drives q i have a mac running windows via the parallels virtual machine software i am also running an older windows pc which i back up to an external disk drive can i plug the external drive into the mac and copy the files into the parallels environment a yes a virtual windows computer running on a mac behaves just like a regular windows computer so you can indeed plug in an external hard disk and copy the files over in addition as i mentioned last week the forthcoming new version of parallels includes a utility called transporter that will move the entire contents of a windows pc into a virtual windows machine running on a mac see parallels com for details you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
