wonder land scooter libby and reputation "there used to be a time when big cases were investigated a different way in this country maybe somethings gone horribly wrong " federal judge lewis a kaplan the trial of i lewis "scooter" libby is the closest version of a red queen trial this country has had in a long time one says that knowing it might start a stampede from past defendants laying claim to the most upside down prosecution lewis g carrolls account of the knave s trial before the red queen and white rabbit is famous for the queens dictum "sentence first verdict afterward " but read the full transcript of the mock trial and one will see that the real subject is not justice but the humiliation of the defendant the trial of scooter libby in washington the national capital of illogic has been exemplary in december the prosecutor purports a crime has been committed by revealing a "covert" cia agents identity to the press despite knowing then what the outside world learned nearly three years later that the revealer of the agent was a state department official richard armitage with the "whodunnit" solved on day one the prosecution follows the red queens script by taking the nation on a useless joylesss ride through the opaque looking glass of washington journalism the testimony of three of the worlds most sophisticated journalists judith miller matthew cooper and tim russert was the trials closest thing to the white rabbit reading nonsense verse to the jury "for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me " the libby case went to the jury yesterday after the verdict all the characters in this satire on beltway mores will go back to doing what they did before except for one scooter libby if found guilty mr libby goes to prison he is ruined if acquitted he loses only that which he built daily the past years of private and public life his reputation this too is ruin purified justice notwithstanding something here has gone "horribly wrong " as is increasingly true of politics american justice today has come to look more like mortal combat the videogame notions of proportionality have eroded crimes that are minor crimes civil offenses or mere hardball politics like the plame case must be elevated to a capital offense eliot spitzers pursuit of aig founder hank greenberg rose to a bonfire of never proven criminal charges that put the torch to the company and mr greenberg before burning down to its current ash of alleged civil offenses against him under the constant stare of the media cyclops prosecutors cant back down and justice in st century america degrades to swamp justice exhibit a the duke lacrosse team prosecution judge lewis kaplan in the federal governments recent kpmg prosecution sat in appalled disbelief as federal prosecutors attempted to reduce defendants to rubble it was ever thus that big cases produce drama thats hard to resist not least is the spectacle of a once in a lifetime defendant a scooter libby virtually bankrupting himself to avoid guilt labor secretary ray donovans remark on acquittal will explain why unto eternity "which office do i go to to get my reputation back " no dramas will be written though about the aftermath for such a defendant but maybe one should consider the case of salim lewis thirty years ago on wall street salim "sandy" lewis was a household name his father salim co built bear stearns and he in turn made his reputation in the high stakes corporate merger cycle of the s he worked without legal or disciplinary taint until he was in a federal prosecutor named rudolph giuliani indicted him for securities violations his accuser was boyd jeffries the criminal acolyte of famed financial criminal ivan boesky the case itself was arcane outraged at a short selling practice legal at the time mr lewis urged jeffries to engage in a stock transaction to thwart the short sellers a subsequent court called what he did "an act of market vigilantism in which mr lewis in no way personally profited " and indeed the short selling practice he attacked was later outlawed still his own act was illegal rudy giuliani indicted him on counts he pleaded guilty to three facing years judge mary johnson lowe reduced it to three years probation an act of now antique proportionality the sec got an injunction banning mr lewis for life from the securities business this was the core of a reputation the court record had shown steeped in good works he sought to restore it in he received a pardon from president clinton later called "a bona fide pardon on the merits" by a federal judge the sec bar order remained he again sought relief in court and this past summer judge william conner of the southern district aka wall street lifted the lifetime bar saying "we cannot ignore the inequity inherent in the injunction " it took only years nor does innocence guard reputation back then prosecutor giuliani flamboyantly arrested richard wigton blameless years with kidder peabody and a youthful arbitrager named timothy tabor they were handcuffed two years later the charges against both were dropped no matter both had been led through the media bonfire they were ruined some of this reputational destruction can be explained as random events having the bad luck to draw a politically ambitious prosecutor messrs giuliani and spitzer or the fanaticism inherent to special prosecutors but something more harsh and bitter is in the water now incredibly scooter libby and ray donovan had the same lawyer ted wells so did sandy lewis then and kpmg today stanley arkin mr arkin thinks its worse now "we use the word criminal very promiscuously" today he told me legal standards and ethics require a neutral review up to the decision to indict but too often mr arkin says "you do not have neutral review we get a poor quality of magisterial review in this country " it is a travesty that the valerie plame bump and run case brought lewis libby to the edge of this cliff primary blame belongs to the bush justice departments abdication of responsibility so now a former manhattan prosecutor is running for president electoral vagaries willing one can think of no one better qualified to restore the meaning of "criminal" to its proper intent write to henninger wsj com
