officials recusal is new twist in blackwater inquiry hearing is roiled as brothers link to firm is revealed washington the governments efforts to unravel a deadly shooting incident in baghdad that occurred while guards from blackwater worldwide were conducting a mission for the u s state department suffered an embarrassment yesterday when the state departments inspector general disclosed that his brother is a member of blackwaters advisory board during a hearing before the house committee on oversight and government reform inspector general howard krongard abruptly withdrew from any investigations involving blackwater after acknowledging that his brother alvin krongard had attended a blackwater strategic planning meeting earlier this week initially howard krongard told the committee that his brother a former top central intelligence agency official had assured him that he had no ties to blackwater but after a break mr krongard reversed himself saying that had spoken to his brother by telephone and learned that he was indeed involved with the company "i hereby recuse myself from matters having to do with blackwater " the inspector general said mr krongards reversal provided more fodder for democratic critics of blackwater and the bush administration california democrat henry waxman who chairs the committee accused mr krongard of using his office to undermine inquiries that targeted blackwater or might embarrass the administration the committees investigators citing interviews and documents concluded in a report that "mr krongards actions impeded the justice departments investigation" starting in march into allegations that blackwater was illegally bringing weapons into iraq mr krongard insisted that he didnt interfere with any investigations according to the committees records of correspondence between alvin krongard and blackwater founder erik prince alvin krongard was invited to join blackwaters board in july on sept mr prince thanked alvin krongard for joining the advisory board blackwater spokeswoman anne tyrrell dismissed the allegations saying "theres no conflict of interest there as far as were concerned " she said the board met for the first time on tuesday the episode before the house committee occurred after the new york times reported yesterday that the federal bureau of investigation had determined that of the civilians killed in the sept incident were the victims of unjustified deadly force at the same time however people familiar with the justice department and fbi probe said the investigation was still perhaps months away from concluding and that no determinations have been made still it is becoming increasingly apparent that authorities will face several hurdles should they seek to bring any criminal charges against those involved among the obstacles complex forensic issues at the shooting scene an uncertain legal framework for charging guards working under u s contracts abroad and limited immunity granted to some blackwater guards involved in the incident people close to the case say blackwater may also present what it believes is physical evidence demonstrating its actions were warranted so far the fbis investigation has focused on blackwater personnel involved in the sept incident there have been no criminal allegations against the company or any of its guards at the same time blackwaters ventures in providing guards training aircraft and other services to the u s military and law enforcement community are also under scrutiny over questions of cost and accountability blackwater has said it believes it offers taxpayers a better deal than they could get elsewhere the justice department declined to comment on the case saying it would be "completely inappropriate to publicly discuss any evidence at this time much less the nature or direction of the investigation " blackwater has said it will hold its guards accountable if evidence emerges that they broke rules regarding the use of weapons however "to the best of our understanding the key people in the incident have yet to even speak with authorities " the blackwater spokeswoman said the blackwater situation is a landmark test for the justice department which faces its biggest challenge to date in prosecuting armed contractors engaged in roles traditionally filled by the u s military initially the state department began a review of the shooting as it does in incidents when contractors have fired their weapons after political pressure mounted including allegations from the iraqi government that the guards shot without provocation the fbi took the lead role at the behest of the state department since then people familiar with the investigation say the fbis efforts have been hampered because the state department team that conducted the initial investigation promised blackwaters guards limited immunity from prosecution in return for their cooperation with providing statements it is also unclear what laws might apply since the companys contractors work for the state department u s lawmakers are moving toward new legal measures that could bring guards like blackwaters under u s criminal law joseph schmitz chief operating officer and general counsel of blackwater parent the prince group who served as inspector general of the defense department from to said that current regulations are already very effective "theres a false premise in the statements of congress that unless you criminally prosecute somebody you cant hold them accountable " said mr schmitz the company has maintained that its vehicles were fired on and have the damage to prove it according to a person familiar with the company blackwater has also informally sought forensic reports on those killed that day to show that its guards werent responsible for their deaths "i think proving a criminal case in an evidentiary perspective would be enormously difficult and problematic assuming theres any basis in law to bring charges against these guys " said a person familiar with blackwaters thinking evan perez contributed to this article
