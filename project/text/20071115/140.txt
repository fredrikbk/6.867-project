who are irans revolutionary guards the scene is a board meeting of bank sepah irans second largest financial institution in tehran the directors are waiting for the sardar literally "head owner" to arrive but the sardar is in a changing room shedding his uniform for a civilian suit the man in question is gen mohammad ali jafari the new commander in chief of the islamic revolutionary guard corps irgc which owns and controls the bank most americans already know more about the irgc than theyd like to in september the senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of a nonbinding resolution urging president bush to label the irgc a terrorist group he did so a month later and has since implemented harsh new sanctions targeting the business interests of the irgc as treasury secretary henry paulson told the press recently "it is increasingly likely that if you are doing business with iran you are doing business with the irgc " still there is much about this organization that is misunderstood the irgc is a unique beast it is an army answerable to no one but the "supreme leader" of the islamic revolution ayatollah ali khamenei it is also a business conglomerate that controls over companies active in a wide range of industries from nuclear power to banking life insurance to holiday resorts and shopping centers by most estimates the irgc is irans third largest corporation after the national iranian oil company and the imam reza endowment in the "holy" city of mashhad northeast of tehran the islamic republic established by the ayatollah khomeini after the ouster of the shah in is often labeled a "mullahrchy" a theocracy dominated by the shiite clergy the truth however is that a majority of shiite clerics never converted to khomeinism and did not endorse the islamic republic in the past few years especially since the election of president ahmadinejad in those mullahs who converted to khomeinism have lost some of their power and privileges today the irgc is the dominant force within the ruling establishment in tehran it is not a monolith and to label all of it a "terrorist" organization as the bush administration has done may make it difficult to strike deals with parts of it when and if the opportunity arises a thorough analysis of the irgc must take into account a number of facts first the irgc is not a revolutionary army in the sense that the aln was in algeria or the vietcong in vietnam those were born during revolutionary wars in which they became key players the irgc was created after the khomeinist revolution had succeeded this fact is of crucial importance those who joined the irgc came from all sorts of backgrounds the majority were opportunists by joining the irgc they could not only obtain revolutionary credentials often on fictitious grounds but would also secure well paying jobs at a time that economic collapse made jobs rare joining the irgc enabled many who had cooperated with the ancien regime to rewrite their cvs and obtain "revolutionary virginity " membership of the irgc ensured access to rare goods and services from color tvs to more decent housing as the years went by irgc membership provided a fast track to social political and economic success today half of president ahmadinejads cabinet ministers are members of the irgc as is the president himself irgc members hold nearly a third of seats in the islamic consultative assembly majlis the ersatz parliament created in twenty of irans provinces have governors from the irgc irgc members have also started capturing key posts in the diplomatic service today for the first time the islamic republics ambassadors in such important places as the united nations in new york and embassies in a dozen western capitals are members of the irgc but it is as an economic power that the irgc weighs so heavily on iranian politics in a tehran university study estimated the annual turnover of irgc businesses at &# billion with total net profits of &# billion the privatization package prepared by president ahmadinejad is likely to increase the irgcs economic clout almost all of the public sector companies marked for privatization at a total value of &# billion are likely to end up in the hands of the irgc and its individual commanders the crown jewel of the irgcs business empire is the islamic republics nuclear program which has cost the nation over &# billion so far this is part of a broader scheme of arms purchases and manufacture which in total accounts for almost of the annual national budget the irgc also controls the lucrative business of "exporting the revolution" estimated to be worth &# billion a year it finances branches of the hezbollah movement in at least countries including some in europe and provides money arms and training for radical groups with leftist backgrounds in recent years it has emerged as a major backer of the armed wing of the palestinian hamas and both shiite and sunni armed groups in iraq afghanistan and pakistan the vehicle through which the irgc "exports" revolution is a special unit known as the quds jerusalem force this consists of highly trained men and women specializing in "martyrdom operations " a code word for guerrilla war armed insurgency and terrorism the islamic republic has invested some &# billion in lebanon since in most cases the lebanese branch of the hezbollah is nominally in control however a closer examination reveals that in most cases the lebanese companies are fronts for iranian concerns controlled by the irgc the irgc is divided into five commands each of which has a direct line to the ayatollah khamenei to minimize the risk of coup detat irgcs senior officers are not allowed to engage in "sustained communication" with one another on "sensitive subjects " of the five commands in question two could be regarded as "terrorist" according to the u s state departments definition that needless to say is rejected by the islamic republic one command is in charge of the already mentioned quds corps which is waging indirect war against u s and allied forces in iraq and afghanistan apart from hezbollah and hamas it also runs a number of radical groups across the globe the second command ensures internal repression it operates through several auxiliary forces including the notorious karbala ashura and al zahra an all female unit brigades which are charged with crushing popular revolt many iranians see these as instruments of terror as a parallel to the regular army the irgc has its ground forces navy and air force it also controls the so called basij mustadafin mobilization of the dispossessed a fanatical semi voluntary force of full time fighters that could be built up to million according to its commander brig gen mohammad hejazi the irgcs own strength stands at men its officers corps including those in retirement numbers around and is as divided on domestic and foreign policies as the rest of society some irgc former commanders who did not share the islamic republics goals have already defected to the u s hundreds of others have gone into low profile exile mostly as businessmen in the united arab emirates malaysia and turkey an unknown number were purged because they refused to kill anti regime demonstrators in iranian cities many prominent irgc commanders may be regarded as businessmen first and military leaders second usually they have a brother or a cousin in europe or canada to look after their business interests and keep a channel open to small and big "satans" in case the regime falls a few irgc commanders including some at the top do not relish a conflict with the u s that could destroy their business empires without offering iran victory on the battlefield indeed there is no guarantee that in case of a major war all parts of the irgc would show the same degree of commitment to the system irgc commanders may be prepared to kill unarmed iranians or hire lebanese palestinian and iraqi radicals to kill others however it is not certain they would be prepared to die for president ahmadinejads glory these concerns persuaded ayatollah khamenei to announce a defense planning commission last year controlled by his office a blanket labeling of the irgc as "terrorist " as opposed to targeting elements of it that terrorize the iranian people and others in the region and beyond could prove counterproductive it may in fact unite a fractious force that could splinter into more manageable parts given the right incentives inside iran the irgc is known as pasdaran vigilantes and inspires a mixture of intense hatred and grudging admiration while many iranians see it as a monster protecting an evil regime others believe that when the crunch comes it will side with the people against an increasingly repressive and unpopular regime mr taheri is author of "lirak le dessous des cartes" editions complexe
