merrill taps nyses thain as ceo pick signals new phase of wall street focus on risk management new york merrill lynch &amp co s choice of john thain head of nyse euronext as merrills new chief executive signals that after years of inner turmoil and risky expansion the beleaguered financial giant wants a pair of steady hands at the helm for wall street at large the message in the elevation of the low key financial veteran is clear after an era of go go growth that led firms into profitable but chancy areas like mortgage securities the industry is moving toward the kind of leader who gets down into the nitty gritty of risk management mr thain years old is a former mortgage bond trader at goldman sachs a onetime electrical engineering student who digs into the details of the businesses he runs his profile thus is somewhat akin to those of the leaders of three firms that have best survived the current credit market turmoil j p morgan chase &amp co s james dimon lehman brothers holdings richard fuld and lloyd blankfein of goldman sachs group inc are all executives who are hands on know the innards of their businesses and cant be fooled too easily by bond traders they arent risk averse but they have a deep understanding of risk and have the battle scars to prove it mr thain joins a firm merrill that ousted its ceo stan oneal after taking an &# billion hit in the third quarter from revaluing bonds backed by mortgages and from other write downs in an interview mr thain said he accepted the offer to lead merrill because it has a "great franchise" with strong positions in wealth management investment banking and sales and trading among other areas "its got one problem area " he said "and i know a lot about that area" from running goldmans mortgage desk from to known for a somewhat staid personality mr thain deflected concerns that he doesnt have the charisma to lead a firm known for its "thundering herd" of brokers "i think i have better interpersonal skills than people give me credit for " he said he added that he has taken a lot of time to get to know the big boards floor traders some nyse floor traders say mr thain made a consistent effort to improve their ability to trade electronically despite difficulties many encountered in adapting to the increasing speed of trading "i was tremendously impressed" with mr thain said gordon charlop a floor broker who said mr thain pushed to improve handheld computers on the exchange floor after mr charlop and a few fellow traders met with him news of mr thains selection gave a jolt to merrills stock price at midday it surged to &# within minutes while the stock later retreated with other financials it still closed up &# or at &# in p m trading on the new york stock exchange even at that level the price is down from a peak in january of just above &# within merrill mr thains appointment was something of a shock it was widely assumed at the firm that the board would tap larry fink the chief executive of blackrock inc merrill owns nearly half of that large asset management firm and mr fink has extensive expertise in the fixed income area where merrill has stumbled and lost a number of key executives mr fink also has considerable familiarity with merrill and is close to gregory fleming its year old co president soon after the thain news broke people associated with merrill and mr fink were generating different versions of how merrill had chosen mr thain rather than mr fink the merrill search committee led by buyout executive alberto cribiore approached mr fink about the job about two weeks ago and he was one of the two main candidates according to people familiar with the search but within the past week or so a person in mr finks camp says the blackrock chief asked for more information about the extent of merrills exposure to risky mortgage assets mr fink told the merrill representatives "he couldnt go forward unless he understood with greater depth the risk exposure facing the firm " said this person a merrill spokeswoman said the merrill job was never offered to mr fink nor was there any discussion of the firms holdings of collateralized debt obligations which are securities backed by pools of mortgages or other assets and which produced the bulk of merrills recent losses mr thain meanwhile said he went through "the specifics of merrills positions" in the mortgage market and got access to information the merrill fink talks also had to address the issue of whether merrill could swap mr finks roughly holding of blackrock for merrill stock and who would pay any taxes due on such an exchange such qualms and issues on mr finks part led some people involved in the search process to believe that mr fink "overplayed his hand " according to people briefed on the search results "it backfired with the board " one of the people said a merrill spokesman disputed this on mr cribiores behalf and mr fink in a memo to blackrock employees said he "was not looking to be considered for other positions or for media attention " another worry for merrills board blackrock is valued in the market at nearly &# billion and merrills board worried that without mr fink at the helm one of its most precious assets its interest in blackrock would suffer in his memo to employees mr fink said "i am fully and exclusively focused on and committed to blackrock " mr thain told the nyse board sunday of his interest in the merrill job and indicated that he didnt want the exchange to go through an extended process of waiting in limbo according to one person familiar with the nyse "he said he was determined for this thing to move expeditiously " said one nyse official who was told of mr thains plans adding to the pressure on merrill the possibility that citigroup which is also looking for a ceo might be interested in mr thain mr thain handled the merrill directors deftly by saying he didnt know if anyone could handle the citi job mr thain said he did hold discussions with citigroup about its ceo job but declined to comment on whether they became serious "citi has a different set of challenges " mr thain said "its a great company " but "i chose to take this job " mr thain said he spent "a lot of time talking to the merrill board about the magnitude" of losses in the cdo and debt markets "i felt they did a good job of pricing the securities at the end of their quarter " still mr thain said his main concern is that the cdo market overall will continue to deteriorate for a while because of all the assets that are going to need to be sold in coming months some merrill directors believed that mr thain would be a good fit because they saw similarities between him and mr dimon says a person close to the board almost a decade ago mr dimon was passed over for the top spot at rival citigroup by his mentor sanford weill and struck out on his own to become one of the most respected bankers in his role as head of citigroup rival j p morgan chase many citi executives think that had he stayed citi wouldnt be facing its current woes some merrill board members thought mr thain might be similarly motivated to build merrill into a formidable rival to his own former employer goldman sachs some merrill alumni expressed surprise that their alma mater would turn to an outsider and a former rival "its shocking they picked someone from a goldman sachs background " said former merrill ceo dan tully he added that mr thain didnt seem to be a folksy "people person" consistent with the culture of merrill which has a huge brokerage force "i understand hes very cerebral " mr tully said as a youth mr thain put together a ham radio for his mother a graduate of massachusetts institute of technology and harvard from which he has an m b a mr thain spent years at goldman sachs he held a variety of roles from co ceo of european operations to chief financial officer before rising to president in he took the nyse job to have a chance to take a ceo role at an important financial institution one facing a variety of governance and technological challenges heading the nyse mr thain made two big acquisitions one that made the exchange public and the other that made it global but mr thain also relished the details of making trading more efficient for customers at a meeting a couple of years ago with a consultant who was working with the exchange on improving computers on its lower manhattan trading floor mr thain jumped in with questions about what color the prices and data on the screen should be to make the job easier for traders in september a visit to the chicago board options exchange ran long when mr thain asked a series of questions about how the floor traders on that exchange used technology mr thain at times grew frustrated with parts of the job at the nyse especially the ceremonial ones early on he preferred to stay away from twice a day bell ringings on the balcony above the trading floor later he showed up at bell ringings more often using them as an opportunity to show business leaders in person what actually happens on the trading floor mr thain survived at the stock exchange by carefully balancing constituencies and understanding who really mattered he appeased regulators and big investors like fidelity investments by embracing electronics while placating threatened floor traders by doing an initial public offering that made their ownership stakes more than triple in value though the floor traders importance has declined he made enough public pronouncements of support of the trading floor that he avoided an outright revolt from the people who trade at the nyse one of his biggest accomplishments was in getting the euronext acquisition done this spring in the face of a bid by frankfurts deutsche boerse that many european politicians preferred so despite his reputation as an operations person he showed he could get a tough deal done through delicate negotiations "that really impressed the board" of merrill said one person close to the board adding to its confidence was mr thains extensive experience in one of the very areas bedeviling merrill lynch mortgage trading mr thains arrival at merrill comes at a time when wall street is being rocked by billions of dollars worth of losses tied to the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry wall street firms which did everything from lending money to home builders to creating sophisticated securities linked to the real estate are stumbling as the value of those investments has tumbled wall street firms also have been forced to hang onto loans that wary investors now deem too risky wall street firms and big banks have taken or announced plans to take nearly &# billion of write downs in recent weeks wiping out billions of profits for the third and fourth quarters just yesterday bear stearns cos said it would likely post a loss in its fiscal fourth quarter after announcing a &# billion write down tied to the mortgage industry many of wall streets most renowned firms have been hit hard and investors have become concerned about experience levels in the top ranks of some mr oneal for instance had risen through the ranks of investment bankers specializing in junk bonds and leveraged buyouts he became chief financial officer and ran the brokerage operation but most of his experience wasnt connected to the kind of hands on trading desk risk taking and asset concentration that ultimately blew up similarly at citi charles prince who recently resigned as ceo had never ran any of citigroups businesses a longtime lawyer for the firm mr prince wasnt able to integrate citigroups vast empire and didnt have the respect of some rank and file executives its no coincidence say wall street executives that the firms that havent been damaged as badly are led by executives with extensive operational experience "you look at a dick fuld or a jamie dimon and they have dirt under their fingernails " said a person close to citis board mr dimon was the top lieutenant to mr weill as he built citigroup into a financial colossus and was often the bosss fix it man after getting fired in after a falling out with mr weill mr dimon resurfaced at bank one corp in and overhauled it before merging the chicago bank with j p morgan mr dimon is known at j p morgan for scouring the balance sheet and asking about intricate parts of the banks operations mr fuld began at lehman as a corporate debt trader and worked his way up this summer he became personally involved in a number of deals involving lehman as the credit markets turned south the same goes for goldmans mr blankfein a former gold salesman who has gained a reputation as a savvy risk manager and one who peppers executives with voicemails and emails at all hours yesterday mr thain met with a group of about senior merrill executives starting at about p m in the floor executive suite of merrill headquarters one attendee said the ceo designate asked how they thought he had done in a tv appearance first assuring them that "i take criticism well " about p m he went upstairs with a senior brokerage executive and merrills co president mr fleming to attend a client gathering robin sidel contributed to this article
