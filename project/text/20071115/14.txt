capital why some mortgage bailouts make sense while were sorting out the big question about the subprime debacle how to preserve the good hard working bill paying people once barred from the american dream becoming homeowners without repeating the bad fraud reckless lending and fast talking salesmen peddling mortgages to folks who simply cant afford them theres an issue that cant wait a tidal wave of foreclosures interest rates on about two million once popular subprime mortgages known as or because the rate for the first two or three years is lower are poised to jump in the next year many will rise to a range of to from or that would boost a typical subprime borrowers payment by roughly &# a month for many of those borrowers thats the difference between affordable and not theres good reason to presume that someone who stops paying the mortgage will lose the house if that rule is broken lenders and the investors to whom they sell mortgages will grow reluctant to lend even in good times though self interested lenders often decide theyre better off renegotiating a deal with a borrower than seizing and selling the borrowers home foreclosure costs a lender as much as or of the unpaid balance and these arent good times sure a lot of these mortgages shouldnt have been made it was foolish for lenders and homeowners to bet housing prices would keep rising but allowing millions of foreclosures to punish the imprudent isnt smart itll damage entire neighborhoods "its not like repo ing cars where you can move them around " says richard syron chairman and chief executive of mortgage giant freddie mac an empty house loses of its value in six months he says even worse the larger economy is at risk cue federal reserve chairman ben bernanke "a sharp increase in foreclosed properties for sale could weaken the already struggling housing market and thus potentially the broader economy " if renegotiating mortgages is really in the interest of lenders and investors youd think theyd be rushing to avoid foreclosures yet most still use a case by case method ill suited to the dimensions of todays problem "mortgage services are just used to doing things a certain way " says sheila bair chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp "the usual course is not to modify many loans " turning mortgages into securities adds to the complexity its easier to persuade a bank that made a loan and held a mortgage to see the benefit of cutting a deal to avoid foreclosure than to persuade trustees for investors who hold a slice of a large collection of mortgages particularly those with deals that require other investors to absorb losses first so the public policy questions are who should be helped and how some folks should lose property if they cant make payments those who lied on applications or speculated by buying properties for investment although tenants may deserve help temporarily cutting mortgage payments for those who never will be able to afford houses they bought is unwise and doomed to failure its the folks in the middle who need and deserve help from the industry and if need be the government those who are making payments would have refinanced easily if not for the housing bust and dysfunction of mortgage markets and cant afford the reset payments douglas elmendorf a brookings institution economist argues that government "should encourage and subsidize refinancing" for households that can keep their homes "with a modest amount of help " even though "many might not own homes today if risks had been recognized fully" when the mortgages were made there is a loud effort by the bush administration to cajole the industry into moving beyond case by case efforts and to enlist nonprofit groups to reach out to suspicious homeowners with more vigor and specificity than others enough to make some officials uneasy the fdics ms bair has urged the industry to extend the two or three year initial interest rate permanently for homeowners who are current and whose income indicates they can pay at that rate "public cajoling was needed to bring more pressure to bear and we decided to come out with a specific example of how to do it " she explains she says three of top mortgage services are quietly doing what she suggested although she wont name them but george miller executive director of the american securitization forum an industry group says the fdic plan is "neither permitted under the applicable contracts nor does it make economic sense" because "youre likely to be granting windfalls to some borrowers " the industry favors developing better ways to identify groups of borrowers with whom cutting new deals makes sense but then treating each case individually it would be nice if all this could be handled with taxpayer money but thats unlikely theres widespread support for mr bushs proposal now before the u s congress to relax the terms and extend the reach of the federal housing authority to help about lower income households refinance their mortgages currently the fha cant help a homeowner who misses a payment because of a reset rate for example congress will be tempted to cut a deal with fannie mae and freddie mac to loosen government constraints on their growth in exchange for doing more to help subprime borrowers but its far from clear that this is in their interest or the long run interest of taxpayers who effectively backstop the two companies that leaves one bunch of unfortunate victims those who thought they could be homeowners and should have been but will be renters as freddie macs mr syron observes "weve gone way way too far in thinking you can solve the entire homeownership problem on the basis of financing " which raises a tantalizing prospect perhaps some entrepreneurial investor or nonprofit group will buy houses out of foreclosure at low prices and turn them into low cost rentals corrections &amp amplifications certain homeowners who have missed payments on their mortgages are eligible for federal housing administration aid under the new fhasecure program thursdays capital column incorrectly said the fha cant help a homeowner who misses a payment because of a reset rate wsj
