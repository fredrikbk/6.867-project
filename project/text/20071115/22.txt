consider the content not the wrapping the dream of a color blind society will remain elusive as long as we identify skin color as the defining feature of our politicians and of those who will or will not vote for them in the nov front page article "whites great hope barack obama and the dream of a color blind america " you use without irony the word "white" times and the word "black" times missing from this article is any discussion of mr obamas actual policy positions on race national security taxes terrorism or any other issue critical to shaping an informed voters decision it is precisely because of those positions that many will not support mr obama and would not if he were white there may be those superficial enough to cast a vote because of a politicians skin color or gender but an informed electorate in a "color blind america" will make voting decisions based on meaningful distinctions between the candidates unfortunately articles such as this do nothing to advance that goal nor give the american voter credit for being able to look beyond the politics of group identity robert j siegel m d atlanta i loved the story of the response of mr obamas father to the bigot in the barroom wouldnt this be a different world if we could have responded in the same way to it would have taken an extraordinary leader to persuade the american people at that tortuous time to not lash out or seek revenge but to appeal to our higher selves it was our chance to be a light to the rest of the world and we blew it i see mr obama as a much needed antidote to the bush era we have greatly disappointed the rest of the world who once saw america as the highest example of hope freedom and diversity mr obama has a chance to restore the worlds faith in us revamp our smeared image and reconfirm our own commitment to the ideals for which we stand with his background he could make this message his campaign centerpiece in a way that no other candidate possibly could linda gregory denver color blind sorry that means treating people equally regardless of skin color those who would vote for mr obama based on his skin color are no less prejudiced than those who would not vote for him based on his skin color the prejudice just runs in the opposite direction it is naive for white americans to think they can demonstrate their lack of prejudice by voting for a black candidate for president just as it is naive for men to think they can show they are not sexist by voting for a female candidate for president black or white male or female a politician is a politician is a politician voters beware david jensen issaquah wash
