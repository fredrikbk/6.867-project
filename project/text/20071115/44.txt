glaxo to add avandia warning change compounds marketing hurdles for diabetes drug the new heart attack warning on the label of glaxosmithkline plcs once blockbuster diabetes drug avandia will likely add to the companys challenge in marketing a product shadowed by a serious safety question under pressure from the food and drug administration glaxo agreed to a "black box" warning that says an analysis showed avandia "to be associated with an increased risk" of ischemic events such as heart attacks in which blood is choked off from the heart however the new warning also says the overall data are "not conclusive " the fda said it doesnt have enough evidence to show that the risks of heart attacks or death for patients taking avandia are different from those for people on other diabetes medications despite the hedged language glaxo may have an uphill fight to convince doctors that avandia is an attractive alternative to rival drugs that dont carry a similar warning particularly takeda pharmaceutical co s actos which is similar to avandia sales of the glaxo drug which were gbp billion &# billion world wide last year have plunged since the may publication of a medical journal article by cleveland clinic cardiologist steven nissen that raised concerns about its possible heart risk avandia sales in the first nine months of this year fell globally to gbp million and in the u s to gbp million when compared with the same periods in glaxo reported both actos and avandia already have black box warnings about a different side effect heart failure a chronic condition in which the heart has trouble pumping blood but heart attacks may be a bigger concern for doctors because unlike heart failure they can come without warning and be immediately fatal in addition diabetes patients in general tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems the new warning will also apply to the glaxo products that combine avandia with other treatments called avandaryl and avandamet in a win for glaxo the fda also said it would ask makers of other diabetes drugs to note in their labels that they hadnt been proven to reduce cardiovascular risk the agency said glaxo will do a study that is supposed to provide clearer answers to the safety questions surrounding avandia it is expected to take as long as four or five years to complete with final results expected by the end of march in fda officials said they expected to see interim information before the study is finished though that appears to grant glaxo a window of time before the agency might reconsider whether avandia should remain on the market fdas own staff split over that question with some officials who focus on the safety of drugs after they are approved calling for the medications removal an internal agency drug safety board voted that avandia should still be sold in the u s according to a letter from republican sen charles grassley of iowa an outside fda advisory committee said that while avandia carried a heart attack risk it should still be sold in the u s a glaxo spokeswoman declined to forecast avandias future sales "as we have done all along we continue to support avandia " she said "from a sales perspective obviously physicians can have confidence in the label to consider avandia as a good treatment option " she also said glaxo views it as "significant" that other diabetes drugs will get label language noting their lack of proven cardiovascular benefit
