mississippi hoods it isnt often that a state attorney general finds himself on the wrong end of a lawsuit then again it isnt often that a state attorney general has such a cavalier approach to the law as mississippis jim hood since hurricane katrina the ag has been waging a legal and pr war against state farm and other insurance companies a populist campaign that helped win him a second term last week weary of being a political pinata state farm has now turned the tables with a federal lawsuit against mr hood the suit accuses him of breaching a non prosecution agreement using his power to retaliate against the insurer over separate litigation and colluding with tort lawyers to purloin documents and assist in their lawsuits the details are colorful if you find legal abuse entertaining mr hoods low jinks were supposed to have ended in january when state farm agreed to settle the insurer had been fighting a hood civil suit for refusing to pay for flood damage even though its policies clearly excluded such claims but when mr hood cranked up a criminal probe and state farm lost a case in court the insurer decided to cut its losses state farm agreed to reopen some claims and to pay off suits brought by mr hoods friend and political ally tort baron dickie scruggs it also wrote a check for &# million to cover the ags investigation costs in return the prosecutor signed a paper agreeing to "conclude" his investigation and to "not bring criminal charges against state farm or any of its employees " however this is mississippi after federal judge l t senter jr blocked the settlement on fairness grounds mr hood promptly reneged by june he had ginned up another complaint against state farm this time for breaching the settlement that the judge had declared invalid by august mr hood was busy with a new criminal investigation despite his prior legal agreement not to do so state farm then filed its countersuit and its complaint is a study in the marauding tactics of the modern attorney general most revealing are details showing how closely mr hood worked with the trial bar a strategy designed to pressure state farm to settle both with the state and the tort posse many of these details are wrapped up in a separate case involving a state farm contractor e a renfroe not long after katrina tort king mr scruggs convinced two renfroe employees sisters cori rigsby moran and kerri rigsby to steal documents to aid his civil litigation against state farm according to previously filed court documents the women were performing this clandestine work for mr scruggs however the state farm complaint says mr hood also knew about the rigsby sisters and that they were also acting as his agents in collecting state farm documents state farm says this amounts to "warrantless searches and seizures of state farm property" a valid point given that prosecutors have subpoena power precisely so they can obtain documents legally if this is true mr hood was allowing state informants to simultaneously conduct discovery in aid of mr scruggss private litigation the state farm complaint also notes that former mississippi attorney general mike moore "acting as an agent of attorney general hood was involved in compiling information from state farm for use by attorney general hood in his criminal investigation of state farm " it also points out that mr moore has appeared as a private attorney for policyholders suing state farm the idea of a lawyer working both in a criminal investigation for the state and as a private attorney for plaintiffs is ethically outrageous renfroe later sued the rigsby sisters to have the documents returned and the state farm complaint says mr hood was "angered" by that litigation and wanted state farm to pressure renfroe to drop the case as state farm and mr hood continued to talk about a settlement this february the complaint says mr moore working as "attorney general hoods agent " sent an email to state farm officials stating "can we get renfroe sic settled its sic holding up progress on my end " two days later mr moore sent another email to state farm "i am told that the renfroe lawyers made unreasonable demands for resolving the issues on the rigsby sisters issue today i am going to wait til tomorrow to report to the attorney general what they are up to because the response will not be pretty " a federal judge later found that messrs hood and scruggs had "teamed up to bully state farm into civil and criminal settlements " and ordered mr scruggs to return the documents instead mr scruggs defied the judges order by shipping them to mr hood this caused federal judge william acker in june to request that the u s attorney prosecute mr scruggs for criminal contempt once again mr hood rode to the rescue of his partner in shakedowns sending a letter to the u s attorney requesting that she not prosecute mr scruggs because he was a "confidential informant" of the state the prosecutor acquiesced which inspired an angry judge acker to appoint three special prosecutors mr scruggs is due to be arraigned shortly before thanksgiving by the way mr scruggs made a &# campaign contribution to mr hood in july about a week after receiving it mr hood sent a letter to federal authorities confirming hed re initiated his criminal probe of state farm and that this time he viewed renfroe as a "potential co conspirator " you cant make this stuff up mr hood has tried to keep all of this under seal but were delighted to make it public the hood scruggs story is all too typical of the way state attorneys general and the tort bar are teaming up to shake down political targets congratulations to state farm for fighting back
