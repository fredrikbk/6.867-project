half open market operations chairman ben bernanke has announced his latest attempt to make federal reserve deliberations more transparent which means the fed has moved from the muddy to the merely murky monetary policy will still be set by mr bernanke working out of his hip pocket though sometimes hell let us see more of what is in that pocket two things struck us as notable from yesterdays announcement the first is that mr bernanke downgraded the feds reliance on so called "core" inflation readings which means a price basket without food and energy some of our friends joke that this core measure includes prices on everything except what people actually buy we think its mostly been a distraction that makes inflation seem lower than it is and that the fed should focus on the overall price level so good riddance the second point is that the full employment and balanced growth act of deserves to be repealed also known as humphrey hawkins this is the law that mandates that the fed consider both price stability and full employment in making monetary policy decisions mr bernanke noted yesterday that this dual mandate makes it impossible for the fed to target only inflation the way say the european central bank is mandated to do it is in pursuit of this dual mandate that the fed sometimes takes its eye off the prize of price stability most recently with alan greenspans decision to hold interest rates too low for too long this decade we are now living with the housing and financial boom and bust consequences if mr bernanke really wants to be "transparent " hell tell us what lessons he and his fellow high priests have learned from this episode the only official whos fessed up so far is dallas fed president richard fisher who in a brave speech blamed "backward looking" inflation data for persuading the fed to stay too easy for too long we think the feds mistake was watching lagging indicators like "core inflation" through the rear view mirror even as more forward looking market indicators like asset and commodity prices as well as the declining dollar flashed red more openness is nice but setting monetary policy by a genuine price rule would be better
