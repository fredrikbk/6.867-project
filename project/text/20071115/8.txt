at starbucks too many too quick jokes about the ubiquity of starbucks have become almost as common as the coffeeshops themselves there are so many a comic once cracked that one had just opened in his living room now that breathless growth is showing serious stress for years starbucks corp has been able to throw up new stores sometimes placing them across the street from each other while sales at older stores still climbed at break neck speed but in the past year the growth in starbucks same store sales revenue and number of transactions in the u s has slowed when starbucks reports earnings today investors will be closely watching to see if growth in the average number of transactions per store which essentially measures customer traffic declines for the first time since starbucks began disclosing the number three years ago "the underlying fear is that starbucks is finally seeing the signs of saturation in the u s " says john glass an analyst at cibc world markets who follows the stock starbucks has about locations in the u s or about more than it did just two years ago in its hometown of seattle there is one starbucks for every residents that doesnt mean there isnt room for more starbucks in the u s for example vermont the state with the fewest starbucks locations has just four the company plans to almost double its presence in the u s by one day having locations the concern is that the company has been adding locations so quickly that the new stores are cannibalizing the old ones to the point where the chain cant increase its same store sales at the rapid pace to which investors have grown accustomed in the past year shares of starbucks have fallen about more broadly starbuckss recent attempts at expanding its brand have had mixed results while its strategy to sell music has been a hit with customers baristas recently gave customers free songs from itunes with their coffee the films it has promoted in stores have had only minimal box office success some analysts say the chain has fallen behind on creating enticing new beverages and its breakfast sandwiches have created little excitement investors knew that starbuckss u s business would eventually mature but theyd hoped that the chains international business would be churning out strong profits that would pick up the slack that hasnt happened yet in part because starbucks is still spending to build stores and other infrastructure in new overseas markets which has slimmed international profit starbucks declined to make executives available to comment chairman howard schultz has said that throughout the companys history outsiders have questioned the companys growth potential and that hes always proved them wrong executives point out that starbucks accounts for less than of coffee consumption in north america in august chief executive jim donald told investors that the impact of cannibalization the company is seeing from new stores is the same as it was many many years ago generally the sales lift from new stores outweighs their negative effect with older stores nearby eventually bouncing back what has investors worried is that for the past two quarters the growth in transactions per store in the u s has been flat after climbing for several years same store sales which measures sales in locations open at least a year have hovered in the mid single digit range after years of growing at a high single digit or double digit rate each quarter much of that may not be starbuckss fault pressures on consumer spending havent made it any easier for starbucks to increase sales particularly because starbuckss customer base has gradually broadened to include americans with lower average incomes a group more likely to cut back this summer a spike in dairy costs caused the company to implement its second price increase in less than a year and competition has intensified mcdonalds corp has bolstered its coffee offerings and plans to add lattes and cappuccinos to thousands of u s stores next year some analysts say starbucks needs to stop building stores in the u s so quickly for now starbucks is planning to add about next fiscal year or the same number as this year although starbucks has added stores quickly ever since mr schultz began expanding beyond seattle in the late s the growth rate in the u s really took off in the past two years in big cities starbucks needed to add stores in order to whittle down its long lines during peak times the rapid expansion convinced investors there was much more room for starbucks to grow now some people on wall street think that two year expansion binge "has been a regrettable move " says david palmer an analyst at ubs "that has helped create acute concerns in the marketplace about the future of starbucks " over the next two years he expects starbucks u s store growth to slow "meaningfully " others contend that starbucks had little choice but to grow quickly "it seems like everyone in the world wants to sell coffee " says sharon zackfia an analyst with william blair &amp co she points out that although starbucks same store sales and traffic growth have slowed the company is still getting a strong return on its investment in new stores and that the weakness of the economy makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly whats hurting starbucks "i dont see any reason theyd want to cut back on new store openings " she says its unlikely that starbucks management will curb its ambitions much mr schultz has said his goal is to build one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world at starbuckss annual meeting in march mr schultz told how when the company went public in an analyst wrote a report doubting the companys prospects "the analyst headline which was picked up by a newspaper said this dog wont hunt " he told the audience in those years starbucks market capitalization went from &# million to &# billion "i had it in my desk drawer for many many years " he said "this dog wont hunt "
