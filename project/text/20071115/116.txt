style on style inside a salon that serves the logo phobic in a corner of new york city yuta powell caters to women who shun ubiquitous labels shari markbreiter a year old new york interior designer is no stranger to luxury shopping she seeks a wardrobe that signals to her clients that she has great taste but she doesnt want to buy her clothes from one of the big heavily logoed fashion brands "to me logos speak more of mass merchandising " she says when ms markbreiter bought an oscar de la renta handbag recently she removed the logo tag even as luxury fashion labels expand all over the world pitching their brands to a broader audience ms markbreiter is part of a coterie of shoppers who are moving away from recognizable labels in search of something else these women want exquisitely made but subtle clothing and accessories that dont shout "fashion " in new york some of these women are gravitating to the small three year old yuta powell salon hidden in a pair of suites on the third floor of the hotel plaza athenee the salon takes understatement to the extreme it has no sign on the street which virtually eliminates foot traffic clients tend to be loyalists referred by word of mouth and they usually call before stopping by ms powell who once ran givenchy and carolina herrera shops in new york doesnt see eye to eye with big fashion today "this is style not fashion " she says glancing around her tiny boutique which consists of two cozy rooms and several racks of suits dresses gowns and accessories a couch is positioned for clients to rest with a cup of tea or glass of champagne ms powell scours paris london and new york for designers mainly independent of the big luxury chains whose attention to detail fine fabrics and workmanship set them apart in her opinion she then demands that they work with her by altering their designs or supplying extra fabric for alterations the designers include boudicca tomasz starzewski azzaro jean louis scherrer kiton loulou de la falaise and charles chang lima while there is nary a logo in sight at the salon there is an intense attention to detail when ms powell inspects her merchandise she gets down and dirty with such details as snaps which she says should be covered with the fabric of the garment or at least its lining and the amount of fabric inside the seam thats available to expand the garment some fashion observers see yuta powells customers as part of a backlash among a certain set of luxury buyers against fast fashion trendy logos and heavy branding interest in a quieter form of luxury is contributing to the growing success of bespoke clothing such as custom shoes and shirts as well as nonlogo brands like bottega veneta says milton pedraza chief executive of the luxury institute a new york consumer research firm all over "paris and london its the same chain stores louis vuitton and hermes " says another yuta powell client theresa havell who is president of new york hedge fund havell capital management llc the yuta powell salon is not for everyone the salon butts up against virtually every fashion industry trend the pressure to sell trendy clothes and high profit margin accessories to leverage a brand with logo merchandise to offer unlimited choice the salon managed to ignore the entire recent trend of hip hugging waistlines for instance this is slow fashion fewer but better clothes says ms powell "funnily enough when people start buying haute couture they start buying much less " she says even the purchasing process is slow few customers walk out with the days finds which are usually left to be fitted by the stores dressmaker mary ellen burgos ms powell and ms burgos who has worked with ms powell for years think nothing of ripping apart a designers work to make something new like creating a skirt and camisole from a scherrer dress as ms burgos recently did for a client ms powell a swedish woman who speaks seven languages is a veteran of the paris london new york fashion scene as a student in paris she was hand plucked by hubert de givenchy to work in his atelier and she later ran the givenchy franchise on madison avenue for years until mr givenchy retired even some designers who sell to ms powell see the store as an unusual fashion outpost "thank goodness she found us because wed never have found her " says sarah broach the sister of boudicca co designer zowie broach "shes a secret and she has these amazing customers " a recent boudicca gown displayed the kind of workmanship ms powell seeks a basketball sized flower made of layers of origami like fabric and hung as an exterior bustle but designed to fold flat as the wearer sits down customers spend on average &# on an outfit at the salon ms powell says prices range from just under &# for a belt or jacket to well into five figures for full couture still her business is relatively tiny selling about &# million worth of clothing each year on a recent day the stores wares included an unusual tweed riding jacket by loulou de la falaise who was once yves st laurents muse and a white wool felt jacket by scherrer in september it had clothes from the gerald watelet runway collection including a sand colored trench coat of fluffy wool that ms powell put with a silk blouse and plaid cashmere pants the full couture outfit which would look elegant but not loudly attention getting on the street could be ordered for &# recently ms havell bought a charles chang lima trench coat from ms powell first ms powell suggested that ms havell substitute her own leather belt for the tweed belt next ms powell suggested she bring the coat back at the end of the season to turn it into a dress which is exactly what ms havell plans to do "yuta shows you that an accessory goes beyond a signature handbag " she says
