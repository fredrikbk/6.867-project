web sites cast a net over striking writers with no restraints under guild rules upstarts lure talent as the television world tries to stave off the effects of a writers strike upstart internet entertainment sites are waiting in the wings hoping to steal viewers and possibly writers a new crop of web entertainment sites has popped up in recent months many of them featuring scripted episodic short form content known as "webisodes " the online offerings include web sites that feature video shorts such as break com scripted original series such as "quarterlife " a episode series from top tv producers marshall herskovitz and edward zwick known for the series "thirtysomething" and "prom queen " the web only drama produced by former walt disney co chief executive michael eisner still more are coming down the pike such as frames com a site promising material from luminaries like joel and ethan coen who directed "no country for old men" and "fargo " former united talent agency executive brent weinstein heads up the company his old employer incubated it some of these ventures see the current strike as a way to attract attention much the way cable tvs prominence rose during a writers strike in the late s because the sites generally arent parties to writers guild of america agreements the guilds strike against film and tv studios is seen as an opportunity to attract talent break com is actively trying to recruit out of work hollywood scribes "striking writers strike gold on break " blares a pitch on its homepage accompanied by a picture of a woman with a mock strike placard "check out breaks special striking writers contest " it reads the site promises &# to the striking writer who creates the video most watched by break users so far the contest has attracted mostly queries rather than entries says breaks chief executive keith richman spark capital partners llc a boston venture capital firm with investments that include online entertainment is heading to los angeles this week to meet with a handful of disgruntled writers "i dont know if its an opportunity or a defense mechanism but they want to talk with me about content that doesnt go through the studio system " says todd dagres a partner at spark he declined to name the writers but said several were "showrunners" top writers with producing duties on two of the top five network shows one adjustment for screenwriters the budgets for such online work are typically in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than the millions some writers are indeed contemplating making the jump to the web striking outside the disney studio last week ed bernero chief writer for "criminal minds " talked a good game about the online future "if we cant reach a deal with the studios ill just call google or yahoo or one of those companies and make a deal myself " mr bernero says the companies may have trouble recruiting writers guild of america members largely because of confusion over what writers may and may not do while on strike some writers believe strike rules preclude them from writing for anybody even if it isnt studio content but a spokesman for the guild said the rules dont prohibit members from writing for new media for companies that havent signed agreements with the guild "we encourage members however to consider trying to cover their new media services by having the employer sign a made for new media agreement " the spokesman said "and we will continue signing such agreements even during a strike " online video companies are hungry for more professional material than what typically arrives in over the transom videos looking ahead a few years the future of online video could lie more in series of clips much like episodes of television shows rather than one off clips "advertisers like buying episodic things because its predictable " says mr richman of break which is aimed at men ages to one of breaks most popular shows is a series it licensed from general electric co s nbc

association with hollywood bigwigs funnyordie com created by actor will ferrell and writer director adam mckay is already benefiting from the labor action with several new skits spoofing the strike

strike will bring in more viewers "when there is nothing but repeats on television people will go searching for alternatives " he says mr shearer says those who do will notice the difference both creatively and commercially "no homogenization due to network and studio interference " he says "no being bombarded with multiple minute "pods" of second ads and promos " still much of the content for these sites comes from amateur contributors rather than professional production companies at sony corp s crackle com chief executive josh felser calls them "emerging talents " after noticing that a clip about slacker zoo workers was gaining a lot of traction on the site his team cut a deal with the creators now they are creating a five part series based on the piece "st james zoo " which will
