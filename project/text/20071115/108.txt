seeing red fusiliers by mark urban walker pages &# the dedication to "fusiliers" mark urbans enthralling account of a british regiment during the american revolution has a certain poignancy in our own day "to those who serve honorably in unpopular wars " on the british side the american revolution was indeed unpopular only king george and his american secretary a position somewhat analogous to that of donald rumsfeld could muster steady enthusiasm for pressing on with the war especially as the empires presumed victory proved ever more elusive and yes the rd royal welch not welsh fusiliers the focus of mr urbans attention not only served honorably but fought like bloody hell through the entire brutal six years from lexington and concord in to the surrender at yorktown in leaving rank and file and officers dead in every major battle and skirmishes in between sampling from journals diaries and letters mr urban gives us a chance to share the pain in effect to campaign with the generals captains lieutenants and teenage "pipsqueak" subalterns of the rd and with the rough and tumble privates although there was a large loyalist population in america the majority of colonists were strong for separation from the crown thus british soldiers the hated "lobsterbacks" often portrayed in american history books as the cruel automatons of a relentless occupying force were cursed spat upon and showered with rocks long before the war began the rage was often returned in kind a british brigadier wrote of the american rabble rousers "the people here are a set of sly artful hypocritical rascals cruel and cowards i must own i cannot but despise them completely " as mr urban makes clear the typical redcoat officer or man in the ranks was no worse and no better than any human being caught up in the exigencies of war among the officer class generally there were strong differences about whether the war should be fought at all "for the schism between whig and tory ran deep within the army " mr urban writes in england the whigs were fervent opponents of the kings policies toward america "this debate about whether the americans were brothers or not would continue for years to come " in any case king george the prime minister lord north and the american secretary lord germain prevailed the war prosecuted to the fullest was long bloody and intensely agonizing the american reader of "fusiliers" may well find himself like a chess player given the black pieces instead of the white making a mental readjustment becoming intensely concerned about the fate of certain brave fusiliers and worrying about their fate at the hands of "the enemy" i e revered american patriots the fusiliers already years old in and with a valiant reputation earned in the european wars of the s and s had long been an elite unit the name comes from a weapon the rd no longer used the fusil a lightweight musket with a flintlock firing mechanism but by the time the regiment landed in america it was full of new untested recruits and in the early fighting around boston it displayed ineptitude indiscipline and cowardice a few soldiers even deserted to the rebels officers of the rd were appalled and began instituting strict military reform by late the royal welch had gotten control of itself and by the battle of new york in it was one of the best units in the british army several companies of the rd were then trained as elite "light infantry" units troops who deploy quickly and "had mastered skirmishing moving in small groups and exposing only the minimum necessary to shoot at their targets " one light infantryman said "we have learned from the rebels to cover our bodies if theres a rail or tree near us " the americans who had fought in the french and indian war had learned this form of petite guerre from the indians now the british army was adapting the form to its purposes so successful were such tactical companies that in an ironic twist gen george washington who had himself fought in the french and indian conflict trained companies of his army to imitate the british mr urban it should be said is a diligent researcher having discovered much of the material about the fusiliers in an exhaustive hunt through the attics and libraries of britain but he is above all an exciting writer who brings war to horrifying life as the rd charges up bunker hill attacks philadelphia or creeps through the swamps to capture charleston at the end of the whole ordeal some fusiliers were chosen by lot to give themselves up as captives at yorktown the rest returned to england with the rest of britains defeated troops it is the ending that americans celebrate even if mr urbans readers may feel a twinge of ambivalence mr crabb is a writer in new york
