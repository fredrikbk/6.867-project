readback when normal mailer was nobody s the naked and the dead was written before he was famous and that is its greatest blessing online edition some critics say "the naked and the dead " norman mailers first novel was the best book he ever wrote for the next years his work went downhill i doubted that because i thought "the executioners song " published in was a very fine piece of reporting and writing but i have finally read "the naked and the dead " and now i think they might be right "the naked and the dead" was published in when mr mailer who died on nov at the age of was only years old the book was no on the new york times best seller list for almost three months and new yorks literary salons swiftly embraced the author as the next hemingway a blustery mans man who could spin a yarn mr mailer began running with a swank crowd and got regular mentions in celebrity gossip columns the effect was like being "shot out of a cannon " he said in a pbs interview "the naked and the dead" was mr mailers only work as a nobody and thats its greatest blessing unmannered and unselfconscious young mr mailer drops you into a small philippine island during world war ii where u s troops are trying to break a japanese line daily life is sporadically dangerous frequently uncomfortable and usually boring grunt labor clearing jungle building roads no liquor no sex occasionally a platoon mate kills or is killed sharing close quarters with random strangers the mens emotions steam boil and erupt many times while theyre holding loaded guns its not hard to picture mr mailer who served as an army rifleman in the philippines during world war ii sharing a canteen of hooch with his characters theyre profane they hate women except in bed and they use their considerable street smarts to compute the best angle for surviving military service it doesnt take long for them to realize that the japanese are only one enemy another is their own commanding officers in all of the pages of what some have described as the greatest novel about world war ii there is never a battle that lasts for more than a few minutes the picture of war as depicted in movies couldnt be more different from the experience of mr mailer and tens of thousands of other soldiers even in the backwaters of the war the men could see how cheap their lives were how randomly and stupidly they could die though many were uneducated mr mailers characters developed complex philosophies about life and death most early critics applauded "the naked and the dead " but it was considered "controversial" by some because of the soldiers frequent obscenities it was a book sniffed an english newspaper that "no decent man could leave lying about the house or know without shame that his womenfolk were reading it " by todays standards the vulgarity would hardly raise an eyebrow mr mailer doesnt write for womenfolk in his world women exist only as extensions of men mothers wives sisters or girlfriends all of whom turn out to be either saggy old frumps or gold digging cheaters mr mailers own record in the romance business wasnt good he was married six times and he stabbed his second wife almost to death in a drunken fury feminist writer kate millett in her book "sexual politics " described mr mailer as "a prisoner of the virility cult " for the greater good i decided not to allow his juvenile misogyny to rob me of the pleasure of his company mr mailer won the pulitzer prize twice in for "the armies of the night" and in for "the executioners song " even he conceded that his fame and success had changed his attitude toward his work "when youre a professional you have a much better sense of the odds against you in doing something " he said in a interview with the academy of achievement "so you make hard calculated judgments the same way a professional athlete will you make a great many decisions on the basis of whether you can bring it off in the writing or youre taking too big a chance and youre going to mess up your book and waste a great deal of time " call me an idealist but i think its too bad more nobodies like norman mailer dont have the chance to waste time
