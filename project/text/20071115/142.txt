wonder land the long goodbye its too bad barack obama wasnt able to meet abbie hoffman i dont know if hillary clinton ever met hoffman who died in but like any young person up and running in america in the late s she knows him well one of the touchstone events in u s political history was the democratic convention in chicago in the summer of among the demonstrators arrested put on trial and acquitted for battling the police amid photogenic clouds of tear gas was abbie hoffman a founder of the youth international party aka the yippies years later hoffman said "revolution is not something fixed in ideology nor is it something fashioned to a particular decade it is a perpetual process embedded in the human spirit " last weekend sen obama said this is more or less bunk what he actually said on fox news was "there is no doubt that we represent the kind of change that senator clinton cannot deliver on and part of it is generational senator clinton and others they have been fighting some of the same fights since the s and it makes it very difficult for them to bring the country together to get things done " after sen obama said that the s were so over sen clintons camp counter spun that he had alienated voters over really in this age of paint by the numbers political campaigns there is no chance wed ever get to hear sens obama and clinton discuss whether the s belong in the doggie bag of history still there are a few other interested parties we would want to invite to our mythical summit on the s such as john mccain during an october tv debate sen mccain noted that sen clinton wanted to spend &# million on a museum at woodstock a concert he missed because "i was tied up at the time " his quip about being held in a north vietnamese prison camp from to may have been scripted but boy did it hit the target there should be one more participant a man who wont mince words about the age of aquarius nicolas sarkozy the new president of france when mr sarkozy was campaigning in april against the socialist segolene royal he said "in this election it is a question of whether the heritage of may should be perpetuated or if it should be liquidated once and for all " he described the political left born out of that period as "cynical" and "immoral " in nicolas sarkozy was years old john mccain was and hillary clinton was barack obama was it is not beyond imagining that the precocious messrs sarkozy and obama were alert to events in but for the first wave of baby boomers just touching adulthood that year it was the beginning of a strange journey nearly any one of the events that went off in would have been enough to dominate another year to list what actually happened that year even today boggles the mind and spirit the year began with sales of the beatles album "magical mystery tour " in retrospect it was a premonition in late january north korea captured the uss pueblo and crew members a week later the north vietnamese army launched the tet offensive on feb walter cronkite announced on cbs news that the u s had to negotiate a settlement to the vietnam war on march sen gene mccarthy defeated incumbent president lyndon johnson in the new hampshire primary aided by antiwar students that sen mccarthy called his "childrens crusade " two weeks later lbj announced on tv that he would not run for re election one week later martin luther king jr was assassinated it was only april there were race riots everywhere on april students occupied five buildings at columbia university protesting the war in may bloody student riots erupted in france likely witnessed by the impressionable mr sarkozy on july valerie solanas shot andy warhol in a new york city loft the next day sirhan sirhan assassinated robert f kennedy jr in august the soviet union occupied czechoslovakia seven days later antiwar demonstrators at the democratic convention fought pitched battles with the chicago police on nov having absorbed all this the people of the united states voted they gave of their vote to richard nixon and to hubert humphrey alabama gov george wallace got four years later george wallace was shot and wounded while running for president lasted a long time whatever civic culture the u s had until the s it was now transformed after we had a new kind of political and social culture pounding like a jackhammer into the older bedrock the country cracked look at those popular vote numbers half the country went left and half went right barack obama says these endlessly booming babies have been at it for years hes right though lets note that like the war of the roses this one is waged today with the tireless recruitment of new fighters not born when the fires started in check the web its hard not to share sen obamas weariness with these people even if one is over but is he right to imply that their long fight has lost its point i dont think so what fell out of was a profound division over what i would call civic vision one side which took to the streets in chicago or occupied columbia university concluded from vietnam and the race riots that america in its relations with the world and its own citizens was flawed and required big changes their defining document was the march kerner commission report announcing "two societies " separate and unequal the press incidentally emerged from vietnam and the riots joined to this new permanent template that too has never stopped the other side was well insulted it thought america was fundamentally good though always able to improve the voting rights act of passed on a bipartisan vote opposed mainly by southern democrats this sides standard bearer called the u s "a shining city upon a hill " but after no democratic presidential candidate would ever speak those words nor will mr obama ever repeat mr sarkozys explicit repudiation of that era if its hillary versus rudy mccain or even the placid mitt romney we will be in those streets again besides her candidacy comes with jumpin jack flash himself bill clinton would it be a good thing if the countrys politics said bye bye baby to the children of probably but it wont happen this time correction the nov column by daniel henninger " the long goodbye " incorrectly said that robert kennedy was assassinated in july it was june also in some early editions it said that george wallace had been shot dead campaigning for the presidency in he was shot and paralyzed the error was corrected for later editions wsj nov daniel henningers nov column " the long goodbye " said incorrectly that eugene mccarthy defeated lyndon johnson in the new hampshire primary that year president johnson received of the vote to sen mccarthys president johnson declined to put his name on the presidential preference ballot and sen mccarthy won of the states delegates wsj nov
