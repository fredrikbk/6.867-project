beijing olympics games backers play up green as protesters gear up olympic sponsors craft plans to avoid the fray beijing concerns are mounting that the beijing olympics could face a rash of bad publicity if so how can corporate sponsors avoid getting hit that is the billion dollar question keeping public relations experts busy as activists gear up to attack china on everything from its human rights record at home and abroad to the quality of its toys and air the scrutiny threatens to take what was originally seen by many multinationals as a certain pr bonanza a chance to attach themselves to the immense national pride surrounding the olympics in the worlds most promising market and turn it into a potential headache already some activist groups say they are broadening their attention from attacking chinas government to targeting olympic sponsors in letters sent last month to olympic sponsors robert menard secretary general of reporters without borders a paris based group promoting global press freedom warned "we plan to publicly challenge those companies that are participants in the beijing games without doing anything in the area of human rights we will address their shareholders their clients and the general public " next week olympic dream for darfur a new york based activist group protesting chinas support for the armed conflict in sudan plans to release a report grading olympic corporate sponsors on their attempts to influence the chinese government the group gave passing grades to only a few sponsors china has been under pressure because it has large investments in sudan and is perceived to be using its influence to prevent united nations intervention in the conflict the darfur activists are a force to be reckoned with in the last year pressure from such groups has prompted some u s states and several universities including harvard to divest billions of dollars from companies linked to sudan "this will only get more uncomfortable for organizers and sponsors " says jill savitt the groups director in response pr executives are swinging into high gear companies operating in china are "absolutely focused" on minimizing their potential exposure to issues such as darfur and tibet during the olympics says richard edelman president and chief executive of edelman public relations whose firms clients include general electric co and coca cola co as games veterans "top sponsors are bracing themselves " says chris renner president of sports marketing firm helios partners china which advises a subsidiary of volkswagen ag the official car sponsor "the bad pr stuff its inevitable " several olympic sponsors appear to be hoping to avoid the red flags by going green focusing on environmental projects in china which have become a growing concern there coke is playing up its water conservation efforts on the yangtze river and putting natural refrigerant coolers and vending machines at all olympic sites since march volkswagen has been planting thousands of trees in inner mongolia ge is touting its role selling ecofriendly products such as solar power and water filtration systems for the olympic venues by concentrating on the environment companies can show they are acting responsibly and score points with the chinese government while avoiding politically charged issues such as taiwan or darfur pr executives say mr edelman calls it a "win win" situation olympic sponsor johnson &amp johnson is playing up its role as a good corporate citizen with a host of public service style ads offering health advice some others such as adidas ag are hoping to avoid the issue by sticking to the message that the games are about sports not politics the high wattage media glare of the olympics has historically heightened controversy judging improprieties during figure skating events and a bribery scandal tarnished the salt lake city games the athens games saw more doping incidents than previous games but experts say sponsors are more at risk in beijing partly because of the record sponsorship fees which total an estimated &# billion including more than &# million from individual companies who hope to tap chinas booming markets no sponsors have pulled out and none is expected to do so because they have all signed agreements a range of issues from darfur and tibet to human rights grievances within china is making close association with the games potentially more risky executives say and the risks could be heightened by technology any attempt by the chinese government to quash dissent and protests is likely to be caught and broadcast to millions via the internet or cellphone cameras "its like lenin no mao meets youtube " says moises naim editor in chief of foreign policy magazine which is published by the carnegie endowment for international peace dr naim says he knows several activist groups with action plans for the olympics "it will certainly happen i dont know the scale but i do know there is intensive preparation " sharon hom director of new york based human rights in china says the activists efforts to generate controversy around the games could be bolstered by the recent spate of china made product recalls getting american consumers to care about human rights in distant china was difficult she says "but if you say the reason you are getting contaminated food and toys all of these things directly affecting you is because the chinese government is not accountable and transparent i think that that link is going to be easier to make " coca cola has struck partnerships with at least some of these groups in the last few years the beverage giant started an ambitious set of water conservation initiatives in partnership with the world wildlife fund among other things the project has a five year &# million budget to improve the quantity and quality of water for local communities along seven river basins including the yangtze the company is also working with greenpeace on supplying environmentally friendly vending machines and refrigerators at olympic sites such projects arent just green washing ahead of the olympics says greenpeace director lo sze ping the olympic vending machines "are just the first step " says mr lo such a move could trigger an industrywide transformation greenpeace hopes "were not being used were very careful working with coke " he says coca cola spokeswoman christina lau says the olympics is "a way to step up our environmental initiatives " but said the projects had long standing goals that would continue past for ge one of the newest sponsors serving as a backer is still "a large experiment " said steve bertamini ges head of greater china "cost remains an issue selling to china " since ges eco friendly products are relatively costlier than normal alternatives the company has sold &# million of products for the games a fraction of its overall china sales of &# billion but the beijing olympics is a vital showcase for ge which is vying for business supplying the shanghai expo and the asian games in guangzhou both scheduled for geoffrey a fowler in hong kong contributed to this article
