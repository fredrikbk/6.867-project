on a roll without the stones mick jagger is one of rocks iconic figures but since his name has conjured the image of a rail thin man preening and peacocking across the stage as he sings in front of the rolling stones though hes recorded four albums and many other tracks under his own name the year old is rarely thought of as a solo artist "the very best of mick jagger" rhino presents him minus the stones and the surprise of this strong track set is not that hes good but that this quality work somehow slipped by us mr jagger is more than a cultural icon hes a talented musician and songwriter "rock fans get very invested in image and iconography " he told me recently when he called from his home in london "its great but it gets in the way it works for you in some ways but it doesnt in other ways people say oh that sounds like the stones or it doesnt but i see it all as part of a whole " he said "im a singer and musics important to me and ive got to deliver the songs " the compilations oldest track is s "memo from turner" from the film "performance " in which mr jagger starred and the newest is s "old habits die hard" from the film "alfie " three tracks are culled from two solo albums from the mid s when mr jagger and band mate keith richards had a public spat "i started to think i wasnt working hard enough " said mr jagger of that period in the s "but then it became fun to have another avenue of expression its something you can do any time you want its not like a second job " he told me a french rock critic once confessed to him that he rejected mr jaggers first solo efforts because he thought it meant the stones were breaking up indeed mr jagger chose not to promote the stones release "dirty work " in favor of recording a solo disc now he says "i have different types of work not just music but also film production whatever i do im focused on that " "the very best of mick jagger" doesnt unfold chronologically nor do the most familiar tunes come first perhaps the two most recognizable songs his duet with david bowie on "dancing in the street" and "dont look back" with peter tosh are tucked in down the line his biggest solo hit "just another night " is the third track "i programmed it like it was a show set list " he said of the album "i wanted that sort of wave to it it starts off strong i didnt put too many ballads on it though i dont know anyone who listens to cds in order any more " there are obvious echoes of the stones in the collection the instrumental bridge in the powerful opener "god gave me everything" evokes "gimme shelter" the "miss you" like falsetto in "sweet thing" also features a solo by saxophonist bobby keyes a frequent stones contributor and there are nods to the jangly bar blues that the stones still play better than anybody in rock but perhaps the strengths of his solo efforts are best revealed by the discs three previously unreleased tracks a cover of sonny boy williamsons "checkin up on my baby" "charmed life" from the sessions for his third solo work "wandering spirit" and "too many cooks " produced by john lennon and written by willie dixon at the suggestion of producer rick rubin "checkin up on my baby" was recorded in with the red devils a los angeles based blues band when mr jagger was growing up in dartford kent "sonny boy wasnt one of my favorite blues singers " he told me "not like muddy waters or howlin wolf taj mahal did a version of the song that i liked " does he ever think about doing an album of blues standards "i do indeed " he replied "but i always think i have to do things with a twist maybe i should throw away the twist " though he chose to omit "charmed life" from "wandering spirit " mr jagger now concedes its a strong track for the compilation he remixed it with producer ashley beedle his daughter karis added a backing vocal "i forgot to send it to her " he said chiding himself "id better do that tonight " "too many cooks " the lennon produced track came from a series of jams held in in los angeles a variety of musicians turned up at the record plant mr jagger recalled on this date jesse ed davis and danny kortchmar played guitar al kooper keyboards jack bruce bass and jim keltner drums "we were just having fun there must be tons of recordings of jams from those sessions i dont know what happened to them " mr jagger says hes recovered from almost two years on the road with the stones hes co producing a remake of "the women " the film he was in boston not long ago to celebrate with cast and crew and working with martin scorsese on the finishing touches to "shine a light " a documentary about the stones coming out next april as for the band "i just saw keith and charlie watts yesterday " he said "yeah everybodys fine " as for his music "im about to start writing songs " he said whether for the stones or future solo projects he didnt know mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
