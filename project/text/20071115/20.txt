china tries to revive a technology beijing china is trying to revive a controversial soviet era technology largely abandoned by the west as it struggles to overcome inefficiencies in its national power grid chinas power distributors have been advocating development of an ultrahigh voltage power grid that would transfer large volumes of electricity from remote inland regions rich in coal and hydropower to economic powerhouses along the coast state grid corp the state owned company that controls most of chinas electricity grid is overseeing a pilot project launched last year that will link parts of shanxi province with jingmen city in the central province of hubei via a kilovolt alternating current transmission line the technology has plenty of critics ultrahigh voltage ac technology has been out of favor elsewhere in the world since the soviet union fell and since power demand stagnated in japan in the s even the chinese government concedes it isnt yet commercial but state grid argues that the new technology which would theoretically be more efficient because it would bypass existing provincial power lines by taking electricity directly from the source all the way to coastal provinces is necessary to prevent damaging bottlenecks in chinas aging power grid china has outshone countries such as india in connecting of its population to the national electricity grid but the risk of blackouts remains the international energy agency recently warned the paris based watchdog said china needs to spend billions more to update its power grid china needs to invest &# trillion through with most of that coming from the chinese central government the iea said in its latest world energy outlook if added to spending on generating capacity the cumulative investment over the next two decades could reach &# trillion equivalent to a quarter of the worlds total the iea said chinas fast growing economy is outstripping the countrys ability to provide enough electricity to fuel growth leading to bottlenecks and periodic power shortages last year china added more than gigawatts of power generating capacity equivalent to frances entire installed capacity but much of that new power is found in areas that have coal mines or hydroelectric dams and are far away fromthe coastal regions where most of the power hungry factories and cities are located getting the electricity from the power plants to the cities has been a major hurdle to chinas growth for example two thirds of chinas hydropower capacity is concentrated in mountainous tibet and the adjacent provinces of sichuan and yunnan according to state grid chinas monopoly power distributor in all but five provinces "the operational stability of the companies in the sector requires more urgent measures to be taken to improve the grid connectivity " said ma shang an analyst at fitch ratings "until that happens there remains a risk of inefficient investments "
