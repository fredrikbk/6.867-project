music test can a firm profit from free tunes new label believes ad sales on web site will subsidize unrestricted downloading amid a seemingly endless slide in music sales the industry is constantly casting about for new ways to make money from its product the latest experiment give it away online and enlist advertisers to cover costs the fate of a new company rcrd lbl pronounced record label will be a test case a joint venture of downtown records the independent label behind gnarls barkley and others and peter rojas a journalist and entrepreneur who founded the respected technology blogs gizmodo and engadget rcrd lbl is a hybrid record label and blog its releases are to be posted on the companys web site for downloading free and unrestricted by digital rights management software that limits copying the company has signed up three sponsors so far richard bransons virgin america inc airline nikon corp and ppr sas puma ag sneaker unit the site will also include short articles social networking features and internet radio stations rcrd lbls plans could be read as either a step forward for the ailing music business or an acknowledgment that the once thriving industrys core product is increasingly worthless as a consumer proposition already this year one of the biggest rock bands in the world radiohead offered its new album to the public in a digital form permitting consumers to decide what they would pay data collected by comsscore inc indicated that around of the people who downloaded the album opted to pay nothing radiohead has disputed that statistic without offering its own figures the idea of an ad supported model such as rcrd lbl envisions has gotten some traction in the music world recently in a negative report on warner music group corp earlier this month pali research analyst richard greenfield wrote "a new model for music consumption must emerge and that model most likely involves drm free downloadable music at no cost to consumers fully supported by advertising " this mr greenfield said is a direct result of the fact that "an increasing majority of world wide consumers simply view recorded music as free " that report helped push down the stock of warner music almost in a day josh deutsch chairman of both downtown records and rcrd lbl is not touting the new venture as a panacea for the ailing industry after all hes keeping downtown in business "im not saying rcrd lbl is the answer " mr deutsch says "but its an answer to the question of how do you monetize music " album sales have fallen this year compared with last year a trend that shows no sign of reversing given those "sobering" numbers mr deutsch says "if youre not trying to monetize the experience of sharing music youre slowly going out of business " john josephson a managing director at allen &amp co llc and a downtown records investor says the new venture is part of the labels vision for "a business model that is reliant on multiple revenue streams " rcrd lbl has signed contracts giving it the right to distribute a handful of songs from to bands including some but not all of downtown records artists for instance there are no plans for downtowns marquee act gnarls barkley the duo behind last years alternative hip hop hit "crazy" to contribute music to rcrd lbl on the other hand the hot indie rock band cold war kids and high profile rapper mos def both signed to downtown will have music on the site rcrd lbls artist contracts are unusual chiefly in that they make the company the exclusive distributor of a specific number of songs not for an acts entire musical output as is the case in traditional record deals "its a blog " says mr deutsch "were not necessarily trying to tie you up for your fifth album " big name advertisers have generally shied away from even the most influential music blogs since most of the music they include is posted without permission thanks to their involvement with rcrd lbl the company says it is launching in the black artists with songs on rcrd lbl wont get a cut of advertising associated with their music theyll get advances mr deutsch characterized as modest for each song they give the label these advances range from &# a song for the least established artists according to people who work in the music industry and escalate for bigger names to around &# rcrd lbl will divide with its artists any money that it makes from licensing their music to television shows movies or tv commercials several established and influential independent labels including the tastemaking warp and ed banger labels plan to participate via their own sites which will include free downloads and advertising and are linked to rcrd lbl rcrd lbl isnt the first effort to deliver music free of charge legally with advertiser backing but there are key differences that have helped it generate far more buzz than predecessors a start up music service called spiral frog has won mostly bad reviews for its ad supported service that combines drm software with a cumbersome and intrusive system for displaying ads also working in rcrd lbls favor its backers are two bankable names in their respective fields with strong track records and at least among insiders strong followings mr rojas who is rcrd lbls chief executive calls the new ventures name "a cheeky take on what were about were a record label but were not a record label " mr rojas years old says he has never worked in an office despite having sold engadget as part of weblogs inc to time warner inc s aol he is getting his first out of home workspace when downtown and rcrd lbl move into new soho offices in the near future mr deutsch grew up in the major label system he now says is withering he was a top executive at elektra records and virgin records both of which have been shuttered in recent restructurings nonetheless high hurdles remain for rcrd lbl it is unclear for instance whether music fans will view as credible a blog that exists largely to promote its own commercial products messrs rojas and deutsch say they will post music from other labels too as long as they can secure the rights and think their readers will be interested another uncertainty whether up and coming bands will be willing to lock up their best songs in a contract that is virtually guaranteed never to generate hit sales meanwhile big acts who like radiohead have fulfilled the obligations of traditional record contracts and are without a label may see little benefit in dealing in a new intermediary between themselves and fans
