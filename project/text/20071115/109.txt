sec chairmans proxy pitch loses steam coxs proposal enhancing shareholders clout in board elections lacks support washington one of christopher coxs top priorities is hanging together by a thread the securities and exchange commission chairman has been trying for most of this year to give shareholders more power to influence the election of company directors his various proposals have come under fire from companies investors democratic senators and even an sec commissioner yesterday testifying before a senate panel mr cox said he still wants to expand shareholders role in director elections an issue known as "proxy access " but he also said that for the coming round of annual meetings which typically take place at the end of the first quarter he would like to maintain the "status quo" for the sake of "clarity " that suggests the sec will allow companies to reject shareholder proposals related to director elections as it has in the past and that any concerted effort to revamp the process will have to wait until the year after next failing to pass such a rule would be a setback for mr cox who is entering what is likely to be his final year as chairman mr cox prides himself on being the investors advocate and has said multiple times in speeches that federal proxy rules should not stand in the way of shareholders choosing the boards they want right now mr cox doesnt have the votes to broaden shareholders rights nor will he until the president nominates and the senate confirms two new commissioners to fill slots left by departing democrats the two current republicans oppose changing the proxy rules the senate recently recommended corporate lawyer luis aguilar and regulator elisse walter to fill the open slots people familiar with the matter say a spokeswoman at the financial industry regulatory authority or finra the securities industry regulator where ms walters is senior executive vice president regulatory policy &amp programs declined to comment on her behalf a call to mr aguilars office wasnt returned the nominations were reported by the washington post it could be months before the likely nominees are in place and they may not necessarily be as supportive of easing the rules as previous democrats in july mr cox cast votes for two opposing proxy proposals one that would allow investors with a stake of to set forth proposals that change the process of director elections the other would allow companies to disregard those proposals in recent weeks mr cox has come under fire by key democratic members of congress who have advocated scrapping both concepts shareholder groups arent happy either arguing that a threshold is too high and democrat sec commissioner annette nazareth who announced she is leaving soon has advocated that the agency wait until there are five commissioners a sentiment echoed by democrat senators yesterday in front of the senate mr cox said he agreed the agency needs to go back to the drawing board and later told reporters that the threshold was one of the "fundamental" areas that needed to be addressed he brushed off concerns that the agency needed to wait until there were five commissioners telling reporters that the sec has passed at least rules without having a full set of commissioners failure to put in place some kind of rule before the proxy season would be dangerous he told the senate panel because it could spur investors to sue amid the confusion the california public employees retirement system the nations largest public pension plan called mr coxs claim a "red herring " in prepared testimony dennis johnson senior portfolio manager at calpers said "the only uncertainty about proxy access comes as a result of the mixed messages from chairman cox concerning the secs intent to adopt a new and improved proxy access proposal next year " in testimony mr cox said he could only speak for himself since his testimony doesnt reflect the view of all the commissioners
