interest rates and dollar fundamentals is the dollar down or is the euro up it is the same thing viewed from different sides of course yet the topic is too often viewed from just one side looking at the dollar alone many economists blame the fed for lowering interest rates viewed from the other side however one might wonder why other central banks have not lowered their interest rates rising currencies are not necessarily a sign of strength the u s dollar rose sharply before and during the recession of the trade weighted index of the dollars value against currencies rose from march to january as the stock market and economy tumbled a graph in the aug issue of the economist showed that "countries whose currencies have gained most against the dollar are high interest rate economies such as turkey brazil and new zealand commodity producers such as canada or a mixture of both such as australia " central bank interest rates are in turkey in brazil in new zealand in australia and in the u k high interest rates may prop up a currency for a while by attracting international "hot money " but super high interest rates like those in turkey and brazil are typically a symptom of inflation prone monetary policy requiring a high risk premium to bribe investors to hold that countrys ious in any case high interest rates are certainly not something most americans would envy or hope to emulate the spectacular rise of the canadian dollar was more closely tied to the price of oil than to interest rates although the bank of canada did raise interest rates in july just before the fed began nudging rates down while prices of oil and gold were soaring exporters of oil and gold such as canada could trade their wares for more u s technology and services such improved "terms of trade" typically raise the global demand for the assets of commodity producing countries and thereby raise their currencies other commodity exporting countries such as australia and to some extent the u k also see their currencies rise whenever the price of their exports rises faster than the price of their imports trade deficits have nothing to do with it australias current account deficit is a bit larger than that of the u s as a share of gdp and britains deficit is not much smaller currencies of commodity exporters likewise fall when commodity prices fall when the price of oil fell in early late and the canadian dollar fell substantially even though central bank interest rates were higher in canada than in the u s many currency and commodity traders have recently made leveraged bets that prices of oil and gold could only go higher but the expression "trees dont grow to the sky" does not just apply to stocks what about the euro interest rates set by the european central bank ecb are now about the same as in the u s but that is something quite new in june the euro discount rate was only while ours was today they are both at until recently the ecb had pegged its interest rate on "main refinancing operations" mro as much as percentage points below the equivalent u s fed funds rate that gap between u s and euro interest rates widened in and early unsurprisingly the euro then fell to per dollar from november to march down from its level at the end of the fed stopped raising rates after june but the ecb continued to push rates higher as a result the gap between u s and euro interest rates first narrowed and then vanished as the fed eased unsurprisingly the euro rose the euros recent rise involved betting on the expectation that the fed will soon cut interest rates again but also that the ecb will not follow suit yet the ecb has always followed the feds interest rate moves albeit quite slowly the ecb did not begin reducing rates until may five months later than the fed and the ecb did not put rates above until december a year later than the fed in past episodes of rising oil prices and all major central banks raised interest rates in unison that always ended in a world recession which was belatedly followed by deep cuts in central bank interest rates after the oil spike of august november when the fed funds rate was above the fed failed to reduce interest rates significantly until a year after the recession ended those calling for higher central bank interest rates when oil prices rise should realize that such policies have in the past resulted in interest rates of two or three years later arguably too low and too late after global industrial slumps slashed the price of oil this time the fed was first to jump off that rusty old bandwagon unilaterally that obviously affected exchange rates however this does not necessarily mean other central banks have been pursuing a wiser course there are two sides to every exchange rate perhaps it is time for the other side notably the central banks of europe canada and the u k to take their turn at reducing interest rates even if the fed sits this one out mr reynolds a senior fellow at the
