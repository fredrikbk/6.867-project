the afternoon report thankless travel online edition ahead of a holiday dedicated to devouring a ground loving bird president bush is set to back those whose feathers have been ruffled by paying more to fly and enjoying it less white house handlers said mr bush will announce a series of moves this afternoon during a pennsylvania avenue gathering with mandarins from the transportation department and the federal aviation administration part of the plan may include new rules to increase the payment from &# to over &# that ticket holders receive if they are excluded from an oversold flight the phenomenon of being bumped is just one aspect of flying that has turned off travelers of late lateness has been another gripe through the first nine months of this year the average on time arrival rate at the nations busiest airports fell to from a year earlier according to the department of transportations bureau of transportation statistics also adding to the mix is a string of well publicized horror stories for travelers such as februarys jetblue airways meltdown in which ice storms cancelled some flights and stranded some passengers on runways for more than hours trying to head off tougher federal measures addressing delays several airline executives testified before the house transportation committee thursday on holiday travel prospects saying they were preparing to care for passengers delayed by the weather or air traffic congestion jetblue airways ceo dave barger acknowledged that "we let our customers down" last february but he said added deicing equipment and crew and more customer service personnel mean "jetblue is ready for the holidays " referring to the next generation air traffic control system that some view as vital to fixing air travel problems rep john

edged up as a whole the mild inflation numbers indicated that the recent sky high surge in crude costs hasnt yet hoisted prices for the broader economy still rising fuel costs could clip the nascent recovery of u s airlines and that scenario is prompting some investors to push for combinations among carriers the most recent merger rumblings revolve around delta air lines which yesterday said it had formed a special board committee to evaluate strategic options including mergers the disclosure followed hedge fund pardus capital managements statement late tuesday calling for delta to merge with ual in the statement pardus which owns shares in the two carriers said "it is imperative" that delta "enter into a merger transaction with another carrier given the rapid rise in fuel prices and the increased risk to the business as a stand alone entity " still no one is saying that ticket prices are set to slip any time soon so unless mr bush a former pilot himself announces that hes open to plane pooling on air force one most americans are likely looking at a costly and somewhat cramped start to the holiday traveling season next week caution prevails as stocks waver new economic data and
