politics &amp economics howard loses favor as australia shifts bush ally may fall as ties with china gain prominence perth australia several of president bushs staunchest overseas allies have fallen from power in recent years now another one is on the ropes john howard the prime minister of australia polls suggest that mr howard australias second longest serving premier and his conservative liberal party led government are likely to lose power in a parliamentary election nov if that happens it would topple one of mr bushs key supporters on global issues such as the u s led fight against terrorism and on climate change the election could also signal a broader policy shift in australia as the resource rich nation forges closer ties with china australia supplies the coal iron ore and other raw materials china needs to fuel its economic boom and ties between the two countries would probably strengthen under a new australian government mr howards opponent year old labor party leader kevin rudd is a former diplomat who speaks fluent mandarin chinese and has long made a priority of increasing australian links to asia at a recent economic summit in sydney he upstaged mr howard by chatting in mandarin with visiting chinese president hu jintao mr rudd has also suggested he may push for greater independence from the u s in setting foreign policy he intends to pull many of australias troops from iraq for example and has advocated more aggressive action to curb emissions linked to global warming some political analysts say its too early to count out mr howard years old who has already served four terms as prime minister although he currently trails in polls by several percentage points mr howard has fought back from the brink before including in australias last national election in he is known for his common touch connecting with voters on his regular jogs and in other informal public appearances mr howard could benefit from a widely held perception that his conservative liberal party deserves much of the credit for australias recent economic success on his watch australia has emerged as one of the worlds most dynamic economies with unemployment at its lowest level in decades and growth expected to hit this year a mandatory retirement savings program has helped australians accumulate wealth that theyre now investing aggressively across the globe the country of million people sits on vast reserves of natural gas coal and other raw materials increasing australias importance as many commodities are enjoying record prices last week home grown mining giant bhp billiton announced an acquisition bid for rival anglo australian miner rio tinto plc valued at more than &# billion still many australians have grown tired of mr howard a polarizing figure who is closely identified with mr bush and the u s led war in iraq several years ago mr howard was quoted referring to himself as mr bushs "deputy sheriff" in asia like the bush administration his government has refused to ratify the kyoto protocol the international accord aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions many younger australians view mr howard as hostile to environmental causes and committed to a harsh brand of free market capitalism highlighted by his governments moves in recent years to give employers more leverage over workers in setting wages and other benefits other bush allies have faced a backlash at home including spains jose maria aznar who was voted out of office in and former british prime minister tony blair who stepped down earlier this year mr rudds career appears to symbolize australias shift toward closer relations with asian nations after growing up in a dairy farming family in queensland state he took an early interest in asian affairs and studied chinese history in college he later joined the countrys diplomatic corps and rose rapidly through the ranks serving in the australian embassy in beijing in the s he also worked as a consultant and later emerged as a labor party star in part because of his foreign policy experience about of australias exports now are sold to china compared with less than in the early s fewer than of australias exports are shipped to the u s compared with about in the early s despite a free trade agreement reached with the u s in mr rudds boyish looks have earned him a series of nicknames in the australian press including "pixie " "harry potter" and "the milky bar kid " he has stressed that he wont seek to end australias close political and security ties with the u s which go back decades but he has also said he believes the u s led fight against terrorism has made australia less safe and he has promised to pull about troops from iraq though he would leave several hundred more security personnel in the region part of what makes mr rudd a serious threat to mr howard analysts say is that he has nudged his traditionally left leaning labor party closer to the political center on a number of issues he has suggested he will promote many of the free market economic ideas put in place by mr howard and his party has promised to deliver large tax cuts much as mr howard has done the labor party has also appeared to moderate its stance on some environmental issues indicating it now supports efforts to require developing nations such as india and china to participate in global emissions reductions targets a position that also mirrors mr howards views australias liberals and labor supporters "are almost the same party" these days says saul eslake an economist at anz bank in australia but that may play to mr rudds advantage economists say by making voters more comfortable with the labor party in a speech yesterday officially starting his partys campaign mr rudd pledged to boost government investment in education and skills training as well as asian language studies "to equip the next generation of australians with the languages of the major economies of the future " he also repeated that he wants australia to have its own voice in global affairs "i want australia to lead and not just follow " he said mr howard has fought back by recalibrating some of his positions to appeal to voters who otherwise might lean toward mr rudd he has appeared to soften his stance on climate change by indicating he now believes australia needs to take some steps to reduce emissions in case global warming becomes a big problem he has also announced billions of dollars of government spending and tax benefits including tax free savings accounts for first time home buyers and tax rebates for education and child care but some of those moves could backfire mr howards reputation as an economic mastermind has already taken a beating in recent months amid signs that inflation is heading above the central banks preferred target of about a problem that could be exacerbated by both parties aggressive spending plans in mr howard told voters his party could be trusted to keep interest rates low a critical issue in australia where many homeowners hold mortgages with adjustable interest rates since then the reserve bank of australia has raised interest rates six times to combat inflation including a quarter point hike in early november australias benchmark rate is higher than in corrections &amp amplifications former spanish prime minister jose maria aznar retired
