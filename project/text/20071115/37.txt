dont be a square at the post office theres a surcharge card makers feel boxed in by rules favoring rectangles mr friedmans debacle at the giants hallmark cards inc and american greetings corp they occupy a remote corner of the business buffalo n y the square has four equal sides and four right angles it is a regular shape to the u s postal service however the square is "unusual " its sorting machines built for oblongs cant find the address on a square envelope people have to do it thats why the post office imposes the square surcharge the square surcharge has been around since machine sorting began in yet even those who knew about it rarely knew how many stamps to put on a square letter postal clerks often didnt know either so square letters mostly got delivered anyway then last may the post office launched a new "shape based" initiative mailing a one ounce oblong costs cents a one ounce square costs cents including a cent surcharge for squareness at a manhattan post office not long ago a window clerk named thomas merritt took one look at a square envelope and said "nonmachinable i would not use that shape period " among square envelope advocates such thoughts promise little joy to the world best wishes or happy anniversaries alan friedman for one is sending the post office no valentines mr friedman who is years old owns great arrow graphics a small company housed in a former windshield wiper factory here in buffalo great arrow makes greeting cards square greeting cards "squares " mr friedman said one rainy tuesday "are the most current and most exciting product in paper communications " he was on his shop floor where young printmakers were mixing inks inking silk screens and stacking racks of cards for christmas several cards had drawings on them of round ornaments "look at the interplay between the circle and the square " said mr friedman holding one up "its the aesthetic the balance such a compelling format " of the seven billion greeting cards americans buy each year squares are a minority at the giants hallmark cards inc and american greetings corp they occupy a remote corner of the business but small companies that rely on them like mr friedmans feel theyre victims of postal shapism its bad enough when grandmas birthday card comes back stamped "postage due " its worse when grandma herself has to pay the extra cents afraid of deflating card customer cheeriness some card shops are chucking their squares into the circular file "square cards went over big right away " says stacy bock a san francisco sales rep for great arrow "then the post office cracked down and there was this spasm people had bad experiences with square cards if you put a stigma on something long enough retailers arent going to deal with it anymore " ms bock adds "the poor square its such a beautiful thing " at oblong books &amp music in the downstate village of millerton n y the card rack held only one square birthday card on a recent sunday it was imported from the united kingdom where the royal mail still recognizes equilateral equality "squares are nice but theyre too much trouble " said oblongs manager lisa wright "weve had to phase them out its really very obnoxious of the post office to charge extra for squares " that was the sentiment the greeting card association tried to convey cordially at the postal regulatory commissions hearings in washington last year on the push for shape based postage it called on andrea sue liss founder of hannah handmade cards in evanston ill who testified to "the novelty of the square" and its "basic appeal to people beyond what they might put into words " plato ms liss told the commission "regarded the square as being absolutely beautiful in itself " the romans she noted based many buildings "on the geometry of the square and its diagonal the ad quadratum " she quoted carl jung the founder of analytical psychology who wrote "the frequency with which the square and the circle appear must not be overlooked " squares said ms liss embody "traditional symbolic meanings " including honesty stability integrity morality and solidarity at the postal service however squares embody extra handling its official philosophy derived from decades of debate with mass mailers is that envelopes needing extra handling need extra postage cent stamps in the case of square letters at great arrow graphics these tidings werent glad from square cards for christmas mr friedmans silk screeners are down to nine this year other greeting worthy occasions have been fully oblongated for instance death "nobody wants sympathy cards returned " says mr friedman "we dont mess with sympathy " in his sympathy line only pet sympathy is still square some square great arrow designs are being printed now on oblong cards for those remaining the shop has devised an oblong envelope with a middle pocket that squares slip neatly into a cent stamp is all they need mr friedmans square christmas card sets with their new oblong envelopes are going on sale this season packed in oblong boxes "were just trying to avoid the whole debacle " he says yet mr friedman is a man of goodwill whose thoughts about the postal service are as kind as those expressed in his greeting cards with an added twinkle of bemused curiosity which is why he was happy to leave his shop early this day for a drive across town and a visit to the usps buffalo processing and distribution center "the post office is caring " he said walking up a ramp from the parking lot "it embraces its neighbors one of its quaint beauties is that you never quite know whats going to happen if everything worked like clockwork it wouldnt be enough fun " he passed through a set of doors into a square foot room and shook hands with tony mazurkiewicz manager of in plant support "im fascinated to see what makes square envelopes so hard for you " said mr friedman handing him a shape based pricing template mr mazurkiewicz said "its the machines " for an hour he took mr friedman down a trail of belts bins and troughs from the dual pass rough cull past the advanced facer cancelers to the delivery bar code readers every step had reject pockets mr mazurkiewicz reached in and pulled out the squares "wouldnt you think " mr friedman asked "that a machine could somehow know in an instant if a piece of mail needs to be rotated to read the address oops upside down turn it around ok " "in fact they dont " said mr mazurkiewicz "a square is like an suv turning a corner it could be a rollover " rectangular envelopes are always knocked down by sorting machines onto one of two long stable edges ink detectors find the stamps front or back upper right or lower left it then takes only two steps flip and turn to line them up for a computer to read addresses and spray on bar codes but squares land on any one of four edges not two so for half of them mathematically finding addresses takes four steps when the machines fail humans get involved at a cost mr mazurkiewicz explained of &# per thousand envelopes instead of &# "couldnt you absorb the cost " mr friedman asked moving along to the manual sorting area where senior clerks were slipping nonmachinable squares into old time cubbyholes as mr mazurkiewicz began discussing postal pricing and aspect ratio differentials mr friedmans focus seemed to drift from his shape based worries his eyes settled on the clerks and the cubbyholes "i love that letters are touched by people here " he said "it costs more money " said mr mazurkiewicz but his guest had wandered off to gaze at a procession of postal trays spiraling upward on a blue conveyor "the ballet of the mail " mr friedman said he watched for a few more moments and then with feeling he added "the post office really is a very beautiful organization " see related letter "letters to the editor mailing on the square" wsj nov see related letter "letters to the editor stamping out solutions" wsj dec
