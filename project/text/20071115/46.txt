fertility therapies under the microscope as couples rush to embrace genetic screening egg freezing other high tech treatments debate grows over their value as medical science continues to churn out ever more sophisticated methods to treat infertility from egg freezing to genetic screening of embryos desperate would be parents rush to embrace the latest techniques but some fertility experts worry that procedures of limited benefit are unfairly raising patients hopes just last month a new embryo screening technique created immediate buzz when it was announced at a meeting of fertility experts a parent group hailed it as a "breakthrough" that may improve womens chances of having a baby through in vitro fertilization the american society for reproductive medicine which hosted the meeting awarded the technique a prize for outstanding research but that same day a related group of experts issued a warning a committee of the asrm together with the society for assisted reproductive technology released a statement urging caution about certain kinds of genetic embryo screening due to insufficient scientific evidence about the usefulness a similar concern was noted about egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation for healthy woman who want to preserve their eggs for use later in life the statement called the technique "experimental " such warnings join a host of concerns including some raised by a recent study in the new england journal of medicine that question the usefulness of advanced fertility treatments for many patients while such treatments are offered with all kinds of caveats that no baby is guaranteed the marketing of them may play into the fears of patients facing an emotionally fraught decision at their worst critics say some treatments may interfere with patients goal of having a baby and they are expensive often costing thousands of dollars "some doctors might say its the best technology available " says richard scott professor of reproductive endocrinology at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey whose lab produced the asrm award winning work "thats too low a standard " dr scott who would confine screening to women who have had multiple miscarriages says doctors must be certain they can say "this is useful " but others contend that the decision should be left to patients "to people who want this theyre willing to take these risks " says pamela madsen executive director of the american fertility association who herself used in vitro fertilization to have her babies nearly years ago that procedure known as ivf involves implanting a fertilized egg in the uterus embryo screening is a technique meant to improve the success rates of ivf called preimplantation genetic screening or pgs it seeks to weed out embryos with an abnormal number of chromosomes pgs is based on the idea that fertilized eggs with the standard chromosomes are healthier than those with too many or too few a condition known as "aneuploidy " three copies of chromosome for instance causes downs syndrome "in theory its great " glenn schattman chairman of the society for assisted reproductive technologys practice committee says of pgs "many miscarriages occur because of genetic abnormalities it would be great to be able to screen all the embryos a woman makes pick out the ones that are normal and put back the ones that are normal " the problem is that there is little evidence to suggest that screening chromosomes for general aneuploidy actually improves the odds of having a baby only targeted screening of specific chromosomes in high risk women those who have suffered repeat miscarriages has been found to be worthwhile the belief is that a higher percentage of these womens eggs are chromosomally abnormal pgs differs from the more well known preimplantation genetic diagnosis or pgd which detects diseases caused by single gene mutations such as cystic fibrosis only recently were two randomized controlled studies of pgs published the latest which came out in july in the new england journal of medicine not only found no benefit of pgs on fertility rates but also suggested it could actually decrease ivf success in older women one possible reason is that the screening process which involves taking a cell from the embryo for testing can damage it "available evidence does not yet support the routine screening of chromosomes to improve the live birth rate " says andrew la barbera scientific director of the asrm and professor at the university of cincinnati college of medicine who wasnt involved in the study some researchers disagree jacques cohen research director at reprogenetics inc of hoboken n j published a rebuttal in the journal asserting that the july study was flawed because the clinic that conducted the work had a particularly high failure rate on the screening procedure instead he said the study highlights the importance of knowing the expertise of a particular clinic despite the debate many companies have embraced screening for the number of chromosomes nearly of ivf clinics reported offering it according to a study published last year in the journal fertility and sterility the cost of such treatment ranges from &# to &# on top of other ivf expenses that typically range between &# and &# a cycle say fertility experts similar issues exist with deep freezing eggs for future reproduction so called cryopreservation is widely considered appropriate for women facing sterility inducing chemotherapy but the asrm urges caution to healthy women who are considering the process for nonmedical reasons say to preserve their young eggs for a time later in life when they may want to become mothers the group says egg freezing "should not be offered or marketed as a means to defer reproductive aging" because there isnt solid evidence that it necessarily improves fertility for one thing the freezing and thawing process itself may harm the egg and scientists cant say for sure how long a frozen egg can remain viable most frozen egg births to date have resulted from eggs that were typically frozen only briefly from a few days to nearly a year according to jamie grifo of new york universitys fertility center still cryopreservation is readily available at around &# a pop fertility institutes of encino calif is one company that has started offering the procedure to women regardless of their reason for wanting it the first page of the companys web site is filled with disclaimers about its success rate and includes the asrms caution about egg freezing "we dont bend any of the rules " says jeffrey steinberg director of the clinics who says he has a "big problem" with the idea that young women shouldnt be allowed to defer childbearing this way the excitement at the asrm conference last month surrounded a new technique for pgs presented by nathan treff of the new jersey facility directed by dr scott the technique detects any abnormalities in all chromosomes in an embryo rather than just the chromosomes covered by current technology but this new technique hasnt been shown to actually improve birth rates either though several laboratories are working to test the method in humans the worry for some fertility experts is that the procedure may generate disproportionate excitement among patients promising technologies still need "the scientific proof that it works " says zev rosenwaks director of the center for reproductive medicine and infertility at weill medical college of cornell university due diligence where to find out more
