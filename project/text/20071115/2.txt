an updated and ravishing giulio cesare giulio cesare lyric opera through dec vanessa new york city opera saturday is the final performance chicago its not often that one gets to revel in nearly five hours of beautifully sung handel and be visually entertained at the same time but that was the case at lyric opera of chicagos "giulio cesare" lyric opera imported the hit david mcvicar production first seen at glyndebourne in and cast it luxuriously with many of the same principal singers central to the shows success is its ravishing cleopatra soprano danielle de niese who can sing brilliant ornaments and dance at the same time mr mcvicar and set designer robert jones updated the opera to the early th century cleverly creating an atmosphere of tension around the interaction of a conquering colonial power and an invaded exotic outpost mr jones aided by the subtle work of lighting designer paule constable used a baroque style succession of columns with a rippling sea at the rear for the romans scenes and draped colorful silks for the egyptians rooms caesar first appeared in an army field office with typewriter and telegraph camp chairs and tables costume designer brigitte reiffenstuel suggested the british empire with red uniforms for caesars soldiers caesar had a roman breastplate under his coat and used a mix of bejeweled harem outfits and english clothing for cleopatra a flapper dress a riding outfit and her brother ptolemy a shooting suit to imply the creeping influence of the conquerors the production capitalized on the operas wonderful mix of comedy and seriousness easily making transitions moments like the shocking presentation of pompeys severed head ptolemy kills him to curry favor with caesar and caesars despair at his defeat fortunately temporary in act iii had proper gravity in act i when cleopatra teased her brother about his lack of leadership potential she sang her aria while dancing andrew georges witty bollywood inspired choreography comedy and seriousness intermingled as well ptolemys adolescent petulance had a decadent edge he pawed his sister on more than one occasion and as caesar sang his famous hunting aria "va tacito " he and his opponent ptolemy physically stalked each other in formal dance patterns the production also included several arias that are often cut from the opera making for a richer more nuanced understanding of the story ptolemys general achillas had more opportunities than usual to demonstrate his lust for cornelia pompeys widow we also got more of the buildup to cornelias young son sesto taking revenge for his fathers murder and more of the development of the caesar cleopatra romance the cast expertly led by conductor emmanuelle haim did it all justice with spirit suavity and lavish ornamentation of aria repeats that gave meaning to each one the astonishing ms de niese whose brilliant high notes and creamy effortless legato carried through no matter how much oxygen she required for her dancing captured cleopatras progression from flirt and seductress to a woman capable of despair and dignity the countertenor david daniels who owns the role of caesar sounded splendid as the warrior who can also be seduced as cornelia patricia bardon was warm and more tormented than usual since wayne tigges achillas got to throw her around and sing menacingly christophe dumauxs bright countertenor and athletic prowess he did an impressive forward flip made for an especially virulent ptolemy mezzo maite beaumonts impassioned singing as sesto occasionally lost track of pitch as cleopatras eunuch servant nireno countertenor gerald thompson sang and gamely danced his restored act ii aria with only a bit of breathlessness marring an otherwise delightful performance although ms haim did occasionally exaggerate tempi making the adagios less supple and anguished than they could be she did splendid work with the modern lyric opera orchestra augmented by recorders and continuo players which had sharp th century style articulation and provided a elegant framework for this remarkable production new york as presented by new york city opera samuel barbers "vanessa" had the feeling of a grand opera imitation a well crafted but rather chilly exercise when i saw the same production presented by the washington opera in i was struck by its theatricality and the expressiveness of its post romantic score in the larger new york state theatre with different singers its charms paled in gian carlo menottis libretto vanessa who has been waiting for years for her lover anatol to return shares a grand mansion with her meek niece erika and her mother the mostly silent old baroness an anatol arrives the fortune hunting son of the lover now dead who promptly seduces erika and gets her pregnant recognizing his shallowness erika refuses to marry him attempts suicide and loses her baby so he marries vanessa the two depart for paris leaving erika to assume her aunts old place its all rather chekhovian but michael kahns direction here emphasized the operas campier elements rather than its subtleties lauren flanigan as the larger than life vanessa was in good voice but in diva mode while katharine goeldner tamped down her rich mezzo into a mousy muted performance that diminished erikas anguish and her centrality to the opera we got no sense of anatols suave persuasiveness either as ryan macpherson who withdrew after act ii with an allergy attack was not singing well christopher jackson replaced him for act iii rosalind elias who sang erika in the premiere nearly years ago looked effectively witchy as the old baroness but also sounded that way in her few singing moments as the unperceptive doctor richard stilwell who also sang the role in washington was a little too bumptious michael yeargens elegant set with its greenhouse like living room showed the snow outside and the isolation of the people within while martin pakledinazs costumes deftly emphasized vanessas big personality and erikas repression anne manson effectively dramatized the colors in the score but the orchestra sounded thick without the transparent air of mystery that could give the piece life ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
