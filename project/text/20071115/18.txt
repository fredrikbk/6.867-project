big boards next chief ex trader at goldman may make more deals john thains departure from the helm of nyse euronext comes at a crucial time for the year old big board as it continues to digest two of its biggest deals ever and contemplates further acquisitions in the u s and abroad the great game of international exchange consolidation is in full swing and mr thain has been its biggest champion last year he transformed the new york stock exchange from a clubby nonprofit where buyers and sellers simply met to do business into a well capitalized publicly traded company and earlier this year he oversaw the nyses historic purchase of european markets operator euronext nv the two deals gave the nyse a global reach and set off a scramble for alliances and market share in trading financial securities but mr thain who has been tapped to become chief executive of merrill lynch &amp co is leaving behind a work in progress in recent months he has intimated that the nyse would like to buy another u s derivatives exchange perhaps nymex holdings inc or intercontinentalexchange inc to round out its u s stock trading business and its largely european futures trading business it isnt clear how such a deal might be structured or how much the nyse might pay to expand in the fast growing derivatives business where potential acquisitions are likely to be pricey the nyse also has to compete with cme group inc which runs chicagos two big futures exchanges now those questions will be left to duncan niederauer mr thains no at the big board whom the exchange named to the top job yesterday a former trader at goldman sachs group inc the year old mr niederauer has played an important behind the scenes role in reshaping stock trading in the past decade while working for goldman mr niederauer helped form the electronic stock exchange archipelago holdings which later acquired the parent of the pacific exchange a stock and options market before being bought by the nyse last year mr niederauer who spoke with mr thain at length earlier this week about the exchanges future says he is going to continue the course that mr thain charted that includes looking into buying a u s derivatives exchange "the corporate strategy is pretty solid right now " says mr niederauer he says he will consider deals that make "strategic and financial sense " mr niederauer and mr thain who is also a goldman alumnus are said to see the world in much the same way they are both proponents of electronic trading but they also believe that traders known as specialists who put buyers and sellers together for nyse listed stocks can improve the way stocks trade by smoothing out some of the short term volatility mr thain guided the nyse through some of its most important changes by persuading divergent groups of traders investors and regulators that the nyse should be a public for profit company as opposed to the private club it had been for more than two centuries after completing its initial public offering a deal it arranged in conjunction with its acquisition of archipelago the nyse became a global company by buying euronext as a result more than of its &# billion in revenue in the latest quarter came from its european businesses the deals allowed mr thain to do away with the product line barriers and regional focus that had long kept stock exchanges off one anothers turf they also sparked a flurry of other market alliances from the merger between the parents of the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade to the announced purchases of u s options exchanges by nasdaq stock market inc and deutsche boerse of germany the nyse went public later than some of those exchanges but became a trans atlantic company before most others even so mr niederauer inherits some worrisome trends in the nyses core stock trading business where electronic rivals have gained market share in nyse listed stocks during mr thains tenure and some question whether an nyse listing is worth as much for a company if much of the companys stock trades away from the big board mr thain has been a major asset to the nyse as a savvy deal maker and strategic thinker indeed some observers worry the company might miss a step without him at the helm its stock took a quick dip on the news of mr thains departure yesterday but then bounced back to finish down just cents at &# in p m big board composite trading still mr niederauer who takes up his new role dec has many supporters he "is really the only logical choice " says michael rutigliano managing director at wjb capital a brokerage firm with floor traders at the nyse "im confident the transition will be fairly smooth " mr niederauers style differs from mr thains the punctual mr thain usually dresses conservatively in a navy blue suit with a white shirt mr niederauer attended a recent meeting to discuss a new trading initiative in a fleece nyse vest over his shirt and tie mr niederauer is also more outspoken thats helped in dealing with traders who want to know the bottom line rather than dancing around an issue but it isnt clear whether his more straightforward style will best mr thains reserve in dealing with potential merger partners as well as regulators in the u s and europe "duncan thinks out loud and john is an internal processor " says harold bradley chief investment officer at the ewing marion kauffman foundation who got to know both men while working on trading issues for mutual fund firm american century a case in point is when mr niederauer then at goldman sachs sent an email to a colleague in early questioning whether mr thain had the courage to pursue a deal for archipelago that would take the nyse public during his days at goldman mr thain wasnt a banker who brought in huge deals but an operations guru who quietly cut costs and made sure the firm wasnt taking any outsized risks mr thain quickly got over any hard feelings he might have had over the email and hired mr niederauer in april to be the nyses head of stock trading and a co chief operating officer mr bradley says that mr niederauer played a key role in building a consensus at archipelago in its early days that eventually led to that company becoming the main u s electronic trading engine at nyse euronext "duncan knows trading customers as well as anybody " says mr bradley "he had a vision for the future of the equity markets and with some others he put together many of the pieces that made archipelago succeed " mr niederauer who graduated from colgate university hamilton n y in spent years at goldman he rose through the ranks working in program trading before moving to japan to run part of goldmans japanese trading desk he returned to the u s became a partner in and managed clearing and execution at goldman unit spear leeds &amp kellogg "hes an expert that really has a passion" for the trading business says one senior goldman trader mr niederauer enjoys a reputation as no nonsense executive he had been considered by some a year or so away from taking over at the big board but was largely viewed as the eventual heir to the chief executive post once mr thain left he says he and mr thain arent that different stylewise but have different strengths deals and solving big financial conundrums "come naturally for john " whereas "im a little closer to the market" and trading issues he says
