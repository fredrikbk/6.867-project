tailor made stem cells move step nearer reality monkey embryos cloned by scientists in oregon medical goal is distant the elusive quest to to create tailor made stem cells for use in treating human disease is a small but significant step toward realization as scientists in oregon created embryonic clones of monkeys and derived viable stem cell lines from them a team led by shoukhrat mitalipov of the oregon national primate research center said that it had created monkey clones by using a variation of the process that yielded dolly the sheep the first cloned mammal scientists have since cloned cows cats dogs mice and other species but never a monkey a far closer evolutionary cousin to humans the experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys were first presented to a scientific meeting in australia earlier this year however the research at the time hadnt been assessed by other stem cell experts yesterday the data were published on the web site of the peer reviewed journal nature a separate paper by independent scientists experimentally validated the cloning work dr mitalipov says that he now hopes to do two other ambitious experiments the first is to take a rhesus embryonic clone to full term and thereby create the worlds first cloned monkey more usefully perhaps his team wants to test whether fresh tissue derived from rhesus clones can treat diabetes or other diseases in a monkey a process known as therapeutic cloning success in the second experiment which is by no means assured could strengthen the scientific rationale for conducting similar tests in human patients the idea is to create an embryonic clone of a patient then transplant altered versions of that embryos cells back into the patient because the dna of the transplanted tissue would match the dna of the patient the immune system likely wouldnt reject it dr mitalipov and his research colleagues have prepared the groundwork for such experiments in monkeys in their lab they injected the genetic material from a skin cell of an adult monkey into a monkey egg whose own dna had first been removed this led to an early stage embryo called a blastocyst from which stem cells were then derived finally they put the stem cells in a petri dish and coaxed them into becoming long thin nerve cells and beating heart tissue the technique is far from perfect however although the team generated two embryonic stem cell lines one of them had genetic abnormalities the researchers also used more than eggs from rhesus monkeys to derive their cell lines a highly wasteful process "its not ready to be a cost effective option in humans " because human eggs are harder to come by dr mitalipov said in a conference call with journalists therapeutic cloning in people is a subject of ethical concern because early stage clones which some people consider to be living beings are destroyed when stem cells are extracted from them also worries have been raised that the technique could be abused by renegade scientists who want to create fully developed human clones the field is under a cloud for other reasons in korean researcher hwang woo suk created a stir by publishing a paper in science claiming that his team had extracted material from cloned human embryos that identically matched the dna of patients those results were later shown to be fabricated and the paper was retracted
