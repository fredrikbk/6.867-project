mr thain inherits a firm that like many of its counterparts faces a lot of uncertainty exemplified by the &# billion hit merrill took in the third quarter because of revalued bonds backed by mortgages and other write downs and the choice of mr thain to succeed the ousted stan oneal suggests "the beleaguered financial giant wants a pair of steady hands at the helm " the wall street journal says "for wall street at large the message in the elevation of the low key financial veteran is clear " the journal adds "after an era of go go growth that led firms into profitable but chancy areas like mortgage securities the industry is moving toward the kind of leader who gets down into the nitty gritty of risk management " his profile isnt all that different from the leaders of three wall street

" mr thain has recently hinted the nyse might be interested in buying another u s derivatives exchange like nymex holdings or intercontinentalexchange and it "isnt clear how such a deal might be structured or how much the nyse might pay to expand in the fast growing derivatives business where potential acquisitions are likely to be pricey " the journal adds "now those questions will be left to duncan niederauer mr thains no at the big board whom the exchange named to the top job yesterday mr niederauer is an ex trader at goldman who has played a key behind the scenes role in the evolution toward electronic trading there and then at the nyse however much esteemed mr thain is in the financial community he faces a challenging time when the damage from the housing market downturn
