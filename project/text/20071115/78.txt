mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i am shopping for a new laptop and noticed that some of the models in which i am interested come with windows vista business edition instead of home premium which i understand is the main consumer version what would i be missing if i went with the business version instead a the main thing vista business lacks that home premium includes is a series of multimedia features these include media center which allows you to play songs and videos and view photos from across a room in addition home premium offers windows movie maker software for creating movies dvd maker and several games the business version lacks on the other hand the business edition has some things home premium doesnt including built in programs for doing a complete pc backup for faxing and scanning and for remotely running programs on another computer for the most part however vista business looks and works like home premium q i just bought a new laptop and want to transfer to it the firefox bookmarks i have on my old desktop how can i do that a there are a number of possible methods but heres a simple straightforward approach first you export the bookmarks from firefox on your old desktop pc which creates a single file containing the bookmarks then you copy that file which firefox names by default "bookmarks html " to a cd or portable usb drive or some other medium you can use to transfer files between computers then you copy the file to the new laptop finally you import the file into the fresh copy of firefox on the new laptop to carry out this process you use firefoxs import and export function for bookmarks on the first computer from the firefox bookmarks menu choose "organize bookmarks " then once the bookmark window opens go to the file menu and choose "export " that will create the bookmarks file after the file is on the second computer launch firefox and repeat the process only this time choose "import " and then click on "from file " and select the file you brought over q i have word and have just started to receive word documents which i cannot open what is the best solution a word has a new default file format called docx that is incompatible with older versions which rely on the long standing doc format the new version can be set to always save files in the old format but not everyone knows that or chooses to do so however folks such as you with the version of word can install a free "compatibility pack" from microsoft that will allow your copy of word to read the new format it can be obtained from the companys download center at www microsoft com downloads youll find it listed there under "popular downloads " you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
