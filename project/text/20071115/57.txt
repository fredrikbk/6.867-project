home &amp family cranky consumer how to get your own personalized font services mimic users handwriting making a cursive q remember handwriting theres a movement to bring it back naturally were not talking about your hand actually writing anything were talking about your computer doing it for you a range of services offer to convert your handwriting into a personalized font that you can install on your computer right alongside the standard times new roman and courier why would you want to do this to more easily add an individual touch to letters or other documents the services suggest for instance at home you can type out a family newsletter in your own familiar scrawl or in the office a production team can quickly crank out "handwritten" marketing materials some people also use the services to immortalize their kids writing before they abandon it for the keyboard we decided to find out how easy it is to get our computer to do the writing for us we tried four services two cursive and two print to see if the fonts measure up to the real thing most of the services work like this you download a form and write out the alphabet then mail or email the form to the company if you want a truly realistic cursive font with connected letters just like real handwriting you have to take the additional step of writing out a bunch of different letter combinations vletter com promises those connected cursive letters we paid &# then printed out the form which didnt take long to mess up presented with a document that would supposedly save our script forever as a computer font we suddenly had lots of trouble simply writing the alphabet especially challenging the loopy capital cursive "q " plus many of the words we had to write were awkward creations like "skyque " "mojxe" and "egtyped " which didnt exactly roll right off the pen but vletter needs those variable letter combos to make sure everything connects we mailed the form via ups to vletter in oregon and asked for rush delivery for an extra &# six days later an email arrived with the font installation was a breeze and our "abby" font showed up in our list of regular fonts on our computer however to make the letters connect you have to select the type and run special vletter software on it the verdict the letters did in fact link up well and the writing looked pretty much like our own but neater fontgod com also offers to reproduce cursive writing although there are no promises about connected letters we paid &# then printed out three forms which asked us to write out individual letters along with a sentence fairly simple but we goofed up the forms four times before nailing them we were supposed to scan and email the forms to font god but since we dont have a scanner and our efforts to do it at a local kinkos failed font god agreed to do the scanning for us so we sent the forms by ups to australia the font landed in our inbox days later and it looked convincing with most but not all of the letters connecting our third service fontshop com has all kinds of features on its site including a blog about events like the typophile film fest showcasing short films about yup typography we downloaded a form that asked us to write the alphabet in block letters along with a few sentences it took only three tries to fill it out error free we also got to include a "dingbat " or a symbol of our choice so we drew a little face gritting its teeth we sent the form along with our credit card info for the &# fee by ups to san francisco in five days an email appeared with the font which looked like a cleaner slightly more stylized version of our own writing handwritingfonts com promises quality fonts at a fraction of the usual cost we paid &# printed the form and wrote out the alphabet in block letters in just two tries we also got to include characters of our choice so we drew three different faces smile grimace frown then we took a triumphant sip of water dripped a drop of condensation onto the form and had to redo it the company said we could snail mail the form so we sent it via ups to ireland in nine days the font came via email and looked like our writing but definitely tidier like the others we also checked out fontifier com which costs only &# and is a diy service that takes you through a series of steps online to create your font however fontifier said it didnt have the resources to scan the form for us so we gave that one a miss company web site vletter com price &# plus &# rush delivery fee delivery time six days comment the site sells other peoples handwriting
