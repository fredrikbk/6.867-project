politics &amp economics iraq bill with conditions proceeds house approves &# billion tied to goal for combat end white house pledges veto washington the iraq war debate erupted anew in congress as the house approved additional military funding but only after democrats attached conditions that set the goal of ending u s combat operations by the end of next year adopted the measure gives the pentagon &# billion in emergency funds to sustain military operations until next spring when a more extensive debate is expected after lawmakers receive a new report from iraq commander gen david petraeus but the white house immediately said it would veto the "bridge" funding unless the house restrictions are removed and the resulting stalemate will almost certainly run into next month and possibly next year republicans accused democrats of pursuing a "fools game" that ignores progress made on the ground in iraq democrats countered that the wars cost and strain on the u s military has become a threat to american security and strong action by congress is needed to force a change in policy by the president in the short term the pentagon has few cash problems since congress just approved &# billion in new funding signed into law by president bush this week the bulk of this money is designated for core personnel operations and weapons procurement accounts separate from the war but services like the army can sustain operations in iraq through most of january by moving money among these accounts mindful of the strain on the military three quarters of the &# billion in the house bill would go toward general operations accounts and it is estimated to be enough to carry the military well into march the bill also designates &# billion for procurement chiefly for the army and marines and this comes on top of &# billion in emergency funds already approved to expedite production of heavily armored vehicles to protect troops against roadside mines and ambushes the pentagon has requested almost &# billion altogether to meet its needs in both iraq and afghanistan for the new fiscal year that began oct an even larger bridge fund would be preferable then for the administration and senate republicans are pressing to increase the &# billion to &# billion but the far greater issue is the language added by democrats who have long opposed the war and increasingly struggle to get the votes in their party for any new funding within days of enactment the bill requires the administration to begin an "orderly redeployment" of american forces from iraq with the goal of completing the transition by dec thereafter the u s would maintain only a "limited" military presence focused on protecting u s diplomatic facilities training iraq forces and engaging in counterterrorism operations against al qaeda over the coming year defense secretary robert gates would be required to make quarterly reports to congress beginning jan on political and military stability in iraq expanding the debate to include the larger war against terror the bill specifies that no person held in u s custody including prisoners held by the central intelligence agency may be subjected to interrogation techniques outside the limits set out in the u s army field manual
