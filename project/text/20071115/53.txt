harvards gates refines genetic ancestry searches for blacks scholar founds a firm after dna tracer put forebear in wrong place if theres a match african ancestry sends a "certificate of ancestry " signed by dr kittles attesting that the customer "shares maternal genetic ancestry" with a particular ethnic group living in africa today in harvard university prof henry louis gates jr sent his dna to rick kittles a geneticist at howard university to trace his ancestry dr kittles who has since started a company selling such searches told dr gates that his maternal lineage could be traced back to egypt probably to a member of the nubian ethnic group in dr gates an african american studies scholar had his dna tested again and was told by another commercial genealogy service that his maternal lineage didnt track to egypt or even to africa instead it went back to a european in colonial america who historians believe was a white indentured servant as dr kittles now concedes the second version of dr gatess lineage turned out to be the right one but the mistakes made by the burgeoning genetic ancestry industry have continued prompting dr gates to start his own dna tracing company one that he says will be able to take a more refined look at african american ancestry dr gatess new company african dna llc aims to use historians and anthropologists to explain which of various genetic possibilities prompted by dna traces is more historically likely for such a search the new company charges &# within the &# to &# range thats typical of the genetic ancestry industry which now includes at least companies operating via web sites for &# african dna which works with houston based genealogy by genetics ltd will include a family tree as far back as census records allow for most african americans that is usually when their last names began to be recorded in post slavery u s records "i see myself as doing a service for a field thats deeply problematic because of the reluctance of some companies to reveal the complexity of the results " said dr gates who is director of the w e b du bois institute at harvard in an interview he has pledged to donate some of the money that the company earns to an educational effort to teach african history to schoolchildren through dna analysis the problems of ancestry tracing arent specific to dr kittles for many people the mitochondrial dna commonly used to trace female lineage just isnt sufficient to nail down an ancestors country of origin the genealogy services work by matching a customers dna to a database of samples collected from modern day africans but the large migrations of african people over the last years mean that a typical black americans dna might have an exact match with somebody living today in ghana but also cameroon kenya angola nigeria and sierra leone an editorial in science magazine recently criticized the precision that companies ascribe to their tests "commercialization has led to misleading practices that reinforce misconceptions " the editorial argued saying that such genetic tests are "less informative than many realize " dr gatess fascination with dna searches led him to trace the ancestry of famous african americans including oprah winfrey and himself for a pbs miniseries such "recreational genetic genealogy" has become big business roughly half a million people have bought searches from companies many of which also offer a service that traces paternal lineage through the male y chromosome dr kittles said the re analysis of dr gatess dna "was a learning experience for me i had a very poor european database " he says he now screens for european dna for his african american customers now at the university of chicago dr kittles commercialized his proprietary database of african dna samples in for &# african ancestry inc sells a kit to swab the inside of ones cheek the company searches for the customers pattern of mitochondrial dna in its database of africans if theres a match african ancestry sends a "certificate of ancestry " signed by dr kittles attesting that the customer "shares maternal genetic ancestry" with a particular ethnic group living in africa today the company says it has had customers since it opened in some geneticists say the company is more interested in giving satisfying answers than properly explaining the uncertain character of the results if a customers dna has multiple matches says bert ely a geneticist at the university of south carolina who isnt affiliated with any genealogy company the scientifically appropriate response is to tell the customer about every match listing only a few matches to make the results appear more precise than they really are "would be cheating " says peter forster the british geneticist who correctly traced dr gates to europe dr kittles said that listing all results would be "confusing " and that he feels customers are seeking his "best guess" as a scientist he has recently started to list more matches on the companys certificates of ancestry but still doesnt list every ethnic group a customer matched with see related letter "letters to the editor african genetic genesis" wsj dec
