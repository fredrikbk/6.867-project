bison dont roam and its a problem for the polish herd plan is to get lazy beasts to travel abroad and breed the eu looks for solution bialowieza poland krzysztof niedzialkowski is trying to teach europes largest land mammal the bison to become more european to keep the animals from extinction mr niedzialkowski coordinator of the european bison program is trying to change the migration patterns of about lowland bison bison bonasus bonasus roaming the primeval forest in northeastern poland he wants to persuade polish bison to breed with other wild herds of the same species in neighboring lithuania and slovakia to do that the bison which can weigh nearly pounds need to stop gathering in one large herd and eventually must learn new migration routes now possible with the expansion of the european union in this town of one story wood houses on the edge of bialowieza national forest mr niedzialkowski runs a project to lay out trails of beets and hay food to coax the bison to take their first small steps beyond the forest and eventually he hopes across borders "its not working very well " says wolfgang fremuth a zoologist at the frankfurt zoological society which is helping to finance the project "bison are very lazy and they havent understood where to go it may take a couple of years for them to learn " the feeding stations of "steering meals" set out by the rangers often dont last long since theres a good chance that elk deer and wild boar will eat the bisons buffet data gathered from bison with radio collars show that so far not a single one has managed to follow a planned mile migration route between neighboring forests in poland mr niedzialkowski says but the eu together with mr niedzialkowskis employer polands mammal research institute and the frankfurt zoological society have put up more than &# million as part of a four year program starting last year to expand the bisons habitat and to teach the animals new routes zoologists like mr fremuth are encouraged by new potential bison habitat such as the tracts of undeveloped forest from romania and bulgaria which joined the eu jan the european lowland bison and the american bison bison bison both descend from an ancient ancestor in india but have evolved separately and are seen as distinct species scientists believe that herds traveled north from india into siberia and eventually across the bering land bridge into north america while other herds headed west into the european forests as the eu has given more people a chance to travel freely within europe it has fenced in the bison poland tightened border controls with neighboring non eu countries ukraine and belarus when it joined the eu in conservationists in poland say they want to keep the bison herd from ukraine because they say the animals are in danger of being killed by poachers a fence blocks the bison from going to belarus just a mile and a quarter from bialowieza thats particularly painful for mr niedzialkowski because belarus is home to a herd of about bison the descendants of the gift of a few polish bison to stalin in the s zoologists at bialowieza national park say if he could breed his bison with the belarusian bison it would reduce the inbreeding that makes this rare species more susceptible to being wiped out by disease "but for political reasons thats not possible " mr niedzialkowski says "since poland left the soviet bloc and became the outer border of the eu the barriers were created " bison have roamed the forest of bialowieza for hundreds of years russian czars hunted them here after the russian revolution in locals hunted them for food and the bison disappeared a concerted breeding effort coordinated by the frankfurt zoological society took seven bison from zoos and reintroduced them into the forest in where they have since remained bialowieza pop which is just a four hour drive from warsaw is crazy about bison the local vodka zubrowka is named for the polish word for bison zubr so are the towns hotel also zubrowka the movie theater and local soccer team the year old mr niedzialkowski moved to town in after graduating from warsaw university with a degree in corporate law to be with his wife a zoologist who was working here on a study of red deer he hadnt planned to be running a conservation project "when i speak to my student colleagues " he says "they think i am crazy " but mr niedzialkowski says he was attracted by the fund raising that needed to be done for the bison conservation project "i had lived all my life in warsaw and i thought to myself if i want to do something else it better be now or never " he says mr niedzialkowskis team figured it would target young male bison which are more willing to stray from the herd in search of females and teach them to associate a particular direction with more food in hope that the rest of the herd will follow if the bison can learn this new route rangers hope they can teach them to move toward other wild herds in other european countries one spring morning a red tractor pulled up to a barn in the heart of bialowieza forest where four rangers loaded a trailer with bales of hay and beets they drove off to a feeding spot in the woods weaving among trees over the damp forest ground as the rangers unloaded the trailer about dark brown animals attracted by the noise of the tractor slowly emerged from the dense woods to watch rafal kowalczyk a zoologist at the mammal research institute had a tranquilizer rifle and radio collar with him the team wants to collar as many bison as possible in order to track their movements but mr kowalczyk failed that morning to attach a radio collar to a large male bison because he was surrounded by large females adding to the zoologists problems was this years mild winter the snow cover in the forest lasted just a few weeks and food was so plentiful bison were less inclined to search for new sources laid out by the rangers mr fremuth the zoologist says mr niedzialkowski is preparing maps of different routes the bison could take called ecological corridors and plans to propose building new feeding stations small barns to store hay along the routes he is also considering planting an apple orchard on the edge of bialowieza to lure the bison away from central feeding areas while the bison dont seem interested in international travel about of them wandered into the neighboring village of zabrody about five miles from the national park and onto farmland belonging to jan skiepko a white haired mustachioed farmer who is also the local policeman he didnt like it "they destroy young trees when they move in big groups " he said standing in front of his farmhouse still mr niedzialkowski hasnt given up hope he tracked one collared male that broke with the bialowieza herd and migrated about miles toward lithuania he believes others could do the same "this cannot be changed over night or in one step " he says "we have to give it some time " corrections &amp amplifications the bison in belarus are descendants of bison that were a gift to joseph stalin under a program initiated in and continuing until years after the soviet leaders death a page one article friday about a program trying to change the migration patterns of the animal said the bison were descendants of a gift to stalin in the s wsj july
