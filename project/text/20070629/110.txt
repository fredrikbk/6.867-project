weekend journal review television husband and wives if the first season of hbos "big love" about a three wife family in sunny utah was enticing season two mondays p m edt manages to be that and more "big love" seems indeed to have grown bigger larger in its ambitions heftier in its observations and in the dry humor that can ripple up in scenes of the most urgent high drama the henricksons for those who havent met them before are a polygamist family living their faith out in secret in the heart of a modern mormon society that views their kind as outcasts neighbors view them with suspicion the wives inhabit three different houses visited at odd hours by the family head bill henrickson to name just one reason the lives they lead in short arent simple and theyre further complicated by that family heads determination to live within the larger society and one day assimilate bill bill paxton is an enthusiastic visionary businessman with his friend don joel mckinnon miller a faithful fellow practitioner of polygamy he has invested everything in an up and coming home improvement business called home plus a name ripe with opportunities for insult the writerly inspiration that produced it what better handle for an enterprise run by polygamists pays dividends during a rich episode two where among other crises bills ambitious advertising plans run into trouble the huge billboard displaying his "home plus" sign along a conspicuous stretch of the highway leading to town has been defaced with obliquely suggestive messages about the polygamist practices of the businesss owners still with characteristic authority mr paxtons bill is having none of it unblinking in his faith not just in the sanctity of his domestic arrangements but in his rights as an american hes an indefatigable fighter certain that there is a positive outcome ahead he succeeds in getting the sign scrubbed clean fast even after his demand for action is dismissed in a daunting encounter with the local king of billboard cleaners who rants about the pressures of highway beautification programs and their chief proponent lady bird johnson whom he sneeringly calls "pruneface " bill henrickson is having none of this either as he goes off to find alternatives but not before delivering his contemptuous judgment about people who disparage a first lady in this way the positive outcome ahead as he often tells his wives depends on unity and purpose a faith no doubt enhanced by his readings about lincoln the american leader he most reveres one scene shows this husband of three father of seven driving toward some crisis or other with two essential guides for living on the seat beside him the book of mormon and next to it "team of rivals" by doris kearns goodwin a study of lincolns strategic managerial genius not a surprising interest for a character like bill a man after all with more than one union to hold together what holds the series together is mr paxtons performance along with those of numerous others in the shows exceptional cast theres no taking your eyes off the key principals here jeanne tripplehorn as first wife barb is torn even as shes exalted by the demands of her domestic role chloe sevigny playing second wife nikki is as menacing here as in most of her roles even as a new republic editor in "shattered glass " in which she played the kindest of bamboozled nurturers ms sevigny had the look of a serial poisoner nor do you take your eyes off ginnifer goodwin for long her margene the third wife is a somewhat bamboozled sort herself childlike in her seductiveness but no less sturdy a wifely soldier for all that nor off harry dean stanton as roman grant the viciously corrupt leader of an extreme polygamous cult a role mr stanton carries off with such guile its hard to remember to hate him wife no barb emerges this season as a woman torn between hunger for the great world outside her secret compound one that holds the promise of universities a chance to teach to learn to feel young and free again and her bonds to this special family and ms tripplehorn has made the most of it it is a measure of her power as an actor and also of the writers skill that the choice between that world of possibilities outside and the burdensome tension fraught one of the family can seem at all a difficult one alarmed after one of barbs rebellious moments of vision in which she appears ready to pack up and go bill asks with his irresistible combination of needfulness and authority whether shes coming back into the house the answer is wordless but clear she is of course headed nowhere but into his arms big love indeed remarkably enough the logic is all quite persuasive more to the point its the product of artful creation the signs of such promise were evident from the outset of the series and that opening ballet danced to the beach boys"god only knows" was one of them in its second season that promise has been amply deliciously fulfilled "american greed" a six part series airing on cnbc thursdays p m edt devotes itself to coverage of scams and scandals without uncovering much thats noteworthy about the nature of greed nor does it tell us the shows title notwithstanding exactly what it is thats american about the drive to get rich the publicity materials inform us that this program is about "the dark side of the american dream" for which delicate distinction we should perhaps be grateful given the suggestion implicit in it that the american dream has a side other than dark that aside the series offers some intriguing reporting in particular in its look at art theft and the details of the search that led to some perpetrators and their booty youll think twice of course before you leave your lifetime collection of picassos rothkos and matisses lying around in a warehouse
