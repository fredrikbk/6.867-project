kings of bling spending the largest percentage on status jewelry and watches meantime the super rich those with &# million or more spend differently from the merely rich no matter what country they live in according to the survey the richer you get the more you tend to splurge on art travel and wine and the less on jewelry here is a breakdown of the spending habits of the worlds wealthy north america since most of todays rich in the u s started out middle class and made their fortunes relatively quickly their luxury budgets tend to be more populist they spend the largest share of their "passion dollars" on cars boats and jets in many cases upgrading the things they enjoyed or craved before they got rich they spend the smallest percentage of any region besides the middle east on art and they spend the largest share in the world on coins antiques rare baseball cards and other collectible paraphernalia "americans like nostalgia " ms van der linde says "especially the baby boomers who have hit a certain level of wealth they want that baseball card that reminds them of playing baseball with their grandpa " europe europeans rank second after north america in the number of millionaires europe has million while north america has million yet the europeans are more rarefied in their spending they allocate of their luxury money budgets to art the highest portion in the world along with latin america experts point out that wealthy europeans have a long tradition of collecting filling their estates with paintings and sculpture dates back hundreds of years and it isnt just about owning cultural objects europeans tend to view art as a shrewd investment "theres a longer history in europe of seeing art as a store of value " says marc porter president of sothebys north america europeans dont take as much a shine to splashy gems spending the least percentage of any region on jewelry nor do they buy coins or memorabilia like americans "their history is so much longer they dont have the same nostalgia for more contemporary items " ms van der linde says latin america latin america now has millionaires according to the study fewer than the number of millionaires in texas they are big art buyers spending of their budgets on it yet unlike the europeans who tend to buy art from around the world the latins usually buy local "you see a lot of investment in latin america for contemporary artists where its seen as investing in the local culture " ms van der linde says latin americans arent big on jewelry perhaps because of personal safety issues in a region where street crime is more common yet they spend as big a percentage as rich europeans and americans on club memberships travel and clothing asia the asian pacific region has million millionaires the study says and in asia wealth seems to be made to parade they outspend their american counterparts when it comes to jets yachts and cars and they spend far more than europeans and americans on jewelry

americans but less than europeans middle east middle eastern millionaires whose numbers grew by in to according to the study spent the most on jewelry wealth experts say the nomadic traditions in the region have made jewelry a popular commodity since its easily portable with outward displays of wealth also popular in the middle east jewelry has big appeal middle easterners also spend big on yachts
