more schools likely to spur diversity via income when jim phillips moved into the wake county public school district in raleigh n c he presumed his daughter would attend the elementary school he could see from his front door instead she was assigned to a school three miles away because of the districts campaign to diversify every schools student body based on family income "if you live within sight of a school you should be able to walk to that school " says mr phillips a landscape architect who has spent seven years battling the district over such assignments nationwide about school districts with an estimated million students use "socioeconomic status " or ses to help determine where students go to school their ranks are expected to grow in the wake of yesterdays supreme court decision further restricting the use of race based school assignment plans by a vote the supreme court struck down voluntary school desegregation efforts in louisville ky and seattle the vote "will encourage districts now using race to shift to income " says richard kahlenberg a senior fellow at the century foundation a new york based think tank income based plans began spreading in the s as race based policies came under growing pressure in the federal courts most seek to limit the percentage of low income students in any one school by dispersing them beyond their neighborhood schools and assigning higher income students to schools with a lower income profile the programs generally identify low income students as those qualifying for the federal free and reduced price lunch program a wide body of research indicates that lower income students generally dont perform as well academically as their middle income classmates but that their achievement improves when they are assigned to middle class schools which tend to have more resources experienced teachers and parental involvement minority students tend to make up a large part of the lower income group that the plans are designed to benefit so ses plans often have a desegregation effect but the income based strategies appear to be less vulnerable to court challenges the bush administration has endorsed them and federal courts have so far subjected classifications by income to far less scrutiny than those involving race conservative legal groups that have challenged race based plans say they are unlikely to take on the income driven strategies unless they can prove a school district is intentionally using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race absent such motives "i think as a legal matter they would be on solid ground " says roger clegg president of the center for equal opportunity a conservative legal foundation that has been active in fighting affirmative action admissions preferences for minorities in higher education many liberals who have backed traditional desegregation plans support income based assignment because of its potential to boost student achievement "standing by themselves i think they have value " says theodore shaw president of the naacp legal defense and education fund "but they are no guarantee that we are going to address the problem of race head on " researchers also caution that receiving free or reduced prices lunches the usual poverty indicator isnt always an accurate measure because many older students who qualify dont sign up to avoid embarrassment meanwhile a recent study that compared income and racial data for large school districts found that assigning students based on income results in significant racial integration only if there is little income overlap between white and minority families school districts using socioeconomic status include baltimore san francisco and clark county nev wake county tried to avoid court ordered busing by opening magnet schools to attract white students back into urban areas and busing black students to suburban schools with such plans facing increased litigation wake switched to its income based plan in under it no more than of the students in any one building are supposed to qualify for free or reduced price lunches to meet that goal the district rejiggers attendance boundaries every year and buses students most of them from low income families to schools outside their neighborhoods wake officials say the strategy has helped to raise achievement among lower income and minority students in more than of african american grade school students were reading at or above grade level up from in but the effort has faced significant challenges including annual reassignment battles with parents particularly those from middle class areas "reassignment strikes terror into every parents heart every year " says jeanie bohl a mother of three such turmoil has been exacerbated by growth so rapid that the district effectively gains two full classrooms of students each school day the growth has been most pronounced in affluent mostly white areas that has forced the district to bus low income students longer distances and made it more difficult to stay within the target for students receiving free and reduced price lunches indeed last year about schools were above the target and at virtually all of them white students were in the minority to cope with the growth the district has begun converting more schools to year round calendars staggering schedules and vacation times wake cares a group of mostly middle income parents has gone to court to challenge such conversions in their neighborhoods in may a state judge in raleigh ruled the district cant assign any students to such schools without their parents consent fearing that the lack of flexibility could spell trouble for wakes diversity effort african american leaders have launched a campaign to persuade low income and minority parents to consent to such assignments "we dont want to have a segregated school system again " says marshall harvey of the raleigh wake citizens association a mostly black group
