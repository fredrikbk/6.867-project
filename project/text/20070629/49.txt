j craig venters next big goal creating new life biologist j craig venter and his colleagues have changed one species of bacteria into another a key step on the road to building what could be the worlds first artificial living organism having famously deciphered the human genome seven years ago dr venter is now helping to pioneer a nascent field known as synthetic biology he hopes to create and cash in on a new life form that has never existed in nature this microscopic creature would be engineered for specific commercial jobs such as churning out a bio fuel or sucking up carbon dioxide from the air to fight global warming "it will be a new species " says dr venter years old who is also seeking to patent the new would be life form dubbed mycoplasma laboratorium details of the latest technique which is a step toward that goal were published online this week in the journal science the paper is co authored by dr venter and others including his colleagues carol lartigue and hamilton smith who won the nobel prize for medicine "its an impressive piece of work " says eckard wimmer a professor of microbiology at stony brook university school of medicine in stony brook n y who read the paper in science dr wimmer should know in he and other scientists made an infectious polio virus from dna snippets purchased from a mail order firm in part to see if it could be done a process that took two years to complete the following year a team led by dr venter said they had created a different synthetic virus but in just two weeks however a virus isnt strictly considered to be a living thing since it cant reproduce on its own instead it needs to infect a host to do so so many scientists agree that no one has yet created a true living artificial organism even if dr venter gets there first other researchers are already seeing their synthetic biology experiments turned to commercial uses with the help of several million dollars from the bill &amp melinda gates foundation amyris biotechnologies of emeryville calif has created designer microbes that pump out chemicals for artemisinin an antimalarial drug typically harvested from a plant the company expects large scale commercial production to start in a start up called ls inc in san carlos calif has made microbes that can produce a bio fuel and is also about to commercialize its invention dupont co and genencor of palo alto calif a division of danish food ingredients and sugar company danisco as have added synthetic bits to the genetic machinery of e coli so that the bacteria churn out the key chemical material for sorona a new nylon like fiber but the field is unfolding so swiftly that some observers say ethical legal and even national security issues are being left far behind many critics fret that there arent enough safeguards to prevent a man made microbe from running amok due to terrorism or negligence the dangers are real almost any skilled geneticist with a laptop published gene sequence information and mail order dna can potentially create a lethal artificial pathogen three years after dr wimmer created his artificial polio virus other u s scientists caused even greater alarm when they resurrected the deadly "spanish flu" virus which killed more than million people at the beginning of the th century the complete genome sequences of more than microbial pathogens including smallpox anthrax and ebola have long been available on internet databases "theres a dangerous component to the whole synthetic biology field " says dr wimmer "theres a great benefit but it could be misused " for now researchers involved in synthetic biology intend to regulate themselves but calls for new rules are growing last year civil society groups including greenpeace international and friends of the earth international released an open letter seeking more governmental oversight of synthetic biology experiments in january etc group a canadian watchdog organization called for a ban on artificial "life machines" until rules could be established for the past two years a group of synthetic biology scientists and public policy experts have been compiling a report sponsored by the alfred p sloan foundation a philanthropic nonprofit group to address key issues such as where the science is headed and how the bioterrorism risk may be reduced although it contains no specific recommendations a draft version was discussed at a december meeting in washington d c where attendees included staff from the central intelligence agency and the department of homeland security the final report will be available later this summer some critics worry that if key techniques are given broad patents as sought by dr venter it could hold back the entire field of synthetic biology several months ago dr venters j craig venter institute applied for world wide patents for a lab constructed microbe dr venter hopes to eventually manipulate this organism to create biofuels or absorb carbon dioxide but earlier this year when the patents were finally published canadas etc group asked the u s patent office to reject them on the grounds that they were too broad and therefore would stifle innovation dr venter disagrees saying that there are potentially dozens of ways to create life forms in the lab in his patent request dr venter is laying claim to the set of genes that make the organism as well as the organism itself although dr venter hasnt created his man made organism yet his team is closing in they are currently stringing together laboratory chemicals and assembling the new genetic code for their synthetic organism a process which dr venter expects will be completed before the end of the year the next step would be to find a way to spark that synthetic genome into life so that it becomes a full functioning organism thats where dr venters bacteria swap experiment comes in in their experiment the team transplanted the dna from a bacterium called mycoplasma mycoides into the cells of a closely related species mycoplasma capricolum the recipient cells somehow chemically booted up the transplanted dna and that yielded cells that were identical to the mycoides donor cells as the authors described it in their paper "the result is a clean change of one bacterial species into another " dr venter needs that same "booting up" ability to create an artificial life form once the synthetic genome is built in the lab he plans to transplant it into a living bacterial cell in the hope that it too will be "booted up " if that happens it would mark the birth of the first living synthetic organism that can reproduce on its own "theres been more speculation in this field than scientific data " says dr venter "but now were closer to the goal" of making useful artificial organisms
