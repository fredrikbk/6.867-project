weekend journal the focus grouped park cities are building new parks at a rate not seen for years jon weinbach on the increasingly heated debate about what to put in them theres a new status symbol for american cities and its not a soaring office tower or retro stadium to many civic leaders nothing says progressiveness and prosperity like an elaborate urban park on a scale not seen since the "city beautiful" movement of the late th century public green spaces are proliferating in irvine calif work has begun on a &# billion recreational area that will be larger than new yorks central park private donors in houston financed the bulk of a &# million downtown greensward while the mayor of louisville ky wants to ring the citys borders with miles of trails in all of the nations biggest cities have added nearly acres of new parkland in two years the equivalent of about football fields but even grass and trees can be complicated citizens and planners across the country are getting tied up in a larger debate about what a park should be one that often pits people who believe in peace and quiet and the soulful contemplation of nature against those who prefer zip lines frisbee golf and hang gliding in the twin cities some residents dont agree with the decision to build a public sports field with artificial turf park builders in dallas are trying to find room in one new project for a backgammon area and an effort to rehabilitate manhattans washington square park has been met by three lawsuits so far including an attempt by preservationists to keep the city from moving the central fountain about feet to the east "youd think we were proposing to build a nuclear waste dump " says adrian benepe the citys commissioner of parks and recreation at a public meeting earlier this month in louisville about people came to weigh in on floyds fork greenway a mile stretch of parks bike paths and canoe launches to be built along a scenic creek after the presentation residents furiously scribbled suggestions on project maps that hung around the room among them "a nature trail cant run along a highway " "leave an area large enough for a hot air balloon launch" and from one particularly agitated person "many people were not notified of this meeting " ralph stanton a goateed tile contractor in his mid s was concerned that the park plans didnt include a trail wide enough to accommodate all three of his horses "kentucky is the home of the derby but weve got to go to indiana to ride " said mr stanton clutching his cowboy hat "they ought to get the horse people more involved " for decades local and federal governments had cut back on park budgets as funding needs grew for education health care and safety that marked a change from the late th and early th centuries when urban parks were held up as symbols of democracy public health and progressive social planning and received generous government support there was another surge of park building during the "great society" era of president lyndon johnson but as more city residents fled for the suburbs many urban parks were not properly maintained and green spaces deteriorated or disappeared federal money is still hard to come by the land and water conservation fund a program that provides grants for state and national parks will receive about &# million this fiscal year down nearly from another initiative the urban park and recreation recovery program has not been funded in five years a number of factors are spurring the current parks boom from research about the health benefits of green space to interest from private donors and corporate sponsors developers who once fought with conservationists are now pushing the idea after discovering that successful parks such as manhattans bryant park and atlantas piedmont park can dramatically increase property values city leaders are also using parks as a marketing tool in an effort to draw young professionals and graying suburbanites a number of cities including denver philadelphia and san diego have gentrified their downtowns recently but politicians are finding that most of the new residents grew up with access to running trails sports fields and the like and expect to have the same access in the city the largest increases in park space over the last two years took place in sprawling municipalities like houston and jacksonville fla but even densely packed older cities such as cleveland with new acres and philadelphia acres are finding ways to create new open space often on former military bases or industrial sites seattles nine acre olympic sculpture park opened earlier this year was built on a former oil transfer site other cities have focused on building parks on reclaimed brownfields industrial or commercial sites tainted by pollution especially near valuable waterfront or downtown real estate pittsburgh the long time hub of the u s steel industry redeveloped a acre slag dump along the monongahela river a few years ago converting it into a residential complex and acres of green space new york is in the midst of "the biggest period of park construction and redevelopment since the s " says mr benepe the parks commissioner mayor michael bloomberg who sat on the boards of two local park foundations before taking office recently increased the parks departments operating annual budget to about &# million double the total in the citys most ambitious projects are building a park on top of an abandoned elevated railway line in manhattan and converting the fresh kills landfill in staten island to a acre recreation area as cities increasingly rely on corporate donors real estate developers and private not for profit entities for park funding theyre facing some criticism when chicagos millennium park opened in named prominent areas after corporate sponsors such as sbc boeing and british petroleum some traditionalists cried foul several cities have recently devised guidelines for sponsorship and naming rights in denver a company has to contribute of all capital costs to get its name or logo on a new park but in most cases the arguments revolve around one issue the purpose of a park in chico calif work on the citys new master plan for bidwell park has been hamstrung by a fight between preservationists and disc golfers who have been using a remote part of the park to play the frisbee inspired sport environmental advocates say the golfers are damaging trees and compacting the soil at a meeting earlier this month two golfers said their course should not be treated any differently than bike or hiking trails planners for downtown houstons acre &# million discovery green park which is set to open next year wanted to create a "critical mass of activities" to generate buzz in a long forgotten area of town says philip myrick vice president of project for public space a new york nonprofit that helped conceive the parks programs throughout the group conducted about a dozen small meetings with different "stakeholders" ranging from hispanic community leaders to downtown employees to elementary school students and held workshops for anyone interested in contributing ideas the hispanic community wanted open space for events while the students proposed adding a "zip line" ride a pulley suspended from a cable wire that allows thrill seekers to fly through the air the final park plans included a dog area a jogging trail a puppet theater and a "birthday veranda" for parties but no zip line "just having a baseball diamond a grove of trees and a couple soccer fields is really the old model " says landscape architect james burnett whose firm is designing a &# million park in downtown dallas that will cover a sunken eight lane freeway the current plans for the site tentatively called woodall rodgers park include a bocce ball court a backgammon area spaces for leashed and unleashed dogs and a botanical garden "the program list can get very long " he says "the discussion is always heated " in some ways the skirmishes over space mirror previous controversies over park land after central park opened in the s new york city commissioners were overwhelmed by public requests for boat rides and more activities even though landscape architect frederick law olmsted imagined the park as "purely passive space " says witold rybczynski a professor of urbanism at the university of pennsylvania and author of a biography of mr olmsted but now that prime urban real estate is much more scarce and expensive "its much more challenging to satisfy everyones notion of what a park should be " he says as a result many of the new projects share a theme park quality with neatly organized areas catering to different groups "you want to please as many people as possible but weve become so different " he says few parks today match the cost or scope of the great park of orange county in southern california on the site of the former el toro marine corps air station the decision to build the park came after years of battles over the fate of the base which closed eight years ago in county voters narrowly approved a plan to convert the base into an airport but opponents stalled the effort until when voters approved a measure overturning the airport plan in favor of a park the navy handled the sale of the base dividing it into four parcels in lennar corp the nations second largest home builder bought all four lots for about &# million in order to build on the site lennar had to turn over a chunk of the land to the public for park development contribute &# million toward the creation of the park and spend another &# million on infrastructure for its part lennar plans to create a sprawling unit residential development around the park as well as a acre "lifelong learning" area thats slated to include a college campus and senior housing the park wont begin to open until though its first attraction a balloon ride that will take riders feet in the air is scheduled to debut on july the balloon will be orange naturally last march the parks designers announced a projected cost of about &# billion not including the funds needed to construct a planned set of museums or a botanical garden to generate revenue the park is exploring sponsorship naming rights and sublease options as well as charging fees for parking and certain events and activities like evening softball games however earlier this month the parks board of directors voted not to put advertising on the new balloon ride despite estimates that it could bring in as much as &# visitors may be charged for parking though like most park projects this one has youth sports organizations and enthusiasts of every stripe angling for prime turf last year the board asked for suggestions how to develop the parks acre sports area and got an avalanche of proposals the list includes a "casting pond" to teach aspiring fly fishermen a research center to study childrens exercise habits and a "california sports hall of fame" honoring local athletes mike meier a year old hang gliding manufacturer from orange calif concedes his request for hang gliding space probably wont get top priority nonetheless he spent "about or hours" putting together a page proposal which included sketches of a bowl shaped hill where beginner level pilots could learn how to take off "it wasnt a madison avenue like production " he says "im not holding my breath " in contrast to most urban green spaces which are centered around pedestrian access few people will be able to walk to the great park aside from residents in lennars new homes the site is in a remote area a few miles northeast of interstate far from anything resembling a neighborhood there are plans to create a light rail service that will connect an enlarged train station in irvine with stops at the park and a nearby shopping center but even roy cooper the parks operations director admits that transportation is a major obstacle "if we provide alternative convenient transportation we might have a shot at getting people out of their cars but this is orange county " he says
