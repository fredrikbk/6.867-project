power and nearly two years to the day after transit attacks killed more than people london police were able to thwart an apparent bombing attempt in a busy nightlife district of the city after discovering a silver mercedes sedan that was packed with gasoline cylinders and nails the metropolitan police service said that it had no intelligence that such an attack was in the works and that if it had been successful the outcome would likely have been devastating "if the device had detonated there could have been significant injury or loss of life " deputy assistant commissioner peter clarke the metropolitan polices top antiterrorism official said the car had been abandoned outside of a popular nightclub called tiger tiger at around a m local time an hour when the streets are crowded with

inferences about who might be responsible unnamed officials noted that it seemed to echo an al qaeda plot in which the group planned to detonate gas fueled explosives in cars and limousines in new york they also said that because the car had been found in a bustling nightlife district it called up another plot for which five members of a british al qaeda cell were sentenced to life in prison

citizens and authorities must remain alert "i will stress to the cabinet that the vigilance must be maintained over the next few days " mr brown said but if the thwarted attack was a reminder of the threat from "international terrorism " as framed by ms smith its proximity to the anniversary of the july attacks is also a chilling reminder that britain also faces a threat from would be terrorists
