immigration victory immigration reform died in the senate yesterday a victim of populist anger on the right and political cynicism on the left we hope the victors are prepared to live with the immigration status quo they purport to hate because that is what they have now guaranteed as a matter of policy this is far from the worst outcome it would be better to bring some rationality to the reality of north american labor movements and bringing illegals into the open would be good for national security but the million or so immigrants who are here illegally will continue building homes and cleaning hotel rooms and more will arrive or leave depending on the job opportunities at least the feds wont have more authority and money to harass more innocent employers who hire illegals owing to the ease of forging government documents perhaps now too reformers can rally around more modest reforms such as an expansion of h b visas for skilled immigrants either the u s will accept more of these workers especially from american graduate schools or more u s companies will outsource more high tech jobs to ireland and india a left right coalition might also be able to agree on an expansion of visas for agricultural workers who are now in short supply here too u s companies will either grow vegetables in america harvested by foreign workers or the u s will import foreign vegetables harvested by foreign workers restrictionists cant have it both ways as for the politics the press will call this a defeat for president bush but he deserves credit for trying this late in his term and with his low approval rating he simply lacked the political capital to persuade republicans spooked by talk radio and cable tv hosts mr bush was also trying to do his fellow republicans a favor by forging a new relationship with hispanic americans even though hell never be on another ballot we look forward to seeing how gop candidates win elections as democrats grab a larger share of americas fastest growing voter bloc perhaps lou dobbs has some campaign tips as for democrats their cynicism has rarely been so obvious senate majority harry reid pulled the bill earlier this month when gop leaders wanted only another day or two for amendments then when he brought the bill back to the floor he doomed it with faint support and by letting his party add amendments he knew would drive republicans away now he and his fellow democrats will tell hispanic voters that they could have passed reform if not for those bigoted republicans mark it down chuck schumer will use this against gop senators next year and should they win more senators and the white house democrats in will be in position to pass their own immigration reform that will be far less restrictive than this one the conservatives who "won" this week will deserve much of the credit
