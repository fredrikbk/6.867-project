fed sidesteps inflation question policy makers dont say if reading is low enough but damp rate cut hopes washington with the nations underlying inflation falling the federal reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon the central bank in the statement issued at the end of its two day meeting sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough it emphasized that the outlook for inflation and not the latest inflation reading is now driving its interest rate decisions on that score the fed reiterated that its "predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected " as widely expected the feds policy making federal open market committee left its short term interest rate target at where it has been for almost exactly a year in the accompanying statement it said that "readings on core inflation " which excludes food and energy "have improved modestly in recent months " a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting on may when it said "core inflation remains somewhat elevated " but it added "sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated moreover the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures " the statement appears to mean interest rates will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future rate cuts appear ruled out by inflation concerns and rate increases are less likely than before thanks to a recent rise in long term interest rates and continued weakness in housing futures markets responded by slightly lowering the odds of an interest rate cut by year end analysts took differing messages from the statement thomas joseph marta a fixed income strategist at rbc capital markets called the statement "tight lite " with the fed moving more to a goldilocks scenario "growth not too hot not too cold and inflation certainly better but weve got to keep an eye on it " but others found the statement almost grudging in its acknowledgment of improved inflation it "maintains a firm inflation bias and is telling us that this will not change soon " bruce kasman chief economist at j p morgan chase said in a note to clients by dropping its description of core inflation as "elevated " the fed implicitly acknowledged that at least for some policy makers the latest inflation rate is no longer undesirably high core inflation as measured by the feds preferred benchmark the price index of personal consumption expenditures dropped to in april from in february revisions to first quarter data released yesterday suggest the decline was less pronounced the may core inflation to be reported today may remain at rather than the widely expected before yesterdays revisions were reported even so that would be at the bottom of the to year end range the fomc projected in february meaning inflation is easing ahead of schedule the fed doesnt have an inflation target some fed officials say their "comfort zone" for inflation is to and see a number much above as too high yet others may think or slightly lower acceptable noting that is the target chosen by many foreign central banks the feds omission of "elevated" helps investors "further pinpoint the higher end of" chairman ben bernankes preferred range for inflation argued jim bianco president of bianco research a chicago financial research firm still with the fomc in the midst of a lengthy debate on how to better communicate yesterdays statement was less a wink at an implicit target and more an attempt to sidestep the issue altogether more importantly the fed emphasized that it isnt enough for inflation to be low now it must also remain low for the next few years on that score it still sees risks it could move higher with unemployment hovering near a six year low of policy makers suspect the economy has little if any spare capacity and firms and workers might have greater than usual ability to raise prices and wages yesterday the labor department reported that initial claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to reversing three straight increases suggesting the job market remains healthy the commerce department yesterday also revised up its estimate of first quarter growth to at an annual rate from primarily due to higher exports than previously estimated economists generally expect growth to rebound to above in the quarter now ending still the likelihood of a fed rate increase also appears to be receding the run up in treasury bond yields from below in may to about now appears driven in part by growing risk aversion by investors previously willing to accept the same return on long term as short term bonds that risk aversion is also evident in corporate debt markets and will likely restrain growth and housing in particular demand for housing also appears to still be falling posing a continuing risk to the economy
