bancroft heir pursues alternative to murdoch leslie hill a dow jones &amp co director and a member of the family that controls of the companys voting power was initially in favor of exploring a possible sale of the company after news corp chairman and chief executive officer rupert murdoch lodged his &# billion offer for dow jones but as a deal with mr murdoch approaches and the family faces a monumental decision she has had an apparent change of heart in recent days she has been scouring the east coast trying to drum up other offers for the company her family the bancrofts has controlled for years ms hill has pressed for dow jones management to meet with brian tierney who led an investor group to buy the philadelphia inquirer last year she helped encourage a hearing for brad greenspan the co founder of myspace com who is trying to buy a quarter of dow jones she threw herself into the minutiae of drafting editorial principles to protect the journalistic integrity of the wall street journal and dow jones newswires a retired american airlines pilot ms hill years old often uses flight analogies to explain the situation facing dow jones "if you are flying into an airport you always have two backup airports in your flight plan " she has told some directors according to someone who heard her "thats what dow jones needs a backup plan " though many involved in the process believe that her efforts are quixotic and that a sale to mr murdoch is likely her activities reflect the deep ambivalence of a family readying to give up a legacy it has held for generations her search also underscores her reputation among family members for determination and stubbornness as well as an assertiveness in a far flung family in which no clear leader has emerged a favorite story retold often among bancroft family members involves a mile hike through the sierra nevada ms hill undertook with her father and uncle when she was in sixth grade some family members say they have been bemused by her shifting approach to the news corp offer "shes unafraid to go out and do things " says one person close to ms hill ms hill was actively involved in crafting the family proposal for editorial protections of dow jones trying to toughen it up her resistance contributed to a delay that eventually prompted some on the board to worry that mr murdoch would pull his bid the proposal which was handed over to the dow jones board and has changed since the family drafted it now includes a five member special committee to protect the companys editorial independence the board members would be chosen with the agreement of both dow jones and news corp the special committee would have "approval rights over the appointment and removal" of the managing editor and editorial page editor of the wall street journal and the managing editor of dow jones newswires including a material change in their employment terms or authority according to people familiar with the matter these editors would also have "control over spending and allocation of resources within budgets set by news corp management " these people said replacement members of the special committee would be decided by the committee and approved by news corp if a disagreement arises between the editors and news corp management the committee would have the authority to adjudicate any conflict and could make their decision public potentially through the editorial page of the journal according to people familiar with the matter the decisions of the committee based on majority opinion would be final and binding the committee which would be funded by news corp could take legal action the committee would be selected prior to the close of any deal and would be in place from day one these people said dow jones would maintain its existing code of conduct these people say even as dow jones management began detailed presentations to news corp ms hill pressed for the familys banker merrill lynch &amp co to meet yesterday with mr greenspan who lost control of myspace to news corp in mr greenspan is leading an investor group that has made a &# billion offer for of dow jones it isnt known who the other investors are he wasnt getting much attention from dow jones following his offer to the board to buy a quarter of the company for &# a share it took almost a week for him to get a response from company adviser goldman sachs group inc he says but ms hill stepped in to push for the merrill meeting while james ottaway a former dow jones board member whose family controls of the companys voting power helped arrange a meeting with the companys advisers he says ms hill wouldnt comment for this article "i think the company should take a serious look at this offer and they didnt seem to be before monday " says mr ottaway "they werent giving it a hearing " ms hill emailed mr greenspan earlier this week about his offer and while the two havent met personally they have been in frequent phone contact in recent days according to a person familiar with the matter "whether it was jim ottaway or other interested shareholders someone pushed the board to really look at everything " says mr greenspan he declines to comment on ms hills involvement in his effort but says that overall the family "is very intrigued by the structure and the proposal " ms hill pressed for dow jones ceo richard f zannino to sit down last week in new york with mr tierney who bought the philadelphia inquirer in and who surfaced a few weeks back after he publicly voiced displeasure with the lack of formality in dow joness effort to draw out other suitors mr tierney has a long relationship with the hill family who lived in philadelphia when ms hill and her siblings were growing up mr tierneys idea for investing in dow jones may have fizzled out mr tierney is a public relations and advertising executive who last year led an investor group that bought the philadelphia inquirer and the philadelphia daily news for &# million he has made significant cutbacks at both papers to combat declining revenue and circulation the moves sparked a showdown with labor unions ms hills campaign also highlights the mistrust some members of the family have felt toward the companys advisers who are being criticized by the family and others on wall street for mishandling certain aspects of the process recently she hired her own lawyer people close to dow jones have said the company is running a process with a "small p" and hasnt prepared an official offering document or "book " which is typically circulated to potential buyers whenever a company is up for sale these people say dow jones advisers have solicited other bidders from the start but mr murdochs rich price has deterred other players the lack of a formal process has raised eyebrows among some family members and fed the perception that the companys advisers have little incentive to open doors to other companies beyond news corp says one family member "its great that leslie is trying to do this but its pretty sophisticated stuff you would think that the company would have a dedicated strong group with missionary zeal working on it " a number of family members have expressed their interest in being able to consider alternatives to mr murdochs bid and in allowing enough time in the process for other options to emerge "its no secret that there are folks in the family who are interested in coming up with an arrangement that doesnt involve murdoch " says a family member ms hill has voiced displeasure with the negotiations to sell dow jones since mr murdochs offer surfaced after mr zanninos presentation to the board on may she complained that he appeared too favorable toward a sale last week the family turned negotiations with news corp over to the dow jones board following concerns by some independent board members that ms hill and other family directors were taking too long in coming to an agreement on a proposal for an editorial board that would oversee the papers independence ms hill has advocated exploring the greenspan offer as well as trying to combine it with another possibility people who have spoken with her say she wants to leave no stone unturned
