saving pieces of immigration bill lawmakers may aid work force levels some want to wait washington with the collapse of immigration overhaul agriculture and high tech interests will seek new solutions to their labor problems while republicans sift through the wreckage of a fight that stamped president bush as a lame duck within minutes of yesterdays defeat in the senate democrats were discussing how to salvage pieces of the immigration bill including farm labor provisions that could be attached to this summers farm bill high tech firms have allies in congress who could press for legislation to increase the number of high skilled workers allowed visas each year the portion of the bill that expands college education and military service opportunities for the children of illegal immigrants has broad appeal on its own but overhaul supporters admit being torn now between rushing in to save provisions or standing back and letting problems worsen until public support builds for a comprehensive approach "heres the dilemma " said rep howard berman d cal "try to do something to make the situation a little bit better or wait for the pot to boil over " homeland security secretary michael chertoff who spent months helping craft the bill expects more raids on employers hiring illegal immigrants "there were some very valuable tools that were left on the floor of the senate today " he said "were going to do it the hard way by arresting people and charging them with criminal offenses " few believe the larger bill can be resurrected before a new president and congress are elected next year "until another election occurs and something happens in the body politic what occurred today is fairly final " said sen mel martinez the cuban born florida republican and national party leader only a dozen republicans stood with mr bush on the roll call which fell votes short of the needed to expedite debate and passage this week the true margin of defeat was closer to two or three votes but once the outcome was clear senators ran for cover even minority leader mitch mcconnell up for re election in kentucky next year voted "no " house republicans contributed to the defeat by passing a party resolution opposing the senate bill despite their efforts to now draw speaker nancy pelosi into the fray she can use the senate stalemate as an excuse to avoid a politically difficult issue if individual pieces are saved a lead candidate is the so called agjobs portion of the bill which confines itself to about million workers with proven records of agriculture employment and who are willing to remain on farms over the next three to five years to qualify for permanent residency "we have to get agjobs in place because its going to be very difficult to harvest without it " said democratic sen dianne feinstein from agriculture rich california "people are frightened and employees have dropped about in the farm area " ms pelosi supports creation of a new visa coveted by high tech for scholars in science and math and some republican critics of the administrations bill have their own proposal that would return the number of hb visas to higher levels and add more green cards so employers can petition for skilled workers to become permanent residents the dream act a third piece of the failed bill is designed to open educational opportunities such as in state tuition benefits now barred to the children of immigrants who entered the u s illegally against the background of iraq it would create a path to citizenship for those who enlist in the military for mr bush immigration overhaul was very much a dream as well like lyndon johnson on civil rights and bill clinton on welfare and trade it was an issue that pitted him squarely against his partys base but iraq has left him far weaker at this stage of his presidency and he never threw himself into the fight as mr clinton did for example in winning approval of the north american free trade agreement "if you are going to pass something that splits your party you have to go to the country hard " said michael levy a former treasury official and veteran of the nafta fight which carried echoes of the immigration debate "bush did go to the country but not hard he didnt pick high profile fights like we did with al gore debating ross perot what happened here was the average guy on the street turned the other way and talk radio killed him mr bush " the president appears to have been hurt too by a distrust toward government cited by both sides in the debate "a lot of americans have lost faith in their government " said sen jon kyl r ariz "they dont think we can control our borders win a war issue passports solve other problems so they ask this question why should we give more power to the government to do things it hasnt been willing to do in the past " the national stalemate creates a vacuum into which state and local governments are moving some cities have passed measures that target employers or landlords of illegal immigrants and others have signed up their police forces for federal training in immigrant apprehension "the political ire will remain in place " said michael fix vice president of the nonpartisan migration policy institute in washington and sen lindsey graham r s c warned "if we dont do anything at the national level from town to town were going to have different laws weve got a growing nightmare on our hands " june kronholz contributed to this article
