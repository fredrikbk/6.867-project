weekend journal review books novelists take to the street you would think that after years of securities regulation reptile brained wall streeters would have learned to behave fortunately they havent if were to believe recent novelists who find the street still rocking to greed sex and drugs if only one of these writers had added for balance a cameo of alpha regulators rudy giuliani and eliot spitzer behaving badly maybe in a sequel tom bernards debut thriller "wall and mean" norton pages &# is the least ambitious of the four of books under consideration here but not without its rewards a straightforward crime story it opens with high drama on a trading desk as hedgies blow out emerging country debt during the russian constitutional crisis of tanks in moscow fire on parliament bids vanish george wilhelm a relatively new boy at city trust has the nerve to buy when blood is in the streets a likable quality in any wall street hero but he also bets the spread on sports games a habit that balloons into a week of mad addiction but whats a quarter million owed to a bookie when youve got a big bonus coming in february george gets a quick answer he needs to come up with big ones every week in interest if he misses a payment hell get hauled out to the "spa" for discipline by frank and kevin two menacing enforcers who speak a kind of post puzo brooklynese after an interest payment or two george knows that he is about tapped out if city trust learns of his gambling problem hes finished there sans bonus such is the crossroads dilemma of "wall and mean " in desperation george turns to a friends drug dealer who used to trade bonds before doing time at the danbury federal pen and the two devise a nifty scheme to have city trust buy obscure nicaraguan debt for a few points markup theyll skim a half million from the bank the bookie will get paid george will be alive to collect his bonus thats the plan the brooklyn boys having gotten a taste of bank skimming have other ideas mr bernards resume includes stretches at salomon and lehman but none at danbury still his depiction of criminal doings is as convincing as his account of trading desk shenanigans in two senses perhaps he is a writer to watch "das kapital" simon &amp schuster pages &# the second novel by viken berberian "the cyclist" appeared in offers a scheme that sounds better than it reads wayne a hedge fund guy expecting a market apocalypse tries to speed it along by allying himself with an eco terrorist known as the corsican wayne sells short the corsican stages spectacles bombs exploding buildings collapsing prices plunge wayne screams in pleasure at other times wayne screams in rage a leitmotif in the novel is his frustration over not being able to get an avocado sandwich that includes avocado an intermediary named alix for instance travels from marseilles to consummate her text messaging flirtation with wayne they meet at the chic restaurant balthazar in new york and we learn perhaps more than we want to know about literary fiction "she was excited when he ordered snails her cultural receptors had been conditioned to champion the terrestrial gastropods from an early age then he smiled and it was the last piece of evidence she needed the perfect man with perfect teeth with durable dentin and enamel the angulation of his teeth was perfect in a moment of openness he shared with her the toothpaste he used it was mavis imported from italy " in the course of telling his story mr berberian anoints nassim taleb "the black swan" and alan abelson of barrons as "good guys " and lo and behold in the publishers press release mr taleb blurbs the book note to promo dept did we ever get in touch with abelson mr berberian displays a good deal of authentic cleverness in "das kapital " alongside perhaps too much erudition one footnote reads "the ratios of successive fibonacci numbers approach the golden ratio as n approaches infinity " the story may be about "the end of western hegemony if not of dialectical history " or not did i mention its a literary novel the dust jacket includes the information that mr berberians earlier "prose gumbo is redolent of nabokov " quoting the lit scholars at entertainment weekly with no trace of nabokovian or even berberianist drollery "confessions of a wall street shoeshine boy" harpercollins pages &# a first novel by a vanity fair editor doug stumpf describes the adventures of gil a hip talking young brazilian who puts the gloss on downtown traders guccis as he goes about his lowly business he trips over insider trading and extortion passing the dirt along to a scribe for glossy magazine who banks on an expose to rescue his career mr stumpf tries for a sassy picaresque tale but the wall street characters are never developed beyond greedy meanies and the mischief is too familiar as for insights gil in his street lingo offers of his clients "but they only about money they live in a kind of fake world " jeez if holden caulfield had stuck it out at a good school and landed on wall street he might have written "mergers &amp acquisitions" riverhead pages &# "who" year old author dana vachon might ask "is holden caulfield " never mind mr vachons book is a profane smartly written largely unsentimental coming of age story its funny too mostly for reasons that cant be described here tommy quinn an undistinguished georgetown student is hired as an analyst trainee at j s spenser &amp co and sets about proving that utter incompetence doesnt guarantee a career meanwhile tommys friend roger thorne floats upward with correlation between ability and consequence he "like dudes" his way through sex goddesses mere babes drugs porno video mexican pirates and half billion dollar deals that bear his name but fortunately not his input mr vachon is a skilled scene builder with an ear for absurdity sometimes its not holden caulfields take on wall street that he offers but bart simpsons both work the big questions for which mr vachon reaches sound familiar as soon as theyre posed god having failed late american man is adrift whats a dude to think mr vachons attempt at an answer if ive understood it rings a false note stigmata really but thats ok if there were a sensible answer young men wouldnt need to write coming of age novels and that would be a pity "mergers &amp acquisitions" is a treat in the authors terms it rocks mr boland has written a half dozen financial mysteries
