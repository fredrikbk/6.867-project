weekend journal taste de gustibus if you can understand give me a sign as part of our jobs shes a paginator and im an assistant editor at the journal khanh lao and i have communicated by email for almost two years but it was only after i met her in person at an informal gathering in princeton n j in november that i learned she was deaf at the party we were able to communicate by writing notes back and forth but it was clearly awkward and time consuming if we wanted to continue hanging out either she was going to have to learn to hear or i was going to have to learn to sign at first i admit i thought it was going to be easy i breezed through learning the alphabet in about a half hour not overly concerned that i would constantly confuse t and r when i tried to fingerspell i had the signs for "god bless america " "happy birthday" and "merry christmas" which looks suspiciously like "happy christmas" to me down cold the first night then i got adventurous i bought an abridged sign dictionary several textbooks and a couple of sets of flash cards there are no reliable surveys of how many people use american sign language the method of conversation employed most often by deaf people in the u s and the english speaking parts of canada estimates of those people who use it as their primary language in the u s range from to two million according to gallaudet university a college for the deaf and hard of hearing in washington d c some experts say that it is the fourth most common language in the states after english spanish and chinese in total as many as million people deaf and hearing use sign language for some communication becoming one of those million has been slow going id say i know about or so signs but i must have forgotten several times that many since i dont get to use them very often heaven only knows why i can remember the word for "wisdom " but what can i do with that sure i can say "your wisdom makes me smile " or something equally childish sounding but i may be years away from being able to relate the story of solomon i also know the word for slavery but im not nearly skillful enough to discuss the civil war and as useful as fingerspelling is and often necessary as some english words have no signs it is an arduous process in the time it took to explain that a friend of mine goes to a n o n d e n o m i n a t i o n a l church he could have converted but i trudge forward i had my first real chance to see how much i had learned earlier this month at deaf and hard of hearing awareness day at six flags amusement park in jackson n j there were about participants this year according to the theme park and though i had been advised by books that it was rude to follow the signs of others if you arent involved in the conversation i couldnt help watching after all my hard work though i was able to understand only a few words here and there thanks to her patience though ms lao and i were able to have fairly involved conversations without the use of paper and pen progress some day i hope soon ill reach a point where i cant teach myself any further and will need to take actual classes for now the textbooks will have to suffice if youre looking for a recommendation i should say that "teach yourself american sign language in hours" thoroughly overbilled itself "signing everyday phrases" might be useful for someone just needing to learn a few sentences but the examples do not follow the grammar of asl one prominent misconception about american sign language is that it is merely english with signs replacing words asl actually has its own structure the grammar of sign language is easier in some cases signs for verbs remain the same no matter their tense for instance but other aspects are more difficult facial expressions body and head movements and sign placement all play important grammatical roles a furrowed brow or puckered lips can alter the meaning of a sentence people conversing in spoken language often use their hands or the volume of their voice to accent a point in sign since the hands are already quite busy and one cant very well sign more loudly or softly a signer may widen his eyes or squint move his head forward dramatically or draw his head back slowly to convey a sense of passion urgency or lack of interest of course asl isnt about miming either but im sure it will come in handy the next time i play charades no foray into another language is complete without learning some of the pitfalls that one may face when conversing with a native speaker for example be careful when signing "coffee " or else you may unwittingly make an unwanted sexual advance mr philips is the assistant features editor of the journals leisure &amp arts page
