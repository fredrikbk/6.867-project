hong kongs unhappy anniversary hong kong to mark this coming sundays year anniversary of life under chinese rule the hong kong government released a music video replete with panoramas of the hong kong harbor red fireworks and fuzzy feel good shots of the peoples liberation army the whole production felt oddly forced perhaps thats because theres very little to cheer to the uncritical eye hong kong looks strikingly like it did under the british quite the anti china witness the regal high court complete with wigged barristers and english common law or the local catholic dioceses web site which boasts a letter from the reigning ethnic chinese cardinal declaring "it is obvious that catholics do not accept communism" or victoria park where thousands gather every june to commemorate the tiananmen square massacre even kowloons crowded streets where entrepreneurs from the worlds many corners jostle hawk and tug at would be customers look like the hong kong of old a dynamo of a town where nothing stands still for long yet hong kongers are divided and uncharacteristically passive about what really matters for the future democracy without it theres no guarantee that the freedoms they enjoy today wont slowly erode at the time of the handover china and britains hard fought pact committed beijing to the concept of "one country two systems " many saw it as a template for taiwans eventual integration with china the basic law hong kongs mini constitution said the "ultimate aim" is to elect hong kongs chief executive and its legislature through "universal suffrage " but over the past decade its become clear just how weak that promise really was hong kongers have witnessed delay after delay of the "democracy question " first beijing reinterpreted the basic law and said no decision on democracy could be made until after then hong kongs politicians themselves hinted at now the wags around town are talking about or later beijing doesnt mince words about its preferences in then president jiang zemin may have declared that "the well water does not interfere with the river water" an oblique way to say "well stay out of your way " but in wu bangguo chairman of chinas national peoples congress standing committee stood up in beijing and declared "our country is a single system state and the high degree of autonomy enjoyed by the hong kong sar special administrative region is not intrinsic to hong kong but was granted by the central government " thats not progress and the blame here can be spread widely over the past decade hong kongs pro democratic political parties splintered and squabbled weakening their cause and voice in the legislature pro business groups lobbied hard against suffrage fearing that it would lead to populist politics and more expansive government or policies that anger beijing the pro china parties plumped for pro china policies which were resoundingly anti democratic so a decade on hong kong is still stuck with an electoral system that doesnt represent the popular will and with politicians who arent accountable to the hong kong people that makes life uncomfortable for the hong kong government which likes to pretend that it has real legitimacy as it tackles real problems chief executive donald tsang campaigned for "re election" earlier this year in a race with a predetermined outcome the one chosen by beijing the communist party elites dont mind elections the saying goes so long as they know whos going to win mr tsangs new cabinet is full of career bureaucrats who wont have an easy time connecting with their constituents the former chief executive tung chee hwa expanded government spending threatened to raise taxes and backed a few costly white elephant projects mr tsang is reading from the same playbook talking about "income equality " tax hikes a minimum wage a competition policy and more all this is giving a great fright to businesses many of which are here because its an easy place to work the situation isnt short of irony these are exactly the policies that hong kongs business tycoons feared would come with universal suffrage instead theyre coming from an autocratic government like their communist brethren across the border whose contributions to economic theory include phrases like "building a harmonious society" and "peaceful development" hong kongs leaders fear public disquiet when mr tung tried to ram through a national security law in more than a half million people hit the streets beijing sacked him when mr tsang tried to raise taxes while sitting on an &# billion fiscal surplus the outcry was so loud that his financial secretary abandoned the plan what these episodes show is that hong kongers arent hoodwinked by beijings propaganda soon after the governments fawning year anniversary video was released a blogger released a tweaked rejoinder complete with lyrics mocking the governments arrogance and calling for universal suffrage but over the past decade chinas position has been made clear "one country two systems" has lost all relevance its stability that counts populist politics and managed democracy may accomplish that for a time perhaps a long time but hong kong will be the poorer for it ms kissel is editor of the wall street journal asias editorial page
