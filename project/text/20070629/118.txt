weekend journal the home front real estate when the dock is worth more than the house boat friendly homes sell for big premiums friction in florida the most valuable piece of a waterfront property isnt always the land sometimes its the dock in vacation spots from buzzards bay in massachusetts to puget sound in washington home buyers are increasingly paying big premiums sometimes as much as twice the cost of comparable properties for waterfront homes that come with their own docks in parts of south carolinas marshy low country docks are doubling property values while in puget sound theyre increasing values by as much as &# in the northeast the dock premium has reached as high as &# million on long island and &# million or more on nantucket in laurel harbor n y a two acre parcel with a foot beach and a foot dock was recently listed for &# million even though local zoning rules prohibit the construction of a house on the property and in cove neck n y a buyer recently paid &# million for a waterfront home and then promptly tore it down the value the listing agent on the sale says was in the dock its nearly impossible to build a new dock in many parts of the country because of environmental regulations local ordinances or in some cases outright bans on new construction in the long island village of centre island which hasnt seen a new dock built since the s pop star billy joel recently gave up his five year battle to build a dock after running up against federal environmental laws "i will not buy where i cannot have a dock " says year old charles manker who keeps four boats on the dock of his square foot summer house in chatham mass and also has a property with a dock on spring island s c a cottage industry of expediters has sprung up to help homeowners steer new dock building projects through the thicket of regulations patricia altschul who hired an expediter when she wanted to renovate a run down dock on her property in centre island likened getting the construction permit to "renegotiating the salt treaty " it took two years but she ultimately got approval to rebuild the dock premiums come as boat ownership soars there were million recreational boats registered in the u s in according to the national marine manufacturers association up from a decade earlier as the number of boats has grown so too has the dock building logjam stirring up community feuds and petty politics between newcomers and longtime residents "it all boils down to the same thing " says john weldon a member of the city council in neptune beach fla which recently passed new dock building regulations "more and more money comes down to florida and it creates more and more friction " although laws regulating design and materials have driven up costs somewhat in recent years the physical cost to construct a deep water dock rarely tops &# in most parts of the country and smaller docks can cost far less in a few areas rugged seas or unusual restrictions can push the price tag into the six figures and maintenance can add thousands of dollars a year even so that pales in comparison to what docks add to the value of the real estate "i personally think some of the values are overstated " says steve bliven a harbor planning consultant in south dartmouth mass but mr bliven adds "its a market economy " there is no official measure for calculating dock premiums but appraisers brokers and other real estate experts say they are able to get a reasonable estimate in various areas by analyzing past sales in the cape cod town of osterville for example the median sale price of a home with a dock last year was &# million versus &# million for a waterfront home without one according to local real estate agent jack cotton while properties with docks are often larger or better situated mr cotton says a good dock routinely adds at least &# million to a propertys sale price appraisers also look at "paired sales" properties that are similar except for one feature chatham mass where mr manker has his dock provides a particularly good example two five bedroom colonials that sold within four months of one another both were waterfront properties with similar acreage and square footage but only one had a dock the difference in sale price &# million a premium for most of the th century adding a dock required little more than a local building permit new environmental regulations passed in the s and s added a layer of bureaucracy but rarely blocked construction altogether except in a few especially sensitive areas only recently have construction bans moratoriums and other harsh restrictions become widespread enough for docks to command such significant premiums in some areas long waiting lists for berths at public moorings and slip space at private yacht clubs mean that private docks are the only option for many boat owners in need of a place to tie up their crafts duxbury mass resident bill rice who recently paid &# million for a acre waterfront property with a five bedroom house a pool and a dock for his foot boston whaler says he would have had to wait years to get a mooring in town without a private dock he says "we wouldnt have had access " but for many boat owners private docks are about convenience rather than need "to be able to walk down to the end of the dock grab my gear and go its a great thing " says long island lawyer richard hutchinson who owns a home in cove neck n y with a foot long deep water dock for his foot chris craft power boat docks are worth far less in areas where they are commonplace or relatively easy to build in much of the midwest for example where lakefront docks usually require no special permits they add just &# to &# to the property value roughly the cost of construction the ones that add the most value are those that have access to deep water even at low tide include water and electric hookups and can withstand storms without being pulled out of the water deep water docks commonly defined as those with at least six feet of water at low tide and suitable for a large sailboat are often worth two or three times as much as those in more shallow water there are exceptions however in nantucket where only a handful of properties have private docks and new construction has been banned since april a property sold for nearly &# million that year and local agents say anywhere from &# million to &# million of the price came from the dock this despite the fact that it sits in four or five feet of water at low tide enough for only about a foot boat seattle based dock builder waterfront construction charges up to &# per hour to help property owners obtain an average of seven required permits from the state department of ecology dave douglas a permit coordinator for the company says the cost of getting a dock permit has more than tripled in the past decade when billy joel paid &# million for a acre waterfront estate on centre island in located in the oyster bay national wildlife refuge he assumed hed be allowed to rebuild a dock that once stood on the property but u s fish &amp wildlife service which controls dock building in the refuge refused the request because the propertys dock permit had expired mr joel who had local support for the project eventually gave up and is now selling "because im a high profile person if i was allowed to build a dock it would open up a can of worms because many people have applied for dock permits and have been denied " mr joel says a spokesman for the refuge says the agencys rules are intended to protect wildlife and are applied consistently most current dock building restrictions are rooted in environmental issues and concerns about increases in recreational boating activity many of the countrys most popular boating areas lie in environmentally sensitive areas floridas biscayne bay for example is a key habitat for the threatened manatees while puget sound is home to the threatened chinook salmon others argue that strict rules are necessary because while one dock may not do much environmental damage many docks can "if everybody who lives in oyster bay wants to put up a dock then all wed have is docks everywhere " says michelle williams deputy manager of the oyster bay refuge ms altschul on centre island agrees "theres nothing worse than seeing islands where every feet theres a dock sticking out " she says ms altschul of course already has a dock and with her house on the market for &# million shes ready to cash in on the premium which her real estate agent barbara candee estimates to be at least &# million others too are looking to take advantage john foster a year old lawyer and developer paid &# for a acre parcel of land on edisto island s c two years ago the sale included dock rights as long as he put one up by dec mr foster says he spent &# to build a foot long dock even though he doesnt own a boat and doesnt plan to build a house on the lot until hes closer to retirement passing on the chance to build a dock he says would have been like throwing away money besides he adds he likes having it occasionally hell drive the miles from his home in columbia s c just to visit "i sit on the end of the dock " mr foster says "and have a drink "
