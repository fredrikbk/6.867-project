weekend journal tastings fifteen steps to a successful winery visit go early ask questions dont get carried away the empty box rule there has never been a better time than now right now this week to go visit a winery near you all over the u s more wineries than ever are open and eager for you to drop by many of them plan special events during the summer and entire regions now are heavily promoting their wine trails if you missed weekend journals recent cover story about the spread of american wineries and wine tourism drop us a note at wine wsj com and well send it along winemakers and winery owners are among the worlds most charming and interesting people and they often give away samples of their art for free why wouldnt you go if you do here are some tips on how to visit wineries with some suggestions for winery etiquette weve focused here on visiting wineries in newer wine regions where tourism might not be as well advanced as places like napa and sonoma get an empty box for wine grab one at your local wine store or think about buying a styrofoam wine carrier from the shipping store trust us on this you are going to start buying bottles of wine that will rattle around in your car unless youve brought a box youll thank us for this advice when your box is full and this might have an added benefit see below hire a car or have a designated driver chances are you will taste more wine than you expected to those little tastes add up not only that but if youre not used to drinking wine early in the day it could catch up with you fast in many of the newer wine regions the wineries might be spread out so you have some driving ahead of you various tour companies are popping up in wine regions all over the country that are happy to chart your visits to wineries and take you to them take the kids but if you do find something for them to do wine regions are very pretty around now so green and lush and winery people are nice so its a shame for children to miss the experience but tasting rooms can be boring for children so ask right away if there are cookies or crackers animals to play with or anything else for kids to do some though not nearly enough have basketball nets bocce courts coloring books or play doh take along a rubiks cube which did the trick for our kids for a while go early especially on weekends the thing thats the most fun about a winery visit is chatting with the people behind the bar who are often the owners or winemakers especially at smaller wineries they wont have time to talk with you if its busy focus on the smaller places there is something comforting and unintimidating about the larger places with big parking lots t shirts for sale and lots of hired help but to feel the passion of wine and winemaking its important to seek out the smaller places where you can really spend some quality time with the people behind the bar be polite yes this seems obvious but weve visited hundreds of tasting rooms over more than years and were always amazed how rude people can be in a smaller winery you are likely to be in part of someones home and possibly talking to the owner and youre probably getting wine free or for a small charge be nice and show them the respect they deserve try new unfamiliar things in many parts of the country the grapes that grow best are native american grapes or hybrids perhaps the winery makes a chardonnay but its not as good as its vignoles if you stick to grapes you know you could miss out on the regional specialties have an answer to the question "what kind of wine do you like " tasting room personnel tend to ask this reflexively as an ice breaker but many people who arent totally comfortable with wine find it hard to answer on the spot in any event wed be hesitant to answer it directly because we dont want to try only the kinds of wines we already know we like even if you think you only like dry wines you should try some that are sweet and vice versa think about saying something like "i enjoy all kinds of wines which would you start with " ask where the grapes were grown many wineries these days all over the country make wine from grapes grown in california or someplace else far away theres certainly nothing wrong with that but when we visit a winery in say connecticut part of the fun of the visit is tasting wines made from grapes grown in connecticut near where were standing if you dont want to ask just peek at the label if it says "estate bottled " thats a sign that the grapes were probably grown right around the corner ask questions dont be shy if you ask simple questions like "does this look like it will be a good year " or "what food goes best with this wine " the person behind the counter will appreciate your interest dont try to show off with questions like "did this get any ml " unless you really really care about malolactic fermentation there are no stupid questions and in any event you cant do worse than the visitor who once asked a tasting room pourer whom weve known for years "how long does the wine stay in caskets " remember that its a tasting room not a bar if you want to drink a big glass of wine buy a bottle and have a picnic and even if you are not driving be very careful about how much youre drinking people who have had too much to drink ruin the tasting experience for everybody be careful how much you buy its a nice gesture to buy a bottle or two but you shouldnt feel pressured to still we tend to get carried away at wineries and buy more bottles than we intended youll be amazed how quickly those bottles add up many wineries now can ship across state lines so you can probably call and get those wines after you get home if you have non buyers remorse later keep wines out of the hot car a car thats sitting in the sun will cook your wines in no time flat find a way to avoid that ask wineries how to ship your wine back if you have bought a case or so at various wineries you might find it easier to ship it back so ask if there is a local shipping place that specializes in this this might not be possible depending on various state laws so this is where your styrofoam carrier comes in just pack it and check it on the plane with you there are obviously some risks involved but we have done this for decades without incident check with your airline to make sure it has no rules against this finally keep this in mind the wines you bought at the winery will not taste as good at home as they did at the winery were sorry to end this list with a downer but its true when youre there surrounded by the wondrous sights and smells of a winery with the winemaker across the bar pouring wine in pristine condition that has never traveled the wine tastes special you simply cant replicate those conditions at home but this is exactly why you should go taste wine at a winery this week you can contact us at wine wsj com
