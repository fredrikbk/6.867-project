qualcomm rejects broadcom pact patent fight continues as proposed settlement is met with contempt qualcomm inc said it rejected a patent settlement proposal from rival broadcom inc that qualcomm estimated would cost &# billion to &# billion over three years qualcomm characterizing that proposal as unreasonable said it had offered to pay broadcom far less &# million as well as offer its competitor a royalty free license to use qualcomms widely used patents on cellular technology but broadcom said that offer would have left cellphone makers or other users of its chips liable for royalties to qualcomm an unacceptable condition the unusual disclosure of proposed licensing terms reported by bloomberg yesterday is the latest twist in a struggle that culminated in a recent international trade commission ruling that would exclude imports of some future cellphones containing qualcomm chips found to infringe broadcom patents though qualcomm is known for wielding patent power in cellphones charging royalties of close to of the price of many handsets the itc ruling and another jury verdict have given broadcom negotiating leverage in entering the market for handset chips broadcom laid out proposed terms in a june letter to qualcomm that reached some cellular carriers as did a later qualcomm response broadcoms general counsel david dull suggested that qualcomm pay &# for every broadband capable handset u s carriers sell that includes the companys patented battery power technology he characterized that amount as a small fraction of the revenue generated for handsets by the carriers and less than qualcomms gross profit on chips for third generation cellphones but qualcomm executives said the &# per cellphone would translate into a royalty rate of on its chips a percentage far above the industry norm broadcoms real motivation is to "destroy qualcomms business model " argued louis lupin qualcomms general counsel broadcom insists that it only made the &# proposal because qualcomm wouldnt enter into what it termed an "exhaustive " royalty free settlement that would cover handset makers that use broadcom chips eliminating what broadcom considers "double dipping" for charging makers and users of the patented technology "we would enter into that in a heartbeat " said david rosmann broadcoms vice president of intellectual property litigation but mr lupin said such a deal would break the pattern broadcom has set with other chip makers and their handset customers who would then demand similar treatment "broadcoms prospective customers are already paying us a royalty " he said "there is no double dipping here "
