weekend journal review theater a taste of ambrosia romeo and juliet public theater delacorte theater central park new york free closes july hamlet shakespeare theatre company lansburgh theatre seventh st nw washington &# &# closes july old acquaintance roundabout theatre company american airlines theatre w nd st new york &# &# closes aug new york the best show in town this month is in central park the public theaters outdoor version of "romeo and juliet" is contemporary in flavor visually striking crisply staged and emotionally direct everything in short that a shakespeare in the park production should be right down to the no holds barred swordplay it also marks the arrival of a new star in the theatrical sky lauren ambrose lately of "six feet under " who made a strong broadway debut in last years revival of "awake and sing" and now confirms that she is an extravagantly gifted stage actress whose potential appears to be unlimited i liked nearly everything about this production starting with mark wendlands set a huge shallow wading pool surrounded by a rotating wooden sidewalk and spanned by a movable bridge made of metal scaffolding at first glance i thought it gimmicky but i was wrong it serves as an exceptionally flexible unexpectedly intimate playing space that michael greif the director uses with the utmost ingenuity i was surprised to read in the program that mr greif had directed only one shakespeare play "pericles " prior to this hes best known for his work on "grey gardens" and "rent " and he brings to his staging of "romeo and juliet" the same savory immediacy youd expect to find in a musical everybodys blood is boiling hot especially that of ms ambrose whose portrayal of the year old juliets sexual awakening is ardent fiery and wholly believable you know exactly what she means when she describes herself as "not yet enjoyd " oscar isaac isnt as compelling as romeo i cant see how anybody could be but his acting is strong and serious while most of the secondary roles are played memorably especially christopher evan welch as a self loathing mercutio camryn manheim as juliets bawdy cigarette rolling nurse and michael cristofer as her explosively furious father this show deserves a longer run perhaps on broadway where i suspect it would appeal to the same young playgoers who are flocking to see "spring awakening " but you dont have to be a teenager to be swept off your feet by mr greifs "romeo and juliet " all you need is to have been one washington unlike the publics "romeo and juliet " the shakespeare theatre companys modern dress "hamlet" is sabotaged by its youth friendly obtrusively clever high concept its all about teen angst director michael kahn gives us a pouty blond prince of denmark jeffrey carlson who whines his way from scene to scene brandishing a bottle of pills prozac no doubt as he lurches into his soliloquy on suicide earlier we see him reading a alvarezs "the savage god a study of suicide " a directorial touch that deserves some sort of prize for pretentiousness the other characters listen to ipods chat on cellphones and do everything else mr kahn can think of to let us know that theyre soooo up to date i can just imagine a "hamlet" that made effective use of all this trickery but mr carlsons pretty boy performance is too lightweight to be anything but laughable mr kahn the shakespeare theatres artistic director is a considerable artist his "othello" was as good as any ive seen and so i did my best to give him the benefit of the doubt but i simply dont know what he had in mind by turning one of the cornerstones of western art into "dude wheres my hamlet " new york john van druten is one of the forgotten men of american theater twenty of his plays opened on broadway between and but until now none of them has been revived there not even such long running hits as "the voice of the turtle" or "i remember mama " now the roundabout theatre company has exhumed "old acquaintance " a comedy that was bought by hollywood three years later and turned into an unmemorable vehicle for bette davis i went to see it mainly out of curiosity but stayed to cheer far from being a musty old relic "old acquaintance" is a fabulously well made play that has lost nothing of its freshness and bite van druten specialized in the kind of commercial comedy that used to be known as "sophisticated " mainly because his more liberated characters made no bones about the titillating fact that they were s l e e p i n g around such things were then unmentionable in the movies which may explain why the film versions of "old acquaintance" and "the voice of the turtle" are as forgotten as their author this time around he gives us a pair of lady novelists one a worldly wise bohemian margaret colin who is perfect and the other a middlebrow suburbanite harriet harris who grew up together and are still the best of friends even though they dont really like each other novelist no has a considerably younger lover corey stoll novelist no has a year old daughter diane davis who idolizes novelist no the resulting entanglements make for two hours worth of slickly witty repartee "i wish there werent something so immoral about making a martini for ones self" served up on a pair of fancy sets like s n behrmans "biography " another long lost broadway hit recently revived to equally fine effect by the pearl theatre company "old acquaintance" is quite a bit more heartfelt than is immediately apparent and michael wilson has made the forgivable mistake of directing some of the scenes for laughs instead of truth not to worry though ms colin and ms harris play it down the center and by the time the curtain falls youll find yourself caring very much indeed about the fate of their uneasy friendship mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
