narrative discord critiques of iraq war reveal rifts among army officers colonels essay draws rebuttal from general captains losing faith last december lt col paul yingling attended a purple heart ceremony for soldiers injured in iraq as he watched the wounded troops collect their medals the year old officer reflected on his two combat tours in iraq he was frustrated at how slowly the army had adjusted to the demands of guerrilla war and ashamed he hadnt done more to push for change by the end of the ceremony he says he could barely look the wounded troops in the eyes col yingling just had been chosen to lead a soldier battalion "i cant command like this " he recalls thinking he poured his thoughts into a blistering critique of the army brass "a failure in generalship " published last month in armed forces journal a nongovernment publication "americas generals have been checked by a form of war that they did not prepare for and do not understand " his piece argued the essay rocketed around the army via email the director of the armys elite school for war planners scrapped his lesson plan for a day to discuss it the commanding general at fort hood assembled about captains in the chapel of that texas base and delivered a speech intended to rebut it "i think col yingling was speaking some truths that most of us talk about over beers " says col matthew moten a history professor at west point who also served in iraq "very few of us have the courage or foolhardiness to put them in print " the controversy over col yinglings essay is part of a broader debate within the military over why the army has struggled in iraq what it should look like going forward and how it should be led its a fight being hashed out in the form of what one pentagon official calls "failure narratives " some of these explanations for the militarys struggles in iraq come through official channels others like col yinglings are unofficial and show up in military journals and books the conflicting theories on iraq reflect growing divisions within the military along generational lines pitting young officers exhausted by multiple iraq tours and eager for change against more conservative generals army and air force officers are also developing their own divergent explanations for iraq the air force narratives typically suggest the military should in the future avoid manpower intensive guerrilla wars army officers counter that such fights are inevitable post mortems of battlefield failures are nothing new the army used col harry summerss "on strategy a critical analysis of the vietnam war" to explain its failure in that war and to chart a future course col summers blamed the loss on political leaders who hadnt mobilized the country for war and army officers who hadnt pushed hard enough for an all out assault on north vietnams army and its capital instead the generals had wasted energy battling a guerrilla threat that was just a distraction he argued "summers was immensely influential " says retired col don snider a professor at the u s military academy at west point his book buttressed a shift in focus within the army during the s and s away from preparing for small wars and toward being ready for a conventional fight with the soviet army in europe the first of the armys explanations for iraq was embedded in its new doctrine for fighting insurgencies that effort was overseen by gen david petraeus now the top general in iraq written in by a bevy of active duty officers historians and a human rights advocate the doctrine criticized the army for turning away from guerrilla war after vietnam "the story of how the army found itself less than ready to fight an insurgency goes back to the armys unwillingness to internalize and build upon the lessons of vietnam " an introduction to the document reads the army is learning in iraq how to fight such wars better the document says but its authors including gen petraeus worried that the lessons may have come too late after the american people had run out of patience since then other officers have weighed in with competing failure narratives earlier this year maj gen charles dunlap an air force officer in the pentagon with a penchant for stirring up debate suggested that gen petraeuss narrative missed the point the u s was struggling in iraq because it had no business using a large ground force to fight a guerrilla war he argued in armed forces journal "absent overwhelming numbers it is virtually impossible for even well equipped ground forces to defeat insurgencies in the midst of sullen populations often sympathetic to the enemy " he wrote he advocated replacing large numbers of u s troops with indigenous forces bolstered by american precision bombs and surveillance planes the conflicting theses are fueling a debate over whether the pentagon should stick to its plan to increase the size of the army and marine corps by troops by the buildup will siphon money from big weapons programs each additional soldier costs the army about &# a year gen dunlaps theory suggests the additional troops are unnecessary gen petraeuss counterinsurgency doctrine holds that about to troops are needed to protect every civilians from guerilla attack in iraq that would mean a force of several hundred thousand a substantial increase from current troop levels the conflicting explanations for the armys struggles in iraq could also breed mistrust in the ranks many young officers are frustrated and exhausted by four years of war and dont understand why their small victories in the field arent adding up to a safer and more stable iraq "there is enormous pride among young officers in their units and in each other " says lt col peter kilner who recently returned from two months in iraq interviewing young army officers for a research project "but i see strong evidence that they are rapidly losing faith in the army and the countrys political leadership " in his controversial essay col yingling pinned much of the armys failings in iraq on generals who he says didnt prepare for guerrilla fights in the decade prior to the war and then didnt adjust as quickly as front line troops young officers had to adapt to survive he wrote the generals products of a system that encouraged conformity and discouraged risk takers were often a step behind the enemy he said "it is unreasonable to expect that an officer who spends years conforming to institutional expectations will emerge as an innovator " he wrote the solution he said is to change the way the army selects and promotes generals taking into account reviews by subordinates col yingling first deployed to iraq in july as part of an artillery battalion ordered to train iraqi security forces when he returned to the u s in late he began banging out articles for journals in his spare time he and a fellow officer pushed the army to get more serious about training indigenous forces and rebuilding the country his field artillery bosses he says told him that he should be worrying about more important things in col yingling volunteered to go back to iraq with the rd armored cavalry regiment he was given responsibility for overseeing economic development projects iraqi security forces and governance in tal afar a small city in northern iraq the soldier regiments year was so successful that president bush cited it in a nationally televised address when col yingling returned to fort hood he says he found an army that hadnt really changed "the thing the army institutionally is still struggling to learn is that the most important thing we do in counterinsurgency is building security forces and local government capacity " he said in an internal army interview in "and yet all our organizations are designed around the least important line of operations combat operations " a few weeks later after attending the purple heart ceremony for the wounded soldiers he decided he had to do something his essay "a failure in generalship " drew upon dozens of conversations he had overheard in mess halls and on patrol in iraq "it included no original thoughts " he says but it quickly made him something of a cult hero among the armys junior and mid grade officers at the armys school for advanced military studies in kansas where its brightest majors attend a one year course on war planning col kevin benson dropped lesson plans to let students discuss the article "most of the majors reaction to the article was right on " says col benson who until last month headed the army school col benson says he counseled the young officers to be cautious about judging their superiors "all right you are going to have to work for some of these general officers " col benson says he told them "if you feel this way what is your obligation to them " at fort hood maj gen jeff hammond the top general at the sprawling base summoned all of the captains to hear his response to col yinglings critique about officers in their mid to late s most of them iraq veterans filled the pews and lined the walls of the base chapel "i believe in our generals they are dedicated selfless servants " gen hammond recalls saying the year old officer told the young captains that col yingling wasnt competent to judge generals because he had never been one "he has never worn the shoes of a general " gen hammond recalls saying the captains reactions highlighted the growing gap between some junior officers and the generals "if we are not qualified to judge who is " says one iraq veteran who was at the meeting another officer in attendance says that he and his colleagues didnt want to hear a defense of the armys senior officers "we want someone at higher levels to take accountability for what went wrong in iraq " he says the generational divide is fueling a fight over how the army should use the extra troops it is getting the army wants to build five more brigades which consist of to soldiers each but some young officers such as lt col john nagl an iraq veteran who helped write the new counterinsurgency doctrine want more radical change he contends the extra troops should be used to build a new man advisory corps focused on training foreign forces "the most important military component of the long war on terrorism will not be the fighting we do ourselves but how well we enable and empower our allies to fight with us " he wrote in an essay published by the center for a new american security a washington think tank although senior army officials dont like col nagls idea it has some support among pentagon civilians in defense secretary robert gatess office "a big question right now in the pentagon is how do you get the army to begin this debate about itself and what it should look like after iraq " says andrew hoehn a former pentagon strategist and senior analyst at the rand corp a government funded think tank frustration among junior officers could drive bottom up change he says the right failure narrative voiced by the top brass and backed up by concrete action could help rekindle the faith of young officers who are leaving the service at a worrisome rate late last month col j b burton who commands a soldier brigade in baghdad warned in a memo to the armys top generals of a looming crisis in the junior officer corps todays officers "have spent the past four years in a continuous cycle of fighting training deploying fighting etc and they see no end in sight they have seen their closest friends killed and maimed leaving young spouses and children as widows and single parent kids " he wrote many young officers complain that the army which is desperately short of captains treats them like interchangeable cogs "as long as i dont get a dui or fornicate on my bosss desk i will be promoted with my peers " col burtons memo quotes one officer as saying gen george casey the army chief of staff and formerly the top commander in iraq has been wrestling with how to respond hes spent the last several months meeting with soldiers world wide he also solicited col burtons blunt memo "everyone is watching to see how gen casey will lead this younger generation along " says col snider the west point professor
