no more jack and jill or jerry and jane after reading your article about the growing pressure on parents to choose the perfect baby name "the baby name business " weekend journal june i worry that my wife and i are guilty of parental negligence we chose the names of our three children because michael was on a list in the hospital rachael sounded nice and clare is an old family name now i learn that the wrong name may keep my kids from getting peoples attention when theyre searching for a job or looking good on a marquee or political banner or being readily found on google it makes you wonder how jimmy carter ronald reagan bill clinton and george bush twice ever got to be president robert j inlow charlottesville va thank god for tradition and the wonders of our efficient ashkenazi jewish heritage which restricted us to naming our children for deceased relatives whose names werent shared by any living relatives if a first name is taken from one parents side the second name is taken from the others instead of searching for ever more bizarre and unusual names we were able to spend time reminiscing with family members about beloved relatives giving our children a unique personal connection to their past our childrens traditional names are easy to recognize and spell with loads of favorable historical and cultural associations to develop in addition to ties with a specific inspirational relative why saddle a child with a name that needs to be spelled out repeatedly that will inevitably sound dated and that causes people to wonder what the parents could possibly have had in mind michael e malamut dedham mass it was amusing to see that nevaeh heaven spelled backward was ranked rd out of the most popular names for baby girls in the u s in can dog be far behind as a popular name for baby boys in dale ellis las cruces n m that there is so much angst attached to choosing a moniker that is "google friendly " "unique" and "catchy" says a lot about the american perspective of image is everything what happened to inculcating the importance of character civic duty and humility first and hoping that these will beget a great legacy later for some reason i dont believe that a set of th century parents sought out a numerologist or retained a name consultant when they asked themselves "what name sounds good with einstein " patti godin healey raleigh n c i freely admit to being from the old school but i was shocked to see how far i have slipped from the mainstream in the radical s when i was growing up this article might have been in "mad magazine" as a sharp sarcastic stab at the establishment as a serious piece in the journal it is astounding we are confronted daily with the lack of discipline low expectations and the rude disrespectful behavior of modern american children how will the current batch turn out if before their birth their parents in naming them are more focused on making them more corporately acceptable than on the awesome act of bringing a new human into the world i suggest a law requiring all children to be named after one of the seven dwarfs at age they could apply to change their names but they would have to prove that theyve earned them david t jack cfa baden pa
