price floor ruling may have small effect mark ups are most likely for high end products antitrust door left open yesterdays supreme court decision allowing manufacturers to set and enforce minimum prices for their products upends a nearly year old ban on price agreements in american retailing but experts say it isnt likely to upset pricing practices for autos electronics books or shampoos the decision a ruling that split conservatives and liberals lifts the threat of an automatic antitrust suit where price agreements are found but doesnt require such agreements nor does it permit anticompetitive behaviors legal experts say the justice department could still bring cases where agreements are shown to reduce competition jeremy bulow a former chief economist at the federal trade commission and now a professor of economics at stanford universitys graduate school of business said that "as much as i hate to go along with the conservatives on the court i think they got it right " a minimum price could give makers of sophisticated new products a chance to fund training or other services since the court left open the door to antitrust action if the agreements protect or fuel a monopoly consumers are still protected he said historically manufacturers and retailers have danced between two court decisions that have guided product pricing and the power of a manufacturer to control distribution the dr miles precedent named after a seller of patent medicines decreed price restraint agreements illegal eight years later the supreme court said in its colgate doctrine that manufacturers were free to unilaterally set a price and choose to refuse sales to any retailer that violated the set price so long as the two werent directly tied the rulings led to a tension between manufacturers wanting to thwart discounters from setting the price of their products and retailers that saw volume efficiencies through low prices as their way to increase their profits the result is a long history of advertisements listing discounts from the msrp or manufacturers suggested retail price and online prices that hid the discounted price behind a "click now" button some critics including the supreme courts minority said manufacturers may be able to raise prices across the board in the wake of the ruling they fear the ruling undermines advances in logistics and low cost operations that have allowed some companies such as wal mart stores inc to deliver lower prices on everyday goods to consumers now they say a manufacturer could negate such advantages by cutting a deal with a higher cost retailer in exchange for exclusivity or some other benefit to the manufacturer a wal mart spokesman declined to comment but economists and many sellers say that for most sales whether cars big screen tvs or everyday items pricing will still be set by the give and take between buyer and seller "if you raise the price you sacrifice volume " says jeremy anwyl chief executive of edmunds com an automobile pricing service only in certain cases such as high end goods will an impact be felt say experts in the case of exotic makers such as bentley or mercedes these companies already control prices by limiting supplies says mr anwyl auto dealers could get around minimum price requirements for vehicles where demand is weak and inventories high for instance by paying more for a trade in he says "one way or the other dealers will adjust pricing to the market or sales will stall " he says makers of books toiletries and towels also could find it difficult to flex their new pricing muscle with retailers such as wal mart or target corp for fear of losing their business just as wal mart bargains hard for what it pays for merchandise it will be able to bargain with manufacturers to keep its discounts say retail experts chet flynn president of necessities inc a norwell mass distributor of home theater systems says a lack of price discipline by big screen tv makers has already contributed to a painful consolidation of consumer electronic retailers he says such consolidation has limited consumers retail choices more than price agreements other companies including high end audio supplier bose corp already strictly enforce their pricing policies "bose knows better than dealers how much money they need to keep the doors open " he says mallory b duncan general counsel of the national retail federation says the court "put a light thumb on the scale" to benefit some retailers and not others but he argues that the overall effect is slight manufacturers are still barred from enforcing anticompetitive policies in the past any agreement was automatically considered anticompetitive behavior he said the new "ruling gives the other side a chance to show there might be a competitive advantage to preventing retailers from selling products at a lower price " not everyone agrees with his sentiment "of all the recent supreme court antitrust decisions this is going to significantly change business practices and make life a lot harder for discounters " says kevin arquit a partner with the law firm simpson thacher &amp bartlett llp and a former director of federal trade commissions bureau of competition auto makers for instance may try to enforce minimum prices in part because its unlikely any single player in the highly competitive auto industry could be said to have "market power" to control pricing says mr arquit constance e bagley associate professor of business administration at harvard business school says "the real losers in this are the consumers " she says retailers may be forced to sell products at higher prices or to strike a deal with one seller to drop competitive products either way it would hurt the consumer she says justice stephen breyer who often has sided with business interests dissented along with justices john paul stevens david souter and ruth bader ginsburg justice breyer argued that there was nothing new in the economic literature to justify overruling a century old precedent that american manufacturers and retailers had long understood "the only safe predictions to make about todays decision are that it will likely raise the price of goods at retail and that it will create considerable legal turbulence" as lower courts examine a plethora of various pricing agreements he wrote but even those who believe the decision is anticonsumer say the market will resist efforts to raise prices patrick byrne ceo of discount web retailer overstock com inc calls the ruling "a bad decision " but insists manufacturers wont be able to impose a minimum price on sites such as overstock com "manufacturers need a channel like ours to exist " he said vauhini vara susan warren and jeffrey a trachtenberg
