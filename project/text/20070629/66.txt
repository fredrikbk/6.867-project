politics &amp economics grassleys tax clout republicans support is crucial to democrats washington a principal reason democrats in congress think they might succeed in raising taxes on the hedge fund and private equity industries is the sympathy for the idea from a prominent republican sen charles grassley of iowa mr grassley the senates top republican tax writer is crucial to getting tax legislation through the closely divided senate a plain spoken populist he is a frequent critic of powerful entities including big companies that he views as putting regular people at a disadvantage especially offensive to mr grassley who first sat on the senate tax panel in are what he calls attempts by wealthy companies or individuals to use maneuvers by "sharp penciled lawyers" to reduce their tax bills middle income people look at their tax bill and "pay whats owed " mr grassley said in an interview "they dont have somebody in there figuring out well now with this comma in this law maybe i can do this and youll save on your taxes " it remains to be seen how far mr grassley will go to translate such sentiments into legislation that hits private equity firms and hedge funds he is already a co sponsor along with finance committee chairman max baucus a montana democrat of a bill that would require private hedge fund and private equity partnerships that go public as blackstone group recently did to pay taxes at a corporate rate of a far bigger question is whether mr grassley will support legislation raising the taxes fund managers pay on their cut of profits known as carried interest the house recently proposed such a bill requiring managers of certain partnerships to pay income tax rates as high as on carried interest rather than the capital gains rate of mr grassley said he hasnt yet made up his mind yet but if he does decide to support such a change he has an argument ready for his republican colleagues failing to maintain the integrity of the capital gains rate will make that tax rate vulnerable to attacks from democrats who want to let it rise to in as it currently is scheduled to do republicans would like to head off that increase mr grassley led efforts to reduce the rate on capital gains to in and then to extend the lower rate he says that it should remain in place but that if very wealthy people are seen as unfairly benefiting democrats will have a stronger argument for a higher rate "what im doing is an effort to ward off the demagogues on capitol hill that can say this is just a way for the rich to get richer and the middle class to be stung " he said "i would ask my republican colleagues to look at it from that standpoint that we want to make sure we arent feeding the demagoguery of class warfare that the other party is always getting blue ribbons for doing " taking a populist stance often is easier for mr grassley than for other senators since it reflects his constituents sensibilities and on this issue he has no home state industry to appease last week as industry groups were in distress over house democrats bill raising taxes on carried interest mr grassley was en route to his familys acre farm in new hartford iowa he spent saturday cultivating the corn and soybean fields "its kind of enjoyable " he said he links his interest in private equity tax issues to a joint effort begun with mr baucus several years ago to prevent u s companies from avoiding taxes by reincorporating overseas many companies made such moves called inversions and mr grassley at the time railed against toolmaker stanley works for threatening to do the same "this is a longstanding issue of where ive been after organizations mostly corporations up until now that have tried to avoid paying taxes " mr grassley said "if you go back to stanley i think thats the first time i may have been involved " separately mr grassley has pressed for greater requirements for hedge fund transparency citing concern that private and public pension funds lack necessary information about their investments in hedge funds mr grassley said he supported the publicly traded partnership bill after consulting the filings and other public statements of blackstone and another firm that recently went public fortress investment group the companies had hoped to avoid the corporate tax rate on much of their income based on an exception for certain public partnerships contained in a tax law currently those partnerships dont pay any taxes directly instead their income flows through to individual partners who pay the capital gains rate on their share of profits mr grassley ultimately decided that companies such as blackstone and fortress shouldnt qualify for the exception he said the old law needed to be updated to account for business structures that he said "couldnt have been perceived" when the law was drafted two decades ago "if it acts like a corporation then it ought to be taxed like a corporation " mr grassley said "this is not a bill about increasing taxes this is a bill about not eroding the tax base " mr grassley made similar points in april while on a jog with vermont democratic rep peter welch in canada where the two were attending a meeting of u s and canadian lawmakers mr welch followed the baucus grassley bill with the introduction of similar legislation in the house mr grassley said he also discussed private equity tax issues with canadian officials he and his aides said they havent yet spoken with officials in the united kingdom who are wrestling with similar questions on the other issue the tax treatment of carried interest messrs baucus and grassley say they plan to wait until after july committee hearings to make a decision but their aides have spent months examining the matter "that may take some legislation " mr grassley said "obviously if were satisfied with the way its being interpreted nothing needs to be done " mr grassley acknowledges that on carried interest he would face a minefield of criticism from the affected industries and other republicans lobbying against the proposal already is intense six weeks ago another republican senator whom mr grassley declined to name visited his office to raise concerns about the matter "i listened to his concerns and i explained what we were up to he may not have agreed with us but i think he came to the conclusion that we were sincere in studying the issue and hadnt made up our minds yet " mr grassley said former house ways and means chairman and frequent grassley nemesis bill thomas a california republican who retired from congress last year said lawmakers should be careful about making sudden moves on tax changes that will roil the markets "a sober approach analyzing what you want to do telegraphing what you want to do and getting broad support which is the way sen grassley usually legislates is the way to go " mr thomas said
