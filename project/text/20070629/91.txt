the daily fix trail blazers supersonics reload as nba draft brings picks trades online edition as expected the first two picks of last nights nba draft were greg oden and kevin durant who joined the portland trail blazers and the seattle supersonics respectively the big news came from a pair of west east trades the blazers sent zach randolph and his long resume of poor off field decisions fred jones and dan dickau to the new york knicks for channing frye and steve francis and the sonics traded ray allen to the boston celtics for delonte west wally szczerbiak and the rights to the no pick jeff green a nice feature true hoops live blog of reactions from various nba team bloggers in the washington post michael wilbon calls portland and seattle "the stars of the night " writing that "goodness portlands scouts and gm kevin pritchard have to be giddy knowing theyll come into the season with oden lamarcus aldridge frye rookie of the year brandon roy and the spaniard rudy fernandez a guard with international experience and lottery level talent " looking at the draft as a whole mr wilbon writes that "it might not be the kind of draft that will rival the talent pool that yielded olajuwon jordan and barkley the one that energized professional basketball globally reshaped the nba and to a degree american popular culture but the nba draft if you care about pro basketball is something to get excited over so many talented players were available through draft and trade its possible even the new york knicks got better which amounts to nothing short of a miracle " "some exuberant sonics fans arrived at a draft party thursday wearing makeshift kevin durant jerseys " writes jerry brewer in the seattle times "they used their no ray allen replicas to make them they wrote durant on a piece of paper and placed it over allens name and taped over the on allens number durant no those fans looked goofy upon entering fisher pavilion at the seattle center about an hour later however their jerseys became eerily prophetic symbols " mr brewer sizes up the sonics trade as both necessary and cruel "judge the sonics purely from a basketball perspective " he suggests "theyve built losing teams four of the past five years the allenrashard lewis combo scores plenty but you cant put together well rounded and consistently successful teams with them and now you want to add durant another perimeter oriented scorer to this flawed group and simply tweak it it cant work the sonics made the right basketball decision and yet they wronged the public again " in the portland oregonian john canzano marvels "at how little the blazers must have thought of randolph the franchise didnt want randolph around oden they didnt want him in lamarcus aldridges way its obvious they didnt want to go another day or another minute waiting for the telephone to ring with a report of randolph mixed up in some innocent dealing with a prostitute police a strip club a gun or street racing " baggage and all knicks fans greeted mr randolph with cheers but celtics fans werent quite as elated about the arrival of the aging possibly still gimpy mr allen "well at least they appeased paul pierce " writes mark murphy in the boston herald "they went out and got him a peer another aging all star another guy with creaky joints " "three seasons from now if youre watching doc and danny ainge announcing the same tnt game then you flick channels and see a broken down ray allen jogging around a half empty td banknorth center at age youll think of me " writes bill simmons of espn com in his th draft diary before adding "to be clear im a big allen fan hes an excellent player he always wanted to play in boston unlike everyone else in the league i would have loved this trade if he were or and its hard to top the comedy of ray allen and allen ray playing for the same team heres the problem his draft class was the year before i wrote my first draft diary " for the rest of the diary mr simmons tries to adjust "i feel more depressed than an elliott smith album right now im busy trying to find the right adjective for my father on the phone right now beaten down distraught perplexed horrified apoplectic all of them fit hes absolutely appalled by the allen trade " with the draftees wearing good suits well maybe not joakim noah and behaving themselves and nba commissioner david stern not looking death at anybody mr simmons wasnt given a lot of material for his usual lampshade on the head asides but he does have fun with the milwaukee bucks no pick of yi jianlian "im starting to come around on yi the thought of him shovelling out his car in minus degree weather in january while fighting back tears and screaming why why in chinese is delightful for some reason " three florida gators were drafted in the top the atlanta hawks took al horford with the third pick the minnesota timberwolves took corey brewer with the seventh and joakim noah went to the chicago bulls at no in the orlando sentinel dave curtis chronicles a bittersweet countdown to the draft for the three the chicago tribunes rick morrissey blasts the bulls pick "noah doesnt have a jump shot he has a push shot fourth graders heave their shot from their chest not top draft picks now players who are feet usually dont shoot much from outside but they do need to be able to shoot a jump shot from at least feet no way noah gets that shot off in the nba no way " harsh and mr morrissey is prepared to eat his words literally "please clip and save this column if im wrong three years down the line about noah ill douse it with salsa and eat it if im right ill let you know but then you know that about me " yesterday also brought a pair of baseball milestones in minneapolis the toronto blue jays frank thomas hit his th home run off the minnesota twins carlos silva making the big hurt the st member of the home run club he also managed to get ejected from the game for arguing balls and strikes in the ninth in the toronto star richard griffin ponders the erosion of homers as a hall of fame guarantee but rejects the idea that the big hurts feats will be tarnished by the steroids era "the big hurt is among those who are quite obviously clean he was already a huge powerful man when he broke into the majors as a former tight end out of auburn university in his body type has basically not changed and he has quite clearly prided himself on putting up numbers the right way " last night the houston astros craig biggio collected his th hit a seventh inning single off the colorado rockies aaron cook he was thrown out trying to stretch the single into a double "all you need to know about why and how biggio got here is not reflected in the hits but the or so times he did not get a hit and the years of committing himself to only two things consistency and devotion " john p lopez writes in the houston chronicle "nothing ever changed in those ways that define an icon he ran just as hard up the line busted his tail and never made excuses playing with broken fingers illnesses sore muscles painful injuries to his shoulder and knee and occasionally a heavy heart as biggio becomes just the th name entered into one of baseballs most exclusive clubs the public sees a boyish looking hero who dirties up his uniform like he dirties up a ballgame in his lifelong pursuit of trying to make just one more play or get one more hit he does it with grit and sweat and blood biggio has played in houston for years yet few people really know a lot about him you should " found a good column
