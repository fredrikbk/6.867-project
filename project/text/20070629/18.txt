court limits how districts integrate schools washington in one of its most bitterly divided rulings of recent years the supreme court sharply restricted how school districts can racially integrate their student bodies reflecting deep disagreements over the meaning of the landmark brown v board of education decision yesterdays ruling could bring sweeping change to hundreds of public school districts many of which must rethink the use of various race based policies they have voluntarily adopted including the busing of students from minority urban areas to predominantly white suburbs except for districts ordered by courts to remedy the ills of prior official segregation the decision effectively outlaws assigning students to a school because of their race that means more districts are likely to seek diversity based on students socioeconomic status some such as pinellas county fla have already dropped any consideration of race the case is the starkest indication yet how the court is splitting along ideological lines under the stewardship of chief justice john roberts as the new court challenges three decades of liberal legal presumptions it is also one of the angriest divisions in modern times on one of the nations litmus test social issues the two sides reached almost diametrically opposed conclusions in their assessment of brown the ruling that decreed an end to segregation in public education in dissenting the liberal justices employed impassioned tones rarely seen in the courts opinions justice stephen breyer took nearly half an hour to read his dissent from the bench underscoring the liberals anguish by a to vote the court said the constitutions equal protection clause outlaws enrollment plans in louisville ky and seattle that in essence used race as a tiebreaker when students sought to attend oversubscribed schools local school boards sought student bodies on each campus that roughly reflect their districts overall racial makeup to the courts ascendant conservative bloc those programs undercut the message of brown which they heard as requiring the governments strict adherence to colorblindness even racial classifications that officials describe as benign or beneficial should be struck down because they argue the act of classification itself is invidious "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race " chief justice roberts declared the liberal justices accused the majority of betraying the promise of racial equality that began with brown and continued through a series of precedents laid down since "this is a decision that the court and the nation will come to regret " wrote justice breyer joined by justices john paul stevens david souter and ruth bader ginsburg seattle was never under a court desegregation order and while louisville was a federal court in found it had eliminated the vestiges of the former "dual" school system the number of formerly segregated systems that remain under court order to desegregate in cases brought by the justice department has steadily dwindled to about the brown decision was implemented and expanded over two decades then in riots against a court ordered busing plan erupted in boston while the supreme court exempted suburbs from urban desegregation efforts encouraging white flight school integration sagged in the s and s many districts adopted less onerous but arguably less effective methods such as magnet schools and programs that let students choose their schools as in louisville and seattle in recent years many schools have resegregated mirroring housing patterns in recent years even as racial diversity has become a watchword of the public education establishment many schools have resegregated mirroring housing patterns but the courts conservatives werent of one mind in assessing the role of race only three antonin scalia clarence thomas and samuel alito joined in full the chief justices forceful argument decrying efforts to engineer racial harmony through government action the deciding vote was cast by the courts pivotal member justice anthony kennedy and he pointedly distanced himself from his conservative brethren "diversity is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue " he wrote as long as no individual is rewarded or burdened because of his or her race justice kennedy offered some examples of what he had in mind such as "strategically" placing schools in neighborhoods where they might draw from different racial communities although no other justice joined that concurrence it likely will become the lodestar for school boards that continue to seek integrated campuses but likely off the table are such policies as busing students permitting students to transfer from schools where they are in the racial majority to those where they are in the minority but not vice versa and using race to balance citywide magnet programs without such tools racial composition of schools is more likely to reflect segregated neighborhood housing patterns the ruling in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district no marked a signal victory for conservatives who long have chafed under race conscious government policies "together these decisions will put an end to public schools using race as a factor to decide where children can attend public school " said sharon browne of the pacific legal foundation who helped represent plaintiffs in both the seattle and louisville cases by contrast columbia law school professor jack greenberg who argued the brown case before the supreme court said yesterdays decision represents not browns legacy but that of those who opposed school desegregation and the civil rights movement "the massive resistance" to brown during the s and s "has transmuted into a low level refusal to acknowledge the legacy of slavery and legally imposed segregation " he said the implications could be felt immediately riverside calif which adopted one of the first voluntary desegregation programs years ago buses about elementary school students each day from two overwhelmingly minority neighborhoods to elementary schools in more integrated areas half the students at taft elementary located in a relatively affluent neighborhood come from riversides heavily hispanic eastside "both my kids went to taft " says deputy schools superintendent michael fine "they had friends from eastside and their educational and life experience was enhanced by the cultural diversity " the district is reviewing the court decision to assess its impact on riversides program a spokeswoman said also in jeopardy lawyers say are programs that bus minority students from cities to predominantly white suburbs one such program in massachusetts metropolitan council for educational opportunity inc which began in sends more than students of color each day from boston and springfield to more than participating suburbs many school districts including those in lynn mass and knoxville tenn use student transfers from one school to another to facilitate integration former massachusetts assistant attorney general richard cole who represented the lynn district when it was challenged in court said that under justice kennedys opinion school districts may still use race in school assignments if they show it is the last resort to achieve a compelling interest such as averting racial polarization and violence but the court majority already has rejected as inconclusive social science data submitted by both parties overall the data show that black students benefit academically from integrated classrooms while white students are neither helped nor harmed said kevin welner a university of colorado professor and co editor of a national academy of education review of the data the next battle could be fought around whether the supreme court decision trumps desegregation plans under state constitutions under a plan ordered by a state court the los angeles school district assures racial balance in its magnet programs by admitting white and minority students via separate lotteries the plan faces a suit filed by the pacific legal foundation "im assuming that the plf has their highlighter out today just as we do " said kevin reed general counsel for the l a school district the courts split recalled a similar divide in when the justices splintered over an affirmative action plan in university admissions justice lewis powells opinion which found a rigid quota unconstitutional but allowed race as a "plus" factor was treated as controlling by lower courts even though no other justice joined it in full in a opinion by now retired justice sandra day oconnor a to court affirmed the "compelling state interest" in diversity in university enrollment although yesterdays decision didnt overrule the affirmative action cases the plurality took pains to distinguish them from the school districts plans if the aim was "sufficient diversity so that students see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as members of a racial group " chief justice roberts wrote a system that assigned students "solely as members of a racial group is fundamentally at cross purposes with that end " the dissenters saw things in a starkly different light justice breyer who served as a law clerk to justice arthur goldberg in the s when the legal battle over desegregation was near its height devoted much of his page dissent to the history of racial separation that gave rise to the assignment plans he cited from the volumes of cases that sought to implement brown to argue that local communities were free to adopt plans that promoted desegregation beyond the minimum efforts that a court might find are constitutionally required "it was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains rode on separate buses and studied in separate schools " justice breyer wrote "in this courts finest hour brown v board of education challenged this history and helped to change it " knoxvilles experience exemplifies the shifting tide since brown in the supreme court struck down a knoxville plan that fostered segregation by letting students transfer from schools in which they were in the minority to those in which they were in the majority around knoxville voluntarily adopted a plan that promoted integration the policy says a white child cant transfer out of nor can a black child transfer into a school where the african american population exceeds one and a half times the system average district officials say now says a schools spokesman that policy is under review sam anderson an african american and longtime school board member in knoxville says the courts turnabout reflects a change in public opinion "the popular opinion in america nowadays is just teach my kids to read " says mr anderson who as a fourth grader attended an integrated school following the decision "whether im african american white or asian i want a good school in my community " for all it portends for the nations schools yesterdays decision also displayed the ideological rift that is coming to define the court under chief justice roberts under his assertive leadership the conservative bloc is moving to rewrite liberal presumptions that have guided the laws evolution for decades to conservatives that represents a restoration of legal conventions abandoned under chief justice earl warren in the s and s the courts liberals see a new majority that disdains what they consider some of american laws most noble achievements "the chief justice rewrites the history of one of this courts most important decisions " justice stevens wrote in a separate concurrence disputing the pluralitys characterization of brown but then he wrote as chief justice roberts himself noted in another case earlier this year "history is written by the victors "
