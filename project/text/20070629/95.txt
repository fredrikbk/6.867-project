business day sign up for the e mail here the supreme courts ruling that race cant explicitly be taken into account when pursuing integration in public schools could have broad implications for schools across the country and the decision also showed strong divisions among the justices the court in a decision invalidated programs in seattle and louisville ky that aimed to maintain school diversity by limiting student transfers on the basis of race or using race as a "tiebreaker" for admission to a school the new york times writes the ruling means that many public school districts must rethink programs such as busing students from minority urban areas to predominantly white school districts in the suburbs the wall street journal says on the final day of the courts term three justices took minutes reading opinions on how this ruling either affirmed or betrayed the desegregation decision in brown v board of education the washington post writes "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race " chief justice john roberts said in an opinion supported by justices samuel alito antonin scalia and clarence thomas legal times notes the courts four opposing judges delivered a dissent that was twice as long as justice robertss opinion the post says justice stephen breyer wrote the principal dissenting opinion speaking from the bench for more than minutes he said "it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much " the times says noting that in his written opinion he called the decision a radical step away from settled law and warned "this is a decision that the court and the nation will come to regret " while justice anthony kennedy cast the deciding vote in agreeing with the courts conservatives he declined to sign on to about half of justice robertss opinion the post notes placing himself somewhere between the conservatives point of view that race may not be used to classify students and the dissenting view that it is necessary to achieve integration in a separate opinion that the times says "could shape the practical implications of the decision and provide school districts with guidelines for how to create systems that can pass muster with the court " justice kennedy said it was a mistake to read the constitution as requiring "that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools " on a practical level justice kennedys opinion which saw as acceptable the drawing of school attendance zones "strategic site selection of new schools" and directing resources to special projects places limits on the other four justices embrace of a "colorblind constitution " the paper notes one option for school districts affected by the courts ruling is to pursue income based diversity plans where schools seek to limit the percentage of low income students in any one school by dispersing them to schools with higher income students the journal writes noting that about school districts nationwide with an estimated million students already use socioeconomic status to determine which school a student should attend immigration bill dies on senate floor immigration reform suffered a big setback as the bill the bush administration worked hard to pass died on the senate floor despite a last minute lobbying effort by president bush the senate voted to defeat a motion to end debate and move the bill toward final passage with just republicans siding with the president the new york times notes adding that there is little chance of its revival before the end of mr bushs term "a lot of us worked hard to see if we couldnt find a common ground it didnt work " mr bush said after a cornerstone of his domestic agenda collapsed the paper writes some republicans pinned the blame for the bills defeat on past administration troubles the los angeles times says noting that freshman sen bob corker a tennessee republican warned that americans were losing faith in the government while pointing out issues such as intelligence failures in the run up to the iraq invasion the response to hurricane katrina and the recent problems with federal agencies issuing u s passports the white house meanwhile saw the bills failure as a problem with capitol hill noting that public approval ratings for congress are lower than the presidents the washington post writes still mr bush found some support from an unlikely source senate majority leader harry reid a democrat from nevada said that the "president worked hard and so did many senators" but that the big winner was "obstruction " the post notes also of note reuters british police defused a bomb in an abandoned car in londons theatre district and launched a counterterrorism
