united struggles to navigate new course ceo forecasts profit but ratings morale remain problem areas chicago seventeen months after completing a lengthy trip through bankruptcy court united airlines parent ual corp still is struggling to navigate its new flight plan the no u s carrier by traffic is laboring with a dispirited work force poor consumer ratings and mediocre punctuality united posted disappointing losses in the past two quarters when other airlines were showing financial resurgence last week an employee error shut down its flight operations computer system for two hours resulting in flight delays and cancellations glenn tilton chairman and chief executive and his management team say they are confident the airline is on the right trajectory although more work lies ahead theyre predicting strong second quarter profits and insist their strategy of pursuing high yield passengers with segmented product offerings and more international destinations is sound cost cutting also is bearing fruit they say and uniteds revenue performance is better than expectations in its post bankruptcy business plan even though fuel prices are higher than anticipated the company is generating so much cash that management is considering a share buyback or dividend later this year they say the problems reflect the lingering effects of bankruptcy insufficient capital investment low worker morale wall street puzzlement about post chapter accounting peculiarities and the negative impression created in passengers minds others arent so sure "their nonlabor costs are higher than some of their peers " said philip baggaley an airline debt analyst for standard &amp poors corp "theyve pursued a different strategy a more complex product offering which can create added costs " airlines in general face problems ranging from fuel prices and competition to congestion and weather recent service meltdowns have increased pressure on lawmakers to legislate changes "its going to continue to be a challenged business " mr tilton said in an interview "our focus has been on financial and economic recovery what were doing now is making good on the strategy we articulated in the restructuring " foremost in mr tiltons mind is the possibility of industry consolidation which he advocates as a way of removing &# billion in redundant costs he estimates the fragmented u s industry carries he also thinks consolidation in europe could put u s carriers at a disadvantage but nothing has occurred because he believes a tie up has to be consensual and no domestic carriers are yet willing to marry next on uniteds to do list is improving service for the months ended in april the chicago based carrier ranked only among u s airlines in on time arrivals with of its flights landing on time according to department of transportation statistics in april uniteds numbers of mishandled bags and customer complaints were up from a year earlier several recent consumer polls about airline service assigned

belatedly refurbishing its first and business class cabins on international flights with the first planes to debut this fall its also launching new training for customer service agents investing in new check in kiosks and trying to develop better passenger notification procedures and follow up protocols for cancellations it started working on a five year plan to accelerate customer service improvements mr tilton said he receives dozens of passenger and employee emails daily with complaints and suggestions in shanghai recently he saw a message pop up on his blackberry from a passenger on a plane halfway around the world he replies to all copying in company officers "its not efficient " he said "but its not bad branding " employee morale also needs a boost workers swallowed steep pay and benefit concessions during the bankruptcy and their pension plans were terminated resulting in lower amounts for some workers and retirees there are fewer workers and they are working harder than ever which has brought complaints about short staffing and fatigue unions inflamed about large equity grants to top management on bankruptcy exit are pressing for the company to open negotiations early for less onerous contacts capt mark bathurst chairman of the pilots union and a ual director took the management team to task a month ago for not transforming the airline into a top performer "united currently lags behind its peers by most measures " the pilot wrote in a blistering letter alone among the traditional carriers he added united seemingly is "without a vision for the future " the ceo acknowledged that across the industry "labor is almost universally disappointed by the way things turned out thats very demoralizing the best tonic we have for morale is a healthy company " to help revitalize its work force united is putting all employees through training to better understand the economics of their business while investing in tools from printers to new computers to airport

rise to &# million this year and &# million in "things need to work " mr tilton said "the information technology needs to be of this world we need to invest in employees workplace " the possibility of a share buyback has raised concerns among uniteds unions and at some credit rating agencies mr brace said united which has about &# billion in long term debt has a responsibility to both its bondholders and its shareholders it used cash flow to pay down &# billion of debt early this year and expects to have replenished that amount by now he said cost cutting continues when united discovered it didnt pare enough in chapter it announced plans to wring another &# million in annual savings including eliminating salaried jobs "were trying to be more productive " said pete mcdonald chief operating officer "but theres still a whole heck of lot of things we can do better " frequent flier bill ellenberger president of a nonprofit organization in tyrone pa agrees he points to recent problems he has had with lost luggage and unhelpful telephone agents overseas on the day of the computer outage last week his wifes flight from san diego to state college pa via washington d c was cancelled and then reinstated but the airline had her booked to get into washington three hours after the flight to state college was slated to leave "we spent four hours on the phone trying to get
