readback defying ordinary rules in a bend in the river naipaul has much to teach westerners about africa online edition a few months ago i read dave eggerss novel "what is the what " based on the real story of a sudanese "lost boy" whose home and childhood were destroyed by the civil war in darfur i worried that the book would be so depressing i wouldnt want to get out of bed in the morning it wasnt the boy now a man was a true hero maybe thats why i picked up v s naipauls novel "a bend in the river " last week the news from darfur continues to be so horrific so unfathomable the rage the nihilistic violence the so called crimes against humanity what makes people do such things "a bend in the river " like "what is the what " gave me some clues mr naipauls book is set in a fictional country based on what is now the democratic republic of the congo formerly zaire after it won its independence from belgium in the river town where salim a young african of indian descent bought a small store had been carved out of the bush then nearly returned to it during the instability of the first years of self rule slowly the town came back to life and salim saw hope and pride in the eyes of young africans but an undercurrent of paranoia in the "overgrown overpopulated unregulated town" never entirely dissipated especially among outsiders like salim "there was a kind of peace now but all of us who were not of the country remained prey to be stalked in different ways it was in the history of the land here men had always been prey you dont feel malice toward your prey you set a trap for him " salim like most of the other residents of the river town had modest aspirations to make a decent living to visit friends fall in love listen to music to be allowed to live in this strange country with its feet in two different centuries but the new president of the country based on congos real life ruler mobutu sese seko had other plans for people like salim outsiders even if they werent european would not be welcome in the new african controlled africa there was no longer enough room for everyone even uganda where one of his friends had fled "was now too small for its tribal hatreds " salim thought "the motorcar and modern roads had made the country too small every tribe felt more threatened in its territory now than in the days when everybody went about on foot " although he narrates the book salim was not the most interesting character but he was a keen and judicious observer he was particularly intrigued by raymond who had once been in the presidents inner circle he was known as "the big mans white man" but had mysteriously fallen into disfavor yet even as the big man became more demagogic and intolerant raymond remained loyal to the presidents vision of africas future for the country to shake loose from its colonial past men like raymond would have to accept their own defeat this is the first of mr naipauls books that i have read several years ago i reviewed "sir vidias shadow " paul therouxs account of his long literary friendship and eventual falling out with mr naipaul whom he first met in uganda although there was something unpalatable about mr theroux exposing his former mentors peccadilloes some of the charges against him misogyny snobbery hypocrisy stuck although an artists character should be irrelevant to the value of his or her work for me it isnt and mr naipauls obtuseness about women is all too clear in his female characters in "a bend in the river " meanwhile his male characters spend too much time pondering their own manhood a scene of physical violence between salim and his lover reads like the pornographic fantasy of a sadist as unconvincing as it is repugnant yet mr naipaul who won the nobel prize for literature in has much to teach westerners about africa its beauty its fury and its defiance of ordinary rules "i dont think you understand salim and it isnt an easy thing to understand " a friend said "it isnt that theres no right and wrong here theres no right " write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
