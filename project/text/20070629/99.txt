table talk a shift in dining scene nicks a once hot chain applebees retained bar and grill formula as tastes moved on on a visit to marietta ga last fall tj palmer stopped into an applebees and ordered a bruschetta burger "i didnt like it at all " she says after having visited the restaurant chain regularly for years ms palmer says she rarely goes anymore "it doesnt have anything that would make me want to come back " her assessment counts twenty seven years ago ms palmer co founded applebees it became one of the countrys hottest restaurant companies with its heaping portions of &# oriental chicken salad and &# riblet platters applebees in the s grew into the nations largest sit down restaurant chain in part by blanketing suburbs and smaller cities that competitors overlooked it was so popular that franchisees of other restaurants occasionally tore them down to build an applebees yet today applebees finds itself a company with falling profits a lagging stock and restless investors agitating for change richard breeden head of an investment group that owns of the company has attacked applebees for giving bonuses to executives while the stock languished and complained that directors didnt have a strategy to get things moving again in february trying to please its anxious investors applebees announced it would consider selling itself what changed like other modestly priced restaurants applebees is up against high gasoline prices that pinch the finances of some of its customers but the chains bigger problem is that it didnt change quickly enough while a raft of competitors copied it in a business where fashions shift fashions in food in decor and in general restaurant ambience applebees stayed too long with a formula that had worked for it in the past attracting diners these days are newer eateries with sleek interiors a contrast with applebees busy walls full of photos and sports paraphernalia menus at many newer generation restaurants stress the freshness or naturalness of their food a contrast with the fried and breaded fare at traditional bar and grill chains like applebees its menus for many years lacked distinctive "destination items " the companys chief executive recently acknowledged some other casual dining chains have been changing strategy to cope with the industrys challenges brinker international inc has sold a chunk of chilis outlets to franchisees and plans to build fewer company owned outlets bar and grill chain ruby tuesday inc is going upscale with fully upholstered chairs and premium wines and beers in fast food mcdonalds corp has added fancier salad offerings none of which changes this problematic fact as of there was one restaurant for every people in the u s according to the national restaurant association way up from about three decades ago when there was one for every people the glut of bar and grills in particular has many industry analysts predicting a shakeout when harry rose opened an applebees franchise in lawrenceville n j in only a handful of eateries competed with him nearby today he counts almost mid priced sit down restaurants within two miles including chilis t g i fridays hooters chevys olive garden and local eateries "they wont all survive " he says the first applebees opened in in atlanta on a strip of bars adjacent to downtown ms palmer a former delta air lines flight attendant and her then husband bill who had been a burger king district manager wanted to create a bar with a lively atmosphere for the happy hour crowd they copied elements of t g i fridays and filled it with wooden indian statues and antique barber poles they kept bowls of pretzels off the bar to spur drinkers who got the munchies to order nacho chips and potato skins the name was quirky t j applebees rx for edibles &amp elixirs the place did so well the palmers opened a second one three years later they sold them to w r grace &amp co in the brand passed to two kansas city franchisees abe gustin and john hamra who soon took the chain public as applebees international inc its headquartered in overland park kan bar and grill chains were trendy with their noisy interiors and menus showcasing hamburger platters and oversize salads most were clustered in or around large cities applebees copied the model to some degree but often built smaller restaurants and priced its entrees below competitors small communities sometimes felt validated when applebees arrived says a former vice president of the company james kirkpatrick "people in small towns loved that we have an applebees like a big city " by the early s applebees was adding more than locations a year in new jersey mr rose razed a roy rogers he owned and put up an applebees he says it siphoned off enough diners from an adjacent shopping center that the mall wouldnt let him connect his parking lot to its "the food was very contemporary at the time " mr rose says and with the success applebees enjoyed there was little reason to change it mr rose says menu innovation often consisted of little more than adding a different slice of cheese or a flavored mayonnaise to applebees popular hamburgers the chain grew to a current total of restaurants world wide of which about three quarters are franchised but competitors were turning their sights on the same small cities and distant suburbs applebees favored chilis for instance developed a scaled down model for smaller communities regional chains added to the competition copying the menu and decor of applebees and sometimes opening right next door meanwhile the way americans used restaurants was evolving televised cooking shows and international travel introduced more people to exotic flavors found in ethnic cuisine concern about over processed foods led some diners to seek out fare billed as natural or organic a very different atmosphere of eclectic music couches wireless internet service and minimalist decor proved popular at some places such as panera bread co and the starbucks cafe chain consumers also increasingly began using casual restaurants for take out meals instead of going there to eat supermarkets became more of a competitor too upgrading their prepared meal offerings whole foods market inc devoted entire sections to serving hot bowls of udon noodles and organic fruit salads mcdonalds for one reacted to the changes with a strategy shift the chain stopped building as many outlets it added higher priced salads with edamame and snow peas while retaining a handful of favorites priced at &# for price conscious customers it also invited its clientele to tour its food suppliers to convince them it used quality ingredients at some outlets out went the molded plastic booths and in came soft chairs and muted colors the strategy has ushered in one of the golden arches most successful streaks but at applebees sales growth was softening sales at u s outlets open at least months a key industry measure after inching up only in declined slightly in then early this year the fall accelerated sharply net income for plummeted in december with applebees stock almost flat over months mr breeden asked applebees to stop spending millions of dollars building company owned restaurants the investor once head of the securities and exchange commission also took the applebees board to task for letting a company plane ferry the chairman to his beach house he complained that over months applebees aircraft had flown into and out of galveston texas where chairman lloyd hill owns a bayside home times "we do not believe that shareholder interests are served by turning corporate aircraft into flying limousines " mr breeden wrote in a letter to the head of the boards compensation committee in january a spokeswoman for applebees says the company paid &# for mr hills aircraft use in and that was part of his compensation package the company no longer lets executives use corporate aircraft for personal travel except in emergencies applebees chief executive david goebel complained that mr breeden was distracting the chain while it was trying to right itself but in february the board announced it would consider a sale or recapitalization of the company that didnt satisfy mr breeden who said at the time that the chain shouldnt sell when its "at the bottom " for this article he declined to be interviewed in april applebees added mr breeden and an associate to its board applebees also has decided to begin opening far fewer company owned restaurants than in recent years and said it would shut that are floundering as far back as october applebees executives acknowledged their industry was shifting "the landscape has changed " john cywinski then chief marketing officer told investors "our paradigm must change " applebees has blamed growing competition and belt tightening among less affluent consumers for its sales weakness in a survey patrons when asked why they went to competitors told the company "the foods just ok" at applebees mr goebel said last year the ceo added that the chain lacked "destination items" singular dishes people seek out he is trying harder to cater to higher income customers those whose finances dont force them to eat out less that strategy is tricky because more than a third of applebees customers have household incomes of under &# a year some even keep their money in an envelope mr goebel says and decide whether to go out to eat by reaching in at the end of the week to see if theres enough money there last year applebees began subtlely upgrading some of its best selling items it started topping hamburgers with whole pieces of lettuce instead of chopped lettuce at the bar it designated jose cuervo as the tequila for margaritas it began offering a merlot that got a point rating from wine spectator magazine the chain hired television chef tyler florence to create food with bolder more diverse flavors it printed a new menu that used a giant photo of mr florence selecting a tomato the menu offered things like the bruschetta burger with garlic parmesan french fries a penne rosa pasta with sweet italian sausage and a crispy brick chicken dish seared with a light marinade of rosemary and olive oil priced between &# and &# the new items didnt go beyond applebees typical prices but they arrived just as consumers were recovering from a stressful summer of high gasoline prices and also as some competitors were pushing cheaper offerings the latest menu out in may features a giant fold out photo of mr florences &# new york strip steak with hearts of romaine salad and onion rings yet on the back page the pitch is to the other end of the price spectrum with &# soup salad and sandwich combinations mr goebel calls this a "high low" strategy so far the changes havent stopped the slide in the four weeks ended may sales at u s restaurants open at least months were down from a year earlier though that was better than the first quarters steep falloff of four new items added by mr florence in the fall only one the bruschetta burger is still on the menu the company says its new offerings are improving perceptions of applebees particularly among lapsed visitors "we are seeing some traction among that more affluent guest " says kurt hankins head of menu development to ms palmer the new more upscale fare doesnt quite fit "that kind of stuff is out of their element " says the chains co founder who is no longer involved with applebees but is entitled to a lifetime of free meals there ms palmer adds that the high school sports paraphernalia applebees still has on its walls doesnt appeal to her now mr goebel says the company is tackling the decor issue its developing new interior designs he says mr rose in new jersey did his own remodeling taking out some dated looking dark wood paneling with stained glass above his bars meantime mr rose is shopping for the next hot restaurant concept the applebees franchisee plans to open a number of branches of corner bakery cafe a breezy lunch spot that serves grilled paninis with artichokes and apricot walnut rugalach desserts
