the jesus phone the apple iphone is set to be released today at p m and i feel like i already have one apples new "jesus phone" it combines internet access an ipod music player and oh yes a phone has been accompanied by a loud relentless and unavoidable drumbeat of hype according to one study of british and of u s mobile phone users are aware of the iphone and million americans have expressed interest in buying one that is remarkable stuff when you consider the iphones &# price not to mention that even the most successful so called smartphones are lucky to sell a million units yikes so how has apple done it some people argue it has cleverly drip dripped product information to the market tantalizing consumers and journalists alike everyone hanging on to learn about the next nifty feature a big bright touch screen a real web browser a finger flickable interface i gotta get one but this theory is wrong apple hasnt steadily dripped product information as a matter of fact the iphone that steve jobs described and demonstrated back in january when he first announced the product is pretty much the same as what is being launched today i am hard pressed to think of a single material feature in the product that wasnt announced six months ago right down to the nifty new way you can scroll through songs so if apple hasnt teased and tantalized its way to iphone ubiquity another theory goes surely it has been the companys massive multibillion dollar marketing campaign that has done the deed the trouble is there is no such multibillion dollar apple campaign apple simply announced the product and then did nothing it has only been in the last month that there have been some television advertisements and those were merely product demonstrations set to music granted it was nice music but it was also just an iphone being put through its paces hardly the recipe for hype some will say im missing the most important factor in apples marketing campaign master showman and apple founder and ceo steve jobs he has been the one driving the promotion using his personal persuasiveness and charm fine show me his recent iphone pumping appearances on cnbc none or on cnn none he has been conspicuous in his almost complete media absence it must be a fairly postmodern style of promotion that has mr jobs playing master showman largely by being invisible so if there hasnt really been much of an iphone marketing campaign at least in orthodox terms and apple demonstrably isnt suffering for iphone attention is it the apple addicts out there that are responsible for the hype apple does have some of the most ardent fans of any modern company more similar to cult members than customers but there simply arent enough of them to explain the iphones cultural ubiquity if its not the marketing campaign nor the cult of apple nor the showmanship of the charismatic steve jobs then how has the iphone succeeded in getting millions of people interested in buying something so expensive that hasnt even been launched ill tell you first people hate their cell phones other than making phone calls a downright dreary bit of business using phones for internet entertainment and pretty much anything else has been abysmal cell phones are best characterized as crippled paternalistic devices best suited for people who think straitjackets are comfortable evening wear they have horrible web browsers crummy screens and obscure to the point of opacity interfaces after all some of the iphones most hyped features like maps are on traditional cell phones as well you just cant find the feature but in addition to hating their phones people hate their cell phone carriers hate hate hate hate the major cellular providers with their ham handed "support" and fascist control of software that can run on phones directly are right up there with the irs in terms of inspiring your average mobile phone users disgust and loathing to such consumers apples iphone seems like a cool drink of water these people want to be liberated either from bad phones or from bad phone companies they want to choose a device that does all the things they want to do calling being entertained consuming information not all the things their phone company thinks they should do and then be charged &# a month per feature for the privilege they want phones that make it possible to do calls over wi fi to the point that cellular companies could potentially become irrelevant the massive upwelling of grassroots support for the iphone shows that a revolution has been building for some time now its here cell phone carriers are going to have to respond by cutting the length of contracts and eliminating exclusivity and most important by finally being responsive to their market if not iphones or their successors will finish them off mr kedrosky is a venture capitalist and cnbc analyst
