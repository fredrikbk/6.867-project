putins soul when president george w bush meets vladimir putin this weekend at his fathers home in kennebunkport he will be trying to improve relations with a russia that is becoming increasingly dangerous to the security interests of the west mr bush is apparently counting on his "friendship" with mr putin but the relationship works in only one direction to confuse and limit the policy options of the united states mr putin will become increasingly hostile not because he has tragically misinterpreted our intentions but because he is the architect of a corrupt bureaucratic system in russia that needs an anti western policy in order to survive russia wants to stop the u s from installing an anti ballistic missile system in eastern europe on the grounds that it undermines the russian deterrent mr putin offered instead to share the russian early warning radar station in azerbaijan to help the u s protect itself against iran but the offer made no sense the radar is too close to iran to be secure and cannot guide interceptors based in poland at the same time russia continues to lend support to iran at a june press conference in tehran russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that iran was not a threat and that russia would continue cooperation with the regime including construction of the bushehr nuclear plant scheduled to come on line in october western officials have often been mystified by russian actions that by undermining western security in the face of islamic fanaticism undermine russias security as well but the putin regime is concerned first of all with its own security russian interests are often not taken into account at first glance the position of the putin regime appears impregnable russia was the single largest beneficiary of the world commodities boom of the s gdp has grown by to a year from &# billion in to &# billion in in current dollars reserves now top &# billion average salaries under mr putin have doubled and his approval rating is above despite this the putin regime is actually quite fragile it sits at the apex of an unjust social system and tolerates just enough liberty to make it extremely vulnerable to a serious investigation of its apparent crimes mr putin has systematically eliminated other centers of power as a result the bureaucracy rules alone without interference from society but also without its support under mr putin the handful of people who run russia also own it government officials are on the board of russias largest state run companies first deputy premier dmitri medvedev is chairman of the board of gazprom igor sechin deputy head of the kremlin administration is chairman of the rosneft oil company and igor shuvalov an assistant to the president is chairman of russian railroads the capitalization of gazprom is &# billion rosneft &# billion and russian railroads &# billion it is estimated that the people around mr putin control companies that account for of the capitalization of the russian stock market the country is the scene of gross income inequality in the average income of the top of the population in moscow was times greater than that of the bottom despite the oil boom of the russian population is poor historically income inequality has been dangerous for russia and seldom has wealth been flouted in russia the way it is now the income gap also has grim consequences because of the governments failure to invest in social services those with money obtain high quality medical care those without it give up on their lives and wait to die aware that decent medical care is out of reach one result is that there are deaths in russia for every births male life expectancy in russia is now lower than that of bangladesh russias murder rate is nearly five times that of the u s because the oil boom has guaranteed a gradual improvement in conditions and russians were traumatized by the chaos of the boris yeltsin years they have been accepting of conditions under mr putin but a collapse of the oil price would plunge russia into recession and change the social and political situation overnight at the same time the russian leaders know that if the social situation in the country becomes unsettled there are several terrorist acts and political assassinations that could be re examined with far reaching consequences russia has been the scene of many crimes and unexplained deaths in the last eight years but the best known were the apartment bombings the hostage takings in moscow and beslan the apparent poisoning of the investigative journalist yuri shchekochikhin the murder of duma deputy sergei yushenkov and the recent murders of anna politkovskaya and alexander litvinenko the government has done virtually nothing to investigate these events the refusal to extradite a suspect in the murder of litvinenko was typical but private citizens and journalists have continued to turn up information it has been reported for example that law enforcement was informed in advance about plans to take hostages in moscow and beslan but did nothing to disrupt them there is also a videotape which was not widely broadcast of two of the persons who shadowed politkovskaya before her murder opposition political figures have taken an interest in these cases mikhail kasyanov the former prime minister who may run for president has called for a new investigation of the apartment bombings and the hostage takings in moscow and beslan even supporters of the regime may use these crimes to eliminate their opponents when vladimir ustinov was removed last year as prosecutor general his opponents proposed reopening the investigation into the apparent poisoning of shchekochikhin who had investigated corruption in the fsb this was a way of attacking their enemies in the fsb under these circumstances the anti western policies of the putin regime far from being a mystery actually make perfect sense by insisting on the right to give orders to countries it once dominated such as georgia and ukraine russia guarantees a series of needless conflicts that can be used to distract the russian population from massive corruption while playing to primitive nationalistic instincts a sign of the success of this policy is the mounting xenophobia in russia and the tolerated attacks on dark skinned foreigners in the streets anti western policies are also useful because they guarantee that russia will absorb the wests attention this can be depicted with the help of state controlled television as a return to russian greatness finally anti western policies set the stage for unrestrained demagoguery that can be used to undermine the ability of russians to draw even the most basic moral distinctions the most recent example was mr putins remarks to a delegation of teachers that no one should try to make russia feel guilty about the great terror of because in other countries even worse things happened there will undoubtedly be an attempt in kennebunkport to put a good face on u s russian relations but this should not come through a self censorship on the u s side that changes nothing in russias behavior and denies us the possibility of influencing it in fact the best president bush can do is speak frankly to mr putin about the obstructive and self defeating character of his policies by telling mr putin the things he needs to hear mr bush may provoke a boorish response but he will be behaving like a true friend mr satter is affiliated with the hoover institution the hudson institute and johns hopkins his most recent book is "darkness at dawn the rise of the russian criminal state" yale
