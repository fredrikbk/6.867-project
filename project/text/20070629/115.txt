weekend journal taste nancy drew and the fountain of youth maybe its the mother in me but when in the new nancy drew movie the cloying teen detective climbs into her trademark blue convertible i am not thinking "i want my year old to be like her " i am thinking somebody please take this kids keys she is clearly too young to be driving in river heights where the original nancy drew books were set without a parent by her side let alone tooling around the streets of los angeles as she does in the movie with two other kids in the car "we will go the posted speed limit and no faster " she says primly as the audience recovers from the moral clubbing that this movie delivers relentlessly we wish director andrew fleming had done what the movies subtitle suggests get a clue in the classic series of books that peaked during the eisenhower administration miss drew was a young woman either or years old depending on the driving laws of the time she had already stepped out of the pimply pool of seething neuroses that we call high school and dwelled unencumbered by a day job in an orderly world where your housekeeper prepared the meals and tweedy new clothes were charged to your fathers account at the local department store the old nancy was so mature that the actress who portrayed her on television in the s posed for playboy if the new nancy drew did that child pornography laws would have been broken the mysteries that made up the original nancy drew series published by grosset &amp dunlap were sparsely illustrated but the covers and crude sketches within showed a smartly dressed young woman with classic clothes and a demure almost matronly hair style the reader is told that she is a teenager but given her demeanor and skill set nancy can handle a gun change a tire fly a plane sew a dress and perform water ballet she transcended the indignities of adolescence and always seemed old enough to drink not that our heroine ever would the nancy in the warner bros movie disappointingly is just a girl she attends high school and hangs with a puerile wisecracking year old she bribes thieves and clerks with homemade baked goods and carries a "sleuthing kit " no doubt coming soon to a wal mart near you approaching cheesiness she is a caricature of the adolescent overachiever a girl who outruns her peers on the high school track with a peter pan collar and exaggerated steps who builds the cathedral of notre dame in shop class saying "i only had time for flying buttresses in actuality there are " baby boomer mothers who take their daughters to the film expecting the classy heroine of their youth will find instead a minute mockumentary of what martha stewart must have been like as a tweener this character is nancy drew in name and convertible only they began filming when actress emma roberts was still and she was grounded by her mother for impudence the week before her publicity tour began what accounts for nancys newfound youth perhaps hollywood wanted to make her believable to a modern audience when edward stratemeyer invented the character in the s nancy drew followed the formula of the other books in his fiction factory no touching kissing or violence according to marvin heiferman co author of "the mysterious case of nancy drew &amp the hardy boys " which chronicles the series success but when was the last time you saw a chaste year old in any hollywood production quick nancy look in the books ned nickerson nancys "special friend " is a hunky college football player theirs is a chaste relationship they dance sometimes and take strolls in the moonlight but rarely do they even kiss in the movie there is no mention of college and boyish ned is little more than a sycophantic satellite for nancy they share one kiss and its fleeting and sweet in one of mr flemings few nods to the original but for a movie heroine to be sexually innocent these days she cant have graduated from ninth grade yet and even if she fits the age criteria this kind of purity must by definition make her unpopular the nancy drew movie removes the heroine from the midwestern everytown of river heights where the beautiful and cool miss drew sort of a small town princess grace was admired by everyone except for the smattering of villains that she foils she was an aspirational figure for generations of american girls a girl who was like nancy was the leader of the tribe today she would be an outcast at hollywood high with all her virtues miss drew is a dweeb this is a fundamental change in the character even more so than her shifted age though she triumphs over the multiply pierced mean girls by the end of the film hey i can perform an emergency tracheotomy with a pen can you the young impressionable sorts to whom the film is marketed get this message if you are a child of virtue you will never fit in of course there are other less esoteric reasons that the latest nancy drew had to be so young the year old set is more likely to buy nancy drew merchandise like the nancy drew makeup bag ipod cover t shirt clue ball detective notebook lipstick pen etc but there may be an upside here those who are inspired as a result of the movie to pick up one of the original nancy drew novels may be in for a big and pleasant surprise ms graham is a writer in the suburbs of boston
