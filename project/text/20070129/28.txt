gazprom goes on the offensive official defends supply moves as russian titan tries to polish image davos switzerland two things anger alexander medvedev the man in charge of russian energy giant oao gazproms exports one is being told the company isnt doing enough to develop its natural gas reserves the other that he has been shutting off supplies to russias neighbors and europe at the kremlins bidding this year gazprom will spend &# billion on development double last years tally mr medvedev said during an interview at the world economic forum more development spending will come as the company secures new long term contracts with countries such as china requiring new pipelines and extra production "before producing gas we should sell the gas " said gazproms deputy chief executive responding to criticism from private investors and the paris based international energy agency that the company isnt investing enough to meet spiraling global demand "we know how much to invest to meet the demand " as for the cutoffs of gas to ukraine and moldova last year and of oil to belarus earlier this month mr medvedev said "wait a minute there was no cutoff " speaking at the sunstar hotel the traditional haunt of russias business tycoons in davos since the s he said these countries refused to agree to pay market prices after years of getting inexpensive gas from russia when their annual contracts expired so did the gas "show me a company in the west that will deliver gas without a contract " mr medvedev said "we have nothing to hide " still russias global reputation has taken a hit during the past year even as its economy has boomed in addition to the energy supply disruptions western energy companies were squeezed out of russian investments for alleged breach of environmental regulations and other reasons meantime a prominent journalist was murdered and a former russian spy was assassinated in central london using polonium a radioactive material mr medvedev was part of a big delegation of cash rich russian businesses and politicians in davos anxious to stop the reputational rot increasingly the public face of gazprom mr medvedev said the company is planning to hire outside public relations firms to help repair its image public relations firms hill &amp knowlton and pbn co will split the business according to a person familiar with the deal mr medvedev has led gazproms negotiations for new long term supply contracts and downstream acquisitions in europe he has sometimes clashed with european union officials over energy security at a dinner on the theme "russias more muscular diplomacy " mr medvedev and other major russian businessmen got up to say the west has misread the behavior of russias energy companies over the past year which he said was driven by commercial and not political factors not everyone was persuaded "its not how people speak its how they act " said sen john mccain r ariz speaking to reporters in davos "weve seen what happened with belarus weve seen what happened with major oil companies forced to sell i dont think there is any doubt that president vladimir putin is using energy as a weapon " according to mr medvedev such criticisms reflect western fears of a major new competitor gazprom is the worlds second largest energy company by reserves after exxon mobil corp he dismissed eu fears that russia is trying to build a gas cartel with algeria another important supplier of natural gas to the eu gazprom signed a recent deal with algerias state controlled gas company to develop fields on each others territory mr medvedev also defended a recent decision to force royal dutch shell plc to sell control of the sakhalin energy project to gazprom because of alleged environmental failures mr medvedev who grew up in sakhalin said the environmental issues were real tnk bp holding a joint venture that bp plc paid more than &# billion to buy into in looks set to face a similar fate at the kovykta gas field later this year the siberian field isnt producing as much gas as required in its license mainly because intended pipelines to china havent materialized "they know what they need to do to keep the license " said mr medvedev viktor vekselberg a major partner in tnk bp said he expects the joint venture will reach a deal with gazprom whereby the license is renewed but tnk bps stake in the field is reduced gazprom is scheduled to start delivering gas to china in but hasnt started building the main pipeline required because it is taking a long time to agree to terms of a contract "lenin said you should sell high and buy cheap and the chinese still remember this " joked mr medvedev he added that gazprom isnt in a hurry though a deal has to be struck this year if gazprom is to meet the schedule gazprom does have a challenge to become more efficient mr medvedev said the companys market capitalization per barrel of oil equivalent is one eighth that of exxon mobil but the company looks set for some strong revenue boosts in the coming years
