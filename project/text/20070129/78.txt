technology a special report less is more how companies are getting their computers to work harder jason glauch was running out of room at the end of the senior systems analyst for viejas casino in alpine calif had filled three rooms with servers that monitored slot machines ran sales systems in the restaurants and handled other critical tasks and his staff was asking for more units without space to add new machines mr glauch decided to get more out of the ones he already had using software from vmware inc he started "virtualizing" his servers making one machine do the work of many by april mr glauch had virtualized seven of his dell inc servers allowing them to carry the workload of machines the move saved the casino from spending nearly &# on new servers not to mention finding extra room to house them all "we are doing a whole lot more with less these days " mr glauch says executives across the country are learning to do the same with it costs rising and space in computer rooms dwindling companies are testing out a host of methods to keep server sprawl under control and make the machines they already have work harder some like mr glauch are turning to virtualization software others are using slimmer servers to pack more computing power into the same amount of space in particular analysts say virtualization will play an increasingly important role in the enterprise market in close to of the new servers shipped will be virtualized versus just of the new servers shipped in according to idc "we think virtualization is probably the most disruptive technology for the server world " says michelle bailey research vice president for enterprise platforms at idc a market research firm the appeal is simple in the past companies usually ran only one software application per server for fear of crashing the machine meaning as little as of a servers computing power would be used on average using virtualization tech managers can essentially divide one machine into several and thus host on average eight different applications on each server these results depend on the size of the server and the application that means between and of a machines computing power gets used on average says bogomil balkansky director of product marketing for vmware a unit of emc corp of hopkinton mass some businesses are combining virtualization with additional solutions such as blade servers blade servers are more expensive than regular servers but they save a tremendous amount of space most standard servers are arranged horizontally in racks like a stack of pizza boxes blade servers come in similar racks but are smaller and are stacked vertically like books on a shelf taking up less space and making it easy to slide replacement units in and out the servers plug into a structure called a backplane that allows them to share power supplies and networking connections though blade servers accounted for only about of the roughly seven million servers shipped in idc estimates that percentage is projected to swell to by the end of the decade thats a fivefold jump in unit sales compared with a projected increase over the same period for conventional servers bryan peterson the principal systems engineer for the university of utahs health care arm in salt lake city turned to blades about two and a half years ago he was working on a system for electronically filing medical forms at the facility which meant the data center would have to be online and functioning at all times to ensure that doctors got up to date information about patients but the facilitys roughly square foot data center was already filled with rack mounted servers there wasnt enough room to add more mr peterson decided to gradually replace the servers with blade servers from hewlett packard co "by using blades we are able to use half the amount of space for the same amount of servers " says mr peterson mr peterson replaced server racks that contained servers with similar size blade racks that contained blade servers there was an increase to power and cooling costs because mr peterson was running servers in the same square footage that used to hold but it was a fraction of the cost of increasing the size of the data center or building a new one mr peterson says today the universitys data center has roughly blade servers and roughly rack mounted servers in the same space as the old ones the university expects to save between &# million and &# million by on building and equipment costs mr peterson says hes only in the first phase of the implementation he began using virtualization software in early to further consolidate the server farm mr peterson says he now uses as much as of his servers computing capacity up from roughly some companies are using virtualization and blade servers to cut the total number of servers they use which helps free up space and in some cases cut power use lee hudson technology director at zumiez inc an action sports retailer in everett wash saw his companys data center more than double in size in as the business grew over the past months mr hudson decided he needed an additional six rack mounted servers to handle the increased load though there was enough physical space for the additional servers mr hudson realized that the data center was already utilizing of its available power load mr hudson first looked into upgrading the power supply but he was given quotes as high as &# "we couldnt plug anything in i could have bought more racks but i didnt have any more outlets " says mr hudson "there was no more juice " so he decided to invest in blade servers from international business machines corp mr hudson removed rack servers from the square foot data center and replaced them with six blade servers using virtualization software he increased the servers workload so the six new ones did the job of the old ones by taking six servers out of operation mr hudson reduced the utilization of the data centers power supply to just under and delayed any power upgrades for zumiez for at least the next year "weve seen a big performance increase there hasnt been anything negative at all " mr hudson
