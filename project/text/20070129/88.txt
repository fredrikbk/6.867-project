treatment kaletra manufactured by abbott laboratories drug manufacturers have clashed with developing nations over the high price of hiv medications in the past but thailands decision to allow an inexpensive plavix concerns an entirely different class of medicines under world trade organization rules nations can declare an emergency and make or sell patented drugs without the consent of manufacturers and in the past other nations have used the threat as a negotiating tool brazil reached a deal with abbot on kaletra that preserved the companys patent but some drug industry

rejection of a patent for the active ingredient in its cancer drug gleevec on the grounds that it wasnt innovative enough arguing that a section of the patent law is unconstitutional and a violation of international trade statutes nearly patients in india are taking gleevec for a rare type of blood cancer and nearly all are receiving the drug at no cost novartis argues that it wants to strip away "unjustified hurdles" to innovation and that its case is about "intellectual property not about patient access " but patient advocates worry that if novartis prevails in its fight then patients who otherwise couldnt afford them will lose access to essential drugs and that drug companies would have an opening to protect drugs nearing the end of their patent lives by making trivial changes to
