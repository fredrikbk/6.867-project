two football coaches have a lot to teach screaming managers the super bowl should be required viewing for managers who think screaming at employees is the best way to motivate them or simply their prerogative as bosses they wont see that kind of behavior sunday as the indianapolis colts play the chicago bears for footballs highest trophy the colts head coach tony dungy and the bears lovie smith dont curse or sarcastically chew out players which makes them stand out in the national football leagues scream and holler culture the two men the first african americans to lead super bowl teams became close friends when mr dungy formerly head coach for the tampa bay buccaneers hired mr smith as an assistant both believe they can get their teams to compete more fiercely and score more touchdowns by giving directives calmly and treating players with respect this doesnt mean they arent demanding or dont push hard mr dungy has a grading system that counts players "loafs " if someone isnt running at full speed or eases up or fails to hit an opponent when he could have those are loafs and its hard to get through a game without getting at least one when mr smith who uses the same system became the bears head coach three years ago he told players to lift more weights and eat better because he wanted a slimmer faster team when he gets mad he stares straight ahead in silence his players call it "the lovie look" and say its more frightening and more of a warning to play better than a torrent of angry words ceo screaming is certainly less in vogue than it was a decade ago judging from the leadership changes at some of the nations largest companies home depots new ceo frank blake is far milder mannered than former ceo bob nardelli who was ousted earlier this month walt disney ceo robert iger is contained and evenhanded unlike his predecessor the mercurial and explosive michael eisner but there are still numerous business executives who ridicule and scream at employees as a result they undermine productivity discourage innovation and may cause a talent drain at their companies says james clifton ceo of the gallup organization "theres a big difference between saying you made a stupid mistake and screaming youre really stupid " agrees gary hayes a psychologist and co founder of new york consultant hayes brunswick he worked with a new york law firm where a senior partner flung heavy law books across the room at an associate "the associate told me it was all right since the partner intentionally threw to miss not hit him " says mr hayes "but the associate soon moved to another firm " the vice president of marketing at a silicon valley company attributes rapid turnover at many west coast technology companies to what he calls "screaming bully bosses " one such boss a body builder who liked to show off his strength to managers by doing pushups at the start of meetings called him at all hours to scream about things that had gone wrong a second bully boss the ceo of a semiconductor network start up ridiculed him and his colleagues publicly "hed pick up something id written and say who wrote this a second grader its the stupidest thing ive ever read " the marketing vice president says on a trip to japan the ceo exploded after the marketing vice president spent two hours on a sunday looking for a gift for his wife back at headquarters he was told hed report to a lower level executive "it was my bosss way of punishing me " says the marketing vice president who quit also quitting in quick succession were the vice president of engineering and the vice president of human resources who were also tired of their bosss harangues margie lubet a pittsburgh communications and marketing manager distinguishes between "bosses with a passionate point of view and belittlers who often want an audience when screaming at you " belittlers cause emotional distress because they undermine your confidence she says one of her first bosses was like this she says she learned to let him vent while asking herself "whats really bothering him " for some managers and athletic coaches screaming is a way to show they are in charge and behavior that may be expected by their bosses the colts mr dungy says he didnt get some jobs earlier in his career because he was considered too laid back and polite and didnt believe being a great coach required him to sacrifice his family or faith on one interview when an owner asked if he would make the team the most important thing in his life he said no "i figured i probably wouldnt get that job and i didnt " he said at a press conference last week "i think your faith is more important than your job family is more important than your job we all know thats the way it should be but were kind of afraid to say that sometimes " lovie smith and he "arent afraid to say it " and both run their teams in the same way mr dungy said the colts and bears play "tough disciplined football even though theres not a lot of profanity from the coaches theres none of the win at all costs atmosphere i think for two guys to show you can win that way is important for the country to see " email
