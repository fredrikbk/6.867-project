technology a special report editors note what do you want to know about me do you want to know when i was born where i live my address years ago how much my house is worth the names of people possibly connected to me well all of it and more is out there online and easily accessible all you need is a couple of minutes and a little bit of money true some of what youll find is off the mark i wish i did own three houses but sadly i just have one but theres enough accurate stuff to make me cringe still is there anything i can do about it or is this simply life in the internet age michael totty tackles those questions in this issues cover story and his conclusion alternates between depressing and encouraging yes you can erase a lot of your traces online and michael offers guidance for those who want to try but doing so requires constant vigilance and even if you are vigilant you probably cant get rid of everything whether you make the effort depends on how private you are and how much information about you is available in the end though it probably comes down to one question what do you want us to know about you
