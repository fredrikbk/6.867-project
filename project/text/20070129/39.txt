in web polls of super bowl ads now a word from the sponsors sponsor the super bowl almost as famous for the tv commercials that interrupt it as for the game itself now has some marketers buying ads to sponsor the ads at least online several web sites rerunning the ads from the game as part of polls asking viewers to pick their favorite commercials have begun to cash in on the millions of people who visit their sites in the days after the game theyre selling ad time in some cases so called pre roll ads that viewers must sit through before they see the ad they came for usa todays web site and viacom inc s ifilm site have both sold pre roll ads on their super bowl poll pages while time warner inc s aol has sold advertising for its viewer poll google inc s youtube which is mounting a super bowl poll for the first time this year is offering advertisers in the big game the chance to buy marketing packages aimed at reinforcing the message of their super bowl spots on the video sharing site "super bowl ads have taken on a life of their own " says neal scarbrough editor and general manager of aol sports "when folks see these big numbers they go you know you think we can advertise there " for example traffic to ifilm increased during the week after the super bowl to million unique visitors from million the week before according to nielsen netratings a web monitoring company if past years are any guide million people will watch cbss broadcast of sundays game between the indianopolis colts and the chicago bears the biggest tv audience of the year cbs is charging as much as &# million for a second spot for madison avenue the super bowl is a contest for who can produce the funniest most creative and entertaining spots advertisers in this years game include anheuser busch cos pepsico inc coca cola co and sprint nextel corp the spots get so much attention that numerous web sites ask viewers to vote on which is the best ad polling opens either during the game or right after when sites put up copies of the spots the sites either obtain the commercials directly from the advertisers or record the commercials off the air some sites such as ifilm include outtakes and related commercials that dont air during the game aol says last year it streamed almost million copies of the ads in the week following the game its unclear how many different people watched because some of those million could be people viewing the ad multiple times but more than votes were cast the week after the super bowl nielsen netratings estimates that aols sports site which offers a variety of information not just the super bowl ads drew million unique visitors in that week which was more than the week before the super bowl aol like other web sites wont say what it charged for the polls advertising but says it was a fraction of the cost of a broadcast spot other sites like usa todays see similar bumps in traffic its ad meter site registered million streams in up from the year before with online video having taken off in the past year even more people are expected to go to the internet to check out the ads this year as a result the sites are seeing heavy demand from advertisers including those which for various reasons dont want to buy spots during the actual game "from the advertisers perspective everyone wants to be in it but not everyone can afford what the super bowl wants " says alex betancur vice president and general manager for publishers clearing house online which is advertising on aols poll "a good opportunity is to go to the peripheral to be involved in the hoopla but not be involved in the super bowl commercials " nbc is promoting its thursday night comedy lineup with second ads on ifilms viewer poll site rolling before a user sees the commercials the network says it couldnt promote the shows during the game which is airing on a rival network but the web reruns of the ads gives nbc a chance to "surround ourselves with the comedic energies of the commercials that line up with our thursday comedies " says ken grayson senior media director for nbc but making viewers watch an ad before they see another spot poses a potential conflict one beverage company could sponsor the commercial of a competitor also if the sponsor of a web poll is also one of the super bowl advertisers whose commercial is competing in that survey it could taint the results anheuser busch one of the biggest super bowl advertisers which has won usa todays online poll for the past six years is this year sponsoring the poll with pre roll ads usa today which is owned by gannett co says it is careful to limit the sponsors role it wouldnt allow an advertiser to include its brand in the polls name "because it is an advertising contest we dont want to give the impression that an advertiser influenced the results " says laryssa kundanmal usa todays vice president of integrated product marketing for these reasons cbs which posts the ads on its sportsline web site but doesnt run a poll isnt selling outside advertising neither is walt disney co s espn ed erhardt president of espn customer marketing and sales says while he expects traffic to the espn site that displays the commercials to peak the commercials are the advertisers work and not espns content to profit off of "we do a lot of business at espn with many of these advertisers " he says "it is better to serve the fans and not make this a sponsorship opportunity for us " some ad executives say the opportunity to reach people who like ads is too good to pass up says sarah fay president of isobar us the global network of digital companies owned by aegis "thats going to be a great audience advertising to people who want to see advertising " ad notes uncomfortable subject heads to the super bowl prostate drug flomax is among the slew of advertisers expected to strut their stuff during sundays super bowl the flomax spot crafted by wpp groups grey features a group of men competing in
