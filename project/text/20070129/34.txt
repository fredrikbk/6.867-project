is plan to use less gas feasible supply transport of ethanol cited as big obstacles u s oil refiners and automobile makers may support president bushs goal to enhance u s energy security by slashing gasoline consumption but they point to formidable challenges in meeting the aggressive year deadline the "twenty in ten" plan to enhance u s energy security by reducing gasoline consumption by in years calls for a sixfold increase in the use of nonpetroleum gasoline ethanol and flex fuel vehicles already in use dominate discussions of how to meet mr bushs alternative fuel consumption target of billion gallons a year by still critics question whether producers can make and transport enough ethanol and whether expensive new gasoline formulations or vehicle engine changes are necessary to accommodate a very different fuel pool costs are expected to mount to billions of dollars "its a huge ramp up " and one beyond the capacity of corn based ethanol said john felmy chief economist at the american petroleum institute technological breakthroughs would be necessary to bring cellulosic ethanol made from plant cellulose rather than starch from pilot program to commercial production he said even ethanol supporters say there isnt enough corn growing capacity to achieve the plans envisioned production levels transportation costs also are set to rise ethanol has a corrosive effect on the fuel pipelines that carry gasoline and other refined products which forces marketers to move it on scarcer and more expensive land transportation and so raises costs at least in the short run tight rail car and barge availability were partly responsible for skyrocketing gasoline prices last spring when in response to a change in fuel regulations marketers began blending ethanol into summer grade gasoline instead of a long used petroleum based additive aside from potential lost revenue changing the gasoline marketing infrastructure to accommodate more ethanol in fuel and perhaps more than one kind of gasoline is another big bill encompassing terminals and service stations mr felmy put the cost at &# to &# per station or &# billion to &# billion for roughly stations nationwide on the refiner level sizable new capital investments may also be necessary to produce a blend of gasoline that includes more ethanol and continues to meet environmental protection agency clean air regulations but stretching the amount of ethanol now blended into the cleaner burning gasoline required in smoggy areas to would require modifications in engine design the vast majority of the million cars and light trucks currently in use cant tolerate too much ethanol blended into gasoline without encountering performance and durability problems flexible fuel vehicles designed to run on either gasoline or the blend of ethanol and gasoline called e are already on the road but in small numbers many models are available only for commercial fleets or by special order and then mostly in the midwest where e supply is focused "manufacturers are committed to offering more alternative fuel vehicles but unless the fuel is available their potential wont be released " said charles territo spokesman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers it is time for the oil industry to step up said douglas durante director of the clean fuel development coalition auto makers have done their part he said between oil companies ability to modify fuel formulations and tax incentives and other measures to pay for the change in fuel infrastructure fuel merchants can do their part to reduce u s consumption of traditional gasoline he said apis mr felmy suggests that the auto industry could back its support for e vehicles and gasoline by setting up pumps at their own dealerships "there are over new car dealerships alone " he said "they all have tanks that can be converted to e "
