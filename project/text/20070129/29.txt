hutchisons li looks to make well timed exit indian wireless assets may yield a windfall a bigger risk to buyers hong kong at the height of the technology bubble hong kong tycoon li ka shing made billions by selling off telecommunications assets just before the crash now the year old chairman of hutchison whampoa ltd may be poised to pull off another well timed telecom deal the board of hutchison telecommunications international ltd a subsidiary of the hong kong conglomerate was scheduled to meet today to discuss plans for the companys indian telecom assets according to people familiar with the matter at stake is the units holding in hutchison essar an indian wireless communications company jointly owned with indian conglomerate essar group todays meeting is the first step as hutchison telecommunications moves to select a preferred bidder the deal is complicated by the fact that essar group claims a right of first refusal to buy the portion of hutchinson essar it doesnt already own and has threatened to try to block a rival deal hutchison telecommunications declined to comment on the scheduled meeting the scramble to get in on indias red hot wireless sector the worlds fastest growing cellular market by new subscribers could drive the price for all of hutchison essar above &# billion analysts say such a price would represent a premium to hutchison essars &# billion enterprise value according to clsa asia pacific markets the list of potential bidders includes british cellular giant vodafone group plc indias reliance communications ltd orascom telecom holding sae of egypt and essar group itself because only about of indias population owns a cellphone companies see massive growth potential in the nations wireless market yet hutchison telecommunications attempt to exit from the booming sector is in many ways a classic play for mr li who is known for unloading profitable assets at the peak of the market "what theyve proven time and time again is that theyre a shrewd asset trader with no sentimental attachment to telecom " says james enck chief european telecom analyst at daiwa securities smbc europe ltd in london hutchison whampoa owns of hutchison telecommunications and also has holdings in real estate retail energy and ports the potential india deal has also raised questions about hutchison whampoas long term commitment to telecom operations elsewhere in the world some of which have been far less successful than the india joint venture since hutchison whampoa has had billions of dollars in losses from a &# billion bet on third generation or g mobile phone services which allow users to watch video and browse the internet on their phones its indian operations use older second generation or g technology but elsewhere hutchison telecommunications offers g wireless services to about million customers through its group in markets including italy the united kingdom australia ireland and hong kong for the past several years losses from telecom have damped profits at hutchison whampoa whose more successful businesses include the canadian oil and gas company husky energy inc and a booming property business in china hutchison whampoa has shown interest in unloading some of its european telecom assets rumors have circulated that hutchison whampoa was considering selling its g uk ltd operation which has suffered from high rates of customer turnover the company has denied it is selling the u k business and last week in an interview with the swedish press managing director canning fok denied the company is getting out of g "everybody is talking about our exit strategy its completely wrong " mr fok said "were a very long term investor " hutchison whampoa confirms the remarks as the india deal nears some analysts have questioned whether hutchison whampoa may be selling an asset with high growth potential too early in the game but others say the &# billion price reflects the value of the indian venture two to three years down the line "if they can get a good price why not crystallize the value and take the money off the table " says rob hart a morgan stanley analyst who covers hutchison whampoa the bigger risk many analysts say is to buyers who might wind up overpaying amid the bidding frenzy cellphone penetration is relatively high in indias major cities such as new delhi mumbai and kolkata where wealthier consumers and businesses are situated now indias wireless carriers are pushing into smaller cities and rural areas where incomes are lower and infrastructure is less secure turning healthy profits there may be difficult the potential essar deal is reminiscent of some of mr lis past deals that have earned him his reputation as a savvy asset trader in hutchison whampoa sold its stake in britains orange mobile phone network at the height of the telecom bubble to germanys mannesmann and booked a &# billion profit within a year telecom valuations began to collapse kate linebaugh in hong kong and cassell bryan low in london contributed to this article
