whats your workout when its cold outside the executive stephen mona has worked in the golf industry for years since hes been ceo of the golf course superintendents association of america a professional association for those who manage maintain and provide upkeep for golf courses in the u s and world wide mr mona spends about one third of the year traveling to golfing events governance meetings other chapters and fundraisers his lawrence kan home is less than two miles from his office mr mona is " weighs pounds and has a golf handicap index of about he is married with three children ages and and has been an avid runner since high school where he ran track the workout running outdoors doesnt cost much more than the price of a pair of sneakers and it can be time efficient theres no gym to visit and many folks just step out their door and go but mr mona says his running routine three miles five days a week started to erode three years ago he found himself skipping more and more outdoor runs mainly due to the weather "it can get pretty cold and snowy and icy around here in the winter " says mr mona "and if its degrees outside its tough to get out there " there are also times in the summer where an early morning thunderstorm would cause mr mona to miss a run his wife offered a solution when she surprised him with an elliptical trainer for christmas they put it in their basement and mr mona now uses it five mornings a week "its great " says mr mona who now only runs outdoors when hes traveling "you have no excuse not to do it nothing can prevent you except you " mr mona says that he doesnt miss running outdoors early in the morning he gets ample outside time through his work and working out in the basement doesnt seem so awful to mr mona there were many mornings in the past when he had to run outside in the dark even though he gets to the office at around a m mr mona still prefers to exercise in the morning it helps that he lives two miles from the office "at the end of the day im tired and just not going to exercise " he says mr mona wakes up at a m and works out on the elliptical trainer for minutes while watching cnn or espn mr mona says he doesnt get nearly as good a cardio workout from the elliptical as he did from running but he says he isnt trying to lose weight just maintain his level of fitness however he does try to push himself to make sure hes getting his heart rate up and his machine has handles that pump back and forth to work the upper body as well as his core muscles and legs so he says he feels like he gets a more balanced workout when on the road which is about days a year mr mona says that he will either use an elliptical machine at the hotel gym or run outside if the weathers warm on weekends hell occasionally use the machine but other times hell just play golf he plays saturday mornings with a regular group of friends and sundays by himself his regular course is fairly hilly and he always walks with a pull cart when he can but sometimes when he plays golf at corporate events he rides in a motorized cart with the rest of his colleagues mr mona stretches both before and after using the elliptical "im really big on staying limber " he says "when i stretch i find it helps my golf game " when he travels for work hell stretch in his hotel room for minutes even if he doesnt have time to exercise and on the weekends he stretches regardless of whether he uses the elliptical mr mona stretches his hamstrings by lying on his back on the floor then extending his legs one at a time against a wall as close to perpendicular as possible he also has a stability ball that he estimates he uses once a week and sometimes weekends he performs core strengthening exercises like crunches on the ball and stretches his arms torso and legs by lying across the ball then extending his upper arm over his head the diet mr mona describes himself as a fairly healthy eater he has a granola or nutrition bar for breakfast at the office and about two thirds of the time he brings leftovers from home for lunch the rest of the time he eats lunch out with staff or clients and orders healthy options like lean meat and vegetables "when you go out and have control of what you order you can still eat right " he says his wife cooks dinner again a lot of vegetables and usually chicken or fish mr mona doesnt eat much red meat except at work banquets where he doesnt like to put in special meal requests "if you put prime rib in front of me ill eat it but at home i just dont eat red meat " after a meal mr mona usually reaches for hard candy if he is at a banquet he might have a bite of a dessert "but youll never see me eat a whole dessert " he says mr monas eating hits pitfalls when hes on the road "its a challenge because you dont get meals on airplanes anymore so i find myself missing a lot of meals especially lunch " he says he usually keeps a nutrition bar in his bag and also buys trail mix at the airport when changing legs of a flight at home he tries to eat dinner fairly early but when traveling for business he finds himself eating big meals much later at night mr mona says that he used to drink about to cups of coffee a day but quit cold turkey in and hasnt had a cup since he also gave up soft drinks "i just wasnt feeling that good and thought maybe it could be related to the caffeine since i drank an unbelievable amount of coffee " he says "i quit over the weekend and by the end of the week just didnt view myself as a coffee drinker " he now drinks plenty of water and keeps a glass on his desk which he fills up throughout the day the cost the elliptical machine is much more forgiving on mr monas sneakers "ive at least doubled the life span of my shoes by going on the elliptical " he says he never spends more than &# for a pair and often receives dry fit shirts or shorts as christmas gifts from his kids his elliptical machine cost &# according to his wife mr mona also belongs to the alvamar golf and country club in lawrence the membership initiation fee for a family membership is &# and monthly dues are &# the effort the elliptical machine offers a much lower impact form of exercise than running and many runners switch to it because of an injury but mr mona says that hes never really had any injuries his switch was more about finding a foolproof routine "this is part of my day and just something i do so it makes it easy i dont think of it as an extra activity i think of it as a normal part of my morning like taking a shower " over the last years with his children now older mr mona has been pretty faithful about not missing a workout he tries to get seven hours of sleep a night and says there are times when an extra half hour of sleep is more important "if i have a a m flight im up at a m and im not going to get up minutes earlier to work out " he says the benefit "im a high energy person and no question this has enhanced my energy and how i feel about myself " says mr mona "it transcends how you feel in general and eventually effects how you interact with other people and other parts of your life like golf " mr mona says exercise also provides a great mental release "work is always highly engaging " he says "so its nice to be able to go watch espn and exercise its not mentally strenuous and its kind of fun versus getting up showering jumping in the car and boom going straight to work " mr mona has also gone years without getting sick to which he credits his exercise and eating habits and in his previous job he was sick one day in ten years "genetics probably have a little something to do with it " he says "but the exercise certainly has played some role " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
