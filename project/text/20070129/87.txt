the daily fix federer cant be stopped at least before clay season in the australian opens round of fernando gonzalez beat no seed james blake in straight sets in the quarterfinals the chilean lost just nine games in a straight set rout of no rafael nadal in the semifinals mr gonzalez dominated no tommy haas losing just five games and committing a mere three unforced errors in three sets then mr gonzalez met roger federer before the final mr gonzalez said "hes winning all the time he has to lose sometimes " not yesterday federer won his th straight match his sixth major title in his last seven tries and his fourth australian open in five years by beating mr gonzalez he became the first man since bjorn borg in to win a major without dropping a set and the first man ever to win seven straight set matches in melbourne "cue the same old celebration a collapse on to his back emotions churning " neil harman writes in the times of london adding "dignified as ever he found time to praise gonzalez for the improvements in his tennis saying that he was one of the great characters on the tour what continues to make federer such a classy champion is that he too is a person to be admired one can only hope that someone can muster the devil in themselves to beat him nadal will give it a go on clay andy murray hard to see anyone else " mr nadals dominance at the french open and straight clay court wins will continue to motivate federer its one of five flaws the ages tim colebatch identifies to lift the spirits of the rest of mens tour some are flimsy winning straight tie breakers surely attests to some form of mental and physical superiority as much as it does luck before the final the independents ronald atkin gave the year old champion more targets he must achieve to claim his title as best of all time "as he got out of bed this morning there were five more grand slam titles to be annexed before he could draw level with pete samprass and three more years to go to equal petes mark of ending six straight years as world no " mr atkin writes "federers count of titles is impressive but jimmy connors has while rogers personal high water mark set last year of wins in a season falls short of ivan lendls record then there is the matter of rod lavers grand slam years of and though one mark which will fall to federer next month is connors consecutive weeks at no " serena williams made a mockery of the conventional wisdom that the tennis tour ruthlessly marches on beyond the capability of its idle players against six seeded opponents in seven matches the younger of the williams sisters lost just two sets neither of them in a minute rout of no maria sharapova in the final that clinched her eighth major title "the williams sisters make fools of everybody " steve bierley writes in the guardian "and long may they continue to do so would be the cry of many they are comets of the tennis world these days blazing into view from time to time and then disappearing dazzling but rarely inconsequential " federers friend and intersport rival tiger woods major championships to rogers extended his own recent string of dominance by winning his seventh straight pga tour event in la jolla calif san diego union tribune columnist tim sullivan says the streak of titles hasnt gotten its due "clearly all contestants are not created equal only a few can match woods length off the tee only a handful can approach his handiwork around the greens maybe one player in a generation can rival woods range of shots his acute competitiveness his grace under pressure and his inexhaustible incentive and still his streak is staggering " but toronto star sports tv critic chris zelkovich says it was the rest of the field that went underappreciated in la jolla "there were tiger highlight packages and those loving shots of him walking up the fairway long before he took the lead now you might think that a handful of unknowns somehow outplaying woods for more than three rounds would have made for a great story but cbs wasnt interested " last november in a rematch of last years nba west conference championship the dallas mavericks beat the phoenix suns the two teams were a combined since then theyve won of their cumulative games one was another mavs win over the suns and established themselves as the best two teams in the league with the suns a half game ahead of the mavs and riding a game winning streak dallas morning news columnist kevin sherrington says the pressure is on dirk nowitzki and co to keep pace "playoff seeding is important " mr sherrington writes "the west has six maybe seven teams dallas phoenix san antonio houston utah the lakers and denver with a legitimate shot to win it all who would you want to face in the first round finish with the top seed and you not only avoid one of those teams you probably miss san antonio in the second round " in the anemic east the washington wizards hold the best record despite having lost as many games as the suns and mavs combined washington times columnist tom knott says coach eddie jordan has handled a turbulent year with grace "jordan has come a long way in the last months from an object of speculation to a potential all star coach and maintained a calm dignity through it all " mr knott writes "his cool demeanor has served both him and the team well with the wizards of the last few seasons capable of driving even the most grounded person to fits of frustration but that is just not jordans style unless sufficiently piqued he routinely takes the blame following a loss and doles out praise to his players following a victory " carl became a college basketball fan as a middle schooler by watching syracuse first year guard lawrence moten quietly gracefully match michigans fab five freshmen in his debut season when the orangemen as they were then known werent televised in new york city the radio broadcasts offered poetry in moten as he was then known mr moten went on to set the school and big east career scoring records "never mind that he didnt have a classic jumper extraordinary speed or at foot and pounds a whole lot of sinew " bud poliquin writes in the syracuse post standard "didnt matter the guy was a basketball surgeon who scored in double figures times in varsity games and was as demonstrative along the way as a potted plant there was no stupid howling for this young man no obnoxious sneering no theatrical tugging on his jersey to reveal ostensibly his robust heart " mr moten went on to play pro ball in the nba and elsewhere on three continents and now just shy of hes retired and returned to syracuse to earn his degree and mentor the current orange team highly touted freshman paul harris has scored points just shy of mr motens first year total lorne gump worsley a hall of fame legend goalie and four time stanley cup champion died friday at age he was potbellied short and played most of his year career without a mask "he seemed forever tortured in the net not unlike most of his contemporaries who faced the rockets from the banana blades of bobby hull and stan mikita and the flashing skates and sticks that threatened their careers every time they dove maskless into a scramble or squatted low to see through a forest of screening legs " dave stubbs writes in the winnipeg free press but mr stubbs adds "despite gumps pained expression he had a world class sense of humour and love of life that kept his teammates loose and himself just north of the sanity border " found a good column from the world of sports dont
