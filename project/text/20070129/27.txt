could weak oil cost venezuela iran clout softening oil prices over the past few months have spurred hope in washington that less revenue for oil rich states could weaken the hand of governments the u s considers worrisome particularly those in iran venezuela and russia the three nations are potentially vulnerable oil and gas revenue accounts for between two thirds and three quarters of government income in both venezuela and iran and only slightly less in russia so a big drop in oil prices would slow economic growth and hit government finances forcing them to cut back spending increases that have boosted the popularity of all three governments at home and emboldened them abroad but it is far too early to expect the changing economics of oil to have big political effects for one thing although the price of oil has fallen since hitting an all time high of &# in july it is still high by historical standards the three nations having weathered crises before have all built up substantial currency reserves to cushion against a further fall in prices "fifty dollar oil doesnt put any of them in any grave danger " says michelle billig director of political risk at pira energy group a new york based consultancy "after all it was only a few years ago that we were talking about an oil windfall for these places at &# a barrel " march crude oil futures settled at &# friday on the new york mercantile exchange up &# on the day equally important it isnt clear that any of the trio would radically alter their policies even if squeezed harder economically under president vladimir putin a former kgb spy russia has put a priority on reasserting its political might and reclaiming the global influence it wielded during the soviet unions heyday generations of leaders in tehran have made the development of nuclear power a stated goal and asserted the countrys hypothetical right to a nuclear weapon no matter the price of oil venezuela might have the hardest time pursuing the assertive foreign policy of president hugo chavez a populist and former army officer if oil prices were to drop much more over the past few years mr chavez has used oil money to try to counter what he sees as harmful u s influence in latin america caracas has helped finance some neighbors debt and it has handed out cut rate oil to dozens of countries including fidel castros cuba and even some u s communities through the state oil companys citgo subsidiary unlike russia and to a lesser extent iran venezuela has been much more reckless in spending its oil windfall last year alone public spending grew widening the gap between total government income and outlays to about of the total economy according to estimates by morgan stanley so far falling oil prices havent dented mr chavezs spending habits just last week he announced a program to send poor venezuelans each year to vacation in cuba he also recently offered the armys services to build a road in nicaragua at a projected cost of &# million while economists agree that mr chavezs free spending policies may eventually shipwreck the venezuelan economy they say that wont happen if it happens at all for at least another year the main reason venezuela has accumulated more than &# billion of reserves but there are signs mr chavez could be headed for trouble even without a much bigger drop in oil prices he recently ordered an increase in gasoline prices which the government has long subsidized to raise federal revenue and some economists view his recent nationalization of venezuelas biggest telephone and electric companies as a sign his administration is eager to raise more money to keep up its spending a further drop in oil prices then might leave mr chavez with some tough choices about where to trim the fat high on the list would be his foreign aid by far the chief beneficiary of mr chavezs largesse is cuba which receives barrels a day of refined petroleum products in exchange for the services of cuban doctors and other specialists analysts believe aid to cuba totals about &# billion a year cutting back on such aid would be a relief in washington which worries about the spread of mr chavezs socialist message and could also be welcome at home where many venezuelans resent mr chavezs largesse toward others when venezuela has seen little progress on issues such as reducing poverty indeed a recent study by claudio loser a former international monetary fund official showed that venezuelas real per capita income has grown a cumulative since the year mr chavez took power mr chavez also might be forced to cut back on the domestic front last year venezuela had latin americas highest inflation rate about and it is expected to climb sharply this year "i think it will be a difficult year for the venezuelan economy " says francisco rodriguez who teaches latin american economics at wesleyan university in middletown conn russia is much less vulnerable to oil prices under mr putin the country has built up &# billion of foreign exchange reserves an &# billion rainy day oil fund and runs big yearly budget surpluses mr putin is loosening the purse strings this year in the run up to presidential elections in early with a increase in spending from but the budget would still break even with oil as low as &# to &# per barrel however lower oil prices could hurt earnings at energy companies that form the backbone of russias economy iran is more exposed to the vagaries of the oil market as revenue has soared with oil prices irans public sector spending has expanded almost as fast to pay for massive subsidies for most daily goods including gasoline bread and heating fuel the government has borrowed in each of the past two years from a special rainy day fund set up to retain some oil revenue for when prices fall again but that spending has ignited inflation now running around iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad introduced a budget early last week that included a increase in spending for the iranian fiscal year that begins in march he said the government whose ultimate authority is held by a council of islamic mullahs would be able to add to its rainy day fund if oil prices remain above &# per barrel the level the budget assumes for iranian oil but some private economists doubt the budget calculations and predict tehran would again fall back on those surplus funds to finance spending jose de cordoba in mexico city contributed to this article
