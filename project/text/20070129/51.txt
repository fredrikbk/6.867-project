no free lunch new ethics rules vex capitol hill ban on lobbyists gifts alters wining dining eating with a toothpick washington every year lobbyists for the seafood industry serve up choice gulf of mexico seafood at a reception for members of congress at next months event called "let the world be your oyster " legislators were supposed to feast on raw oysters from acme oyster house and oyster pasta from dragos a famed new orleans restaurant raw oysters are still on the menu but the oyster pasta has been shucked that dish runs afoul of new ethics rules passed by lawmakers specifically whats being called the "toothpick rule " to cut down on wining and dining by lobbyists the house and senate have drafted new rules that bar lawmakers and congressional aides from accepting almost any meals from lobbyists hors doeuvres are an exception so is "food that you have to eat standing up using a toothpick " explains washington lawyer brett kappel who advises lobbyists and companies about ethics rules oyster pasta the seafood lobbyists decided would be difficult to eat with toothpicks stung by a series of corruption and bribery investigations on capitol hill congress is moving to enact the most far reaching ethics reforms since the watergate scandal both chambers have approved new rules but legislation has not yet been finalized the result considerable uncertainty about whats allowed and some unintended consequences the american heart association canceled free cpr training on capitol hill for fear the sessions would violate a new ban on giving lawmakers and aides anything having more than nominal value a house prohibition against taking trips on corporate jets approved this month has turned into a headache for some lawmakers the rule forbids house members from boarding any "non governmental airplane that is not licensed by the federal aviation administration to operate for compensation or hire " unless they are traveling to a fund raising event most private planes arent licensed that way that means that the dozen or so house members who are pilots would violate the rule by flying their own aircraft rep dennis rehberg a republican from montana however is free to continue flying he flies a rented sikorsky helicopter the ban applies only to "fixed wing" aircraft the rule "was written by people who dont know the difference between private planes and corporate planes " says rep collin peterson a democrat from minnesota who has stopped flying his own four seat propeller plane across his mile long district republican rep robin hayes commutes from north carolina to capitol hill in his own plane he often picks up other lawmakers along the way hes made the trip at least once since the rule took effect he and mr peterson say they are working to change the rule to cater to the pilot lawmakers they say they think the problem will be resolved in the next month the senate has proposed banning lawmakers spouses from lobbying the senate a clause exempts those who were lobbying a year or more before their spouses became senators which accounts for just about all of them but the wife of sen kent conrad a north dakota democrat wouldnt be able to continue lobbying the senate on behalf of major league baseball thats because she got into the business after her husband was elected because the rules ban gift giving by lobbying groups dozens of amateur softball teams on capitol hill will no longer be allowed to accept balls bats and league fees from corporations and lobbying organizations the nuclear energy institutes sponsorship of the team of rep joe barton a texas republican who until recently headed the energy and commerce committee could be in trouble "i dont think you will see that happening anymore " said bill sells a lobbyist with the sporting goods manufacturers association the trade group will provide plastic bases to the league but only if they are returned at the end of the season team sponsorship by bars and restaurants is still ok provided they dont use registered lobbyists that means the "smell the glove" team from the office of rep william jefferson a louisiana democrat can still receive support from trustys a capitol hill bar the no meal rules which took effect this month are especially knotty they apply to meals from lobbyists and from people who work for companies that employ registered lobbyists that means that a congressional aide cant accept a hamburger from the national association of home builders which uses lobbyists but an aide can be treated to a steak dinner by companies that dont have registered lobbyists such as home builders toll brothers inc and nvr inc the rules are leading to other peculiar results consider the competing annual events to commemorate national hot dog day on capitol hill each july the american meat institute gives away hundreds of hot dogs to lawmakers and aides at an invitation only reception in the courtyard of a house office building the trade group pays former major league baseball players to hand out the hot dogs each year on the same day people for the ethical treatment of animals an animal welfare group holds a separate reception for lawmakers and aides outside the same house office building it hands out vegetarian hot dogs unlike the meat lobbys bash the peta event is open to the public instead of paid baseball stars the animal welfare group recruits playboy models to hand out the veggie dogs the women dress in skimpy bikinis fashioned partly from lettuce peta does not use registered lobbyists which makes its event kosher the meat institute which does use lobbyists isnt sure whether its event would fall under one of the exemptions to the meal ban "right now everyone in town is trying to figure out what this all means " says jesse sevcik a vice president of legislative affairs for the american meat institute he says he plans to talk to aides on the house ethics committee to figure out how to make the event permissible one option is to turn it into a "widely attended" event which is one of the exemptions dragos oyster pasta was on the menu of the annual seafood reception for lawmakers until the seafood lobby did some checking stacey viera a spokeswoman for the national fisheries institute one of the sponsors called the senate ethics panel to see if the event would pass muster "they said you dont have any chairs or silverware do you " recalls ms viera in the new ethics environment the use of chairs and tables suggests that a meal carries more than nominal value "its unusual to invite people to something and not let them sit down but thats one of the quirks of the rule " says mike voisin of motivated seafood an oyster harvesting and processing company that is one of the organizers another sponsor mcilhenny co the maker of tabasco sauce has decided to stop giving ties and golf shirts with the tabasco logo to lawmakers and aides worried that the clothing would be deemed too valuable the national fisheries institute has offered to hand "gummy fish" candies in small packets that bear the institutes name see related letter "letters to the editor continuing saga of ethics reform" wsj feb
