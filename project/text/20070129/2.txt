americas tortilla facts mexican president felipe calderon has been making an all out effort to fight the u s war on drugs but now he will have to redeploy forces against a new brand of mexican criminal the corn hoarder anyone caught stockpiling the ancient mexican grain can get years in jail its not the higher cost of corn per se that has mr calderon denouncing "speculators" and "hoarders " rather its what rising corn prices are doing to push up the cost of tortillas the most fundamental of mexican staples in just a few weeks tortillas have become the issue for the new government which boasts a free market agenda the little golden disks made from corn flour are practically a symbol of national identity in mexico as prices have surged by at least in most parts of the country mr calderons political opponents are pushing their view that economic liberty is behind this assault on mexican culture nothing could be further from the truth the cause of the corn price spike is too much government intervention not too little which makes this mr calderons first big test either he moves boldly to liberate mexicans from the restrictive policies that led to the problem or he caves in to those who demand price controls more subsidies and a reversal of the north american free trade agreement if he chooses liberalization he will establish himself as a modern leader much as ronald reagan proved his bona fides by firing the air traffic controllers if on the other hand he gives in to his adversaries the defeat could weaken him irretrievably in that case his six year term is likely to look more like that of his predecessor vicente fox who never got much done the sharp increase in mexican corn prices which fueled the tortilla price spike followed big price increases for corn on international markets over the past year the main cause according to most commodity analysts was the u s decision to subsidize ethanol made from corn growers who previously marketed their harvests to food and livestock companies suddenly have new demand from ethanol producers who are also armed with a subsidy to make their bids more attractive the increase in demand from government subsidized ethanol producers pushed up prices yet the u s isnt the only government that is distorting markets mexicos quota system for corn imports has exacerbated the problem in december chicago futures markets were already forecasting higher prices because of increased demand commodity speculators were anticipating supply problems in the mexican market and according to the jan edition of the mexican weekly el semanario corn flour makers were ready to pass those costs onto consumers the only way to reduce the building price pressure would have been to increase mexican access to international suppliers but that wasnt easy to do thanks to quotas on corn imports to increase the quotas required permission from the bureaucracy but according to the el semanario report the bureaucrats misjudged the urgency of the matter at a dec meeting the magazine says "a representative of the office of the secretary of the economy was present but he did nothing to deactivate the bomb he elected to confront the crisis upon return from the christmas holidays but by then it was too late " this illustrates why quotas have to go the way of the dodo if mexico hopes to be an economic tiger rather than a lumbering dinosaur bureaucrats balked at higher imports in december because they wanted to keep corn prices at a certain level and worried that an increase in supply might knock them down we dont doubt the good intentions of the government officials charged with finding the goldilocks "just right" amount of corn to import but thats an impossible task for government only the market can efficiently discover the equilibrium that satisfies both suppliers and purchasers to turn down the heat on his government mr calderon is asking tortilla makers to agree to voluntary price controls and promising to punish speculators neither step inspires confidence price controls whether they are achieved through arm twisting or the law tend to cause shortages if producers are eating losses they lose their incentive to produce speculators play an important role in diversifying risk in the market they are not criminals unless of course the government has granted them quota privileges which brings us to the crux of the problem import quotas the government raised corn quotas last week but only in an acceleration of the annual import schedule as such its the proverbial band aid the way to avoid future mismatches between supply and demand is to end the quota system altogether something mexico has to do by next january in any case to comply with full nafta implementation less than a year ago mexican officials were asking their nafta partners to "reconsider" the opening of the corn and bean markets because they feared that local farmers could not compete but now as luis de la calle a former mexican deputy trade minister points out "the increase in the price of corn in the u s means that the vast majority of corn that is grown in mexico will now be competitive and will not require subsidies to be commercially viable " far from being a victim of u s ethanol policy mr calderon can come out the hero in an environment of robust prices he can open the agriculture sector with no harm to producers and champion the consumer while hes at it he might confront mexicos powerful green movement which is blocking the use of genetically modified organisms gmo in seed much to the detriment of mexican competitiveness and both producers and consumers modernity technology and competition not tortilla prices are why leaders of mexicos large labor unions and peasant groups have been kicking up a storm against mr calderon and are now promising a mega march on the capital on wednesday to demand price controls their pretext may be high food prices but their solutions are all about a return to corporatism and protectionism so far the government doesnt seem to appreciate the broader opportunity presented by the "tortilla crisis " mr calderon was elected to take mexico further down the path of modernity restructuring the agricultural sector is central to this goal with consumers up in arms about food prices the president has been handed all the political cover he needs to take mexico to the next level of liberalization if only he has the sense to use it write to ogrady wsj com
