eurolinks daily view curbing the excesses of energy rich regimes as oil and gas revenue accounts for between two thirds and three quarters of government income in both venezuela and iran and only slightly less in russia lower energy prices are reducing the leverage of these three energy rich states with whom washington has its differences forcing them to curb spending that has both helped their popularity at home and emboldened them abroad but as the u s pushes to limit oil consumption which may help curb the excesses of such oil and gas rich governments how realistic is president george w bushs call for a nearly fivefold increase in the u s s alternative fuel consumption by the profitability of many alternative fuels is still in question especially now that the cost of raw ingredients used to produce "biofuel" has rocketed its also becoming clear that boosting output of agriculture based fuels such as ethanol will cause significant new strains on the worlds water and land resources and could drive prices of basic foodstuffs to unacceptably high levels hurting poor consumers but even as the outlook for alternative energies darkens a more positive outcome may be emerging a forced redirection of resources toward alternative fuels that are more efficient and sustainable than the current batch not unlike the emergence of stronger internet players from the

that the fed might not move rates much this year as central bank policy makers prepare for this weeks first meeting of the year investors are increasingly resigned to a longer pause in rate moves than they had expected some wall street forecasters think the fed could go all year without changing its rate targets a prospect that contributed to last weeks market sluggishness such predictions run counter to many investors hopes for a quick rate cut which would lower borrowing costs and encourage more consumption throughout the u s economy potentially helping corporate profits and thus stocks
