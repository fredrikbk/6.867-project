technology a special report outside chance why oursourcing it often doesnt save as much as it could companies outsource their information technology operations for a lot of reasons but the most important is always to save money so how is it that so many outsourcing deals fail to deliver on the promised savings the wall street journal took the question to joe hogan vice president of strategic sourcing programs for unisys corp of blue bell pa mr hogan who has spent years in the outsourcing business explains why farming out it services doesnt always pay off in lower costs and how companies can make the most of their outsourcing deals mr hogan laid out three reasons for failure three questions chief information officers need to ask before entering into outsourcing deals and four principles for success why do so many it outsourcing deals fall short of the promised cost savings for three reasons mr hogan says companies fail to anticipate changes in business circumstances or in technology resulting in surprise charges they suffer from "misaligned expectations" among the outsourcer the chief information officer and the various company departments that use the technology and they dont take into account hidden costs first circumstances can change over time giving rise to unexpected costs mr hogan tells of a banking client that signed a deal with an outsourcer to process paper checks but the client didnt include a crucial cost in the agreement the eventual switchover to electronic payments when the client later made the change it faced an additional cost the change did ultimately bring lower processing costs "so the whole economics of the business case and the cost savings you were trying to achieve with that transaction are going to change " mr hogan says "its not going to work " companies also can be disappointed about expected savings when the outsourcer it department and various business units have different expectations about the outsourcing arrangement mr hogan points to the case of a pharmaceutical company that contracted with an outsourcer to deliver computer hardware software and help desk services when the marketing department needed it support to prepare for an important product launch the outsourcer delivered the equipment and services within the price and time frame specified in the agreement not on the schedule needed by the marketing manager though the manager eventually got the needed equipment and service the delay wasted time and money "the service level that was contracted for by the cio was different than what the business needed " mr hogan says "it was not adequate to cover the new business requirement it was one dimensional " then theres the discovery of hidden costs which can result from doing the deal too quickly without enough due diligence by the company and the outsourcer most often though hidden costs come from failing to take a simple fact into account companies need to oversee the work that the outsourcer is doing and that can cost as much as managing in house employees "most companies dont think about the fact that they have to manage the outsourcer " mr hogan says "you need to manage the outsourcer with a set of skills thats different from what you need to manage your own in house shop at the end of the day theres always an added cost to do that " in most cases the failure is "usually a mutual problem " mr hogan adds "its not something that is just caused by the client but also can be caused by the suppliers themselves " sometimes for instance the outsourcer doesnt make it clear how to manage changes under the contract or doesnt do enough to manage a clients expectations and sometimes the deal is just a bad match what does a cio need to do before signing an outsourcing deal a cio mr hogan says needs to ask what he or she wants to accomplish by the end of the outsourcing contract cios also need to determine what resources and capabilities they need from an outsourcer as well as how to measure performance and set up effective communication among the it department the business units involved and the outsourcer how can cios ensure that outsourcing deals achieve the expected savings "i have a watchword when im doing a relationship with a client " mr hogan says "no surprise endings allowed " to prevent unpleasant surprises cios need to follow four basic principles mr hogan says expectations about what services the outsourcer will provide how timely they will be delivered and at what cost need to be agreed upon by the it department the business units and the outsourcer before the deal is signed if cost savings are primary all parties need to agree ahead of time on the importance of the other priorities such as response time for calls to the help desk the second principle is that everyone involved needs to understand what it will take to meet those expectations if meeting cost targets is the goal for instance that might mean slower help desk response times or restrictions on equipment upgrades number three mr hogan says is to "make sure that everybody understands whos responsible for what the business the it department and the outsourcer and thats got to be very clear " the fourth is that the company needs to be able to measure performance from the beginning of the outsourcing deal to document any changes in the performance of the contract and to communicate those changes back to everyone involved in setting the original expectations is it a mistake for companies to put such emphasis on cost savings what should they focus on instead while saving money always needs to be a factor mr hogan says other benefits need to be considered for instance outsourcers can offer companies the flexibility to quickly change technology as their needs change they can also adjust it costs depending on changes in the economic climate and they can give companies better access to research and new technology ultimately he says a successful outsourcing arrangement depends on cost speed and the knowledge an outsourcer brings "if i can understand it i can do it quickly i can keep my costs low " he says "if i cant understand it and cant do it quickly my costs will get out of control its three dimensional rather than one dimensional "
