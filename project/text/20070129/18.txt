consumer technology mini myspaces new social networking sites create communities catering to specific interests shawn hesketh was looking to create an online meeting place for student artists in the houston area when he discovered ning com mr hesketh wanted to build a site that would encourage interaction among the participants in his culture shapers program which organizes an annual art contest for local high school students ning com owned by ning inc of palo alto calif provided the tools he needed the site allows people to create their own social networking web sites "i checked them out and fell in love right away " says mr hesketh "we had our site developed and launched within minutes " culture shapers ning site received visits in the first month after its launch in early october as mr hesketh posted the winning entries for the programs most recent art contest since then some users have set up their own pages on the site to post art critique other works or hold discussions amid the explosive growth of giant social networking sites like myspace and facebook ning and other sites are offering new ways for people to connect online these sites offer more focused interaction on a smaller scale from social networking built around shared interests to family or friends planning a get together and they give users more control over the experience than bigger sites do "we really want to take a back seat toward the whole thing and really empower people to create something of their own " says ning co founder and chief executive gina biachini ning com allows users to easily set up three different kinds of sites a social networking site a photo sharing site and a video site the typical web site that people have been able to build for years doesnt allow multiple users to upload items and interact with each other the way the sites prepared by ning do though such a site can be set up with knowledge of complex coding techniques the creator of a group site on ning com can change the way it looks by scrolling through different templates to choose the color scheme font and other layout details users can make their group site as open or as private as they want the culture shapers site was so successful that mr hesketh decided to create a video group dedicated to a sister program a singing competition called young voices of houston mr hesketh expects both sites to attract young local artists for at least the four years they are in high school and possibly beyond "what were expecting is that the kids will continue to use this site to keep in touch " he says there is no charge for creating a group but ning com charges for services like added storage culture shapers pays &# a month for additional storage and for the right to run ads on its site a move that mr hesketh says has more than paid for its costs kyle ford created a group on ning com dedicated to libertyville high schools class of in preparation for its reunion last november members of the class posted profiles and photos on the site and were able to contact each other through the site ahead of the reunion hani khalil an alumnus of the chicago area school found it a useful tool at the reunion he says "people i hadnt spoken to in years were striking conversations with me on topics they wouldnt have known about if they hadnt read my profile " he still regularly checks the site to get in touch with people he couldnt talk to at the reunion groups built around a reunion or other event may come and go but overall nings popularity is growing ms biachini the co founder says the sites page views are increasing at a rate of about a month the potentially ephemeral nature of many self created online groups is part of the attraction suggests joe kraus the founder of jotspot a social networking site that was recently acquired by google inc "one of the cool things about these web tools is you dont have to make a personal investment " says mr kraus "being able to set something up and tear it down is a benefit " google last spring began offering people a way to connect online through its calendar application users can share a calendar to help plan an event for instance widely scattered family members can organize a get together by plotting on a common calendar everything from location and time to who brings what when one person fills in information on the calendar everyone in the invited group can see whats written users can also view each others calendars with permission or layer another persons calendar on top of their own calendars can be viewed by the day week or month and can be printed out they can also be set up to send out alerts via email or as text messages to cellular phones one limitation of googles calendar is that all communication has to be placed on a calendar grid so the program isnt ideal for sharing information that isnt tied to a date or a timetable but in october google launched its docs &amp spreadsheets application which allows people to create and alter shared documents and spreadsheets so for example a book group could create an online list of members proposals for future reading the list could be updated or comments could be inserted by anyone in the group for all to see all changes are marked to show when they were made and who made them aden bliss a financial analyst for wested a san francisco based nonprofit that promotes education and student development is a so called trusted tester of google applications serving as a guinea pig for new features mr bliss who isnt paid by google to test the features says he uses docs &amp spreadsheets to share a monthly chart of housing expenses with his roommates all the google applications are free some social networks are growing up around event listing sites andrew baio is a co founder of upcoming org a site that compiles listings of coming events in various cities the listings are created by users who post events as they hear about them users also can post their profiles on the site along with comments and photos networks of friends can check each others profiles to see who is interested in which events mr baio started the site in and in its early days it included pages for los angeles san francisco and san jose calif as well as general pages for the states from there the site grew on its own as users posted events in countries the site lists thousands of events but users can filter them by checking recommendations from friends or by searching for unique interests it also has a list of the most popular events by city upcoming orgs rapid expansion drew the interest of yahoo inc which acquired the site in october yahoo declined to say how many people are using the site but it said the number of users has tripled from a year ago and the number of events on the site doubles every six months justin foster started using upcoming org to find shows featuring techno and house music in the san francisco area the year old web designer kept seeing the same people at these events and eventually used the web site to connect with them "the nice thing is the listings but the group dynamic makes it much more valuable " says mr foster a similar site heyletsgo com was launched in september with a focus on boston area activities and has expanded into new york and san francisco like upcoming org it offers a list of local events and allows people to post their profiles and discuss the listed activities roughly people have visited the site and there are more than registered members in boston says heyletsgo inc chief executive evan schumacher the number of registered users is growing by about each month he says mr schumacher says heyletsgo targets people who are looking for a social site with a real life connection "this isnt about spending hours a day on the web site " he says "its about checking in it and getting out we want to help people expand their social life " mr cheng is a reporter for dow jones newswires in
