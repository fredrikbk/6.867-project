today wsj com subscribers can see more of mr viness picks at wsj com reports reply all is web another bubble hundreds of internet companies have emerged since the dot com crash looking to capitalize on a resurgent online advertising market and venture capitalists are pumping money into the new crop &# million in the first nine months of according to research firm ventureone which is a unit of dow jones &amp co publisher of this newspaper so is this another bubble the wall street journal online invited two venture capitalists to debate the topic todd dagres spent nearly a decade at battery ventures before starting spark capital last year david hornik a partner at august capital and a former silicon valley attorney writes the popular ventureblog mr dagres web is a bubble for three reasons there is far too much money chasing web deals too much money means too many companies getting funded at higher valuations there are virtually no barriers to entry in web and therefore the ability to develop a unique solution and sustain a competitive advantage is virtually nil therefore its difficult for web companies to build long term value there is very little liquidity in the market for web companies mr hornik i do not believe that the existence of too much venture capital money chasing too few interesting ideas constitutes a bubble the web bubble inflated because the public markets were willing to bet on unproven ideas public markets are ill suited to evaluating such risks on the other hand the venture capital community exists precisely to take on that risk while many web companies will fail they will not likely fail in significantly greater proportions than has been the case with other venture investments historically so it is hard to imagine how this so called bubble will overinflate venture capitalists will rationally stop investing in ideas that dont bear fruit online today wsj com subscribers can read more of the debate on web at wsj com reports
