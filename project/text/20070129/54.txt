peoples investment company for wall street the big news out of china this month is that the country will "actively explore and expand the channels and methods for using foreign exchange reserves " the communist party might hive off a big chunk of its &# trillion stash and invest abroad on behalf of its citizens a la singapores government investment corporation that may be a boon for bankers but its not necessarily a smart idea for china this is yet another scene in the partys balancing act between economic liberalization and state control chinas exchange rate policy the catalyst for its huge foreign exchange reserves is at the heart of the debate by more or less pegging the renminbi to the dollar beijing accumulates foreign exchange reserves when it mops up the incoming greenbacks the policy has spurred an enormous boom giving chinese and foreigners the confidence to invest without worrying about price volatility this has also bought time for china to reform its broken financial sector a task thats far from finished at the same financial conference at which the government investment idea was floated premier wen jiabao kicked off the reform of the agricultural bank of china more than half of whose loan portfolio is rumored to be non performing it will take perhaps &# billion or more to bail it out so why hive off foreign exchange reserves into a singapore style fund for one chinas policymakers may be frustrated that their efforts to encourage money to flow abroad arent working quickly enough to offset the tide of incoming capital the so called qualified domestic investor initiative scheme which lets chinese investors buy bonds abroad has attracted only a few billion dollars so far but there are good reasons for that today chinese investors see better prospects at home the shanghai stock market is up more than over the past months and property prices are still healthy chinese investors probably arent turned on by buying u s treasury bonds if the party were serious about opening their capital markets theyd let investors buy general electric on the new york stock exchange or a vacation home in thailand its more likely that beijing likes the gic like setup because it would keep the partys hands on the money singapores fund hasnt released public accounts since its founding in its stated total under management at &# billion hasnt changed in years but at least singapore has a reputation for clean governance the same cant be said of chinas bureaucracy beijings policymakers could also make political hay domestically by telling citizens that they will get more return for their renminbi which could then be invested in say education or health care this is the "negative carry" argument the idea that foreign investors are receiving double digit returns on their dollars while chinas central bank receives single digit returns when it invests renminbi in u s t bills but thats not the way it really works foreign exchange reserves are liabilities on a central banks balance sheet not found money up to a certain point reserves assure foreign investors that a country has ammunition to fight an attack on its currency such as during the financial crisis once reserves accumulate beyond that point more fundamental questions about government policy have to be raised instead of creating an opaque government institution to manage reserves china would do better to tackle the root problem the need for more capital freedom
