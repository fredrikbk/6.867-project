a long stretch of steady rates some say fed could go all year without changing targets and that may be good for stocks there isnt much that moves the market like a shift in interest rates by federal reserve policy makers this year it is beginning to look like the fed wont move much as central bank rate setters prepare for their first meeting of the year this week investors increasingly are resigned to a longer pause in rate moves than previously expected yet it might be that it is the pause that refreshes in recent years the stock market usually has performed well when the fed declines to move up or down as it has since last summer some wall street forecasters say the fed could go all year without changing its rate targets a prospect that contributed to the markets sluggishness last week such predictions run counter to many investors hopes for a quick rate cut which would lower borrowing costs and encourage more consumption throughout the u s economy potentially helping corporate profits and thus stocks there is a lingering risk that stocks latest rally may already have run its course the dow jones industrial average is up since the fed last changed its benchmark rate raising it a quarter percentage point in late june to many analysts believe the market is likely to remain especially volatile in the weeks ahead as investors rejigger their bets to reflect new rate expectations the main reason for bulls overall optimism is that as fourth quarter reports roll in corporate profits seem to be doing just fine even without fed action wall street expects profits at companies in the standard &amp poors stock index to rise by more than for the quarter a slower pace than in the previous few years boom but still solid growth by historical standards "theres a growing sense among investors that if the economy is ok then profits will be ok so i dont really need the fed to step in and help me" with lower rates to spur economic growth says strategist jack caffrey of j p morgan private bank mr caffrey says his firm still expects a rate cut this year perhaps during the summer if unemployment creeps higher but that timetable has been pushed back from earlier estimates of a spring rate cut "the data just werent supporting that idea " mr caffrey says many analysts say the labor departments better than expected report on december payroll growth released jan set off hand wringing among investors that the economy might not be slowing enough to justify a rate cut since that report came out the dow jones industrial average has floundered off despite touching several new records last week as investors continued to shift their rate related bets the blue chip average fell points or to up just this year the broad standard &amp poors stock index also slipped last week off points to up on the year the technology heavy nasdaq composite index fell or points to up on the year the feds rate committee will meet tomorrow and wednesday with a rate decision due wednesday afternoon futures contracts tracking the likelihood of a fed move recently have reflected a chance the central bank will leave its rate target unchanged with only a chance of a quarter point cut ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers has been telling reporters since mid december that he expects no rate move from the fed in if anything he now says there is some risk the fed may raise rates this year if the current supply of relatively cheap money throughout the global financial system begins to translate into more inflation in the u s "i dont understand why some strategists are rooting for rate cuts " says mr harris "to me a cut would tell you the fed is quite worried about the economy the things that would get them to reach that decision would not be a good environment for stocks " if the fed does indeed keep rates unchanged all year it would constitute the longest pause since the late s in the midst of the dot com boom going back to the s&amp p index has risen an average during fed pauses not including the current one according to research firm thomson financial mike thompson director of research at thomson financial says the key difference between the market now and during the late s is that the market value of stocks relative to their expected earnings hasnt skyrocketed to unusual levels as it did during the bubble that comparison should bode well for the market in the months ahead explaining the more fundamental reason that flat rates might help stocks is trickier one possibility mr thompson says is that investors might like fed pauses for similar reasons to why they tend to like the white house and congress to be controlled by different political parties the common wisdom on wall street is that if the government is divided it is more likely to result in legislative gridlock which cuts down on the chance that congress will do something to hurt business likewise mr thompson says if investors know the fed is going to be on pause maybe they grow confident that the central bank wont "overshoot" on its rate targets and set off runaway inflation or even worse a recession like lehmans mr harris mr thompson expects the fed to keep its rate targets unchanged throughout "for them to move it would take some economic report to come in really really bad below what everyone is expecting " says mr thompson "its hard to see what that would be "
