schumers tort epiphany write about politics long enough and you come to think youve seen everything but even we didnt expect to see a leading senate democrat declare that tort law abuse is making america less economically competitive has chuck schumer told his colleagues about his epiphany mr schumer was knocked off his horse last week on the way to a press conference with governor eliot spitzer and new york city mayor mike bloomberg to discuss the ways that regulation is driving financial business from u s shores governor spitzers presence was so ironic that even he not famous for his self deprecation had to joke about it but the really big news is that mr schumer endorsed a study declaring that tort reform is the single biggest key to retaining u s leadership in global finance as political conversions go this is like dick cheney endorsing a stronger congress mr schumer is chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee which puts him at the center of fundraising for democratic candidates and trial lawyers have been a leading and deep pocketed constituency for democrats donating millions of dollars in each election cycle over the last decade more than of trial lawyer donations have gone to democrats in return the democratic senate caucus has been a bulwark against tort reform senator schumer himself has a mixed voting record on reform as a representative he voted for the securities litigation reform act in but he opposed an attempt to go further in the next congress as a senator hes voted against asbestos litigation reform and class action reform but as the mckinsey report commissioned by messrs schumer and bloomberg notes settlements of securities class actions have been rising every year for years in the total bill hit &# billion and that number excludes &# billion in worldcom related settlements alone apart from some &# billion in enron related settlements the bill for is expected to be somewhat lower according to the mckinsey study but then most stocks had a good year and securities lawsuits always thrive in a difficult market both the mckinsey report and last years interim report from the privately funded committee on capital market regulation reach the same conclusion concern about an unpredictable and expensive legal lottery is a major impediment to listing securities in the u s the mckinsey report relates that among the executives surveyed litigation risk ranked second in importance in deciding where to do business after the availability of qualified workers the cmr report released last november put it this way "foreign companies commonly cite the u s enforcement system as the most important reason why they do not want to list in the u s market " and a big part of "enforcement" in the u s is private litigation that report also points out that securities class actions are unknown in most of the international money centers competing with the u s for financial business mr schumer argued at tuesdays press conference that a number of the reports recommendations could be handled "administratively " through rule makings and the like by the sec but this is whistling past the tort graveyard sarbanes oxley has already laid the seeds for the next big round of shareholder lawsuits by creating a number of new causes of action against companies that misbehave the true costs of those provisions have yet to be tested for the simple reason that it will take a recession or a stock market correction to trigger the next round of attempts to turn corporate miscalculations into income redistribution opportunities so far this ticking bomb inside sarbox has received little notice compared to the very real costs of compliance with section on internal controls but we can expect to hear more about it after the first wave of sarbox lawsuits starts hitting the papers until that happens the current consensus that sarbox is tolerable and the sec merely has to enforce it more sensibly will remain the conventional wisdom senator schumer was silent on the prospects for tort reform which will be the real test of his sincerity as a new yorker mr schumer has been hearing a good deal from wall street on this and we hope his press conference isnt just a constituency massage he shouldnt be able to have it both ways by holding press conferences in new york city then returning to washington and winking to tommy boggs harry reid and the tort lobby that its all merely talk if his conversion is real we look forward to his energetic leadership in building a bipartisan majority for tort reform see related letter "letters to the editor insurers support schumers reform" wsj feb
