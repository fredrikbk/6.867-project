telecommunications browsing barriers consumers can use their cellphones to surf the web why arent they cellphones are everywhere internet surfing is pandemic so why is surfing the web by cellphone still a backwater web enabled cellphones let customers check email check stock prices and book flights among other things they allow users to tap into the internet in places where they cant access wi fi on their laptops but among u s consumers mobile web use has yet to take off although of todays cellphones come with web browsing capabilities and more than million people owned such phones in october only of these customers used their browsers to surf the internet that month a small percentage compared with the number of web enabled devices in the market according to seattle based research firm m metrics inc "its still not a mainstream application " says jaimee minney a senior manager at m metrics major tasks still face handset makers service providers and web programmers alike mobile devices with bigger screens more powerful processors more memory and the ability to bridge gaps in web programming are seen as key carriers for their part need to allow easier access to the internet outside what the industry refers to as the "walled garden" carrier sponsored pages that typically feature personalized capabilities for visitors and lead to other content from the provider service providers also need to educate consumers more about data plans and pricing many customers for instance still dont realize their devices can access the web others wont try it because they find it hard to predict the cost handset makers are perhaps the most visible force working to encourage mobile internet use and surprisingly its a cellphone newcomer that for the moment at least is making the most waves wireless experts think that apple inc s iphone is a definite boost for mobile browsing "the iphone dramatically raises the bar for mobile phone web surfing with a full pc class web browser on a wide screen and high resolution display " says avi greengart an analyst at current analysis inc who got a look at a prototype at the macworld conference in san francisco earlier this month "the only knock on it is the lack of g " mr greengart says referring to the phones incompatibility with high speed third generation data networks the iphone is designed for use in wireless hot spots or on slower networks that use edge a technology created for gsm phones "when youre out of a hot spot " says mr greengart "youll have a gorgeous device but youll be stuck surfing at edge speeds " apple declined to comment on the iphones technical specifications for this article the iphone and other late model handsets are giving mobile customers access to more of the web than in the past by equipping their browsers with full hypertext markup language the programming code used in web pages sony ericsson mobile communications ab meanwhile has gone a step further making phones with browsers that also support a new web programming language extensible hypertext markup language or xhtml this code allows sites to recognize whether a browser is mobile or pc based and to automatically format their pages and contents accordingly formerly sites that wanted to offer mobile and pc access had to be programmed with both html and wireless application protocol or wap xhtml by contrast does the job with just one code saving time and money the new language has been chosen as the next industry standard for web design but relatively few web sites have adopted it so far while programming code issues are key what the consumer experiences directly is the mobile browser and its user interface and handset makers are focused on making the experience as much like a pc browser as possible while also playing to the strengths of the wireless medium like a desktop browser the latest sony ericsson models feature back and forward buttons that reveal previously visited web pages you can bookmark favorite web sites but you can also send your bookmarks to other cellphones using bluetooth sms or infrared last year too the company released the cyber shot k phone which it claims is the first handset on the market to give users the tools to create a blog including shooting and uploading photographs in an alliance with google inc s blogger web site finland based nokia corp s mobile browsing software dubbed s shares certain features with the sony ericsson phones the s software installed in nokias n series phones and devices of some other makers reproduces standard web pages in miniature for the small screen then users zoom in on the parts that interest them a floating toolbar provides commands familiar to pc browser users but the nokia software has unique features as well like the smart text fit tool which resizes lines of text to fit the margins of the cellphone screen generally nokias browser software tries to keep the experience "as desktop like as possible by keeping the original design of the web page intact " says craig cumberland a nokia spokesperson the vast majority of mobile browsers dont reproduce standard web pages well because of the screen size difference mr cumberland says "you lose some of the content from the page and the richness and familiarity of the web experience to the end user " other limitations can be even more vexing mr greengart the current analysis analyst points out that currently no cellphone browsers support such widely used web plug ins as activex or embedded flash tools required for various controls animation video and music on some of the webs most popular sites without flash for example you cant watch videos posted on youtube com or myspace com pages mr greengart says apple informed him the iphone browser will have a plug in for flash when it is released in june though he says flash was not installed on the prototype he tested at macworld nokia and sony ericsson say they are working with adobe systems inc the maker of flash to resolve the problem on its browsers meanwhile the lack of a plug in doesnt consign a device to the junkheap nor prevent its user from accessing a popular web site completely the sidekick from t mobile usa inc comes with an html web browser a larger screen than most handsets and a faster processor and while it doesnt support flash the sidekick does support javascript another tool used on social networking sites t mobile says more than of all web page views on the sidekick are of myspace com independent browser developers too are caught up in efforts to encourage more mobile surfing norway based opera software asa has launched opera mini which uses a remote server to compress web pages by as much as before sending them to a phone this speeds up browsing and makes it less expensive by using fewer minutes nine carriers world wide use opera mini including t mobile which has preinstalled the software in select devices the browser can also be downloaded free from operas web site using any phone that supports java unless the phone is locked by the carrier to access only restricted sites and services the carriers know speed and convenience are key to encouraging more traffic and are investing millions of dollars in new networks and devices so that web pages will load faster on mobile devices sprint nextel corp launched a high speed wireless ev do network in to widen mobile web access and speed up data rates nevertheless phones supplied by the carriers can still make it difficult for a typical user to find his or her way to the open web mr greengart says that on some new phones offered by verizon wireless one push of a button takes users to the verizon wireless mobile web portal but with another the lg env to go to a site on the open web users must press a button that says "get it now" and click on "news and info" just to bring up the browser then by pressing the "menu" key a list of options opens up with "go to url" the fourth listed a url is a web site address a spokesman for verizon wireless a unit of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc says while its phones do use menus listing verizons mobile sites such as news weather sports and entertainment you can put any url in the browser window and go there if the site is wap enabled "thats always been the case for our mobile web service as open as it can be " says jeffrey nelson verizons spokesperson similarly when cingular wireless customers access the internet they see the companys mobile home page first but a spokeswoman says they can access any wap enabled web site all of the carriers are placing a big emphasis on customization and convenience cingular a unit of at&amp t inc provides weather reports based on a phones billing zip code t mobile is testing a location based search tool that lets users find the nearest restaurant or atm without having to manually enter the street name or zip code even with the efforts under way experts say that mobile internet surfing in the u s is still years away from catching up to europe and asia where faster networks are more widespread "in some countries " says jupiterresearch inc analyst julie ask mobile browsing "will be the primary way in which people access the internet " mr ali is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau he can be reached at sarmad ali wsj com
