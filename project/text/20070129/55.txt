phelpss prize the nobel prize lectures given last month by the economics and the peace laureates strikingly emphasized entrepreneurship but the kinds of entrepreneurship espoused by the laureates are profoundly different the economist edmund phelpss lecture highlights the contribution of entrepreneurial individuals firms and financiers in transforming stagnant societies dominated by small business owners into dynamic economies with large and highly productive commercial enterprise mr phelpss celebration of modern capitalistic entrepreneurship is to say the least unusual of the winners of the nobel in economics did not utter the word "entrepreneur" or "entrepreneurship" in their lectures mr phelpss lecture has mentions more than the total over the previous years moreover when the typical economic theorist uses the word entrepreneur it is often a short hand for a big blue like computer that unfailingly makes the right choices in contrast mr phelpss entrepreneurs like those of friedrich hayek and frank knight undertake innovations in a dynamic and highly uncertain world they play a "human role over a vast range of activities involving management judgment insight intuition and creativity " this entrepreneurial activity says mr phelps has not only produced great material prosperity in the economies where it has flourished but also represents the essence of a "good life " full of "stimulation challenge engagement discovery and personal development " none of this is possible in a stagnant society where individuals are assigned fixed tasks the nobel peace prize winner mohammad yunus also lauds entrepreneurship his lecture mentions entrepreneurs or entrepreneurship an unprecedented six times mr yunus observes that the grameen bank which he started in has made seven million microloans in bangladesh for housing education and micro enterprise the bank has turned borrowers from "begging to business " looking ahead mr yunus envisions a new "social stock market" for investors who will support the mass proliferation of microloans and to "defining entrepreneur in a broader way so that we can change the character of capitalism radically " mr yunuss ameliorative entrepreneurship however is very different from the transformative entrepreneurship that mr phelps argues has been central to modern capitalism indeed most of the ventures funded by microloans in bangladesh are activities that were marginalized by modern entrepreneurs they dont involve any economies of scale or scope or the use of new technologies capable of producing significant advances in overall productivity and incomes economic development does wonders for peace but what does microfinanced entrepreneurship really do for economic development can turning more beggars into basket weavers make bangladesh less of a well basket case a few small port cities or petro states aside there is no historical precedent for sustained improvements in living standards without broad based modernization and widespread improvements in productivity brought about by the dynamic entrepreneurship that mr phelps celebrates in principle microfinance does not preclude modern entrepreneurship but in practice we wonder if the romantic charm of the former might distract governments in impoverished countries from undertaking reforms needed to foster the latter the poverty of countries like bangladesh derives from their comprehensive backwardness bad roads illiteracy inadequate health care unsound banks porous tax collection systems disorganized land records corrupt policemen and so on simple policy changes such as lowering import tariffs are a good start still the problems wont disappear with a stroke of a pen they require a change in deeply embedded attitudes but governments in fragile states have only so much political capital and capacity so it is crucial to proceed in a disciplined sequence identify the worst impediments overcome them and move on to the next lot micro enterprise may well help those left behind in economies that are already advanced help themselves the inner cities in the u s may derive great benefit from mr yunuss innovations but chasing will o the wisps instead of tackling the first order causes of backwardness is probably not a winning strategy for countries like bangladesh that country has in fact made some economic progress in recent years most notably through the growth of an export oriented garment industry although the few thousand firms in the industry are smaller and less efficient than their chinese counterparts they are larger and more productive than individual craftsmen microfinanced or not the not quite miraculous growth in bangladesh has followed rather modest reforms what might have been achieved with more vigorous modernization consider the case of vietnam now one of the fastest growing economies in asia in the country started a transition to an open economy ongoing reforms that fostered a new class of modern entrepreneurs not microlending to marginal businesses helped cut poverty in vietnam by half in the s surely the countrys unsung and possibly uncharismatic policy makers also deserve a prize mr bhide is a professor at columbia business school mr schramm is president of the kauffman foundation
