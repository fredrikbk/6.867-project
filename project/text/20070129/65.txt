sec discovers breaches in lending of securities securities and exchange commission examinations of mutual funds securities lending practices an obscure but fast growing side business for fund companies found that some firms werent following proper procedures when lending their securities plus directors had failed to oversee the practice properly a senior agency official says among the problems the sec found were instances of the appearance that units of mutual fund companies that were paid to help their funds lend securities may have tilted the bidding process in which they had been awarded the middleman role by a funds board because of those shortcomings and others the sec staff sent a series of so called deficiency letters last month to warn the funds that the agencys staff had found compliance breaches needing correction funds lend some of the stocks or bonds they own in exchange for interest payments and collateral which provides additional returns for fund investors the practice isnt new but the explosion of hedge funds engaged in so called short selling has led demand for borrowed securities to skyrocket that is because when a hedge fund or any investor enters a short sale betting a stock will fall they are selling a stock they have borrowed in hopes of buying it at a lower price later replacing the borrowed shares and pocketing the difference lending occurs through an agent that finds brokerages needing to borrow the securities the agent takes a split of the money earned off the lending from to depending on the situation the sec staff issues guidelines that funds must follow when setting up securities lending agreements the requirements are stiffened when the fund is considering doing its lending securities through an agent affiliated with the fund management company in the sec requested information from funds about their securities lending practices in just about every circumstance where the funds lent securities though an affiliated agent the sec found problems when an affiliated agent was involved "directors in pretty much all of the funds we looked at were not adequately overseeing the securities lending of the funds " gene gohlke associate director of the secs office of compliance inspection and examinations said in a speech thursday mr gohlke didnt specify how many funds were queried in the sweep saying in an interview that it was kept to the "single digits" because the exams were very labor intensive when the funds as required by the sec sought bids during the process of hiring a lending agent the sec found situations that were "rife with conflicts of interest " mr gohlke told a conference hosted by the mutual funds directors forum as required by the sec staff when the funds were considering hiring an arm of the adviser to be its lending agent they sought bids from nonaffiliated companies however the fund boards typically had the advisers oversee the search rather than say an independent consultant unknown to the fund boards it appeared the advisers would wait until they had the outside bids in hand before the affiliated agent presented its own proposal raising questions about the bidding process mr gohlke said
