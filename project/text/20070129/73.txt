squaring off warning what kind of federal consumer notification law is needed in case of a data security breach it depends on whom you ask someone walks off with a laptop containing the names and social security numbers of million veterans identity thieves set up fake accounts to gather personal records on people from data broker choicepoint inc similar albeit smaller data breaches have become commonplace in the past two years in response at least states have adopted laws requiring companies or agencies to notify anyone whose personal information has potentially been exposed to unauthorized outsiders but efforts to pass a federal notification law have stalled over disagreements between consumer and industry groups consumer advocates argue that any federal law needs to leave room for states to adopt stricter notification rules if they wish meanwhile financial services firms and computer and data brokerage companies insist any new legislation needs to override state laws they argue that the patchwork of laws places unnecessary burdens on organizations that experience a breach so what kind of law should congress pass when it takes up the issue as expected this year the wall street journal invited gail hillebrand a senior attorney in the san francisco office of consumers union to debate the issue with oliver ireland a washington based partner with law firm morrison &amp foerster who has represented the financial services industry before congress on this topic an edited version of their email discussion follows ms hillebrand consumers deserve to know about data security breaches congress should pass a strong no loophole notice of security breach law and should also enact restrictions on social security number use and sale and a consumer friendly security freeze which lets people block businesses from seeing their credit report or score thereby blocking identity thieves from opening new accounts with stolen data congress also should leave room for further state protections data is stolen because it has value a thief with your name and social security number can open new credit accounts in your name ruining your credit and setting you up for hours of frustrating steps to restore your credit record a thief with the right information from your debit card can drain your family bank account in seconds in the past two years more than states have passed laws requiring notice of security breaches and a total of states now give consumers the ultimate tool to stop false new accounts for credit goods and services the security freeze as congress acts this year it should enhance not reduce these consumer rights and it should leave room for states to respond to new forms of theft in the future mr ireland first i agree with gail that data about individuals is valuable and needs to be protected from identity thieves i also agree that a federal bill could be the best solution the current situation with over different state laws on security breach notification is difficult at best in practice because companies generally do not want to treat consumers who live in different states differently the laws of the state with the broadest requirements dictate how consumers who live in other states will be treated for example states that believe notices about breaches should be provided to consumers even where there is no risk to the consumer tend to overrule the laws of states that decided that notices should only be given when the consumer is at risk an appropriate uniform federal standard could solve this problem however such a federal standard needs to pre empt state laws in this area in order to avoid further inconsistencies with respect to a federal security freeze law i believe that some more thinking needs to be done in this area our goal should be to protect consumers from identity theft while not interfering with their ability to get credit insurance or employment or to engage in other transactions consumers would have to lift a freeze in order to let lenders access their credit information again i am skeptical that a security freeze law is the best way to accomplish this goal ms hillebrand the fact that more than states have passed notice of security breach laws illustrates the ability of states to respond quickly to changing developments oliver is correct that consumers nationwide are getting notice now under the stronger of the state standards but this makes it important that congress not water down those standards strong notice is valuable for more than the information it provides to individuals notice requirements can also encourage companies and government agencies to invest in better technology staff training and monitoring to avoid or minimize future security breaches mr ireland for a number of reasons i think that we are going down the wrong track if we think that a primary purpose of notice is to provide an incentive for tighter security first consumers need to understand the significance of notices notice to consumers of a security breach should only be required where the consumer needs to do something to protect against fraud such as check his or her credit report or monitor his or her account statements if notices are provided in circumstances where consumers do not need to act consumers will ultimately conclude that the notices are not important and then ignore the one notice that he or she needs to act on providing notices and responding to customers inquiries about notices also costs money that would be better spent on information security if companies need stronger incentives to provide adequate security there are more direct ways of providing those incentives ms hillebrand we need both strong notice and better security standards oliver suggests preconditioning notice on whether the consumer needs to take action but consumers should be allowed to decide that for themselves after getting the notice instead of having the company or government agency who failed to protect sensitive data decide that the individual doesnt even need to know about it another significant problem with preconditioning notice on a prediction about risk or need for action is that many data breaches will fall in an in between category where there just isnt enough information to evaluate the potential risk at the time the breach is discovered this would deprive consumers of timely information about a security breach in one of the most common circumstances mr ireland while i am usually a strong believer in individual choice and self determination as a practical matter in the area of security breaches i dont think that the idea that consumers will be notified about all security breaches and then be able to make informed choices about how to proceed is realistic many cases often involve complex judgments about what has happened and the risks that are involved lets say a laptop with personal information on it is lost then returned is there a risk involved it depends on the opportunity that an unauthorized person had to access the information computer forensic analysis to determine what if any information was accessed and professional judgments about the credibility of the individuals involved notices to individuals cannot convey all of this information in anything other than a conclusory way therefore i think that it is unrealistic to think that consumers are in a position to make informed decisions based on these notices ms hillebrand i have a little more trust in the ability of consumers to make choices for themselves such as the choice of how to respond to a notice of security breach mr ireland i think that this discussion highlights the tension between increasingly national financial markets and the historic role of the states as protectors of their own citizens in todays national markets individual state laws increasingly tend to affect how services are delivered in other states the line where individual state interests should give way to overall economic efficiency is not likely to be fully resolved anytime soon
