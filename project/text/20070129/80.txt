technology a special report open doors web sites are making it easier for users to contribute their own content that makes it easier for hackers too in july gena miller started getting amusing phone calls from friends they wanted to know about the message she had posted on myspace com about her one night stand ms miller a year old from northridge calif didnt recall a one night stand however she had a boyfriend and a new job at a human rights organization that kept her busy but when she logged into her account at myspace the social networking web site owned by news corp she found that someone had indeed posted a public "bulletin" from her account with a link that promised tantalizingly to lead to photos and everyone on ms millers list of online friends could see it ms miller soon realized that she had been the victim of a new kind of cyberattack one that takes advantage of the features that make sites like myspace and others so popular such sites have developed a strong community of users by making it easy for them to contribute their own content users can create personalized web pages by posting images videos and even pieces of basic software code to change aspects of the page like its color the sites also let users send messages to each other sometimes in the form of public bulletins that show up on the pages of others but that openness is starting to create a security issue for the web sites since that content is coming from outside sources its not all necessarily reliable or safe some of it could be the work of hackers and others trying to spread viruses or steal personal information the trickery usually in the form of links or computer code can go undetected by most users until its too late and because the content is found in sites that users tend to regard as trustworthy many people arent inclined to be suspicious "our average user will say im safe because i dont go to porn sites or respond to spam emails but if they go to say amazon com its hard for them to distinguish between amazon content and user generated content " says dan nadir vice president of product strategy at scansafe inc a san mateo calif start up that sells a service that helps companies stop viruses from reaching their network through the web experts say the risk of the scams is still small but is expected to grow while many sites may be reluctant to impose stricter rules about content worrying that such a move would drive away their community of users some say they are starting to find ways to scan for and quickly stop any problems myspace google inc ebay inc and wikimedia foundation inc s wikipedia com are among the sites that have been targeted by these types of scams in the past year in november wikipedia com the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit by clicking on a tab and typing in an online form faced an attack from a hacker who created a fake entry about a supposed new kind of virus that targeted microsoft corp software in it the hacker included a link to a web site where people supposedly could download software to protect themselves from the virus instead the link sent them to a malicious site that downloaded a virus to their computers fortunately a wikipedia user removed the bad link from the article within one minute of its appearance says jimmy wales wikipedias founder but the hackers found a way around that by pointing victims to an older version of the entry that included the link wikipedia preserves old entries in a "history" section it took a while mr wales doesnt know how long for a wikipedia administrator in germany to remove the link from all the older versions of the entry too mr wales says while he hasnt received any reports from people who fell victim to the scam he assumes that some did "in a strange way this incident was a validation of the publics growing trust in user generated content " mr wales says "the virus authors knew if they could trick people into thinking that something came from wikipedia it would be safe to install " mr wales says wikipedia users will likely respond to such incidents by taking care to remove bad links in all versions of an entry including the old ones but he says he isnt implementing any top down changes "the community just takes care of it " mr wales says adding that if he himself were to become involved in every wikipedia decision "nothing would get done " the security breach at myspace involving ms miller occurred after she clicked on a link in a bulletin that appeared to be from a friend the link directed her to a web page that looked like a myspace log in page but was in fact a spoofed page that was meant to steal her password when she entered her personal information someone was able to steal her name and password and log into her account to post the bulletin about the one night stand whats more if her friends clicked on the link on the bulletin they would be taken to the same spoofed page where their information could be stolen as well "i remembered hearing about it and thinking that people that click on those links are stupid " she says "then it happened to me " ms miller says she now changes her password regularly and avoids clicking on strange links to combat such security issues last may myspace recruited hemanshu nigam microsofts former director of consumer security outreach to become its chief security officer in recent months mr nigam has hired more engineers and consultants dedicated to tackling security issues and is training engineers to write more secure software mr nigam says he also has created a more standardized procedure for responding to security issues in the past myspace responded to incidents on a case by case basis with no standard process for dealing with them now the company sends a group of employees to analyze the problem find out which users have been affected tell victims how they should respond find any web addresses that have been set up to steal users personal information and work with law enforcement officials to catch the culprits mr nigam declined to say how many security issues involving user generated content myspace has encountered so far another security threat involves posting pieces of software code directly onto a web page a method known as cross site scripting in april for instance the u s computer emergency readiness team a government organization known for short as us cert posted a warning about an ebay feature that allows sellers to incorporate a certain kind of programming code into the pages where they describe auction listings to add things like images and other elements to make their listings better looking and more informative according to the warning an attacker could use that code to redirect ebay users to a malicious web page the page might appear to be a legitimate ebay page requesting personal information but would actually be a spoofed page meant to steal passwords credit card numbers or other personal information an ebay spokesman says the company uses what it calls "scrubber" technology to scour each listing for pieces of code known to be malicious brand new unknown threats can sometimes make it onto the site he says and they have tricked some users into giving up information but the spokesman adds that ebay usually removes them within hours or days of finding out about them while such threats are nascent security experts expect them to get worse so some firms already are lining up to help online companies that have user generated content bulk up their security steve munford chief executive of u k computer security firm sophos plc says that in the past nine months sites that accept user generated content have approached his company about partnerships in which sophos would scan material posted on those sites for security problems like viruses he declined to say how many and which sites are working with sophos or to discuss its relationship with these clients mr munford compares web companies realization that they need to address security risks for their users to a similar change in thinking that took place at email providers in the early days email companies often left it to consumers to buy their own spam filtering software to weed out unwanted email but as spam became a bigger problem about four years ago internet service providers started including free spam filters in their web based email services he expects a similar evolution at the new wave of internet companies as security problems become more widespread web companies like myspace and google mr munford says "have the responsibility to make sure theyre not the conduit for malicious code " ms vara is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be reached at vauhini vara wsj com
