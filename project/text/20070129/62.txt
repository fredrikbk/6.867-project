power producers rush to secure nuclear sites first to develop plans could tap &# billion in federal subsidies with the u s on the verge of building a new generation of nuclear power plants potential owners are racing to identify and lock down the best sites in order to secure billions of dollars in federal subsidies pledged to first comers their efforts will test local and national attitudes more than two decades after nuclear accidents made headlines they also represent a considerable financial gamble for the utility industry which is moving ahead at a rapid pace despite uncertainty ranging from environmental opposition to finding a home for radioactive nuclear waste in one case the zeal to secure a promising site has resulted in a nasty legal battle a flood of applications seeking permission to build at least reactors primarily in the south is expected to pour into the nuclear regulatory commission beginning late this year if built the reactors would boost the nations electricity supply by more than megawatts or a megawatt is enough to power at least homes under recent legislation intended to jump start development congress is dangling more than &# billion worth of subsidies plus loan guarantees in front of the first few plants that get built practically speaking companies must apply to the nrc this year or next to qualify for the special assistance a process that can cost &# million apiece "its like a horse race " says adrian heymer senior director of new plant development at the nuclear energy institute a washington d c based trade organization "most companies are striving to submit applications as fast as they can " at root is a sea change in views over nuclear power from to spooked by skyrocketing costs high interest rates and accidents in at the three mile island plant in pennsylvania and in at chernobyl in the former soviet union utilities canceled nuclear projects in the u s nuclear power currently makes up about of the nations electricity supply compared with about from coal from u s reactors but in a time of rising concern over price stability dependence on foreign sources and global warming nuclear power is on the cusp of a return it doesnt rely on fossil fuels in tight supply or located in politically troublesome countries unlike coal use of nuclear fuel doesnt create air pollution or carbon dioxide blamed for global warming earlier this month president bush in his state of the union address encouraged "safe clean" nuclear power some existing plants have been getting license extensions from the federal government to keep them running but the industry argues that aging plants eventually will need to be replaced still theres no certainty the industry will build plants despite the money being spent on the effort development of the federal governments waste depository at yucca mountain nev is behind schedule and could still face political opposition spent fuel is being stored at power plant sites a situation never intended to be permanent utilities are worried about the waste disposal problem and construction costs which spiraled out of control once before meanwhile opposition is gathering the advocacy organization public citizen criticizes the "nuclear relapse" under way and asks opponents near proposed plants to "let us know how youd like to help" block construction utilities expect some opposition but hope nuclear powers spruced up image as a carbon free resource will win over environmentalists even the biggest and most profitable nuclear operators are avoiding regions where public sentiment is unpredictable big nuclear operator exelon corp is "sniffing around for a site in texas " says john rowe chairman and chief executive of the chicago based utility company he says new jersey could use more nuclear capacity but hes "not sure the citizenry is ready for it yet" so hes steering clear california prohibits nuclear development until theres a federal waste repository so far the industry is focusing efforts almost exclusively on the south where plant operators think acceptance of nuclear power never flagged and where local officials welcome the economic stimulus of multibillion dollar projects applications will focus on sites utilities are confident will pass muster at the nuclear regulatory commission locations that are adjacent to existing nuclear units or that were previously approved for nuclear development that never occurred baltimore based constellation energy inc has publicly identified two sites for development the calvert cliffs plant in maryland and a notable exception to the southern concentration of the new sites the nine mile point plant in upstate new york constellation is willing to chance receptivity because "we already operate there so we think we can make it happen " says tracy imm constellation spokeswoman the plants canceled long ago represented about half of the number of projects originally proposed the cancellations were costly at the time but they created a large inventory of locations now being given a second look utilities in many cases still own the sites for safety security and public relations reasons nuclear plants typically are built in rural areas thus the jobs they create loom larger than they would in cities plants are expected to cost &# billion to &# billion each creating construction jobs once completed a plant needs to workers a consortium of utilities called nustart energy development llc is working with the nrc to speed up and smooth out the application and development process its working on applications for a new plant at entergy corp s grand gulf nuclear site in mississippi using a new general electric co reactor design and at tennessee valley authoritys bellefonte site in alabama using a new reactor design from westinghouse electric co now controlled by a consortium led by japans toshiba corp nustart members constellation duke energy corp edf international entergy exelon fpl group inc progress energy inc scana corp southern co and tva control half the nations nuclear capacity utilities also are pursuing separate projects dominion resources inc is considering its north anna site in virginia and southern is looking at its vogtle site in georgia in each case four units were permitted but only two built "atlanta is expected to double in the next years " says southerns buzz miller senior vice president of nuclear engineering "were going to need a lot of new generation " the imperative to find sites has set off intense jockeying for position in some cases one transaction involving utility operator duke energy has led to lawsuits underscoring the eagerness to secure potential nuclear sites duke announced its intention to pursue nuclear development last march and it identified a acre riverfront tract in cherokee county s c as its top pick it was land duke previously had owned and decades earlier it received permission to build three nuclear reactors there but after investing more than &# million duke canceled the cherokee projects and sold the parcel for &# million in a partnership mark v land and development llc approached duke and other utilities to gauge purchase interest in when duke learned southern had emerged the apparent victor it sued to block the sale the suit was dismissed as groundless mark v in a countersuit accused duke of abuse of process and trying to depress the price duke denies the allegations and the case is headed for jury trial duke and southern now are teaming up to develop the site
