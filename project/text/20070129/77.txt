technology a special report how to protect your private information your life is an open book online it doesnt have to be on the internet " as a new yorker cartoon famously observed "no one knows youre a dog " thanks to the ease of finding personal information online that may be the only thing about you they dont know indeed for anyone who knows where to look your address phone number birth date and more are only a few clicks away dedicated searchers can easily turn up property records unlisted or cellphone numbers and even more sensitive information such as social security credit card and bank account numbers in broward county fla a simple search through pet licenses can in fact tell whether youre a dog or at least whether you have one its enough to make anyone feel exposed do we really want our friends our neighbors our colleagues or any stranger for that matter knowing so much about us do we want them to know even the small stuff where weve lived how much we paid for our house how old we are how they can reach us for many of us the answer is no the semi good news is that our lives dont have to be quite such an easily opened book privacy advocates and professional investigators say people can shield at least some personal information from online snoops "there are things individuals can do " says charles wood an information security consultant in sausalito calif "youre going to have to work on it its going to take some time and were going to have to wait for better laws this isnt something they need to throw their arms up about " the semi not so good news is that it may not be possible to erase completely your online traces many details are contained in public records like voter lists property records and court filings that increasingly are being placed online trying to keep these records private could take more time or money than many people are willing to spend to make sure that these documents cant be used by identity thieves or stalkers privacy advocates are promoting legislation requiring states to remove or block out especially sensitive facts such as social security or bank account numbers that might end up in bankruptcy filings property deeds and other public documents for instance after it was discovered that florida counties had put documents online containing social security numbers including that of gov jeb bush the state adopted a law requiring counties to remove those numbers before posting documents online but such laws may be slow in coming if they come at all and they go after only a small portion of our online tracks what follows is a guide based on recommendations from privacy advocates investigators and others for taking control of ones online information know thyself people vary in how sensitive they are about others being able to see their personal information just as businesses should assess their actual risks before spending time and money on security measures individuals need to do the same before beginning to clean up their online identity some people may not care if some of the personal details of their lives are online or they figure there arent enough details available to worry about for others the risk of identity theft or the desire to limit email spam and other marketing pitches are enough reason to make some effort to get a handle on their online information then there are those people such as high profile executives or celebrities as well as victims of domestic violence and stalkers who may want to take stronger measures to shield their private details from online snoops people "really need to be clear about what they want to achieve and the rest will be a function of that " says mr wood the security consultant know whats out there privacy advocates advise those worried about identity theft to monitor their credit reports regularly the same is true about ones online identity beth givens the director of privacy rights clearinghouse a san diego based advocacy group says most of the consumer complaints her group receives come from people who have suddenly found details about themselves during a routine online search "people are just really shocked that anyone can sit down at a computer" and find personal information ms givens says indeed an "ego search" for ones own name on any of the popular search engines can be an eye popping experience for most people turning up newspaper articles postings to internet discussion groups professional licenses or a passing mention in a friends blog of course any simple search will turn up a lot of other people with the same names especially for those with common names given how widespread it has become to "google" prospective dates the parents of childrens playmates or new neighbors its just as worthwhile to uncover such cases of mistaken identity for instance a recent google search for my own name "michael totty " mostly returned the kind of results expected for a journalist reprints of published articles but it also contained an amazon com profile and "wish list " which i had created for people who know me not for the world to see and it turned up the owner of a private airport in northern arkansas an english worker who was seriously injured during the construction of the channel tunnel and an appeals court ruling from tennessee concerning the case of a michael david totty who was convicted of theft and burglary will people who look me up i wonder think i am the michael totty convicted of theft sometimes a mistaken identity can be as problematic as a stolen identity but a basic search is only a start the web features dozens of sites where you can hunt for personal information about people from addresses and phone numbers to a full background check that covers criminal and sex offender records bankruptcies liens and relatives and associates most of these "people search" sites charge fees for a detailed background check but a surprising amount of personal information can be uncovered at no charge one of the most widely used is two year old zabasearch a free advertising supported site from zaba inc type a name into its simple google like search box narrow the search by state and the site comes back with a list of names and addresses and in many cases phone numbers and year of birth the site also contains paid links to services that provide more detailed background searches for a fee for instance an all state query for "michael totty" turned up listings including my current and previous two addresses and phone numbers and the correct birth year some of the listings werent about me but the site found quite a bit of personal information about me that was accurate the spread of blogs and social networking sites such as myspace com provides a treasure trove of information for snoops and a nightmare for the privacy conscious cynthia hetherington managing director of the corporate strategic intelligence unit of aon corp s consulting practice advises high profile executives on managing their online identities she tells of a job candidate for a wall street investment group who was rejected after recruiters discovered comments on his wifes blog about allegations of sexual harassment at his previous employer cover your tracks it is possible to clean up many of these online traces but it can be a difficult and time consuming task and privacy experts warn theres no assurance that everything will be removed many sites make it possible to have ones name removed from their search results though it usually isnt easy intelius inc bellevue wash will let anyone "opt out" of the companys online people search results by mailing or faxing a letter with the persons name and address as it appears on the site but intelius cautions that the request doesnt remove the persons information from its public records database so the persons information might reappear when intelius refreshes its listing with new records requiring another request for removal "if youre going to ask us to suppress this information we have to make sure youre who you say you are " says ed petersen inteliuss executive vice president of sales and marketing to that end intelius requires anyone requesting removal to verify his or her identity for instance by faxing a copy with the photo blacked out of a drivers license or other government identification us search a unit of first advantage corp in st petersburg fla says on its web site it will make "good faith efforts" to remove personal information when requested but requires that you mail a signed letter complete with full name email and mailing address social security number and other personal details the privacy rights clearinghouse web site contains a comprehensive list of data brokers and their opt out policies while repeatedly removing your name from these sites can become tedious after all it may involve dozens of sites it eventually will pay off "this is a short term fix but when monitored every few months becomes effective in keeping your name out of their search engines " says ms hetherington "getting to this point is a big win for the person who wishes to preserve a little privacy and avoid old college chums theyd sooner forget " at least one service has sprung up to assist people who want to remove their names from these people finder sites mypublicinfo inc in may began offering its identitysweep service which for &# a month will comb about different directory sites for personal information at the consumers request the arlington va company will then fill out all the required opt out forms and will monitor the sites to make sure the information stays removed chris mueller a marketing consultant in northern california signed up for the identitysweep service because she was worried about identity theft since starting the service this spring she has used it to remove her name from a handful of online directories "its one of those sleep a little better at night things " ms mueller says in some cases it pays to go directly to sites to ask that they remove personal or otherwise embarrassing information one of ms hetheringtons clients a rising investment banker who previously had been a beauty pageant winner found her swimsuit competition photos in a google search the client sent several requests to the web site that hosted the photos asking to have them removed she succeeded only after promising the sites webmaster an autographed picture in an evening gown removing personal information from public records can be more difficult but states are becoming more cognizant of the easy availability of sensitive information in electronic documents in florida where counties have been required for years to make official records available online people can request to have sensitive details blacked out in posted documents this system was in place before the law requiring counties to remove the details took effect guard your information most privacy advocates say the best way to shield your online identity is to avoid giving out personal information in the first place "once its out its impossible to rein in " says chris hoofnagle senior fellow at the university of californias berkeley center for law and technology "it can be recontextualized and used for purposes not anticipated by the individual " this can be as simple as not signing up for supermarket loyalty cards mailing in those ubiquitous warranty cards that come with new purchases the information is frequently sold to marketers and ends up in online databases or entering sweepstakes be especially careful about disclosing personal information in discussion groups chat rooms or blogs limit exposure to spammers by not including your email address on web sites if you do include it try to present it as a button or some other graphical element regular text can be read by automated programs "bots" that scour the internet looking for information getting an unlisted phone number can partly shield it from prying eyes but not completely unlisted numbers can still end up in online databases because marketers and investigative firms can buy unlisted numbers from outfits such as toll free services and pizza delivery companies mr hoofnagle also recommends that privacy conscious consumers request that wireless and land line phone companies not resell their calling information protecting social security numbers is probably most important since identity thieves can use the data to get credit under victims names privacy advocates advise job hunters not to include the numbers when posting resumes online mr hoofnagle and other privacy advocates recommend that consumers give out the numbers only for tax credit and unemployment purposes "there are four things you should ask when someone asks for a social security number " says diane stubbs a private investigator in scottsdale ariz "how will you use it how will you protect it is it really necessary for this transaction and what if i dont give it to you " since much information comes from such common sources as property records and utility service requests security consultants advise those who are really serious about protecting their privacy high profile businesspeople or victims of stalking or domestic abuse to take more aggressive measures for instance many executives and celebrities set up special land trusts that enable them to buy property and start utility service anonymously although typically used to shield landlords and other property owners from litigation ms hetherington and others advise clients to use land and other trusts to keep names and addresses out of public databases start yesterday unfortunately all these efforts take time to bear fruit while information already online remains available to anyone with time a computer and an internet connection "if someone wanted to limit this kind of information " says ms stubbs the private investigator "they should have started years ago " mr totty is a news editor for the journal report in san francisco he can be reached at michael totty wsj com
