alternative fuels push may inspire some better bets president bushs state of the union address which called for a nearly fivefold increase in the nations alternative fuel consumption by did little to silence critics who contend that new fuels like ethanol and biodiesel arent likely to play a major role supplying the worlds energy needs in the years ahead they see two key problems first the profitability of many alternative fuels without sizable subsidies is still in question this is especially true now that the cost of raw ingredients used to produce "biofuel " including corn has rocketed squeezing profit margins for producers of those fuels at the same time oil prices have receded since last summer when they hit &# a barrel they are now hovering around &# a barrel that could lead to losses at some biofuel plants if the trend continues in some parts of the world notably australia the market for alternative fuels has already started to look like a bust with the local media referring to "carnage" in the sector as once hot companies cancel share offerings or watch their stock prices tumble second its becoming clear that boosting output of agriculture based fuels such as ethanol will cause significant new strains on the worlds water and land resources and could drive prices of basic foodstuffs to unacceptable heights hurting poor consumers but even as the outlook for alternative energies darkens some analysts see a more positive outcome from the latest turbulence a forced redirection of resources toward alternative fuels that are more efficient and sustainable than the current batch these analysts see an analogy in the dot com bust of the bust cleared out some of the worst ideas and least efficient companies in the tech arena allowing deeper pocketed investors to consolidate operations and emerge leaner to make the internet an even more powerful force in the world economy they believe a similar scenario will play out in the alternative fuels market "i quite look forward to a period of &# to &# oil prices i think it will bring good discipline to the alternative energy market " says michael liebreich chief executive of new energy finance a london based research firm that specializes in alternative energies there are indications that a shift toward more sustainable investments is already taking place as some serious investors channel their spending to energies that either produce less environmental fallout such as solar or wind power or to agriculture based options that dont require as much water or compete with traditional food crops in india for example some farmers are rushing to plant jatropha a little known oilseed that can be used to make fuel jatropha like some other newer generation sources of biodiesel is inedible so its use doesnt divert a food crop to fuel use more important analysts say it can be grown in arid soil or planted on poor unused land that is threatened by erosion making it a relatively environmentally friendly option investors are also directing more money into "cellulosic" fuels that use nonfood commodities such as switch grass or farm waste to make ethanol a small number of companies including spains abengoa sa are attempting to launch projects using such biomass energy a growing number of financial institutions including bank sarasin &amp co a swiss private bank that follows the sector are advising clients to steer their money into these "second generation" alternative energy companies still the newer alternative energy sources have their problems it will likely be years before sources such as jatropha or biomass will be economically viable on a meaningful scale and its possible much of the current wave of investment in such technologies will yield losses but investments in research can produce results during the last big alternative fuels push after the s oil price shocks corn yielded less than two gallons of ethanol per bushel according to dan basse president of chicago research firm agresource co in the newest facilities launched after years of study a bushel can yield gallons or more analysts say theres also far more private capital chasing alternative energy solutions these days partly because of the rise of hedge funds and other investment vehicles desperate to find new growth industries moreover subsidies for the industry are more widespread than before in addition to the u s many european countries as well as china brazil and others have adopted or are contemplating new biofuel incentives mr liebreich at new energy finance estimates that investors poured about &# billion into alternative energies last year more than double the total much of the money is coming from well established companies that could be in a position to buy up distressed assets if the alternative fuel market continues to struggle one such company is noble group ltd of hong kong although much of its business is in traditional commodities such as iron ore and coal noble has purchased minority stakes in several u s ethanol plants and is investing in sugar based brazilian ethanol "people will overextend and many plants will have financial difficulty " says ricardo leiman nobles chief operating officer but he adds that as facilities fail that could create more opportunities for bigger investors to move in of course all bets are off if oil prices keep falling if that happens alternative energies could wither just as they did after the retreat of the oil price surges of the s
