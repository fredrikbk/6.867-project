journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources art how influx of money has fostered climate of laissez faire aesthetics the recent tidal wave of money into the art world has swept away its old ways of establishing an art works aesthetic value contends the new republics art critic jed perl gallery owners art fairs museums and auction houses are driving up revenue by promoting "laissez faire aesthetics " which believes that a painting "is simply what everybody or anybody says it is " mr perl contends for instance that an elder generation of critics would have attacked an artist such as painter john currin for incoherently being like cranach the elder and mad magazine simultaneously mr perl attacks him for this reason but in the new critical environment this incoherence is a virtue gallery owners use it to sell mr currins paintings to both fans of mad magazine and fans of th century painters similarly mr perl charges that museums have lost faith in their permanent collections instead they draw visitors to blockbuster temporary exhibits such as the guggenheims "art of the motorcycle" in by erasing the old distinctions between high art and pop culture they promote art as a public communal experience along the lines of television whereas mr perl argues that good art should be an individual experience mr perl suspects that this explains why collectors now buy works in public forums such as auctions rather than in the privacy of galleries its conspicuous consumption sellers also promote a works price more than ever since its the one distinction laissez faire aesthetics makes between say a picasso and "the sopranos " the new republic feb international relations military interventions by u s vary in effect even if economists and historians have discovered that imperialism has had global benefits the benefits dont match the harm it causes argue economists christopher j coyne and steve davies messrs coyne and davies single out as typical of the pro empire argument a recent paper in the journal of economic history that showed how bond markets across latin america flourished after theodore roosevelt established that the u s would intervene militarily if a country defaulted on its debt however they point out that along with a public good like regional stability u s military intervention can also create public bads using a historical index of democracy they find that very few of the nations where the u s intervened militarily in the past years developed democratic institutions five years after an intervention only had a viable democracy and only had one years after the authors say this poor success rate even when considering positives such as short term stability shows how military interventions have downsides such as worse instability later on and client governments focused on keeping the support of the u s government rather than on domestic growth economic journal watch

surviving one that isnt " he tells inc magazine in an interview how a silicon valley company estimated that one jerks behavior cost it &# a year to pay for anger management training fielding his constant complaints to human resources about his benefits and the external searches for his secretaries no secretary within the company would work for him to avoid hiring jerks "seek out people who knew the candidate but werent given as references " mr sutton also recommends that people from more than one group interview a candidate since jerks tend to like working with other jerks "if there are jerks in your it group maybe another group will be able to keep new jerks from joining " as for dealing with jerks outside the organization consultants sometimes charge difficult clients more inc
