politics &amp economics clinton seeks iowa connections senator cultivates personal ties not celebrity aura in heartland davenport iowa one of the most well known women on the planet spent the weekend introducing herself "i am hillary clinton " she began yesterday before a standing room only crowd just as she had a day earlier before a throng in des moines each time the audience of iowa democrats laughed and cheered as if in on the joke that a former first lady current new york senator and newly minted democratic presidential candidate wouldnt be recognizable to all yet for mrs clinton this is serious getting enough people to know her as shed like to be known rather than as the cold figure that even some admirers perceive is critical to her hopes of getting the partys nomination let alone being elected the first female president the senators challenge is plain in this state that holds both parties first nominating caucuses a year from now mrs clinton is the democrats early front runner nationally about of democrats support her twice as many as her closest rival illinois sen barack obama can claim but in iowa she has trailed in polls behind mr obama and two other candidates former sen john edwards of north carolina who has been working the state since his white house bid and iowas former gov tom vilsack "hillary carries a lot of baggage and the only way she can unload that is to meet with people " says dennis goldford a political scientist at drake university in des moines "people want to feel personally comfortable with a president thats where hillary has a problem " so a week after announcing her presidential bid over the internet mrs clinton was here in the flesh for what she calls "conversations " trying over a sub freezing weekend to show fellow democrats she isnt an ice queen for iowans who jealously guard their year role as vetters of presidential candidates mrs clinton can pass their "electability" test only by first passing their "likability" test that would allow them to imagine she could overcome her polarizing image and attract the votes of independents if not republicans needed to win back the white house she aced her tests for richard brannan the year old longtime former county commissioner went skeptically to saturdays rally at a des moines high school gymnasium "she connected " he said "she wasnt on stage two minutes and she had the crowd in her hands " but many others said they wouldnt commit this early karin hill of marshalltown iowa after getting mrs clintons autograph said she liked the senator but she added "i like edwards i like bill richardson " new mexicos governor "i like barack obama " "most iowans do not jump early when it comes to the caucuses " says iowas senate majority leader mike gronstal one of about a dozen democrats who dined with mrs clinton at a des moines supporters home friday night "they want each of the candidates to dinner " he quipped about iowans expectations of getting to meet all comers "thats somewhat of a challenge for hillary because of the media bubble around her " for her maiden campaign weekend scores of reporters including television crews from switzerland and japan followed the senator around des moines cedar rapids and davenport as she will this coming weekend in new hampshire mrs clinton mixed small private events in which she met with party officials and labor leaders with larger public "conversations" in each city the one in des moines saturday drew a couple thousand with many spilling into an overflow room early yesterday perhaps filled a county fairgrounds hall despite temperatures outside below zero she took questions town hall style most from clear fans but a couple from skeptics of her vote to authorize force in iraq afterward she invited all to come forward to speak individually a crush of photographers along with a number of secret service agents made it difficult for iowans to press in but most did and she stayed to sign autographs pose for photos and answer more questions mrs clinton emphasized several issues from health care to global warming she tended not to bring up iraq in remarks addressing it mainly when asked she reiterated her charge that mr bush rushed to war and waged it incompetently and that she wants to work for a bipartisan solution to end it its a position she acknowledged that falls short of the aggressive antiwar stance that some liberals influential in the nominating contest would like she repeatedly used her answers to show a folksy self deprecating and even humorous side in promising to work again for universal health care for example she alludes to her disastrous stewardship of her husbands health care initiative "since i do have a little experience in this area i know what not to do " she said in des moines to much laughter but mrs clinton also sought to assure party activists that she will be steely enough to answer partisan attacks of the sort she and her husband have drawn for years during her saturday visit to state party headquarters one official asked what lessons she had learned from john kerrys unsuccessful campaign many democrats believe mr kerry lost because he failed to fight back against conservatives assaults "when youre attacked you have to deck your opponents " mrs clinton said to applause from about officials she nearly brought down the house in davenport yesterday when for those in the audience who hadnt heard she paraphrased one mans question "what in my background equips me to deal with evil and bad men " several democrats afterward said they interpreted her delivery as a charmingly funny allusion to her husbands past marital misbehavior a controversy that still leaves some voters uncomfortable about her candidacy but in a later news conference mrs clinton expressed mild exasperation that reporters were suggesting the audience interpreted her remark that way "i get a little funny and now im being psychoanalyzed " she said " i dont think anybody felt that im sorry "
