battle royal bush clinton bush clinton it sounds like the wars of the roses lancaster york lancaster york to compare our political struggles to the conflicts between rival dynasties may be carrying it too far but we have become i think a nation that is less small r republican and more royalist than it used to be viscerally this strikes me as a bad thing but as ive thought about it ive decided that something can be said for the increasing royalism of our politics and whether you like it or not you cant deny its there not when the wife of the nd president is a leading candidate to succeed the rd president who in turn is the son of the st president the two george bushes are referred to in their family we are told as and if hillary clinton wins will she and her husband call each other and evidence for my case comes from the recent set to in the white house press room after reporters had learned that laura bush had made no public announcement when she had a skin cancer routinely removed when press secretary tony snow said it was a private matter reporters spun out theories why mrs bush had a duty to disclose this minor surgery to the american public even though she is not a public official and even though the operation had no impact on the operation of government but reporters instinctively sense that the doings of mrs bush are as newsworthy as their british counterparts regard those of the royal family and they have some reason to her husband started just about every campaign speech by praising his decision to "marry up " her high approval ratings take some of the edge off his low ones "royalty " wrote walter bagehot in his book "the english constitution " "is a government in which the attention of the nation is concentrated in one person doing interesting actions a republic is a government in which attention is divided between many who are all doing uninteresting things " he went on to note that the monarchy his capitals was not just one person but several "a family on the throne is an interesting idea also it also brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life " so we have columnists writing that the current presidents policies are a sort of oedipal rebellion against his father and we have endless speculations on the dynamics of the clintons relationship the personal has become the political in bagehots england they were separate the monarchy was personal the palmerstons and gladstones and disraelis political now political reporters are getting ready to grind out pieces about the families of the presidential candidates there was always a risk of royalism under our constitution with the president both head of government and head of state but for a long time politicians struggled against it george washington turned down a crown john adams did not make public the scintillating intellect of his wife abigail for half the time in the first years of the th century there was no first lady at all thomas jefferson andrew jackson and martin van buren were widowers when they took office after the civil war politics revolved so much around parties rather than presidents can you name all the presidents from abraham lincoln to theodore roosevelt that in the s the future president woodrow wilson wrote a book called "congressional government " the drift toward royalism is a th century phenomenon at first it was concealed theodore roosevelt and william howard taft had strong willed intelligent wives and broods of children who went on to impressive achievements but they didnt make much of this public woodrow wilsons first wife a southerner who died early in his presidency reportedly pushed for racial segregation in federal building cafeterias while his second wife effectively ran the white house while he was incapacitated by a stroke neither something youd want to talk about even now lou henry hoover an engineering school classmate of her husband directed her public energies to promoting the girl scouts with eleanor roosevelt we come to the first first lady with a political identity of her own but she was just one of many courtiers in her husbands white house and not necessarily the most influential harry truman did not bring bess truman to potsdam she spent much of his presidency at home in independence with her elderly mother mamie eisenhower said that "ike runs the country and i turn the pork chops " but ever since john kennedy made a point of bringing his french speaking wife to paris where she charmed the seemingly uncharmable charles de gaulle most presidents and presidential candidates have made a habit of showcasing their wives and most of their wives have made a point of taking up some public cause or other some of them controversial first ladies increasingly became public figures and given the considerable talents and charm of presidential wives since that time political assets now we have our first first lady to run for president she brings to the race a formidable asset that few presidential candidates can claim a first hand knowledge of the operations of the white house but then queen elizabeth ii who has had weekly audiences for years with prime ministers from winston churchill to tony blair would probably be a pretty good prime minister were she eligible for the office shes not by law she cant set foot in the house of commons sen clinton was more involved in making public policy than any other first lady except possibly sarah childress polk who was her husbands chief secretary and worked alongside him in his office but there is something bizarre something royal about the vision of the wife of a former president becoming president herself although those of us who voted for george w bush are poorly positioned to complain about it and perhaps we shouldnt because the royalism of republican politics is not just an american phenomenon you see it in other very large republics india for of the years after independence had members of one family as head of government jawaharlal nehru indira gandhi rajiv gandhi grandfather and daughter mother and son rajiv gandhis widow is now head of the governing party indonesia elected as president the daughter of a former president so did the philippines maybe there is a reason for this its hard in a very large democracy for voters to judge a potential leader they can gather some information on his or her positions on issues but they rely on an inevitably imperfect and often biased media if they are strongly on the side of one party they can vote for that partys candidate but in the united states at least they have some voice at least if they live in iowa or new hampshire in determining who that candidate is they have a hard time ascertaining the ability and character of candidates but in making judgments about those things it helps if you know the family not that anyone assumes that family members are all alike it would not do for candidate bush in and for candidate clinton today to claim to be clones of his father and her husband rather candidate bush made comments about his mothers fearsomeness and candidate clintons "lets chat" suggests that she is more of a listener and less of a nonstop talker than her husband so the trend to royalism may not be all bad it does give some candidates an unfair advantage over others but lets face it only four of the million living americans has been president and probably only or more ever will be we need as much knowledge of our presidential candidates as we can get and if we get some of it by knowing their families as closely as we know the families of recent occupants of the white house so be it as bagehot put it "the best reason why monarchy is a strong government is that it is an intelligible government the mass of mankind understand it and they hardly anywhere in the world understand any other " in any case its no sure thing that a clinton will follow a bush who followed a clinton who followed a bush but keep the following in the back of your mind george p bush will be eligible to run for president in chelsea clinton will be eligible to run for president in so will jenna and barbara bush who will turn several days after the election and jeb bush who had a fine record in eight years as governor of florida will be younger in than john mccain will be in or ronald reagan was in royalism may be here to stay mr
