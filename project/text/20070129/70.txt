inc has had a devoted following ever since the bethesda md company won its first order in to brew bottles of its organic iced tea for whole foods market inc but beverage giants like coke and pepsico inc had such a tight grip on distribution through their bottlers that it was hard for honest tea to get space on supermarket shelves and in convenience store coolers suddenly though honest tea has struck deals with coke bottlers in california colorado and pennsylvania to distribute honest tea several distributors for anheuser busch cos and other large beer companies also have begun carrying its heavenly honey green pomegranate white tea with acai and peach oo la long flavors honest teas expansion is just one of a growing number of unusual alliances between beverage companies and distributors grappling with sluggish sales of their core brands and eager to expand some distributors are making deals with new companies that market small faster growing beverages coca cola bottling co consolidated cokes second largest u s bottler created a wholly owned subsidiary byb brands inc in may to develop new types of drinks that it wasnt already getting from coke in atlanta one such drink a "premium coffee latte drink" called cinnabon and created with retailer cinnabon inc was launched last summer and is already being distributed in states through agreements with cadbury schweppes

called respect and tum e yummies a flavored water from byb brands coca cola enterprises inc cokes largest u s bottler recently signed a pact with hornell brewing co to distribute versions of arizona iced tea in the heyday of the cola wars it was red trucks versus blue trucks coke versus pepsi but those days are receding lately consumers are drawn to new smaller brands "started out of garages" that arent sold on a mass scale like coke or pepsi says norm george president of byb and coke consolidateds former marketing chief and chief customer officer "youve got to have brands people want " he says coke and its bottlers are separate companies although coke owns sizable stakes in its largest bottlers such as cce and coke consolidated coke bottlers have always distributed a few outside products many sell dr pepper which is owned by cadbury but those brands were generally big and bottlers previously havent started their own brand companies as coke consolidated has it is too soon to say whether the moves have cut into coke sales the volume of coca cola classic sold in north america has declined since the late s although cokes overall north american volume rose in data for are not yet available even so the moves present a conundrum for the atlanta based company which relies on its bottlers to push its new drinks into the market late to the noncarbonated beverage wars coke lags behind pepsi in those types of drinks its bottlers want the beverage giant to move more quickly to bring out new drinks in fast growing categories such as iced tea coke and pepsi have also rankled their bottlers by channeling some noncarbonated drinks outside the traditional bottler system a group of small coke bottlers sued coke and its biggest bottler last year over a plan to deliver powerade to wal mart stores inc stores through an alternative distribution system the sides are close to an agreement now to dismiss the suit according to beverage digest "clearly we would prefer that our bottlers distribute our own brands " says coke spokesman dan schafer "our role is to create innovation in our categories and we are working closely with our system to do that " he says coke has recently picked up the pace of introducing new drinks for example the restructuring of a joint venture with nestle sa has given coke greater flexibility to develop and introduce coffee and tea drinks
