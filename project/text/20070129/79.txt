smell test how politics influenced a big clean up deal tiny start up wins border sewage contract a meeting with cheney imperial beach calif as tijuana has boomed fueled by industrial expansion something else has also surged the flood of raw sewage the mexican border city sends gushing downhill into neighboring california less than of the citys sewage is being treated at all and that only to minimal levels leaving tons to flow into the canyons and surf of southern california to stem this growing mess the american government has chosen an unusual solution without any competitive bidding the u s gave bajagua llc a start up company with no experience in treating waste water sole authority to build and operate a treatment plant in mexico the tale of bajaguas success in getting the contract involves among other things well timed campaign contributions to local members of congress and other political figures the firm also enlisted people with crucial connections as lobbyists and when that didnt prove enough bajagua obtained backing from vice president dick cheney and the white house which cleared away opposition by federal agencies several former senior federal agency officials say the bajagua plan "bajagua" is a contraction of the spanish "baja " for baja california and "agua " water has prevailed even though when it was first proposed in the late s it faced opposition from all of the relevant federal agencies records show that the state department the environmental protection agency the justice department and the clinton white houses office of management and budget dismissed the proposal as inadequate and impractical and said it would violate existing law and treaties opponents of the plan say it wont stop the main causes of the waste and garbage flowing across the border bajaguas tale shows how plans for federal public works projects could be diverted by a small group of lawmakers who were able to push contracts toward big campaign contributors it also highlights the political difficulties posed by the pollution flowing into the u s from burgeoning mexican border cities recently the projects backers have missed important deadlines and officials are questioning whether the company has taken vital steps it claims already were achieved including obtaining commitments for financing essential permits and land the federal governments contract with bajagua calls for cancellation if the plant isnt built and running by september leaving the company only months to build and open a plant as a result u s and mexican officials have begun to express concern about whether it can succeed bajaguas principals say they are on track in an unusual step the u s committed itself without appropriating money for the plant and the final cost isnt known the federal agency in charge estimates the total cost to the u s will be between &# million and &# million coastal southern san diego county lies at the bottom of a drainage system that originates in baja california mountains in mexico feeds into the tijuana river flowing through the heart of tijuana and down into the ocean at imperial beach calif as it passes through tijuana the river picks up raw human waste battery acid old tires household garbage and toxic chemicals from hilltop squatter settlements surrounding tijuana meanwhile more sewage flows directly down canyons into san diego county beaches as far north as northern san diego county are affected but imperial beach a favorite california surfing spot has borne the brunt of the pollution all or parts of the beaches along imperial beach and the estuary just to the south of it were closed for days in according to the san diego county statistics the pollution causes health hazards a weakened local economy low home prices and harm to endangered wildlife according to public health experts local business owners and others in the dry season a system of special drains often catches the waste flowing through the tijuana river which would be dry without waste water as well as the sewage running down the canyons these pump the waste to a treatment plant in san ysidro calif but the drains are overwhelmed in the november to april rainy season and sometimes in the dry season too the problem was obvious on a late november day when the san diego tijuana area had its first rain of the season after only a few tenths of an inch of rain the raw sewage flow was too much for a drain in the river bed water covered with floating garbage and white foam from detergent and filled with raw human waste washed into the tijuana estuary on the u s side soon reaching the ocean health officials closed the beach at the mouth of the tijuana river justin jeter has surfed around the landmark imperial beach pier for years and says he cant resist going in when the surf is up but he adds that lately he has suffered frequent sinus and ear infections which like many surfers he attributes to the pollution a recent study in the journal applied and environmental microbiology by richard gersberg professor at san diego state universitys graduate school of public health and colleagues documents high levels of hepatitis a virus and human intestinal viruses in ocean water off the mouth of the tijuana river and at the imperial beach pier after seasonal rains the pollution also affects the estuary a acre wildlife reserve sandwiched between the border and imperial beach through which the tijuana river empties into the ocean joy zedler an ecology professor who has studied the estuary says polluted sediments from tijuana have eliminated clams sand dollars and fish species from the estuary and adjacent waters endangered birds such as the light footed clapper rail have been harmed and plants native to the estuary killed off including a rare species of pickleweed once a sleepy border town tijuana is now mexicos fourth largest city with a population of more than million about people on average arrive daily to stay tijuanas growth stemmed from maquiladora plants foreign owned plants allowed to import materials and export finished goods duty free and more recently the north american free trade agreement and growing cross border trade with the citys flat land used up hundreds of thousands of new dwellings eat up the surrounding steep hillsides so quickly that whole new neighborhoods appear in days even in many legal developments the dwellings arent connected to sewers or running water instead plastic pipes run from indoor latrines dumping raw waste into the dirt roads the outflow etches gullies in the roads and flows into the tijuana river or down the hillsides to the estuary on the u s side the municipal sewage system is leaky a reporter driving one day in the citys center during the dry season saw a geyser of sewage shooting up from around a manhole cover and running down the street tijuana has a sewage treatment plant of its own on the coast just south of tijuana that receives million gallons of raw sewage daily it treats million gallons to a "primary" standard before dumping it into the surf only solids are filtered out not toxic chemicals heavy metals and other dangerous stuff the rest of the sewage is spewed untreated directly into the ocean the u s has long recognized that mexico was unlikely to pay all the costs of treating sewage that washes north of the border under treaties agencies in both countries work together on sewage and other issues the u s agency is the international boundary and water commission an el paso texas based arm of the state department in the s the commission built the san ysidro plant on the u s side of the border it takes in million gallons per day of tijuana sewage treats it to a primary stage then sends it through an foot wide pipe before discharging it in the ocean miles offshore that partly treated discharge falls far short of u s clean water act standards in response the ibwc intended to expand treatment at the plant it acquired land and planned to increase capacity in steps then bajagua entered the picture the small company was established solely to try to build a plant in mexico under a u s government contract to address the tijuana waste problem it grew out of a partnership in the s between james d simmons a former san marcos calif city councilman who runs a consulting business and enrique landa a rancho santa fe calif architect turned entrepreneur and son of a mexico city architect messrs landa and simmons had put together packages of permits which they sold to construction companies to build a waste treatment plant in sonora state in mexico and to upgrade treatment at a mexico city plant mr simmons says mr landas travels in northern mexico where he saw an acute shortage of usable water and waste treatment led him to the idea of building a tijuana treatment plant through a bajagua spokesman mr landa declined to be interviewed the two men concluded that they could make money by treating waste eventually to cleaner standards and selling the reclaimed water under bajaguas plan to build a plant in tijuana million gallons a day of raw sewage would continue to flow to the san ysidro plant on the u s side where as now it would be treated only to primary standards then new pumps and pipes would send it back uphill into mexico to the new bajagua plant after treating the sewage there bajagua would send it downhill again through yet another set of new channels where it would cross the border a third time to san ysidro then it would be shunted into the ocean through the existing pipe eventually the bajagua plant would also treat an additional million gallons of sewage directly from tijuana to be sent across the border to the ocean pipe the idea of a u s funded treatment plant in mexico ran counter to an agreement the u s had with mexico committing to build treatment facilities on its own side of the border a environmental impact statement prepared by the environmental protection agency and the ibwc called the bajagua plan "not a feasible alternative " it said the plan wouldnt expeditiously meet the goal of additional treatment which it said could be accomplished at the san ysidro plant a big criticism then and now was that no plan addressed a key source of pollution the millions of gallons of tijuana sewage that dont go into any sewer system at all engineers who evaluated the bajagua plan including michael l evans a senior ibwc engineer at the time concluded that it was unnecessarily costly because the same sewage would ping pong across the border three times before being discharged into the ocean bajagua executives say their plan makes sense because the san ysidro plant has limited room for expansion and faces local opposition they also say bajagua would be reimbursed in annual increments only after its plant is up and running "the only way we get paid back is if we build it it works and it operates to standards " says mr simmons the commission and other federal agencies reviewed bajaguas plan and rejected it but that wasnt the end local members of congress blocked the ibwcs plan to expand the san ysidro plant and pushed the bajagua alternative democratic rep bob filner whose district includes the san ysidro plant and republican rep brian bilbray from a nearby district in sponsored a bill promoting bajaguas plan a draft of the bill actually named bajagua as the firm to do the work when some lawmakers complained the sponsors changed to wording that they hoped was so specific it would make bajagua the only possible choice "we basically wanted one company " mr filner says "so we had to find a way to do it within the law " from through bajagua officials and their immediate relatives gave more than &# in campaign contributions to mr filner federal campaign records show more than to any other candidate in that period mr filner says he supported bajagua because he considers it the best solution and his constituents wanted the plant in mexico "im doing this for my district not for enrique landa who is my friend " he says the clinton white house opposed the bill the office of management and budget stated "its approach raises serious foreign policy and legal concerns and will hinder our ongoing efforts to address the regions wastewater treatment needs " but after some amendments and facing strong congressional support mr clinton signed it the bill paved the way for a new treaty with mexico that would allow the bajagua project even congresss backing wasnt enough to overcome opposition by the ibwc and other federal agencies arturo duran ibwc commissioner in and says he had reservations because "its not normal to sole source to a company a contract for hundreds of millions of dollars its not how the federal government operates " with progress at a standstill the california water quality control board in sued the ibwc as owner of the san ysidro plant the suit led to a federal court order to bring the plants discharge up to less toxic "secondary" standards by september it took intervention from the white house and republican rep duncan hunter of southern california to turn events to bajaguas favor on oct bajaguas messrs simmons and landa traveled to roswell n m where vice president cheney appeared at republican fund raisers after a public rally mr cheney met privately with a small group of big contributors at the home of a local republican backer energy executive george yates mr yates says mr simmons says he and mr landa went in response to an invitation received in the mail to the fund raiser "dick cheney attended that i got to shake his hand and had my picture taken and that was the end of it " he says but the next day mr simmons sent a letter on bajagua stationery to the vice president expressing gratitude "that you could spend some time with us in roswell " it added "i appreciate the opportunity i had to briefly introduce the bajagua project to you and your staff " mr simmons also gave a five page "bajagua project briefing" to catherine martin a top adviser to mr cheney in early bajagua officials say they cant recall the date matthew simmons then a lobbyist for bajagua met with a cheney aide about the project in the vice presidents offices mr simmons a former legislative director for rep hunter isnt related to james simmons other lobbyists hired by bajagua include james r jones former u s ambassador to mexico on sept bajagua representatives including james simmons met with officials of the white houses council on environmental quality which oversees executive branch environmental policy bajagua says the same day rep hunter met with james connaughton chairman of the environment council to press for support of bajagua according to emails by ibwc officials disclosed on the web site of william weaver a university of texas at el paso professor public records show that bajagua spent &# on lobbying from through the first half of beginning in the white house pressed the relevant federal agencies to embrace the bajagua project according to interviews a report by the project on government oversight a washington d c based nonprofit organization and email messages and documents posted on mr weavers web site at the justice department a staff attorney who had backed the ibwcs opposition to bajagua on legal grounds was replaced by a political appointee who reported to then assistant attorney general thomas sansonetti a longtime friend of mr cheney staff at the ibwc who had opposed the project were overruled or moved aside say mr evans and other former ibwc staff lea anne mcbride a spokeswoman for mr cheney declined to respond to questions about the vice presidents role in the bajagua case "the bottom line is that the vice president does not issue government contracts " she said in rep hunter pushed through amendments to the law that favored bajagua further exempting it from normal restrictions on federal contracts in the ibwc chose bajagua as the sole "preferred option" for additional treatment of tijuana sewage the thank you letter from bajagua to mr cheney praised rep hunter chairman of the house armed services committee as "our champion " before the encounter at the fund raiser with the vice president rep hunter had received a total of &# in campaign contributions from messrs simmons and landa and a bajagua lawyer two days after the meeting he received another &# each from mr landas brother and sister in law bajagua spokesman craig benedetto says timing of the contributions was "coincidental " he says rep hunter had no role in arranging access to mr cheney mr hunters spokesman said the congressman "doesnt specifically recall coordinating a meeting" with mr cheney but "it would be entirely appropriate for the vice president to be involved in such a meeting" given the importance of the sewage issue concerning the bajagua campaign contributions he said "congressman hunter does what he thinks is right for the nation and in the best interest of the san diego community this project is no exception " rep hunter has announced he is running for president in meanwhile rep bilbray the other sponsor of the law received &# in contributions from bajagua related individuals he lost his seat in the elections and soon went to work as a lobbyist he represented mr benedettos public relations firm to lobby on behalf of bajagua for which he received &# records show in december less than a year after mr bilbrays term ended he testified before the house water and environment subcommittee at a hearing on progress under the bajagua related law he didnt disclose that he was a bajagua lobbyist mr bilbray says he didnt violate lobbying rules which forbid a former lawmaker to appear before or even communicate with members of congress to try to influence them on anyone elses behalf for a year after leaving office he says he testified at the hearing "just representing myself as an author" of the law last year mr bilbray was reelected to congress taking the seat vacated by randy cunningham now in federal prison for soliciting bribes from federal contractors bajagua related individuals gave mr bilbray &# in campaign contributions the cost to the government of the bajagua project remains unknown bajagua and the commission missed a march deadline to negotiate an agreement which would have set the financial terms the u s would reimburse the companys investment with an added percentage of profit over years once the plant opens although mr simmons says bajaguas hopes for big profits lie in selling treated sewage someday as "reclaimed water " u s and mexican officials say bajagua hasnt submitted any plans for an additional plant to produce the water and has no land or approvals to build one it isnt clear whether bajagua legally could sell reclaimed water ibwc commissioner carlos marin says bajagua has missed deadlines for the tijuana plant bajagua insists that as required it has arranged for financing mr simmons says flatly "we have a commitment from citibank to finance the project " but the ibwc says bajagua hasnt given it any documents supporting the claim mr marin says "we dont have any proof" of financing also california denied bajagua a permit it was required to obtain by september to discharge treated waste into the ocean bajagua is appealing bajagua also was to have reached an agreement by september to purchase land mr simmons recently said mexico would be announcing the specific site "in a few weeks " but jose de jesus luevano an official at the ibwcs mexican counterpart says the government has no intention of selling land to bajagua he says a lease is under discussion between mexico and the company but any announcement is months away mr marin admits doubts about whether bajagua will meet the deadline "the more time that passes thats getting a little bit leery " he says yet the ibwc has put all its eggs in bajaguas basket failure would mean years before any alternative could be in place mr marin acknowledges that the ibwc has no backup plan
