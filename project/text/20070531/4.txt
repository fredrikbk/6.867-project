aclu vows it is unbiased when civil liberties are at stake wendy kaminers assertion that the aclu no longer defends the free speech rights of people whose views we do not share is simply wrong "the american liberal liberties union " editorial page may right now the aclu is challenging laws in several states designed to ban picketing by anti gay groups at military funerals just last month the aclu of ohio spoke out in defense of a nazi groups right to march in cincinnati on hitlers birthday the issue did not wind up in the court the aclu is equally evenhanded when other civil liberties are at stake in recent years we have defended the rights of the late rev jerry falwell and radio personality rush limbaugh in cases involving religious liberty and privacy the linchpin of ms kaminers misguided criticism is that the aclu failed to defend a high school student in san diego who was barred from wearing an anti gay t shirt in fact the aclu of san diego has already drafted a brief due in federal appeals court next month supporting the free speech claims in that case the aclu has defended the rights of speakers across the political spectrum for almost years it still does and it always will steven r shapiro legal director aclu new york ms kaminer points out the aclus selectiveness and inconsistency about free speech it once sued the owners of the alpine village inn for not allowing neo nazis to display swastikas in their restaurant even though the restaurant was a private business but in aguilar v avis the aclu argued that racial slurs aimed at illegal aliens were not speech but just a "verbal act " in that case it helped convince the california supreme court in a to ruling to uphold an injunction banning any racial slur in a private workplace the injunction banned even comments that a complainant learns about secondhand today the aclu is supporting the federal hate crimes bill which would allow people found innocent of hate crimes in state court to be reprosecuted in federal court the aclu trumpets the fact that the bill would cover gays along with other minorities it ignores the fact that backers of the bill have openly sought to take advantage of a loophole in constitutional protections against double jeopardy a loophole the aclu once opposed hans bader counsel for special projects competitive enterprise institute washington the fight over "hate speech" addressed by ms kaminer is not recent as appointed counsel for an alleged cross burner i successfully briefed and argued the first "hate speech" case heard before the u s supreme court rav v st paul i did so without the assistance of the aclu instead the aclu submitted an amicus brief that undercut our argument in an apparent attempt to obtain an opinion that allowed censorship of hate speech as i stated in a book i wrote about the case "beyond the burning cross " concerning the aclus involvement "an organization that promoted itself as a nonpartisan civil liberties organization had shown that it was neither the aclu sacrificed principle for political expediency the defense of civil liberties for the promotion of political constituencies " it is indeed sad to see that it appears the sacrificing of principle within the organization continues edward j cleary st paul minn
