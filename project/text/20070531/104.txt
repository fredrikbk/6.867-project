the dire effects of continental drift the last days of europe by walter laqueur st martins pages &# if youve heard the celebratory noises coming out of european capitals of late you could be forgiven for thinking that as with mark twains prematurely recorded demise reports of europes death may have been greatly exaggerated for a continent in the supposed grip of demographic implosion economic stagnation political paralysis and existential anomie the news has been oddly cheerful recently in the past year the rate of economic growth in the eurozone has actually overtaken that of the u s the market capitalization of companies quoted on european stock exchanges has surpassed american corporate worth for the first time ever london has edged ahead of new york in most categories as global financial capital the euro closely watched in europe as a barometer of continental self respect is close to its highest level ever against the dollar even europes infamous political stasis may be giving way to a hint of dynamism in germany chancellor angela merkels coalition government has defied the odds and pulled off small but important economic reforms in nicolas sarkozy the french have elected a man so committed to recasting the countrys economy that he is widely viewed among the liberal elites as a dangerous radical all this could not have come at a more opportune moment the european unions leaders are in the midst of lengthy celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the founding of the european communities at the same time the gloom that enveloped the eu after the french and dutch rejected its beloved constitutional treaty two years ago has been replaced by a restrained optimism that the show might just be put back on the road this summer is it possible then that the writers who have spent the past few years predicting europes collapse could be wrong the short answer is no even a corpse has been known to twitch once or twice before the rigor mortis sets in the longer answer is provided by walter laqueur in "the last days of europe " one of the more persuasive in a long line of volumes by authors on both sides of the atlantic chronicling europes decline and foretelling its collapse unlike the euro bashing polemics of a few of those authors mr laqueurs short book is measured even sympathetic it is mercifully free of references to cheese eating surrender monkeys and misplaced historical analogies to appeasement the tone is one of resigned dismay rather than grave stomping glee this temperate quality makes the books theme that europe now faces potentially mortal challenges all the more compelling the demographic problem is by now so familiar that it hardly bears restating mr laqueur notes that the average european family had five children in the th century today it has fewer than two a trend that will shrink the continents population in the next century on a scale unprecedented in modern history the failure of europeans to reproduce makes it vulnerable to internal schism too often europe has reacted to the growing threat posed by extremists among its minorities with a tolerance and self criticism that has bordered on capitulation meanwhile social tensions increase not least because of high emigration to europe from muslim countries and high birth rates among muslim populations no one has yet found a good way of integrating those populations into mainstream european society even as the challenge from fanatical islam has intensified at home and abroad europeans have found new ways to abase themselves before it two years ago it was the danish cartoons affair in which too few politicians and opinion leaders defended the rights of the danish newspaper that published them last year it was the collective european cringe in the wake of the popes mildly assertive remarks about the disconnect between islam and reason this year it has been the embarrassing spectacle of humiliated british servicemen fawning in front of their iranian captors in the economic field europe is celebrating a growth rate of annually in the u s a similar pace is regarded as a crisis meanwhile unemployment remains brutally high and productivity stagnant mr laqueur notes that europeans sometimes embrace their economic sluggishness as part of their "soft power" appeal all those hour weeks long vacations and generous social benefits but the long term cost of their welfare states and their confiscatory tax rates may eventually make such luxuries unaffordable mr laqueur ponders whether europe will really surrender to these adverse trends or finally resist he is not optimistic perhaps europeans will find ways to bolster their birth rates perhaps they will stiffen in the face of an escalating terrorist threat perhaps muslims will assimilate better into europes democratic and tolerant societies perhaps the pro american sensibilities and the pro growth nimbleness of eastern european countries will drive the rest of the continent out of the ditch of stagnation and pacifism perhaps but then again as mr laqueur observes museums are filled with the remnants of vanished civilizations abroad the u s has long surpassed europe in power influence and economic dynamism asia may do so before long at home a profound demoralization has set in induced in part by the continents ruinous past century it was a century in which unimaginable violence sapped the regenerative energies of a wearied people in which the seductive falsehoods of twin totalitarian ideologies undermined moral self confidence in which a flaccid relativism replaced the firm ethical boundaries of religious belief it was also a century we now see in which the luxuries of rapid economic growth produced a false sense of security that cannot be sustained in a global age not dead yet maybe but even mark twain succumbed eventually to the obituary writers mr baker is u s editor and an assistant editor of the times of london
