tax shelter indictments leave a cloud over ernst new york broadening a high profile probe into the sale of improper tax shelters federal prosecutors secured indictments of four current and former partners of accounting giant ernst &amp young llp on charges tied to the designing and selling structures that brought in millions of dollars in fees the indictments show the u s attorney in manhattan michael garcia isnt backing down in the governments investigation of fraudulent tax shelters despite recent setbacks in the prosecution of former kpmg llp executives similarly charged over shelters sold by that firm a trial in that case billed by the government as the largest ever criminal tax case in u s history has already been twice delayed a recent appellate court ruling related to the defendants legal fees threw the september trial date into doubt and raised the possibility that the case could be dismissed yesterdays indictment charges that the current and former ernst partners designed and sold four types of tax shelters for the ultrarich that either generated paper losses based on sham investments to offset taxable income or disguise income as capital gains so that it would be taxed at a lower rate in both cases ernst received fees based on the amount of tax savings generated by the shelters the partners are also charged with trying to prevent detection by the internal revenue service of the shelters and of using and selling to other ernst partners a shelter that shielded &# million in personal income ernst itself isnt expected to face criminal charges according to people familiar with the matter the firm isnt completely out of the woods though the indictment noted that the sale of the allegedly bogus tax shelter products brought the firm about &# million in fees ernst and the government are continuing to discuss settlement options that would likely fall short of an indictment but include monetary sanctions these people said ernst in entered into a civil settlement with the irs related to its shelters and agreed to pay a &# million fine in a statement ernst said that it has "cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation " meanwhile prosecutors are also continuing their investigation into deutsche bank ag which is alleged to have helped arrange financing for tax shelter products however like ernst that firm isnt expected to face criminal indictment and instead would likely face monetary sanctions a person familiar with the matter said deutsche bank which has settled civil litigation related to its involvement with shelters declined to comment during a hearing yesterday before u s district judge sidney stein in federal court in manhattan the indicted ernst partners pleaded not guilty to charges that included conspiracy obstruction of the irs making false statements and tax evasion attorneys for three of the men said they plan to fight the charges while an attorney for robert coplan declined to comment if convicted of all charges the four men face prison terms ranging from years to years according to the u s attorney the four include mr coplan former national director of ernsts center for family wealth planning martin nissenbaum national director of the firms personal income tax and retirement planning practice richard shapiro a partner in the firms new york office and brian vaughn a partner who was an accountant ernst said messrs nissenbaum and shapiro who are still with the firm have been on administrative leave prosecutors charged that the partners went to considerable lengths to create the impression that the shelters had valid business or trading purposes and werent simply designed to garner tax benefits they said the partners also repeatedly stressed that clients should never be given materials that could one day find their way into the governments hands in a email mr coplan stressed that "a fax of the materials to certain people in the government would have calamitous results " the indictment said unlike the other partners mr coplan was additionally charged with trying to impede an irs investigation by telling ernst staff to destroy documents related to a particular shelter known as cobra short for currency options bring reward alternatives after learning the irs was auditing some clients who used cobra mr coplan the indictment said sent an email to some ernst staff telling them to "immediately delete and dispose of" cobra documents while yesterdays indictments mark another step in the governments pursuit of tax shelter promoters they are also consistent with a strategy in which prosecutors have sought to criminally charge individuals rather than firms in the government entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with kpmg that called for the firm to pay a &# million penalty but allowed it to avoid criminal indictment in recent months the government has declined to charge two law firms jenkens &amp gilchrist llc and sidley austin llp with wrongdoing in connection with shelter sales both firms agreed to pay monetary penalties
