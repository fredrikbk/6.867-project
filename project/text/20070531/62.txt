its a jungle in there a tale of the bronx and beyond bronx n y preserving historic architecture and protecting global wildlife might seem to reflect very divergent priorities but at the bronx zoo flagship of the wildlife conservation society the two go hand in hand "we have a real difference with environmentalists who think that humans are not part of the natural landscape " steven e sanderson president and ceo of wcs said recently in his office "human history is largely written in the successful interaction between humans and wildlife " for a symbol of the institutions philosophy in action look no further than astor court an early th century beaux arts ensemble designated a historic district by the new york city landmarks commission in after a face lift that took months the graceful outdoor spaces reopen to the public tomorrow a more elaborate project is still in progress the restoration of the lion house long since vacated by the lions which are much better accommodated in their five acre outdoor savannah a space they share with zebras antelope and other grazing animals by current lights hardly any zoo structure of the vintage of the lion house will serve its original purpose those that survive are often converted to offices or exhibition spaces due to reopen in its terra cotta lion friezes intact this one will be serving new functions too both as a home to wildlife and as a multipurpose space for the gatherings and social functions on which the welfare of good causes increasingly depends in keeping with the wcs ethos the project adheres strictly to current principles of green construction the feat of transformational engineering has been phenomenal at one point the entire building had to be placed on stilts so the ground it stood on could be excavated for a new cellar the big new attraction at the lion house will be a permanent suite of state of the art displays dedicated to madagascar an endangered paradise that has been called the eighth continent a nile crocodile swimming at eye level behind glass will give the "fear factor" crowd a frisson as will three inch roaches carapaces gleaming like polished mahogany that swarm the hollow of a man made baobab tree an orb spider will be spinning her majestic web ring tailed lemurs will be playing in the branches and this will be the place to make the acquaintance of the rare predator called the fossa cryptoprocta ferox up to three very agile feet in length with a tail that is then again as long of catlike appearance the fossa is actually a close relation of the mongoose and its name is pronounced foo sah wcs operates the worlds largest system of urban wildlife parks "at the bronx zoo we receive two million visitors a year " says mr sanderson "at the aquarium and the zoos in central park queens and prospect park we receive another two million most of them are urban dwellers who have no day to day reason to think about wild nature a great part of our job is to impart to them feelings about the wild the people have felt throughout history the challenge is to get people to care " wcs was founded in as the new york zoological society its new name dates to mr sandersons master plan for the second century pays a lot of attention to enhancing the visitor experience beginning at the parking lot and entrance gates which are not at present uplifting inviting or notably efficient likewise ecotourism is very much on his mind mr sanderson is just back from a wildlife preserve in tierra del fuego established on land given to wcs by goldman sachs conservationists from here on in mr sanderson observes will need to be skilled in dealing with human communities both at home and out in the world balancing the needs of wildlife with economic realities is not easy anywhere and in developing countries the job is especially difficult for wcs itself mr sanderson says "its a new portfolio we need to follow successful business practices not in the sense of generating a profit but we have to make decisions about where to invest " today the goal at any enlightened zoological facility is to keep the animals environment stress free historically however zoos were places to keep wild animals in cages as often as not in the knowledge that they would not thrive there the bronx zoo was never so cavalier about its living collections professional veterinary care was introduced as early as elsewhere mr sanderson says the long prevailing attitude was "hurry come see the animals while theyre still alive " wcs has always pursued a broader agenda than putting wildlife on display a first conservation expedition set out in paving the way for the restoration of the american bison to the western prairie from estimated herds of million in the th century the stock had dwindled by the early th century to fewer than todays number is about the metropolitan museum of art prides itself as the worlds only institution of its kind of encyclopedic scope would it be fair to say that wcs holds an analogous position unique in its global reach "the short answer is yes " mr sanderson says "we couldnt settle for less in new york " on his watch wcs is embarked on a new campaign under the banner "gateways to conservation " meant to evoke the role of the bronx zoo as the wellspring or portal for a whole host of activities wcs runs programs in countries and plays an instrumental role in the management of protected areas in excess of million acres which comes to nearly half a million central parks the staff in the field numbers ph d s and two dozen veterinarians adding in the scientists with directly applicable college or graduate degrees personnel abroad numbers some how can so few cover so much territory "on the plus side we exert tremendous leverage in engaging in effective conservation for one to five dollars per acre a ridiculously low figure compared to the outcomes " says mr sanderson "on the negative side were structurally underfunded the typical size of a project might be a million acres with a budget of &# so were pretty anemic on the ground " many of the locations are remote politically troubled or otherwise hard to serve yet the work goes on even as genocide was raging in rwanda the warring factions went out of their way to spare the conservationists who are protecting the gorillas calmly and with a smile mr sanderson quotes the chronic grievance of the coast guard "we do so much for so little that pretty soon someone will ask us to do everything for nothing " one thing wcs no longer does is bag specimens in the wild one thing it no longer can do or only very rarely is release animals raised in captivity back to their natural habitats too many of those immemorial homes are simply gone destroyed to those who would throw up their hands mr sanderson has this to say "its a desperate situation out there in the wild but ours is not a message of despair people are more sophisticated today its amazing what theyve seen high end adventure travel has opened up areas that have been totally unknown and people want to go there we can generate a broader appreciation than even a generation ago " for example "the southern sudan is an area that has seen a lot of conflict in the last years but were remembered there as faithful friends we did important wildlife surveys there in the s to s now we have entered into a new phase of conservation with the provisional government to protect a spectacular savannah and wetland landscape the environment is vast and priceless and no outside conservation organization has been working there for many years the area includes a great swamp called the sudd at the origin of the white nile which in the rainy season is about the size of england the savannah has elephants savannah antelope and giraffes in incredible numbers and the southern sudan is bigger than kenya uganda and rwanda combined on flyovers were seeing antelope numbers that appear to rival the serengeti migrations " meanwhile back in the bronx the renaissance at the zoo continues mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
