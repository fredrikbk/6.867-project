tuberculosis patients voyage stirs debate over security issues billions of dollars spent on tougher airline security and border protection proved incapable of stopping a globe trotting tuberculosis patient from entering the u s last week in large part because public health issues havent been treated as national security issues according to homeland security officials and experts the slip in which centers for disease control and prevention officials lost track of an atlanta man with a rare potentially deadly type of tuberculosis while overseas only to have him come back into the u s unchallenged points to gaps in the nations system to keep the direst of diseases from crossing borders it also raises questions over the governments ability to stop a would be terrorist in spite of advance intelligence "we are increasingly stronger at stopping anything that represents potential national security or criminal threats " says homeland security spokesman russ knocke "but the fact remains that it is difficult to detect the unknown terrorist or unforeseen threat that doesnt present itself clearly " homeland security officials say it wasnt clear when the man left atlanta this month to go to his wedding and honeymoon in europe that he presented a major risk cdc officials only later contacted dhs and other federal agencies about the seriousness of mans condition after he was already abroad according to a homeland security official cdc officials say they contacted him in rome several times asking him to go to a hospital in italy and telling him not to fly u s customs and border protection agents had been notified to be on the lookout for the man in case he ignored cdc warnings officials said they said that patient had a return ticket for june customs officials were told that if they encountered the man they were to don protective clothing and quarantine him immediately cdc and dhs officals were considering options to restrict his travel including using a cdc jet to fly him back home as well as having him put on a "no fly" list so he would be flagged but in the meantime the man left rome and flew to montreal from czechoslovakia on may "by the time we knew he was missing from rome the opportunity to intervene had passed " said martin cetron cdcs head of global migration and quarantine from montreal the man drove into the u s via the champlain border cleared by u s customs officials a federal law enforcement official said investigators were looking into how the man was allowed to proceed sen charles schumer d n y said the case shows that "something is wrong" with the training and supervision of u s border agents "we put all this time and effort into identifying those who shouldnt enter our country but what good is it if it can be brushed aside by a border guard i shudder to think that this individual could have been a terrorist " he said some observers said that had the man been a known terrorist the response would likely have been very different "it was the fact that he was just sick that is part of the problem " said frank cilluffo the director of george washington universitys homeland security institute "this incident clearly points to the need to recognize that public health matters are national security matters and we need to widen the net in a way which respects peoples privacy and doesnt treat sick people as criminals " he added howard njoo the director general of canadas center for emergency preparedness and response said that all the cdc had told him was that that they lost track of the individual and picked him up again only when he was back in u s dr njoo said that given the fact the man represented a "relatively small" health risk to the public canada wasnt overly worried but he added that the incident underlined the need for better coordination of watch lists for public health threats as well as terrorists u s customs and border protection spokesman kevin corsaro said the man didnt appear sick to agents on the northern border when he crossed last week cbp said it hasnt changed its screening or security precautions as a result of the case once the man returned to the u s he was contacted by health officials who required he go to an isolation hospital in new york city for evaluation said dr cetron of the cdc "he drove himself there voluntarily " the cdc hasnt released the mans identity citing privacy concerns a decision that was an additional cause of delay in tracking him down the cdc eventually gave the details to dhs say homeland officials a hearing on the incident by the house homeland security committee is planned for wednesday and there are at least two investigations by government agencies including one by the inspector general for the department of homeland security the cdc is trying to contact about passengers who sat near him on the flights corrections &amp amplifications the tuberculosis patient who sparked fears about u s border security flew to montreal from the czech republic a personal journal article on thursday incorrectly said he flew from czechoslovakia wsj june
