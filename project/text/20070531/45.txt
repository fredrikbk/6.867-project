elderly benefit from surgery for back pain elderly patients who have surgery to repair slipped vertebrae experience more relief from pain and other symptoms than those who choose nonsurgical treatments according to the latest findings from a large federally funded research effort the results from the spine patient outcomes research trial or sport confirm findings of other smaller studies of so called degenerative spondylolisthesis although some researchers not involved have questioned the trials research methods launched in sport set out to compare surgical and nonsurgical treatments for several common back ailments paid for by the national institutes of health the trial involved about patients at treatment centers around the country patients were initially divided into surgery and nonsurgery groups but during the various related studies there was heavy crossover between the two groups making comparisons difficult for instance during the two year period measured in the new slipped vertebrae study about one third of the patients assigned to the surgery group chose not to have an operation while half of those in the nonsurgery group opted to have one to account for such shifts researchers measured results based on treatments patients actually received rather than the group to which they were initially assigned the study which is being published in this weeks new england journal of medicine involved patients whose average age was they were surveyed at various times during the study and asked to rate various aspects of their own pain and physical function on a zero to scale both groups improved over the two year period although the final scores for patients who had surgery were in the point range scores for those who stuck with nonsurgical treatments such as physical therapy were in the low s lead researcher james n weinstein surgeon and chairman of orthopedics at the dartmouth medical school in hanover n h acknowledged the research problems created by patient crossover but said the studys results still give patients a better sense of their options "if i was having my back operated on id like to know this information " he said observers not involved with the study disagreed on its importance david flum a university of washington surgery professor and a past sport critic said surgery patients are too heavily invested in the outcome of their procedures to objectively assess their own progress richard fessler chief of neurosurgery at the university of chicago medical center said the study "dramatically shows the efficacy of spinal surgery" for such patients adding that conducting totally randomized studies involving surgery is all but impossible "you cant ethically do a placebo study in surgery " he said "you cant cut someone open and not take care of their problem "
