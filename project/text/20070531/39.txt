a cloud in the group he had run began losing both deals and talent but wall street loves a good comeback story and both he and his old firm are trying to mount one the credit suisse investment banking unit of swiss bank credit suisse group which has since dropped first boston from its name was the streets top adviser last year on tech mergers and acquisitions according to thomson financial it did &# billion of deal volume nearly quintupling since the year after mr quattrone left the firm was the second biggest collector of deal fees thomson estimated recently credit suisse grabbed a key role in deals like google inc s planned purchase of the online advertising company doubleclick inc for &# billion and two summers ago the initial public offering of the chinese search engine baidu com inc despite the progress some clients have reservations about doing business with the group that underwrote some of the hottest ipos of the tech stock boom in the late s jerry kennelly chief executive of data services provider riverbed technology inc in selected goldman sachs group inc an early investor in his company to lead his &# million ipo after credit suisse failed to wow him "they had some people good people credible people but it hadnt quite jelled yet " recalled mr kennelly riverbed shares have roughly quadrupled since september when they began trading on the nasdaq stock market in technology stock and bond underwriting last year credit suisse ranked no with less than half the &# billion in deal flow that top ranked citigroup inc claimed at the same time credit suisses broader investment banking business has performed strongly pulling in of the banks total revenue last year and helping the parent company post record profit the company said its strategy has been to target higher margin businesses like ipos and debt financing "in technology " said co head of investment banking eric varvel "weve consistently been a top tier player " it still is a long way from the technology boom in the late s when credit suisse first boston whose tech practice was led by mr quattrone was the bank to beat in silicon valley but in mr quattrone was indicted for allegedly obstructing an investigation into whether credit suisse had steered cheap ipo shares to a favored group of hedge fund clients in exchange for inflated stock trading commissions the bankers obstruction conviction has since been overturned and in august he won an agreement conditionally dropping all charges against him he will soon be free to re enter the banking business and it is widely expected he will open an advisory or private equity firm some bet he will deliver credit suisse a blow by taking george boutros one of the firms top rainmakers with him mr boutros declined to speculate on his next move saying he is "very engaged" in what he is doing through a spokesman mr quattrone declined to comment the loss of another important person isnt what credit suisse needs some influential bankers have already left including john hodge now a senior adviser at private equity firm blackstone group lp and deal maker ethan topper who plans to open a tech m&amp a firm called union square advisors mr topper declined to comment and mr hodge didnt return calls many who remained at credit suisse resented mr quattrones legal troubles to show their sympathy for a man they felt had been wrongly accused some took time off work to attend his two criminal trials until the tech practice moved offices last fall mr quattrones corner space in the palo alto building was left unoccupied as if to pay homage to him said a person who works in the group the quattrone saga proved a continuing distraction "there were a lot of questions at the time about our ability to continue the leadership of csfb technology banking " said david wah who with david popowitz was promoted in to run mr quattrones old practice one tactic that helped win business was asking brady dougan then head of the investment bank who was recently elevated to chief executive of credit suisse group to work the phones in july he called dave orton ceo of chip manufacturer ati technologies inc late at night in germany to pitch the firms advisory services credit suisse later advised ati on its &# billion merger with advanced micro devices inc mr ortons spokesman said he couldnt be reached for comment another strategy said mr wah was borrowing moves from mr quattrones playbook identify potential clients early stick with them in the tough times and realize that small deals prove worthwhile one case in point credit suisses dealings with google salman ullah the search companys director of corporate development said the investment bank won roles advising google in the doubleclick deal and last years &# billion purchase of online video site youtube partly because the firm showed its commitment by working on a pair of smaller deals that didnt come off during those failed talks he recalled "they really understood when to give and when not to give and thats something of an art " dana cimilluca contributed to this article
