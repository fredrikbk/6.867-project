the daily fix kobe and the lakers consider life apart online edition kobe bryant and the lakers a partnership that has spanned seasons three titles and more than points may be ending for four days kobe has made conflicting statements to the press about his dissatisfaction with the teams lack of a playoff series victory in the last three years on wednesday he said early in the day that he wanted to be traded then backed off those comments later in the day the lakers have no intention of trading one of the leagues best players marc stein writes in a useful guide to the contretemps on espn com but he adds "while common sense says that the lakers have lived through a rift or two during bryants decade plus with the club and will find a way to heal the bruises from this one as well like they always do there is nothing common about what weve witnessed over the past few days even by the standards of the kobe era lakers so theres no telling what will happen next here " a big part of the current rift is the low profile of lakers owner jerry buss during this mess as noted in yesterdays fix bryant told boston globe columnist jackie macmullan he was particularly angered that mr buss hasnt contacted him meanwhile a lakers insider was quoted in the los angeles times saying bryant deserves some of the blame for the franchises sorry state since he pushed for the trade of shaquille oneal in a charge bryant angrily denies "bryant better hope his owner is thick skinned " ms macmullan writes "theres no telling how buss will react to the biting comments of his superstar whom he is paying an average of nearly &# million a year " oneals departure was a team rending event that was the fault to some extent of all three principals mark heisler writes in the los angeles times yet they all shirk blame "this is how it works nobody is making anything up " mr heisler writes "everyone clings to a scenario that absolves them " looking at future scenarios espn coms bill simmons dreams up some tantalizing trade possibilities most notably a deal sending kobe to play alongside steve nash in phoenix "what a fascinating sociological experiment " mr simmons writes "if nash can turn kobe into a team player im voting him for our president even though hes canadian " one trade scenario makes little sense to mr simmons kobe to denver in the state where he successfully defended himself against rape charges "youd see o j move back to brentwood before youd see kobe accept a trade that puts him in colorado " mr simmons writes denver post columnist mark kiszla fervently hopes thats the case writing "the cost is too high for a prima donna who talks out of both sides of his mouth and sends mixed messages about his desire to depart los angeles or stay with the lakers in a single breath " mr kiszla adds "the last thing colorado needs is another kooky californian " the l a press would miss that kooky californian j a adande suggests in a farewell column in the l a times "looks like im leaving the times at the right moment if kobe bryant goes away hell take most of the good column material with him he has rendered the nba playoffs the stanley cup finals and every other sports story irrelevant with his non stop media parade " oh right the nba playoffs last night the san antonio spurs routed the utah jazz to clinch the western conference championship series in five games between a questionable decision by the nba to suspend two opposing players in the prior round and various injuries and other distractions plaguing the jazz the spurs have enjoyed good luck in this postseason buck harvey writes in the san antonio express news "now the only question is this will it be the cavaliers or the pistons who lose their luggage on their way to san antonio next week " utahs future is bright sort of gordon monson writes in the salt lake tribune "the jazz with a few tweaks maybe a major one have the makings of an nba title contender over the next three or four postseasons " elsewhere in basketball news the washington city papers dave mckenna was dismayed recently to see a pickup game played in the nationals capital under losers out rules it may been a fluke but it got mr mckenna ruminating about proper playground style "along with being the local standard make it take it is a superior game the mandated possession change in losers outs mitigates the momentum a bucket brings to the scoring squad worse it eliminates the opportunity for the megalomaniacal high the in the zone sensation that even mediocre playground players can occasionally get by knocking down multiple shots within a matter of moments " the stanley cup finals can lose media attention without kobes help toronto star columnist damien cox was bored by the anaheim ducks defeat of the ottawa senators to take a series lead the problem too much dump and chase hockey "some people love this stuff and bully for them " mr cox writes "but television ratings suggest theres little appetite for such conservative hockey as we wander into june " meanwhile greg couch complains that the nhl has grown soft to expand on his theory the chicago sun times columnist checked in with two of the men who played the pugilistic hanson brothers of the classic movie "slap shot " remarkably dany heatley who scored points for ottawa this season and anaheims drew miller who didnt play a minute of regular season hockey each have the same number of points and shots on goal in this series orange county register columnist mark whicker explains how mr miller got a victory in the finals before he got a locker mr heatley meanwhile is playing playoff hockey thanks to the forgiveness of a bereft family "graham snyder wants dany heatley and the ottawa senators to play well in the stanley cup finals an infinitely more generous wish than might be expected from the man whose son died nearly four years ago as a consequence of heatleys misjudgment behind the wheel " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times ms elliott recounts the death of dan snyder and its aftermath for the snyder family and for mr heatley hockey blogger james mirtle reports from the scene of a very different championship canadas national juniors tournament "maybe im just a big softy but i dont know that ill ever get used to the scene i took in on sunday in vancouver " mr mirtle writes "in one dressing room jubilation gangly teenagers hooting hollering and posing for pictures with junior hockeys holy grail while the likes of pat quinn and gordie howe served up congratulations thirty feet down the hall cordoned off by a curtain like a lifeless body but certainly not out of earshot of the celebration were the medicine hat tigers or at least the few players who were unlucky enough to be called out for media availability after the most difficult loss of their young careers " atlanta falcons quarterback michael vicks alleged involvement in professional dogfighting as laid out in this si com investigative piece by george dohrmann has brought "to the national spotlight a barbaric practice that has no place in st century america " jeff jacobs writes in the hartford courant mr jacobs has a suggestion for nfl commissioner roger goodell "if vick is charged and found guilty goodell should make it a stipulation for his return that he do public service announcements to be aired during nfl telecasts explaining the brutality and illegality of dog fighting yep vick could be the cover boy of kindness " the campaign for a div i college football playoff long waged by the fix and many other sports columns but lacking the necessary support of big colleges has been joined by a powerful insider "he is the right man for the job he is fighting the right fight more than ever this is the right time " gary shelton writes in the st petersburg times "in other words university of florida president bernie machen doesnt stand a chance " tip of the fix cap to reader garey g ris found a good column
