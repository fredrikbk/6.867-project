the morning brief why israel and syria have little to say to each other online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here there is word this morning from israel of prime minister ehud olmert exploring new peace initiatives with syria but mr olmerts weak political standing at home syrias semi isolation over the hariri killing in lebanon and the regionwide malaise for peace and stability efforts suggest the idea could join many others that have been floated and forgotten senior israeli officials tell the associated press mr olmert is using a third party to seek information on what syria would offer if peace negotiations resume and that he might revive the idea of giving back the golan heights if among other measures syria cuts its ties to iran hezbollah and hamas syrian president bashar assad recently expressed a willingness to talk with israel prompting mr olmert to say he didnt believe mr assad was serious why this view would change wasnt immediately apparent mr olmerts political fate following a harsh official report on his conduct of last summers war in lebanon is in the hands of the labor party which is currently his junior governing partner but is undergoing a leadership transition that could see it leave his coalition he is also once again trying to find the proper response to renewed rocket attacks from gaza even as he nominally maintains peace making ties with a palestinian president who has no power to stop such attacks two rockets hit southern israel this morning and israel responded with two airstrikes with neither assault causing casualties meanwhile syria currently painting itself as the victim of foreign principally western interference wouldnt seem willing to give up the hezbollah card and other regional bargaining advantages in ways that could convince israel to come to the table and then there is the timing of leaks about mr olmerts exploratory moves the united nations security council yesterday voted with five notable abstentions to create an international tribunal to try the allegedly syrian killers of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri current prime minister fouad siniora who greeted the news with a visit to mr hariris grave has been seeking such a tribunal and has a government too weak to produce one itself hezbollah is one of the main opponents to such a move among the security council members who didnt back the u n measure were russia and china but despite their reticence it was passed under chapter seven of the u n charter which authorizes force and economic sanctions to deal with threats to international peace as le monde notes the tribunal which would be set up if lebanon doesnt create its own by june would be located outside the country and mostly be composed of international judges the u s britain and france were the principal backers of the tribunal but as the los angeles times notes the victory against syria at the u n could cost the u s on other fronts secretary of state condoleezza rice recently held talks with syrian counterparts seeking cooperation in stabilizing iraq and as it did with recent u s iran talks in baghdad the bush administration seems to be operating on the public assumption it can limit cooperation to that one subject but multiparty conflicts in the middle east are often used as currency in bargaining over others lebanon is also currently handling its armys standoff with an islamist militant group at a palestinian refugee camp near tripoli itself part of the wider phenomenon of radical militancy exported from iraq which has shown up in saudi arabia jordan gaza and elsewhere syrias role in the uprising at the camp isnt clear but as the washington post points out the u n decision provoked fears among lebanese authorities that syria will stir up more trouble in lebanon and none of this bodes well for any ambitions mr olmert has of dealing with damascus debut of a dubai futures contract making its debut early tomorrow morning in the persian gulf at p m et today will be the recently organized dubai mercantile exchanges middle east "sour" crude futures contract what the wall street journal calls "an alternative to the bellwether new york and london contracts for the black gold of texas and the north sea " it comes at a time when the worlds main benchmark the new york mercantile exchanges west texas intermediate represents a smaller share of global production is trading several dollars a barrel below other key crude markers and is viewed by some powerful market players as less relevant the journal says at the same time a greater role among national oil companies in the middle east the source of a third of global production and of proven petroleum reserves has been contributing to a shift in industry focus from american oil hubs to the mideast still "no one is claiming that nymexs busy energy market will cease to matter " the journal notes adding that the dubai contracts success isnt certain and that "some traders are vowing to sit on the sidelines until trading momentum builds " brocade may pay first backdating penalty brocade communications systems settlement with the securities and exchange commission of allegations it improperly issued stock option grants could be a model for how similar cases are resolved the wall street journal reports brocade whose backdating of option grants was one of the first cases to become public in the backdating epidemic has agreed to pay a &# million penalty making the technology firm the first company to pay a fine in connection with the scandal people familiar with the matter tell the journal two other companies have announced preliminary settlements that include penalties and brocade first struck a deal with the sec back in march but as more and more backdating cases were discovered the settlement was delayed "the rapid spread of backdating probes spurred a lengthy debate among the five sec commissioners about whether or not backdating warranted a penalty " the journal notes "in general levying penalties against companies involved in a financial fraud is a hot button issue for the commissioners republicans in general oppose them as a double hit to shareholders who already have been penalized once by being defrauded democrats argue that penalties serve as deterrents " in the brocade case it isnt clear how the sec decided whether and how shareholders were hurt the journal says also of note dow jones newswires

quote of the day "members continued to view the risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside although with turmoil in the subprime market appearing to have remained relatively well contained and business spending indicators suggesting a more encouraging outlook these downside risks were judged to have diminished slightly members agreed that considerable uncertainty attended the prospects for inflation and the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as desired remained the committees predominant concern " read the minutes of the federal reserves policy making committees may meeting which suggested there is greater confidence in the u s economys strength at the central bank and persistent vigilance toward inflation in addition to the feds principal inflation worry a tight u s labor market the minutes show concern about pricing pressure that originates beyond american shores "economic activity in the rest of the world continued to advance briskly participants noted that strong foreign expansion should help to underpin demand for u s exports but expressed some concern that the strength of global demand could contribute to price pressures at home prices of non energy commodities especially metals had moved up markedly since the previous meeting moreover inflationary pressures in a number of overseas economies appeared to have increased of late perhaps partly in response to heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries and this development had the potential to add to the prices of u s imports in that regard several participants noted that the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period could reinforce the upward pressure on import prices " write to joseph schuman at joseph schuman wsj com some links in
