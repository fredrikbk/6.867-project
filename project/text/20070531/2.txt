a good immigration bill immigration reform is very tough its an issue that divides both political parties and on the right has led many close personal and ideological friends people we respect and whose criticism we take seriously to oppose new rules governing how people enter this country and how we handle those who are here illegally but we hope our friends reconsider we support the immigration reform compromise worked out in the senate for a few simple reasons it strengthens our national defense it makes our economy more competitive and flexible it enhances the rule of law and promotes national unity and it also does these things in a fair practical way heres what the bill does not do it does not grant amnesty to the million illegal immigrants already in the country and nor does it give a free pass to others who want to enter the country illegally the bill provides real border security for the first time protecting us against the entry of terrorists and stemming the flow of illegal drugs it doubles the border patrol expands the border fence and informs law enforcement about foreign nationals in the united states because it requires foreign workers to carry tamper proof identification both law enforcement and employers will be able to identify and apprehend those who violate the law the temporary worker program will reduce the number of people trying to sneak past the border patrol allowing law enforcement to focus on those who pose a threat to the u s by putting border security first this immigration reform adds a provision that many republicans suggested last year it adopts the "trigger" mechanism suggested by sen johnny isaacson a georgia republican until and unless security improves on the border the temporary worker program and "z" visa provision for three year work permits will not be implemented second the bill strengthens american economic competitiveness the high tech economy of the st century and the rise of china and india as economic powerhouses have left us with a stark choice we must be home to the worlds most skilled workers if we are to have the worlds highest living standards the immigration reform takes a step in this direction by ensuring that we as a country do a better job in granting visas to immigrants with the skills we need we should welcome more computer programmers engineers and scientists and this legislation admits more of these highly skilled workers our economy also needs to be flexible the temporary worker proposal deals with job shortages in critical areas expanding and contracting our labor supply based on market needs not politics additionally providing legal status to workers already in the u s adds them to the tax rolls this will protect american taxpayers now bearing the burden of illegal immigrants who use public services but who dont pay taxes third the immigration reform reinforces the rule of law in a practical and fair way today those in the country illegally live and work without penalty doing nothing is the real amnesty under this bill illegal immigrants would be required to pay fines pass strict background checks remain employed and maintain a clean record to stay in the u s getting these million people out of the shadows will enhance our national security it will also be fair to the legal immigrants who have waited patiently in line to apply for a green card illegal immigrants would have to learn english and american civics and return to their home country to apply from the back of the line the american legal system has a long tradition of reducing penalties for lawbreakers who come forward and admit their guilt the penalties in this legislation are consistent with this tradition finally the immigration reform bill will strengthen americas culture our national motto "e pluribus unum" out of many one explains one of the key ways our nation is different from other nations america is uniquely focused on your destination in life not your origins an individuals race creed or national origin isnt what matters what matters is that persons work ethic heart dreams and aspirations our nation has become one out of many because we are a nation that assimilates newcomers its why no one thinks of st patricks day as a foreign holiday and why some of americas best cuisine is italian unlike the status quo the proposed immigration reform would strengthen american culture and reinforce assimilation by requiring new citizens to learn english and master american civics both of us have spent much of our professional lives working to help build the republican party we believe this legislation will be good for the gop hispanic americans are natural republicans many tend to be pro life pro military and pro small business last year republican pollster david winston conducted a national poll in which he asked registered voters to rate themselves along a to scale from very liberal to very conservative he found that overall the country was center right and hispanic americans viewed themselves as slightly to the right of the country as a whole hispanics are also the fastest growing segment of our population salsa outsells ketchup and tacos outsell hot dogs one out of eight people under in nebraska is hispanic republicans have shown we can win hispanic voters when we reach out weve also seen what happens when republicans adopt a different approach california used to be reagan country a reliably red state that along with texas and florida provided the gop with a huge electoral college advantage in california republicans embraced proposition which denied illegal immigrants public services the proposition passed and the gop won the governors mansion in the short term but alienated the fastest growing constituency in the state california has leaned democratic ever since no republican presidential nominee has won the state since republican senate candidates have repeatedly gone down to defeat and our only successful candidate for governor has been the uniquely popular arnold schwarzenegger the immigration reform before congress is far from perfect its a compromise after all but on balance we are convinced that this legislation is the right choice it represents progress in making america safer and stronger progress in making our economy more competitive and flexible progress in reinforcing the rule of law and progress in the important work of national unity doing nothing is not an option mr bush is a former republican governor of florida and mr mehlman is the former chairman of the republican national committee
