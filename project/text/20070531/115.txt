why your car has lousy gas mileage despite big technological advances in auto design fuel efficiency has stagnated since the s with summer driving season on the horizon more consumers are taking a closer look at the fuel efficiency of their cars and wondering why they get such lousy mileage after all many drivers recall cars built in the s and s that went a long way on a gallon of gasoline using engine technology that seems crude today some cars like the honda crx the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette could log miles per gallon or more on the highway yet despite huge advances in auto technology bringing everything from satellite navigation and crash avoidance radar to computer controlled engines that rarely need tune ups passenger vehicles fuel economy hasnt improved appreciably in the past or even years the fuel efficiency issue is particularly acute right now as gasoline prices soar above &# a gallon in many regions some suv and pickup truck owners will cringe when it takes &# to fill their tanks but even car drivers will feel the sting of the rising cost as a fill up that set them back &# a few months ago now registers upward of &# the apparent lack of progress in improving fuel economy is tied to a host of trends in the auto industry and u s consumer culture a long running focus on vehicle safety has resulted in cars growing heavier over time as manufacturers used more metal to strengthen structures and added heavy safety gear including antilock brakes airbags and electronic traction control systems cars also are larger overall and models that started out as subcompacts have grown to become more like midsize models honda motor co s civic crx a mid s two seater of years ago was feet long and weighed about pounds todays civic sedan is nearly three feet longer and weighs about pounds more even the smaller honda fit considered almost impossibly small today is larger than the mid s civic crx the considerable advances in auto technology in recent decades has benefited engines structure and passenger comfort most of the effort in improving engine performance however has gone toward increasing horsepower instead of improving fuel economy so while cars of all types are generally faster than the sports cars of years ago their fuel economy seems relatively poor thanks largely to the energy required to move their added weight even the environmental protection agency advises drivers to save fuel by cutting their cars weight avoid cluttering the car with unnecessary items it recommends especially heavy ones an extra pounds in a vehicle may reduce your miles per gallon by as much as development of german car maker bmw ags long running series model has led to the model weighing more than pounds compared with about pounds years ago in the series predecessor called the weighed about pounds of course todays model is faster roomier more luxurious and easier to drive than earlier versions its horsepower has also roughly doubled since the company says it uses ever lighter components to keep weight under control on several models including plastic fenders and carbon fiber roof panels while the trend toward bigger heavier cars is well established long development cycles in the auto industry can still make it difficult for car makers to judge shifts in consumer preferences indeed some vehicles arriving in dealerships now seem particularly ill timed toyota motor corp s scion compact car unit is rolling out the second generation of its boxy xb when the company developed its strategy for the new xb more than two years ago it focused on making the car bigger more powerful and safer instead of improving fuel economy as a result the xbs mileage ratings are miles per gallon in the city mpg highway not so impressive when compared with current small cars like the chevrolet hhr mpg city mpg highway the honda fit city highway or the old scion xb mpg city mpg highway toyotas prius has the highest fuel economy rating among production vehicles on the market in the u s conventional gasoline powered models like the honda civic honda fit chevrolet aveo and toyota yaris log about mpg on the highway government regulations have done little to push car makers to make more efficient vehicles while corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards call for cars to average miles per gallon light trucks are held to a lower standard of mpg in his recent state of the union address president bush proposed improving fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks by a year through under current federal rules auto makers passenger car fleets have to reach an average of miles per gallon a standard that hasnt changed since suvs and other light trucks must meet a standard of mpg auto makers can be reluctant to embrace smaller fuel efficient cars because historically they have not sold well in the bigger is better u s market whether they were the american bantams and crosleys of the s and s or ford motor co s pinto and general motors corp s chevrolet vega of the s cars designed to be easy on fuel often were regarded as mundane necessities by consumers often purchased during periods of high gasoline prices or shortages they often were traded in for something larger once gas prices fell again one sign that this trend may be abating is the apparent high level of buyer interest in the smart fortwo a tiny two seat car from daimlerchrysler ag set to go on sale in the u s next year but despite its small size the fortwo gets only about miles a gallon hardly a fuel efficiency breakthrough even now it isnt certain that high fuel prices will compel many drivers to switch to more economical cars besides families tend to have more than one vehicle so they can park the gas guzzler when fuel prices are high art spinella president of research company cnw marketing research in bandon ore says surveys show households that own a toyota prius hybrid sedan have an average household fuel economy of miles per gallon those that own a hulking dodge ram pickup truck with a fuel thirsty hemi engine have an overall rating of miles per gallon when gasoline gets expensive he says "people change the way they utilize the family fleet " see related letter "letters to the editor labeling changes distort fuel economy ratings" wsj june corrections &amp amplfications a honda
