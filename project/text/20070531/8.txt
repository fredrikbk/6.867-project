a family dilemma gets rerun dow joness bancrofts might find lessons in publishing fight the proud family that controls a media company and a venerable newspaper is split some family members want to sell others cant stomach the prospect of giving up the companys independence potential buyers are circling this isnt the story of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal rather it is what freedom communications inc publisher of the orange county register in california encountered in the result was that the controlling hoiles family shunned a higher offer made jointly by industry giants gannett co and medianews group inc and took a lower one from blackstone group and providence equity partners the buyout firms bought out some family shareholders but allowed those who wanted to stay in to retain a stake in the company keeping freedom in family hands thats a scenario that some investment bankers and others are buzzing about as dow joness controlling bancroft family considers a &# billion bid from news corp even family members who are willing to listen to details from news corp chairman rupert murdoch dont have much taste for mr murdochs fox news channel people familiar with the bancrofts say that is why some of them are hoping for a "white knight" solution that might preserve dow joness independence while rewarding shareholders the newspaper industry has changed dramatically since the freedom deal was struck and dow jones has public shareholders to consider unlike the situation facing family owned freedom then theres the premium news corp is offering over dow joness stock price prior to the offer which has scared off many private equity players and others who could help engineer a solution still a case study of the freedom deal was shown to several dow jones executives at the time of that deal including chief executive richard f zannino who was then chief financial officer according to people familiar with the matter but any such solution would be difficult to sell to dow joness common stock holders if it didnt offer the same rich premium as mr murdochs bid so far dow joness board has taken no formal action on mr murdochs offer the boards position is that because the bancrofts dont want to sell any consideration of the offer would be a futile exercise in a sign of how nonfamily shareholders might react to a lower offer the companys largest outside shareholder t rowe price group inc which through its funds owns of the companys total shares outstanding as of march said dow joness board should consider mr murdochs offer regardless of what the bancrofts want "the board has an obligation to consider an offer and alternatives " said t rowe chairman and chief investment officer brian c rogers "in our view this looks like a full and fair offer and the board has a duty to consider it in due course and either evaluate it carefully or come up with plan b " representatives of t rowe price talked to dow joness mr zannino and chairman m peter mcpherson before the companys latest board meeting on may to urge the board to take a stance on the offer the board didnt change its position and a spokesman for dow jones referred to the companys statement from may that said the board would take "no action" on the offer given the bancrofts opposition to the deal under delaware law the bancrofts who control of the voting shares of dow jones have broad latitude to vote down any deal they dont like the company has said that votes representing of the total voting shares are opposed to the deal the trickier legal question can the family impose an alternative and potentially lower priced transaction on the rest of the companys shareholders "the parallels are significant" between dow jones and freedom says scott flanders chief executive of freedom who was one of the companys independent directors at the time of the sale "minority shareholders cannot compel a majority to auction the business to the highest bidder and they shouldnt be able to " so far no alternate bidder has surfaced to buy dow jones and wall street investment bankers say other potential acquirers are loath to pay the &# a share price offered by mr murdoch the hefty premium offered by mr murdoch serves to fend off other publicly listed suitors who may have a hard time explaining the price to shareholders private equity firms have been skittish about the newspaper industrys prospects and were unwilling to seriously enter the bidding in the most recent newspaper auctions of knight ridder and tribune co tribune ended up agreeing to a deal at roughly nine times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda according to deutsche bank estimates mr murdochs bid for dow jones is roughly times the companys ebitda deutsche bank says "i dont think any private equity firm would think they were getting a great deal if they came in at &# to become a minority holder in dow jones " says paul ginocchio media analyst at deutsche bank "there are a lot of third ways but the blocking factor is the &# a share price and thats why rupert made the offer he did " dow jones shares yesterday were up &# or to &# in p m new york stock exchange trading the bancroftss hope to find an alternate deal raises a host of knotty legal and ethical issues around the familys power its obligation to all shareholders and the role of the companys directors considering an offer for less than &# a share would be an especially sensitive issue for dow joness independent directors yet it would perhaps be the familys best way to reward shareholders while thwarting mr murdoch some family members have discussed selling a minority stake in the company to an investor who might use that stake as part of a larger takeover in the future there is also the possibility that the family and an outside party could make an offer for the entire company with the family rolling over its stake and therefore reducing the final buyout price for a buyer with which it felt more comfortable
