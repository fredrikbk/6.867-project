lawnmower engine maker once had the lead in hybrids "we are all seeing our personal mobility threatened by rising petroleum prices and dwindling resources the fundamental appeal of electric cars is that they allow us to use energy sources other than petroleum on the road " a quote from a major auto maker rolling out a new hybrid concept at a recent auto show no in november briggs &amp stratton corp the wauwatosa wis based maker of lawnmower engines rolled out its sleek futuristic plug in hybrid electric concept car with the very same motivations and goals as todays car makers on earth day the following spring the manufacturer hauled it to washington d c and demonstrated the car running on domestically produced ethanol like todays toyota prius the b&amp s hybrid sported hump backed styling for minimal aerodynamic drag the forward looking design was penned by the agency of famed industrial designer brooks stevens who is credited with sketching the willys jeepster harley davidson hydra glide evinrude outboard boat motor and the oscar mayer weinermobile it used a parallel hybrid system which like the prius allowed the car to run on either gas power electric power or both unlike the current u s market prius the driver could select the mode toyota has noticed the desire of consumers to choose electric drive and under the right circumstances the next generation highlander crossover suv will permit that choice motor trend magazines march test found that the cars plug in electric only range was between and miles enough for many people to commute to and from work without using the gas motor in hybrid mode the cars range was about miles an unorthodox aspect of the b&amp s car is the use of six wheels this wasnt because of some forgotten s fad though there were a few six wheeled formula one cars built at about the same time so maybe it was the extra pair of rear wheels were there to address a problem that plagues electric car designers to this day the weight of the batteries needed to power the electric motor powering this motor was a pound pack of deep cycle lead acid batteries the kind you would use to run an electric boat motor putting this kind of weight in a car creates real problems so in a time when the business cliche "think outside the box " had yet to be coined much less flogged to meaninglessness b&amp s engineers hit upon the idea of carrying the batteries on their own separately sprung axle in a captive trailer this kept the car from feeling so heavy when driving over bumps or going around curves even though the mass was still there to be accelerated and stopped "we had to use a lot of ingenuity to make it work " recalled bob mitchell then briggs &amp strattons manager of advanced research and now a senior research analyst who consults for the company while the trailer solution helped isolate the weight of the batteries from the rest of the car the concept car was built with little consideration for crash safety he said "i wouldnt have wanted all those batteries to come thundering forward in a crash " mitchell chuckled the b&amp s hybrid employed a then conventional drivetrain layout with a gas engine at the front sending the power to a four speed manual transmission and then to a solid rear axle suspended by leaf springs rather than a traditional large heavy car engine though the hybrid used a briggs &amp stratton air cooled twin cylinder horsepower industrial commercial engine with an horsepower electric motor installed between the gas engine and the transmission interestingly b&amp s identified the traditional four speed manual transmission as a shortcoming the companys prescribed solution a continuously variable transmission exactly the transmission employed by toyota when it introduced the prius the gas engine was designed for constant speed industrial use so the carburetor wasnt calibrated for the on and off the gas use seen in a car which created a few hiccups however driving the b&amp s hybrid was little different from other cars of the day reports mr mitchell though it was a bit slower "it was just like a normal car except you could select whether you wanted to run on the electric motor or the gas engine " he said "there was more acceleration with the electric motor because of its immediate torque so you could even spin the wheels " but that hard launch quickly petered out "it wouldnt have that sustainable acceleration when you got up to or miles per hour and it took a long long time to get to " richard petty held the pedal to the metal long enough for the hybrid to reach its top speed of miles per hour in a test at the now defunct riverside international raceway briggs &amp stratton toured the car around the u s in an effort to drum up interest in cars using its small engines at a time when concern about fuel economy was high enough that people commonly carpooled and even rode mopeds to work todays advanced electronic controls make driving hybrids nearly seamless &lt ndash&gt and quiet without those electronics the old b &amp s hybrid produced buzzes and clicks from its controllers and mechanical relays "that technology would certainly have helped our project " observed mr mitchell now general motors corp is trying a similar idea in january the auto maker unveiled a concept car the volt that uses a small engine running at an optimal steady speed to generate electricity to maintain the charge on the cars battery pack the volt will likely avoid the hiccups that plagued briggs &amp strattons effort thanks to modern electronics but gm has said current batteries would be too heavy perhaps two axles in the back would solve the problem mr carney is an automotive freelance writer based in herndon va
