cox vows to penetrate soft dollar fog sec chairman urges congress to eliminate fee research bundling securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox is urging congress to consider repealing legal protections for arrangements that allow money managers to pay above average brokerage commissions on customers trades congress gave the green light to so called "soft dollar" deals in on condition that such deals provide items that money managers can use to benefit investors such stock research the sec has taken a harder stance recently on industry practices and its chairman now wants lawmakers to repeal or substantially modify protections for soft dollar arrangements mr cox told dow jones newswires that with current law in place regulators "can only go so far with reform" of soft dollar practices an outright ban which would require congressional action would be preferable in his view in a letter last week to senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd d conn and house financial services committee chairman barney frank d mass the sec chief called for a legislative fix to soft dollar use mr cox is expected to elaborate on his views on the subject in a speech in new york on thursday he told dow jones newswires "the secs embarked on a campaign to make investing more understandable for retail investors this fog that surrounds soft dollars makes investing harder not easier for ordinary investors " more clarity less confusion and possibly lower fees could spring from a ban on such deals according to the chairman money managers who take part in soft dollar deals may pay as much as five cents a share in brokerage commissions on customer trades far more than the one to two cents per share commission for no frills automated trading that doesnt come with research some money managers refuse to accept soft dollar perks and insist on paying for research separately while others ask brokerage firms to break out fees for trading and research "unbundling" the soft dollar package individual investors often have to dig to find out whether their mutual fund manager uses soft dollars even though trading commissions are paid out of fund assets a lack of transparency that mr cox decries as a hidden cost that is confusing to investors conflicts of interest are another concern best remedied by outright repeal of soft dollar deals he said he noted that such deals may cause money managers to engage in excessive trading of client portfolios to obtain soft dollar benefits or to direct trades to brokers who offer research that the manager wants rather than to brokers who can best execute clients trades money managers who oversee various mutual funds or asset pools may use soft dollar benefits obtained from one group of clients to benefit another yet another conflict that may compromise investor protections in his view mr coxs call to ban soft dollar deals hasnt been cleared with others on the five member commission and it isnt clear how it will be received in congress or on wall street brokerage firms that receive above average commissions and their soft dollar counterparties mutual funds pension funds and other money managers might balk at an outright ban on what has become a widespread industry practice third party research providers meanwhile have expressed concern that demand for their services might evaporate if soft dollar arrangements disappear the sec chief declined to predict what congress will do but noted that legislators from both parties "have long been concerned about the conflicts of interest" posed by soft dollar usage should soft dollar deals be outlawed mr cox predicts that investment research will continue to be bought and sold but in a more direct and transparent way
