million chairman and chief executive philip schoonover said the latest changes will mark the midpoint in his restructuring plans for the company "we think were in the middle act of a three act play "

of the retailers u s stores the job reductions will be done through attrition and layoffs circuit city also will eliminate about of the roughly workers at its richmond va headquarters the retailer has employees overall the staff shuffle is its second overhaul in three months in march the retailer let go higher paid store level employees and replaced them with lower paid workers to pare expenses even with the cutbacks mr schoonover said the retailer will be adding more jobs than it eliminates this year as a result of new store openings and the growth of its firedog unit which provides home installation and computer support services and though it is cutting back on senior managers he said it will create a new midlevel "supervisor" position that will include management responsibility "it will actually create more opportunities for our frontline associates to be promoted " mr schoonover said circuit city dominated electronics retailing for part of the s and s and is still the no independent electronics retailer in the u s by sales behind best buy but the company faltered amid strategic missteps in recent years including a distracting plunge into divx a dvd technology that charged customers for each viewing and into the car business with its carmax inc unit circuit city shuttered divx in spun off carmax in and rejected buyout bids from mexican financier carlos slim helu in and a hedge fund highfields capital management lp in since taking charge of the company months ago mr schoonover has launched several efforts to try to return circuit city to its former prominence he is revamping nearly every aspect of the electronic retailers business including how it sells tvs where it opens new stores and how it structures its work force yet those changes are still nascent

c bernstein &amp co analyst colin mcgranahan store level staff shake ups arent rare at electronics retailers these days but few are as broad as the changes circuit city is making according to steve baker vice president at research firm npd group in port washington n y "given circuit citys financial performance i think pressure is on them " mr baker said the volatile tv category has hampered circuit city sales the most in recent months the retailer depends on tv sets for of its sales compared with of sales for best buy bernsteins mr mcgranahan says so circuit city has been hit harder as growing competition to sell popular flat panel tvs has caused prices to plummet in the past year including declines of for the most coveted models rather than pull back from tvs mr schoonover plans to
