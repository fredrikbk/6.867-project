described as the peaceful nuclear ambitions of syrias ally iran "as someone from the east you should understand iran is a strong power and should be recognized as such " he told mr ban a south korean "they have the capacity to cause disturbances throughout the middle east and beyond " both the u n and a syrian diplomat said they couldnt comment on any private conversations between messrs assad and
