fashion conscious shoppers these days then theres allen edmonds oxfords tassel moccasins penny loafers now heres a brand in need of resuscitation eighty five years old with flat revenue and an aging boomer clientele its new private equity owners goldner hawn johnson &amp morrison inc which bought an stake last year are now advocating an overhaul but instead of following the rest of the high fashion accessories industry allen edmonds is digging in its heels with a wingtip and a prayer its expanding with a strategy to make new assets of old world service and quality allen edmondss timing may be fortuitous despite all the hype about the emergence of the metrosexual a few years back most men havent embraced fast moving fashion trends as marketers predicted in fact evidence is growing among retailers that many men are again gravitating toward classic styling in both apparel and footwear "a lot of fashionable men are wearing a lot more traditional footwear " agrees rachel jones a footwear editor for worth global style network in london allen edmonds shoe corp s shoes come in classic styles redolent of choate and st albans they are some of the last truly american made shoes created in port washington wis and lewiston maine the shoes feature special lasts and an inner cork lining that conforms to their owners foot because they dont have the typical metal shank the shoes are meant to caress the foot without a breaking in period when they are worn out you can send them back to be "re crafted" a process involving among other things scraping out the cork lining and replacing sole and heel these shoes are intended to become heirlooms priced from &# to &# in the upper middle range of the mens shoe market they are sent out the store door with a final polish in a shoe box so well constructed that you can hardly bear to toss it out but all this hasnt been enough to stop sales from eroding some stores like the nordstroms at the grove shopping center in los angeles have been discontinuing allen edmonds in favor of flashier more disposable styles though a nordstroms salesman there told me some customers have clamored to have them back while aging baby boomers are a good business for luxury brands these customers wont live forever if you are under in fact you may not even know allen edmonds brian walker a year old project manager for innovation consultants ideo had never heard of the shoemaker when he was asked to help conceive a new retail concept for them he asked his grandmother about the brand "it turned out that my grandfather was buried in allen edmond shoes and wore them all his life my father received them as a graduation present yet somehow i had never heard of them " says mr walker i tried the name out on my own father in law who once ran his familys shoe manufacturing company rubin brothers footwear it turns out that cyrus rubin too has long worn allen edmonds thus prompted he introduced me to the benefits of welt construction he informed me of allen edmondss sewn together quality compared with more expensive fashion forward shoes at which he scoffed and mumbled about cement construction a single glued on sole can be fashionably thinner he said but a sewn together bottom and midsole will cradle a mans foot a kindness to joints arches and heels after three generations rubin brothers footwear factories went the way of the rest of the u s shoemaking industry battered by cheap imports by little was left but a host of regrets and a pair of unworn samples in my in laws east th street closet allen edmonds is one of the few shoe companies that have managed to survive while manufacturing here alden shoe co in middleborough mass is another when richard nixon wore his wingtips on the beach they were aldens the company has been told alden has stayed lean and paid close attention to its aging customers this is a world without fleeting trends "our best selling shoes tend to be our best sellers for decades " says bob clark aldens vice president of sales yet its essential for these pedigreed companies to draw the attention of their customers sons and grandsons michael sweeney goldners managing partner

the country controlling its own retail environment will allow it to better market quality and services like re crafting without hiring a famous designer or expanding into new risky products the first
