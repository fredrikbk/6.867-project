tough extraction miners daunting task digging in risky zones scarce copper deposits make congo a hot spot demand vs danger lubumbashi congo the worlds biggest mining companies hungry for metals increasingly tapped out in developed countries are plunging into risky new terrain that means mining executives are setting up operations in some of the most violent politically turbulent places like the tenke fungurume copper and cobalt mine that phelps dodge approved here in december expatriate homes for tenke staff have panic buttons and full time guards workers do role playing exercises in which fake armed authorities detain them one of the first to arrive in the area was jeff best a general manager hired to help head up operations mr best is a fifth generation phelps employee with a background in the military including experience as a platoon sergeant for a machine gun unit in the first gulf war his resume also included a stint at a remote indonesian mine for freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc phelpss parent company it didnt take long for mr best along with his wife stacy and their two daughters to realize the unpredictable nature of their new setting a once grand provincial capital with crumbling cobblestone streets on mrs bests first visit the power went out for seven hours while her husband was away at a meeting another day a man wandered onto their street carrying an ak and a rocket propelled grenade launcher "i was a little on edge " mrs best recalls "you get used to it " during much of the current world wide commodity boom mining companies focused large parts of their operations on countries with low political risk and reliable infrastructure such as the u s canada chile and australia but deposits in those places are being depleted just as in the oil industry that leaves companies little option but to press into more volatile zones especially africa until a few years ago the congo was home to a civil war that left as many as four million people dead recently u s state department travel advisories warned visitors of "unofficial" armed militias that "pillage carjack kill extra judicially rape and kidnap " the world bank rates the congo as the worlds single worst place to do business more difficult than iraq and afghanistan but mining companies need to feed the worlds raging demand for commodities especially in industrializing china where consumption of copper nickel and aluminum has tripled or more over the past decade some analysts predicted chinas raw material orders would have fizzled out by now but theyve only soared over the past year chinese copper imports shot up nearly if all goes according to plan the tenke fungurume mine will yield some million pounds of copper a year with production starting as early as the cost of the project more than &# million and the congo which also has huge deposits of gold tin and other metals could represent a lucrative new frontier for the mining industry now that safer fields are running out western mining companies previously eschewed large projects in high risk areas in part because they worried that metals prices might not stay aloft now confident that growth in china will keep demand strong for years they are charging into all sorts of difficult areas including sierra leone liberia and papua new guinea some have even mulled investments in a giant copper mine in afghanistan in the congo alone more than a dozen other major mining companies are at work and others are looking to invest there tenke fungurume was a major draw for freeport which acquired phelps in a &# billion transaction in march john fenn phelps dodges senior vice president for africa acknowledges that doing business in the congo is "especially challenging " but he adds "as a resource company the way you grow is you have to go after the resources " the project requires more than million bricks and as much as miles of chain link fence far beyond any local suppliers capabilities in a country more than three times the size of texas there are less than miles of paved roads that can transport imported supplies first discovered in tenke fungurume is estimated to contain ore that is in some cases times as rich in copper than whats found in similar mines in other places where most of the easy to mine copper has already been extracted mine officials say that means the mine can be profitable even if copper prices fall to &# a pound from more than &# now in some areas the congolese copper is so close to the surface that it spills out onto the ground and is visible from satellite images in the s investors including former u s oil company amoco corp poured more than &# million into the site before bailing out because of the congos chronic instability and shattered infrastructure anglo american plc of london now one of the worlds largest mining companies by market capitalization built some housing at the site but moved on as well in the early part of this decade phelps dodge entered the picture founded in it had once specialized in frontier territories it helped tame the wild west by building railroads hospitals and schools at mines in arizona new mexico and mexico phelps had never developed a major new project in africa but saw that things were looking up in the congo after a peace deal that ended most of the fighting the government with help from the world bank passed a new mining code to attract more investors phelps dodge had taken out an option to invest in tenke fungurume in and started building up its team in the congo in when the regions worst violence was largely finished that year the company paid &# million to the government and agreed to make sizable future payments and investments giving phelps a stake in the project the remaining shares are held by tenke mining corp a canadian company and gecamines congos state copper mining company in late phelpss board gave conditional approval for the initial phase of the project pending an agreement with congolese authorities to improve power supplies in the region political tensions in congo have eased significantly in recent years last year the country held its first multiparty elections in more than four decades but other big problems remain congo has one of the worlds most dysfunctional economies with a fragile government little in the way of basic infrastructure and widespread poverty and desperation conflict continues in some areas especially places with natural resources and corruption is endemic exposing foreign companies to routine requests for bribes basic amenities like banks and reliable medical facilities are scarce mining companies face the additional problem of dealing with tens of thousands of "informal" mine workers who park themselves on old or abandoned mines and eke out a living by prying out small quantities of raw minerals often in dangerous circumstances when foreign mining companies take over they typically improve safety standards and boost production but they cant afford to employ all the informal miners setting the stage for unrest at least two mining workers have been killed in recent years and numerous others attacked or harassed in an australian mining company anvil mining ltd was caught up in a bloody local dispute in which congolese soldiers commandeered anvil vehicles to attack and kill rebels and civilians in a nearby town anvil has said it had no knowledge of the militarys plans in march in the congolese capital of kinshasa rival political factions clashed in the streets forcing phelps to confine its employees in kinshasa to their homes more than people were killed in the violence "we know there are going to be some ups and downs a country this size will go through " says mr fenn who has worked in peru and chile and has a reputation among colleagues for caution "when youre a company like this you just have to mitigate those risks " in past commodity booms mining companies overexpanded when times were good only to face underperforming mines or even losses when commodity prices fell and some mines werent needed other mining companies who arrived in recent years already are running into trouble united kingdom based nikanor plc which is developing a large project in the same province as tenke fungurume recently said costs have surged beyond estimates and that it might have to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the project going the project has suffered from heavy rains and delays analysts say the tenke fungurume site is miles from lubumbashi a provincial capital that serves as the mines administrative headquarters the trip by land can take eight hours decades ago lubumbashi was known for cobblestone streets equestrian clubs and mansions with green tiled roofs a legacy of the belgians who ruled the congo for nearly a century until their brutal reign inspired joseph conrads classic novella "heart of darkness " which drew on the authors travels in the congo over the past several decades the congo suffered from extreme neglect and chaos as strongman ruler mobutu sese seko plundered the countrys mines and allowed the country to sink into disarray he was overthrown in by laurent kabila and congo descended into war culminating in the assassination of mr kabila that left the country in the hands of his shy young son joseph today few echoes of the colonial era remain in lubumbashi other than the uniformed waiters in a local hotel called planet hollybum who serve smoked salmon to french speakers drinking pastis outside united nations vehicles patrol the potholed streets at the local university ceilings long ago caved in and windows are blasted out neither mr best nor mr fenn had experience in the congo nor did they speak french or swahili common languages here they relied partly on claude polet a belgian native and former gecamines employee with more than years in the region he was appointed managing director of the project the team also hired a former belgian soldier with experience in baghdad to help supervise security they set up an operations center that can track company vehicles as they snake through town and prohibited most employees from going anywhere without drivers a "quick response" team is on call to handle emergencies advocacy groups in the congo and elsewhere are pressing the congolese government to revise or cancel its contracts with foreign mining companies they believe the contracts were signed without sufficient transparency and dont provide enough benefits to the local population the congolese government has said it is reviewing the contracts for problems phelps officials say their legal footing remains secure meanwhile in the area surrounding tenke fungurume malaria is common and skilled workers are in short supply some villagers live too close to the mine site and have to be relocated traveling by local roads is hazardous partly because grass can grow as high as feet tall obscuring animals and people that wander onto the roadway at the mine site itself situated on a lush green hillside construction is just getting under way forty ton dump trucks and giant excavators rumble around the site on newly built dirt roads often passing by thatched roof houses as they clear areas for construction crews have been marking off areas that will have to be cleared and a camp for local workers is being built reminders of failed past efforts are still visible including a strange circular pad of concrete on the side of a hill and some underground tunnels "this is one of the last mining wildernesses " mr best said one day recently as he toured the area which is surrounded by mile after mile of scrubby savannah and hills "even in south america " where phelps dodge has invested heavily "theyve pretty much kicked over every rock " to get the materials they need for construction mine officials distributed equipment to local residents to launch brick making businesses they ordered vehicles from as far away as south africa and rebuilt an airstrip near the mine mr best has imposed some of phelps dodges safety standards workers for instance are required to travel to and from the site in buses instead of riding down dirt roads in the back of pickup trucks still the tenke partners have yet to finalize a deal with the congolese government to upgrade power supplies upgrades that must be made before the project can be completed mine officials say they are confident all necessary agreements will eventually fall into place and they are proceeding with construction in order to meet the schedule they have laid out for the project many in the area appear to support the tenke fungurume project but residents in lubumbashi and elsewhere complain that foreign mining companies in general arent doing enough to dole out jobs and benefits tenke fungurume officials had to force two thousand or more illegal miners off of their site in lubumbashi some residents say they know new investment is needed but they still feel the congo is being exploited by foreigners itanga maruchi years old says his son is earning just congolese francs a week or about &# as a digger in a chinese controlled mine "theyre just using him " he says if that continues and resentment grows "theres a possibility we could have a violent confrontation " a phelps spokesman said "we are working hard to be fair to all parties and be a positive part of the congo " to foster local goodwill the tenke fungurume operators are improving local education by building two schools and refurbishing a third they say they have brought more teachers into the area and are providing one meal a day to students and offering basic medical care theyve also purchased some pair of oxen to help villagers who grow corn peanuts and other crops mr best and his team plan to hold a public cookout later this year to "bless" the hill where tenke fungurume is located for phelps workers and their families things have improved the bests two daughters have begun to master french and make friends the family has grown more comfortable with their home a spacious house with a german shepherd named lambeau and framed photographs of u s city skylines phoenix chicago and madison wis besides the bests say thanks to years of european influence its possible to get great wine here paul glader contributed to this
