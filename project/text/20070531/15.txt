buddy movie over cigars schwarzenegger speaker build unlikely bond how nunez helped drive governors left turn youre danny devito sacramento calif in late republican gov arnold schwarzenegger rode into office promising to "blow up" state bureaucracy and go over the heads of californias liberal legislature a few months later fabian nunez an outspoken critic of the new governor took over as speaker of the democratic run state assembly "i have declared political war on schwarzenegger " mr nunez said at the time now gov schwarzenegger calls mr nunez his "great friend " the year old governor and the year old speaker often talk over cigars in the smoking tent the governor has set up in a courtyard of the sacramento capitol building politically the two have come together to forge deals on raising the states minimum wage rebuilding infrastructure and passing a landmark anti global warming bill amid continuing criticism from their own parties theyre tackling thorny areas including health care reform after a failed effort to ram a conservative agenda through the legislature early in his tenure gov schwarzenegger shifted sharply to the center last year since this conversion to what he calls "post partisanship " the governor has been basking in the glow of mounting popularity but arguably much credit for californias new era of bipartisanship one of the most productive periods in the state legislatures recent history belongs with mr nunez "i am a results oriented person " the governor said in an interview "so is the speaker " their journey toward rapprochement one part political calculation another part personal ties forged over cigars in the governors backyard helps explain why california is beginning to solve problems that have vexed the golden state for years the state is becoming something of a national model for how the two parties can work together even after years of acrimony and messrs nunez and schwarzenegger have attracted the attention of the presidential campaigns two republican contenders arizona sen john mccain and former new york mayor rudolph giuliani have visited gov schwarzenegger to seek his advice on bridging partisan differences aides for the campaigns say in april new york sen hillary clinton named mr nunez one of national co chairs of her presidential campaign a job that calls for national campaigning and fund raising "he was able to demonstrate leadership and get the republicans in california to go along with him " said mo elleithee a spokesman for sen clinton "that is lacking in washington " messrs nunez and schwarzenegger share an outsiders perspective the governor came to the u s as a struggling bodybuilder from austria mr nunez was born in the u s one of children of mexican immigrant parents but in many ways they are opposites while gov schwarzenegger rode to power with a celebritys name recognition and a conservative mandate on many issues mr nunez worked his way out of a san diego barrio in mr nunezs parents moved the family from tijuana mexico to san diegos logan heights neighborhood to give their children a better education his father pablo worked as a gardener his mother soledad as a maid mr nunez was born in san diego making him eligible for u s citizenship mr nunez walked to school from the familys two bedroom apartment negotiating junkyards and transients "the odds were totally against him " says rachael ortiz executive director of barrio station a youth center where mr nunez went after school to practice for golden gloves boxing competitions mr nunez says many of his friends ended up in prison "somehow i slipped through the cracks " he says after attending the university of california at san diego on an academic scholarship and going on to graduate from pitzer college in claremont calif he went to work helping latino immigrants assimilate in the u s in part by teaching them english later in los angeles he organized for a local gasworkers union and the afl cio once getting into a brawl with four guards during a labor dispute antonio villaraigosa a former california state assembly speaker and now mayor of los angeles helped groom mr nunez to run for his old assembly seat in a low income district that includes east los angeles mr nunez was elected to the assembly the lower house of californias legislature in his charm and negotiating skills impressed people on both sides of the aisle "on day one people kept talking about this young kid from l a " says jim brulte then the republican minority leader of the state senate in an october special election gov schwarzenegger unseated democratic incumbent gray davis who was recalled by voters over his inability to deal with a huge state budget gap among other problems two months later mr nunez was nominated speaker of the states lower house he took office in early the two locked horns immediately the former actor used his action hero persona to take on the states financial problems telling voters to "terminate" legislators at the polls if they didnt go along with his budget mr nunez and others in the democrat led legislature fought his attempts to reduce funding for education and social services mr nunez was quoted by a mexico city newspaper as saying he had declared war on the governor on immigration issues vowing to fight gov schwarzeneggers attempts to keep undocumented immigrants from applying for drivers licenses mr nunez says he was misquoted by the newspaper la cronica the paper did not respond to written requests for comment in gov schwarzenegger derided the democratic legislators for refusing to sign off on his budget he called them "girlie men " mr nunez shot back in a sacramento bee article that quoted him as saying "i dont know that he wears lifts i know thats the rumor i dont even know that he wears makeup i know thats the rumor " but behind the scenes the two men had already begun to forge more cordial ties in december gov schwarzenegger hosted a dinner at his mansion in the brentwood section of los angeles in mr nunezs honor one of the governors actor friends danny devito was there at one point the speaker recalls gov schwarzenegger suggested that mr nunez join him in his backyard to smoke cigars "i remember walking out there and thinking this is a pretty big backyard " mr nunez says "then devito looks over and says do you mind if i join you i said of course youre danny devito " gov schwarzenegger also popped into the speakers office when mr nunezs parents were in town and paid a visit to mr nunezs new home in a suburban tract in sacramento "i knew right away when the torch was passed to him that he is the person i need to deal with " the governor said in public the clashes continued the governor in attempted to do an end run around the democrats by taking his conservative drive directly to voters through a series of ballot initiatives the measures would have curbed the power of democratic leaning unions to make political contributions for example and would have made it easier to fire teachers "this is a governor who wants the power to be king " mr nunez said that summer on pbss "newshour with jim lehrer " he called the initiatives an attack on working people "i came at him very hard " says mr nunez "i took him on on everything " in july gov schwarzenegger invited mr nunez to his brentwood home in a bid to head off a showdown over the measures the pair retired to patio chairs beside gov schwarzeneggers backyard pool to smoke cigars the governor wearing shorts sandals and a polo shirt the speaker in khakis at one point mr nunez recalls the governor turned to him and began talking about their common backgrounds "he said you and i are both immigrants " says mr nunez "he let his guard down a lot with me and his attitude was really about how do we make this work " the two failed to work out a political compromise that day by august gov schwarzeneggers popularity had dropped to compared with over after he was elected in november california voters roundly defeated the ballot measures with gubernatorial elections only a year away many believed gov schwarzenegger had no chance of reelection mr nunez having helped trounce the governor saw his political capital soar fellow democrats urged the speaker to press for advantage major contributors including the california teachers association the california correctional peace officers association and the states trial lawyers association advised him to keep attacking ahead of the polls a spokeswoman for the lawyers group the consumer attorneys of california said she was not aware of such lobbying from her association and said it isnt the groups practice to tell politicians what to do "the easiest thing for me to have done politically would have been to jump on the anti arnold bandwagon and take it all the way to the governors election " mr nunez says the speaker knew that while the governors approval ratings were low the state legislatures numbers were lower still the same survey that showed gov schwarzeneggers popularity had plummeted a field poll of registered voters showed that only of respondents thought the state legislature was doing a good job democratic lawmakers could have faced a backlash from voters if they had blocked progress in sacramento mr nunez says "i would have wasted a whole year " soon after the initiative debacle mr nunez says the governor confided to him that he would chart a more conciliatory course with the democrat dominated legislature in a meeting in the governors first floor office a few days after the election gov schwarzenegger brought together mr nunez state senate president pro tempore don perata and the two republican legislative leaders "he told us thats over with lets get to work " says kevin mccarthy then leader of the republican minority in the assembly soon after the governor announced he was replacing his republican chief of staff with a democrat "political courage is not political suicide " gov schwarzenegger says of the turnabout by this time mr nunez had become a regular visitor to the governors cigar smoking tent in one such visit shortly after the november elections the speaker suggested a bill he had recently agreed to sponsor that would cap greenhouse gas emissions in the state "i told the governor heres what i want to do " mr nunez recalls according to the speaker the governors eyes lit up he said im a republican but im a hollywood republican " gov schwarzenegger had already taken stands to protect forests and water quality on the global warming bill he faced opposition from his own party in california because many republicans said businesses would have to spend more to comply with its measures the governor agreed to sign the bill only if the state would consider letting businesses use market based approaches to capping emissions such as trading pollution credits the governor signed the bill in turning him into a world wide environmental hero and gaining him recognition as the "green governor " gov schwarzeneggers alliance with mr nunez has made both men targets of criticism within their own parties last year the governor drew opposition from one of his biggest supporters the california chamber of commerce when he threw his support behind a democratic bill that would raise the state minimum wage from &# an hour to &# the highest in the country by business leaders complained the increase would hurt state businesses gov schwarzenegger addressed some of their concerns when he rejected a democratic provision that would have tied future increases to inflation when the minimum wage bill was signed into law on sept mr nunez appeared at the governors side and thanked him for his leadership gov schwarzenegger referred to mr nunez as "my great friend " the law stung some democrats coming just a few weeks before the states november gubernatorial election the wage increase was seen as adding a pro labor feather to gov schwarzeneggers cap at the expense of the democrats own candidate then state treasurer phil angelides mr nunez was co chair of mr angelidess democratic campaign "the effect of fabian working with the governor undermined the ability of the democratic candidate " says donna berger director of government relations for the california nurses association a member union which was instrumental in helping defeat the governors reform initiatives in mr nunez says he campaigned hard on mr angelidess behalf he also acquiesced to requests from many in the party terminating his appearances with gov schwarzenegger in the final weeks before the election which the governor won by a landslide but mr nunez said that deals such as raising minimum wage shouldnt wait for politics "i said look this will help poor people " mr nunez says
