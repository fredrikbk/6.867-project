intensified some chrysler employees spotted a familiar figure striding through the main lobby at the auburn hills mich headquarters wolfgang bernhard was back in the days since the announcement that cerberus capital management llp would take an stake in chrysler mr bernhard the former no executive at chrysler and now a cerberus adviser has taken an increasingly visible role at his old employer the day after daimlerchrysler announced its plan to sell a majority stake in chrysler to cerberus mr bernhard was at meeting with chrysler chief executive tom lasorda the same day mr bernhard who was chryslers chief operating officer during its turnaround effort earlier in the decade attended crucial meetings with chryslers union leaders along with mr lasorda and cerberus founder stephen feinberg mr bernhard years old is making the rounds at chryslers design studios pointing out in detail what he likes and what he doesnt like and doling out assignments to employees the way he used to when he was no at chrysler to dieter zetsche now daimlers chief executive people familiar with the matter said company officials have stressed that mr lasorda will remain chief executive mr bernhard however is poised to have a prominent role "tom lasorda will continue to lead chrysler " a cerberus spokesman said "mr bernhard will be helping cerberus manage its investments in the automotive sector including chrysler " a person familiar with the matter says mr bernhard will answer to mr feinberg not mr lasorda on chryslers performance mr bernhard already has an office on the executive floor at chryslers headquarters mr bernhard isnt a "background kind of guy " says canadian auto workers union president buzz hargrove who praises mr bernhard as straightforward bright and tough "he was always good to deal with because you could always hold him to his word and if he said a problem would be solved it would get solved " mr hargrove said many at chrysler including mr lasorda who worked under mr bernhard in the past say they welcome his return whether the smooth sailing will last remains to be seen especially if mr lasordas restructuring plan fails to deliver better financial results fast enough chrysler had a &# billion operating loss last year as it grappled with a consumer shift to more fuel efficient cars and high costs in north america and it projects it will return profit on sales by which mr lasorda has acknowledged is a modest goal messrs bernhard and lasorda werent available for comment for this article cerberus and chrysler have made it a point to emphasize that mr lasorda is in charge at chrysler trying to quash speculation that mr bernhard could take over his job mr bernhard wont be a part of chryslers executive team the company says cerberus is known for expecting fast turnarounds and a person familiar with the matter said mr bernhard will help keep the pressure on mr lasorda and other chrysler executives to bring chrysler back in the black catherine madden a senior auto analyst with research company global insight said messrs lasorda and bernhard may establish a nontraditional relationship at chrysler which could work to their advantage she noted that at general motors corp vice chairman bob lutz is in the media spotlight as often as chairman and ceo rick wagoner but the roles of mr lutz and mr wagoner are clear with one being a product guru and the other a finance man messrs lasorda and bernhard also have complementary attributes with mr lasorda having a strong manufacturing background and mr bernhard having a knack for products ms madden said if it appears the two men share leadership roles it would presents a challenge as employees need to know who is in charge and have confidence in that person the situation must not deteriorate "into a challenge between the two people only time will tell if this can last " mr lasorda said this month that he and mr bernhard are close friends and it would be "crazy not to tap him " given his experience and talents when it comes to product development cost cutting and operations mr lasorda also said he doesnt have an ego when it comes to asking for help when it is needed and he will look to mr bernhard when he wants his assistance "ive got a great bench at my disposal " mr lasorda said mr bernhard was hired by cerberus this year following a turbulent three year period during which he sought to lead wrenching overhauls at two storied auto makers mercedes benz and volkswagen only to be forced out after clashes with his superiors in daimlerchrysler named mr bernhard head of mercedes the company rescinded the appointment three months later after mr bernhard clashed with then ceo jurgen schrempp over strategy mr bernhard left the company later that year mr bernhard then went to volkswagen ag to eventually become head of the core volkswagen brand there mr bernhard persuaded the companys powerful german union to accept a wage cut for some workers by threatening to shift production of a planned sport utility vehicle outside germany vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder who had backed mr bernhard was pushed out late last year and mr bernhard followed in january now mr bernhard could get an opportunity to prove himself again albeit in a different role when mr bernhard was at chrysler the first time he and mr zetsche helped lead a turnaround that for a time appeared to prove that a big detroit auto maker could overcome the handicaps of high cost labor and weak brands with a combination of aggressive cost cutting and smart stylish vehicles the chrysler sedan brought out on mr zetsches and mr bernhards watch was a runaway hit the success proved fleeting and the company was back in the red in and again in this month mr lasorda acknowledged that the pressure is on to produce a durable sustainable recovery at chrysler a challenge that has eluded leaders of the company since lee iacocca mr lasorda says he and cerberus have faith in his restructuring plan that calls for job cuts and a &# billion investment in engine systems mr lasorda has also said he knows his job could be in danger if he doesnt produce results but he said that would be the case no matter who owned chrysler "they cerberus have deep pockets but weve got to deliver " mr lasorda said at a news conference
