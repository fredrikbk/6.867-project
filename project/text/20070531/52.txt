home &amp family cranky consumer whats really wrong with this house we ask inspectors to look for flaws digging up a tank special to the wsj buying a house means buying its problems thats where home inspections come in many states and real estate companies require sellers to disclose what they know about a homes problems such as mice in the attic but inspections which are the buyers responsibility can reveal what the seller either doesnt know or isnt telling you big ticket flaws can run the gamut from foundation cracks to a faulty septic system before closing on a property buyers can ask sellers to fix problems negotiate a credit for repair costs or agree to buy the house "as is " walking away from the deal entirely can be a final option however locating a knowledgeable house inspector isnt easy real estate agents offer referrals but finding one yourself ensures an inspectors independence the price of a general inspection varies depending on the homes age size and location but generally runs about &# to &# added services such as a septic inspection and well water analysis can push the cost into the thousands for our test we followed the buyer of a year old four bedroom house in bucks county pa the contract spelled out possible inspections we needed five a general inspection including an inspection for termites and other wood boring insects for an extra fee a radon test a lab analysis of well water a septic inspection and testing for possible leaks in an underground heating oil tank web searches for several national organizations directed us to local inspection and testing professionals telling friends and acquaintances about the upcoming move also elicited referrals including the name of an inspector we ultimately chose the inspections turned up minor things including a broken dishwasher hose and some windows that needed replacing the seller fixed them but soil samples collected near an underground oil tank revealed a more costly suspected leak the sellers excavated the tank and installed a new one above ground the septic system worked in all our tester spent &# on inspections for the general inspection a building consultant for u s inspect a national home inspection company flicked every switch and inched along the crawl space during a five hour process he educated us about infrastructure such as a pump that made the basement toilet flush and an attic wire that wed never see he also found carpenter ants which can cause structural damage by destroying wood such as windows and beams we received his page report that evening along with photos that helped us show the problems to the owners the report included maintenance tips and repair cost projections the house already had a radon mitigation system a fan that routes underground air outside but radon testing would determine if it worked properly radon a natural cancer causing gas can seep through a foundation we asked our general inspector to conduct a continuous monitoring test which found normal levels of radon septic system inspections often cause anxiety for both buyers and sellers repairs can cost thousands while replacing a system can top &# we avoided inspectors who relied only upon basic dye tests which reveal seepage if dye thats flushed down the toilet later appears on the lawn the test wouldnt tell the whole story we thought pumping and inspecting the tank is costlier but the process is more revealing we retrieved names via an online directory of septic pros from the national onsite wastewater recycling association based in edgewater md www septiclocator com the pennsylvania septage management association in west chester pa www psma net service provider html whose members work in seven states was a source of even more contacts we selected an inspector who seemed knowledgeable about other septic systems and the soil in our neighborhood he concluded the system was fine the homes underground heating oil tank was a remnant of another era when home builders seemed unconcerned about rusting and leaking decades later we obtained referrals for tank inspectors from local oil companies but an internet search led us to ats environmental services co the inspector collected soil samples and conducted a vacuum test which uses sonar to check for cracks and leaks through a digital probe a sound usually emanates from leaky tanks but ours was quiet we paid extra for a soil analysis which showed petroleum traces a sign of possible leakage the expense saved us thousands in tank removal and potential soil clean up costs which were the sellers responsibility the house inspector collected water samples from the private well for basic potability testing a lab analysis for elevated nitrate and bacteria such as coliform and e coli but we worried about other contaminants possibly from the leaking oil tank a well drilling company and the county health department suggested laboratories we chose the one with the most knowledgeable phone representative and at her suggestion tested for volatile organic compounds harmful groundwater contaminants derived from substances such as fuels and paint thinners it seems unlikely that the oil traveled across the yard to the well area but test results will take about days we were convinced we found all the possible money pits the inspections reassured us that we were about to invest
