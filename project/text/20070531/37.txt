coke cargill aim for a shake up in sweeteners calorie free rebiana is touted as natural a controversial herb coca cola co and cargill inc have teamed up to market a new calorie free natural sweetener they hope will appeal to health conscious consumers and shake up the global sweeteners market but they face serious regulatory and production challenges the two companies ambitious push to develop the new product tentatively named rebiana is the latest step in the soft drink industrys decades long quest for the "holy grail" of sweeteners one that sweetens products naturally without adding calories but also tastes good sucralose the most recent breakthrough was introduced in the u s in under the brand name splenda today the multibillion dollar global sweetener market is dominated by sugar high fructose corn syrup and synthetic sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose but with consumers increasingly eager for healthy foods and beverages of natural origin coke and cargill may have found a sweet spot for rebiana which is derived from a south american herb called stevia coke the atlanta beverage giant has quietly filed patent applications that were published by the u s patent and trademark office last week and says it will have exclusive rights to develop and sell rebiana in beverages closely held cargill the big minneapolis food and agriculture company plans to market the sweetener for use in products such as yogurt cereals ice cream and candy and hasnt ruled out selling it for tabletop use neither coke nor cargill would say specifically how much they had spent on developing rebiana so far but a cargill spokeswoman described it as a "significant amount of money " serious challenges lie ahead for the product whose source the stevia plant has a controversial past stevia isnt approved in the u s or european union for use as a food additive one peer reviewed study on rats published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences concluded the herb could cause mutations in the liver some european food safety officials have cited concerns about a lack of data on the herbs safety amid indications it could lead to fertility problems in men a report published last year by the world health organization found no major toxicity risks but it said more data are needed on the herbs effect on hypertension and blood sugar levels coke and cargill dispute the studys methods and findings the companies say they will market rebiana in the countries where stevia is approved as an additive including japan brazil and china while seeking regulatory approval in the u s and the eu limited supplies mean rebiana isnt likely to be used widely for more than a year or two in any case stevia has never been produced in amounts close to those needed for global distribution cargill says it has spent the past three years developing a tightly controlled growing breeding and production system with partners in china paraguay and argentina to ensure that production steadily increases while rebiana remains consistent in quality safety and flavor danny strickland cokes chief innovation and technology officer said "we think this could be used as a very wide ranging broad based broad shouldered sweetener " but he added "there is a lot of mileage between here and the end line we dont take anything for granted " if it catches on rebiana could shake up the sweeteners industry the current global demand for stevia is nearly four million pounds a year according to cargill since the herb is at least times as sweet as sugar that represents million pounds on a sweetener equivalent basis even so its barely a blip compared with the billions of pounds of high fructose corn syrup used each year in the u s alone production of a no calorie natural sweetener from stevia would almost certainly put pressure on synthetic sweeteners like nutrasweet and equal which are made by merisant co of chicago and splenda which is marketed in the u s by mcneil nutritionals llc a unit of johnson &amp johnson and it could ratchet up competition between cargill and rival archer daniels midland co of decatur ill one of the nations largest producers of high fructose corn syrup and a coke supplier "we look at rebiana as transformational " said dirk reif a cargill scientist who has traveled to more than a dozen countries helping to develop the rebiana production system cargill was part of a sweetener revolution in the s when it was one of three companies to begin marketing high fructose corn syrup which quickly overtook cane sugar as the main sweetener in soft drinks today almost all nondiet soft drinks in the u s contain high fructose corn syrup for coke rebiana represents the culmination of more than a dozen years pursuing a way to use stevia to sweeten drinks while extracts of the herb have long been used to sweeten foods and have been included in dietary supplements they often leave a bitter licoricelike aftertaste coke said the technology it is seeking to patent identifies and extracts the best tasting part of the stevia leaf called rebaudioside a and creates a sweetener that leaves no bitterness lingering on taste buds the company is also seeking to patent processes for formulating rebiana in drinks and foods mr strickland said coke has received positive feedback in taste tests with consumer groups and experts using rebiana in "a range of products of interest to us " including diet and non diet drinks "in some formulas we think were virtually there " he said meaning coke has been able to make some drinks taste close to the way they taste with existing sweeteners he declined to name specific beverages mr strickland also declined to comment on what beverages coke might eventually sweeten with rebiana although he did say its flagship coca cola classic "wouldnt be coca cola classic" without the exact formula it has now coke has in the past marketed a version of powerade in japan sweetened with stevia he said it isnt clear whether other beverage or food makers are close to having their own natural no calorie sweeteners ready to market stevia is native to paraguay but is now grown largely in china it has been used for decades to sweeten teas cakes and other products and became a hit in japan in the s after the artificial sweetener saccharin was banned there today in japan it is widely used in many products including a sports drink called pocari sweat it also became popular in south korea and in the u s where it was used to give some ginger ales a distinct flavor and was briefly used in lipton special blend tea some countries banned the product after the study linking it to liver problems in the early s the food and drug administration concluded that "available toxicological information on stevia is inadequate to demonstrate its safety as a food additive " later the fda allowed stevia to be sold as a "dietary supplement " for consumers the tight regulations meant that they could typically purchase the herb only in bulk leaf or powder form but not in food products companies marketing stevia must clearly mark it as being sold for dietary use a few companies have tried and failed to win fda approval of stevia as a food additive that hasnt stopped stevia from making inroads as full calorie sweeteners have increasingly been linked to obesity and diabetes the herb which is often sold as a fine white crystal or powder can be found in health food stores and it has become fashionable in hollywood on her blog actress mariel hemingway has posted a recipe for a morning shake that recommends mixing in stevia for added sweetness coke and cargill are gathering data necessary to apply for fda approval mr strickland said "we will not move forward until we have done our homework and done it correctly " he said but "we wouldnt be this far along if we didnt have absolute confidence that we could satisfy everybody here " mr strickland said the early studies that found ill effects used unrefined stevia but health problems havent been reported with refined versions of the herb rebiana is an even more refined version of stevia than those evaluated in the who report which found no significant risks he said the two companies are undertaking clinical studies to determine whether rebiana lowers blood pressure or blood sugar effects about which the who report said data were lacking coke said the need for a tasty sweetener has become more pressing for coke in recent years as sales of carbonated soft drinks have waned amid growing concerns about obesity diabetes and other health problems those sales slipped in the u s last year according to beverage digest an industry publication in response coke has been aggressively expanding its lineup of diet drinks and improving its sweeteners to make them more appealing coca cola zero a diet cola introduced in is sweetened with a blend of aspartame and acesulfame potassium that the companys scientists spent years perfecting the drink has proved extremely popular because it tastes closer to regular coca cola than diet coke coke said its efforts to develop rebiana intensified over the past years as the company stepped up innovation efforts overall under chairman and chief executive e neville isdell it has applied for more than patents since but most have been for beverages or equipment rather than ingredients such as sweeteners over the years cargill had focused on marketing sugar and corn syrup along with a variety of sugar alcohol sweeteners like sorbitol and other natural sweeteners dissatisfied with its sweetener portfolio cargill about five years ago assigned employees to scour the globe for the source of the "dream sweetener " says marcelo montero president of the companys cargill sweetness solutions after considering more than natural sweeteners including a licorice root derivative cargill settled on stevia today cargill is contracting with farmers around the world to raise specially bred stevia plants in greenhouses once those plants grow to about inches tall they are handpicked and transported to contract farmers who plant the stevia in the ground after they reach a certain age the leaves are cut and transported to one of a handful of extraction facilities located around the world after harvesting the leaves are dried and then steeped in water where the sweetness of the plant is extracted the sweet water is then crystallized and the product left over is rebiana coke approached cargill about rebiana about two years ago last june the companies signed an interim agreement detailing their cooperation over rebiana a name they coined jointly ilan brat contributed to this article
