agnelli heir files lawsuit against dads consiglieri milan in life gianni agnelli became one of europes most illustrious businessmen celebrated for his management of italian car and industrial giant fiat spa and for his lifestyle as a bon vivant now one of his heirs is dragging a delicate family matter the extent of private wealth accumulated by mr agnelli into the public eye with a lawsuit that risks tainting the reputation of one of europes most distinguished dynasties in the suit filed yesterday in turin a copy of which was viewed by the wall street journal margherita agnelli de pahlen years old and mr agnellis only surviving child alleges that three of her fathers most trusted consiglieri have never given a proper accounting of her fathers estate in the suit she claims that there may still be significant sums of money scattered around the world in different bank accounts that must be distributed to heirs the lawsuit which threatens to shatter the unity that has characterized the agnelli family highlights how europes age old model of family capitalism is coming under pressure as power passes to new generations as these empires have grown keeping a balance between the families private matters and their businesses now often including publicly traded companies has become a challenge moreover patriarchs like mr agnelli often depended on tight but informal political and business relationships that younger generations are hard pressed to maintain the agnelli family has controlled a vast swath of the italian economy for more than a century anchored around fiat which makes ferrari alfa romeo and fiat cars trucks and tractors the family empire also includes newspapers a tour operator the juventus f c soccer team a chunk of the new york real estate firm cushman &amp wakefield and stakes in some of europes largest companies giovanni agnelli &amp c the company in which much of the familys wealth is kept is estimated to be valued at more than billion euros or &# billion the suit which comes after other less public spats over inheritance could have implications beyond the nearly agnelli heirs affecting the network of public companies that the family controls such as ifil spa and fiat mrs agnelli de pahlens suit is directed at three figures franzo grande stevens who serves as the familys chief legal adviser gianluigi gabetti who is still among the top executives in the agnelli family holding company and sigfrid maron who manages private assets for the family from switzerland mr grande stevenss turin law office said last night that he wasnt available to comment mr gabetti declined to comment but noted through an assistant that in after some negotiating mrs agnelli de pahlen publicly declared herself to be satisfied with how her fathers wealth was distributed mr maron was traveling and an associate at his zurich office was unable to reach him an ifil spokesman said that neither mr gabetti nor mr grande stevens had seen the suit while mr agnelli still referred to in italy simply as the avvocato or "lawyer " was alive these three men were among his most trusted associates after mr agnellis death in they continued to manage his estate but mr grande stevens and mr gabetti also hold important posts in the publicly traded companies controlled by the agnelli family mr grande stevens is secretary of giovanni agnelli &amp c and a board member of the family holding companies ifi spa and ifil he is also secretary of the fiat board mr gabetti meantime is president of giovanni agnelli &amp c and chairman of ifi and ifil holding such important roles in public companies and family affairs says maurizia iachino a milan based consultant on corporate governance is common for close associates of top european entrepreneurs but it also blurs the distinction between private and shareholder interests "theres a confusion of roles here " she says mrs agnelli de pahlens suit also risks creating tension among the upper ranks of the family business her first born son john elkann is being groomed to take the reins he holds the title of deputy chairman at fiat at ifil he is deputy chairman second in command after mr gabetti mr elkann declined to comment in the s and s gianni agnelli grandson of the fiat founder of the same name became one of the best known tycoons in europe keeping the company of the kennedys in the u s and the upper echelons of the business and political elite in italy he married a noblewoman named marella caracciolo di castagneto and he and his brother umberto served in the italian senate his sister susanna once served as foreign minister but when mr agnelli died of cancer at his empire was in tatters fiats car business was hemorrhaging money the family began selling off cherished holdings to raise cash including stakes in club med the french winery chateau margaux and la rinascente spa department store chain fiat was temporarily salvaged after the italian government rallied banks to extend a &lt euro&gt billion loan but its only recently under new management that it has engineered a strong comeback the issue of the inheritance of mr agnellis personal fortune was even more complicated mr agnellis first born edoardo led a troubled life and is believed to have jumped to his death from a highway overpass near turin in as a result mrs agnelli de pahlen and her mother became mr agnellis de facto heirs the bulk of his personal holdings were divided between them including his art collection two yachts palazzos in turin and rome and an expansive corsican estate mrs agnelli de pahlen who has eight children from two marriages began splitting her time between geneva paris new york and turin she has published a book of poetry and occupies herself with painting and various microfinance projects but mrs agnelli soon began to have doubts about the management of her fathers estate and entered a period of protracted negotiations with the estates managers and other family members then in she issued a statement in which she declared that she was satisfied with how the wealth had been distributed now she is raising her concerns again in the suit mrs agnelli de pahlen doesnt accuse the defendants of seeking personal gain but she claims that they rebuffed repeated requests to properly disclose the estates total value and where the holdings are located for example mrs agnelli de pahlen alleges that several months after her fathers death mr maron showed her a list of foreign trusts stakes in private equity funds and other holdings but the amounts she was shown werent exact she charges nor was she given assurances that they represented all of her fathers accounts she also claims that after her fathers death she received million euros from an account held by merrill lynch but she charges that she was never told who ordered the payment or whether it was the full amount in the account corrections &amp amplifications margherita agnelli de pahlen
