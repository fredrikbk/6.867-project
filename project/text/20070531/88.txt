politics &amp economics can the iraq surge be salvaged as violence seems to outpace progress officials talk of next steps washington when the bush administration decided to send tens of thousands of additional troops to iraq the strategy rested on an unspoken trade off u s troops would risk greater casualties to tamp down violence and buy the baghdad government time to make the political compromises needed to reconcile the countrys warring factions but a resurgence of sectarian violence and attacks on u s troops coupled with little to no progress on crucial iraqi political goals is already spurring discussion about whether the current strategy can succeed in the near term senior american military officials in baghdad are wrestling with how to increase the effectiveness of the "surge" strategy between now and september when gen david petraeus the top commander in iraq is supposed to give washington a progress report u s officials here and in baghdad are also waging a parallel debate over how long the "surge" should last and whether the u s needs to begin planning for an alternative approach that would scale back both u s troop levels and american ambitions in iraq with about u s fatalities may has been the deadliest month for u s troops since the fight for fallujah in april the problems facing the surge have been compounded by the recent re emergence of moqtada al sadr a shiite muslim cleric whose heavily armed militia has waged an on again off again guerilla war against u s and british forces for almost four years his mahdi army has also been linked to the wide scale abductions and killings of young sunni muslim men when the additional u s forces began streaming into iraq in mid february mr sadr dropped from sight and his fighters stood down but earlier this week he returned to the public stage with an angry speech denouncing the american presence in iraq and promising to resume his fight against "the occupation " his strident remarks coincided with an uptick in attacks linked to the mahdi army including this weeks kidnapping of five british citizens from a finance ministry building in central baghdad a british officer in the southern city of basra communicating via email said the number of daily attacks in his area of operation had nearly doubled in the past week with most strikes carried out by mahdi fighters "jams leadership has made a conscious decision to rejoin the fight " he said using the militarys acronym for the arabic name of mr sadrs force in baghdad the number of sectarian killings also has begun to climb again an american official in the u s embassy there said more than unidentified corpses had been found so far this month up from found in january the last month before the additional u s forces began arriving in baghdad senior u s officials in baghdad caution that the last of the five additional brigades just arrived on the ground in baghdad and that it is too early to pass judgment on the plan each brigade numbers about soldiers and support troops they also point to successes such as an increase in the number of tribal leaders who say they want to work with u s forces to fight al qaeda in iraq a dynamic that has sharply reduced the violence in the sunni dominated anbar province but even the staunchest supporters of the "surge" strategy acknowledge that the u s must do more to push political reconciliation in baghdad among feuding sunnis and shiites one debate roiling baghdad now concerns whether the political process is stalled because elected officials are merely inneffectual or because they are more interested in advancing their sectarian agendas than in governance the strategy review conducted for gen petraeus seems to conclude it is a bit of both the report argues that iraq is essentially a failed state and that the u s must devote far more effort to making iraqs ministries work said officials who participated in the review "weve been too passive and deferential to iraqi sovereignty " says one u s military official involved in a review of the surge for gen petraeus it also recommends that the u s take a more active role in "isolating the irreconcilable iraqi government officials from the reconcilable ones" by demanding they be replaced said the military official who was involved in the review stephen biddle who served on the panel said he believes iraq is in the midst of a low grade sectarian civil war and that u s forces should be used as leverage to compel sunnis and shiites to reach an accord in washington meanwhile administration officials have begun to debate how much longer the surge should last and what comes after it senior military officials in iraq have said they would like to see the higher troop levels sustained through early but senior bush administration officials worry that extending the buildup into next year could further turn the american public against the war pentagon officials and the white house are developing rough proposals to begin withdrawing tens of thousands of soldiers sometime next year as a way of defusing some of the public fury over the war and making it less of an issue in next years presidential and congressional elections white house officials caution that the efforts are preliminary and that president bush has yet to sign off on them one aide acknowledged that the white house has developed similar withdrawal plans in the past only to abandon them when violence in iraq continued to climb white house spokesman tony snow yesterday said mr bush envisions an indefinite american military presence in iraq that would resemble the one in south korea with the u s in a support role able to "react quickly to major challenges or crises " that presumes though that an iraqi government would request or at least tolerate such a deployment as the south koreans have
