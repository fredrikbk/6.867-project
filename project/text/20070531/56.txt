immigration reform bill threatens small business contrary to your view that employers like "construction contractors who rely heavily on unskilled workers generally support" the senate immigration bill "business divided as debate opens on immigration " page one may we find that the housing sector and contractor community generally oppose the deal because it would do irreparable harm to small businesses specifically the nations home builders view the bill as counterproductive because it contains onerous provisions regarding employer liability and responsibility for subcontractors the law could be used to unfairly prosecute an employer who unknowingly hires an illegal alien general contractors could be held responsible for the legal status of employees hired by subcontractors the program to provide a future flow of immigrant workers for the construction industry is unworkable the new mandated electronic verification system is untested and the new record keeping requirements are unduly burdensome especially for small businesses these are just a few of the reasons why we believe this bill cant be fixed without making major revisions jerry howard executive vice president and ceo national association of home builders washington
