zoellicks clean up duty having published at least a dozen of robert zoellicks op eds over the years we know him as a man who neither minces his words nor takes easily to editing if thats an indication of the management style hell bring to the world bank then president bush has nominated a fine successor to outgoing bank president paul wolfowitz mr wolfowitz was removed from the bank in a bureaucrats coup via a made up scandal the real purpose of which was to undermine an anti corruption agenda that threatened the banks zero accountability self dealing culture mr zoellick seems to have been recommended by treasury secretary hank paulson in part because he has experience building international coalitions and is well known and liked by europeans but if he is to succeed as president mr zoellick will have to do more than become a mouthpiece for the banks shove money out the door culture mr zoellicks first test will come early as we go to press sources inside and outside the bank tell us that a follow up to the putsch against mr wolfowitz is being engineered by managing director graeme wheeler and staff association chair alison cave against suzanne rich folsom who runs the banks department of institutional integrity or int ms folsom an ethics lawyer brought in by former president jim wolfensohn and promoted to her current job by mr wolfowitz has been aggressively pursuing corruption investigations much to the alarm of some at the bank prominent among those investigations is one concerning an indian health project irregularities in the project including indications of bid rigging and bribery led mr wolfowitz to veto further loans to india in while the investigation unfolded despite fierce protests from the projects managers now that the int is about to issue a report about the project mr wheeler has been lobbying the banks executive directors to place ms folsom on administrative leave and for the ints oversight responsibilities to be radically diminished among mr wheelers responsibilities at the bank is oversight of its works in south asia mr wheeler and ms cave were among the most outspoken bank employees calling on mr wolfowitz to resign mr zoellick can hardly allow this putsch to go forward if he means to safeguard the banks integrity ms folsom was bound to make plenty of enemies by the very nature of her work allowing her to be pushed out sends the signal that the job is a poisoned chalice to anyone who takes its work seriously mr zoellick must also insist that the int get the funding that mr wolfowitz requested last year from the banks board of directors he was turned down and that the recommendations from a forthcoming report on the int by former fed chief paul volcker be heeded beyond the int mr zoellick would also do the bank and the english language a favor by abolishing the independent evaluation group despite its name the group which is supposed to provide independent assessments of the effectiveness of bank projects is staffed by bank employees who have every incentive to kiss the hand that feeds them if the bank truly wants "independent evaluation " it would be better served asking transparency international to set up a field office in the atrium of the banks d c headquarters then theres the banks annual &# billion loan portfolio why does the bank continue to lend to china a country that has foreign currency reserves in excess of &# trillion why lend to mexico or brazil two countries that can easily obtain credit in the private market a "bank" that justifies its existence as an agent of the poor should make africa its main focus the system by which the banks executive directors approve loans is also geared to handing out money regardless of the intrinsic merits of the projects it funds between and fewer than half of the banks projects in africa were judged to be "sustainable" and thats according to the banks generous self assessment fewer projects with better oversight and follow up could help turn that depressing record around the wolfowitz putsch has also revealed a great deal about the banks dysfunctional institutional culture the way it winks at corruption punishes dissent and applies rules selectively to protect its hefty salaries and perquisites restoring whistleblowers who have been unfairly dismissed to their previous jobs would be a powerful way for mr zoellick to signal his determination to reform that culture if that makes him the victim of off the record sniping and media leaks well know hes doing his job right in selecting mr zoellick mr bush has at least quashed any illusions europeans might have had that they could put one of their own in the top bank job we have no brief for the year tradition of having an american run the bank or for that matter the tradition of giving the top job at the international monetary fund to a european but there is no way the europeans could be rewarded for trashing mr wolfowitzs career in order to get his job as a former trade representative and deputy secretary of state mr zoellick understands modern markets and knows his way around multilateral institutions his weakness is a tendency to be too clever by half as when he sold the bush administrations steel tariffs as a political concession for the sake of free trade when what the world saw was u s hypocrisy for now the challenge facing mr zoellick is whether to be a change agent or just another fief builder who lectures western taxpayers that they arent giving the bank enough money well get an early signal by how he handles the banks anti anti corruption revolt
