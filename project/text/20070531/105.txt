the evening wrap bushs climate change online edition president bush who is set to jet off for an international summit next week unveiled a significant change in his posture on climate change today but some critics say his proposal mistakes scheduling meetings for having a plan the president is calling for a series of discussions among the worlds economic powers to establish global targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in an important shift in tone for an administration that has long played defense on the question of what to do about global warming "the united states takes this issue seriously " mr bush said saying that his approach will "contribute to the important dialogue" that is expected to happen at next weeks summit of group of eight leaders in germany under the presidents plan the heaviest producers of greenhouse gases including the u s india and china would establish a target for reducing emissions then each country would set about developing their own means to reach the goal the plan is meant to serve as a successor to the kyoto climate change accord which expires in and which mr bush wouldnt support because he believes that meeting its demands would be too damaging to the american economy under the kyoto pact industrialized countries were required to reduce greenhouse emissions to levels by the clinton administration played a big role in negotiating that agreement but the u s s subsequent refusal to ratify it has alienated many of its allies some fellow g leaders appeared to be receptive to the spirit of the presidents plan if not its letter british prime minister tony blair described the proposal as a "big step forward" and noted for the first time "americas saying it wants to be part of a global deal for the first time its setting its own domestic targets for the first time its saying it wants a global target for the reduction of emissions " german chancellor angela merkel said mr bushs speech showed that climate change is an issue that cant be ignored and an official of her government said it was a "positive step" that shows that the bush administration "recognizes the need for action " but environmentalists said that the plan offered plenty of talk and no action friends of the earth president brent blackwelder said the plan is a "charade " national environmental trust president philip clapp described it as "a transparent effort to divert attention from the presidents refusal to accept any emissions reductions proposals" at the g summit the white house said such criticisms were wrong "if we wanted to put things off further youd have annual meetings at the u n for the next five years " said james connaughton the chairman of the white house council on environmental quality apparently word that the president is now taking climate change seriously didnt filter all the way through the administration since the nasa administrator michael griffin said on national public radio this morning that he wasnt sure "that it is fair to say that global warming is a problem we must wrestle with " he said that "i guess i would ask which human beings where and when are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today right now is the best climate for all other human beings " he then added "i think thats a rather arrogant position " the white house seemed eager to put some daylight between mr bush and mr griffin jack marburger the white house science adviser said mr griffin was speaking for himself and has "a very wry sense of humor " but others at nasa werent laughing james hansen its top climate scientist called the comments "incredibly arrogant" and "ignorant " stocks pause after a record day one day after the dow jones industrial average
