the afternoon report banking on joe investor online edition at a time when wall street is entranced by the riches of private equity and hedge funds wachovia is betting big on the little guy and shareholders of regional brokerages apparently think other giants will follow that lead wachovia agreed to acquire a g edwards for about &# billion in a deal that will forge a powerhouse retail brokerage with over &# trillion in assets trailing only merrill lynch and citigroups smith barney the once sleepy southern bank has been no stranger to deal making over recent years indeed its path to banking supermarket status isnt unlike the road traveled by such financial behemoths as bank of america and citigroup first union as it was known before the merger of first union and wachovia had made a series of deals before that merger and the combined company has continued to scarf down assets wachovia added some considerable muscle to its retail brokerage arm with its acquisition of prudential financial and the deal struck today massively enlarges the platform from which wachovia sells a range of financial products the deal would give it more than locations around the country as well as an army of more than financial advisers wachovia stock was slightly lower in morning trade while a g edwards surged more than chasing after small investors hasnt exactly been the sport of choice on wall street these past few years a good many average joes got torched by the flameout of the dot com frenzy and some have forsworn the stock market even amid its recent winning streak in which the dow jones industrial average has been setting new highs on what feels like a daily basis and the standard &amp poors index finally broke through to a new record yesterday white shoe investment houses have instead focused their energies on the big dollar universe of corporate buyouts as well as hedge funds and other flavors geared more toward the well to do but wachovia sees an opportunity in the impending retirements of the baby boom generation and the passing of funds from one generation to another after that some investors may worry that folding a g edwards into wachovia will be no mean trick bringing relatively independent regional brokerages under a large corporate umbrella can be tough a broker exodus followed when ubs acquired piper jaffrays financial adviser business last year and merrill lynch held on to a smaller than expected group when it acquired advest in december if a large number of brokers decide to jump that could alienate longtime customers of a g edwards many of whom may choose to follow their brokers wherever they ultimately land but the remaining regional brokerages such as raymond james and thomas weisel appear to be under increasing pressure to find buyers trading revenues for many of them are on the wane even as their supersized wall street competitors are raking in more money than ever shares of raymond james shot up as investors salivated at
