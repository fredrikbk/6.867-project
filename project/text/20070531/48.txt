fda overly concerned with adverse side effects the response of the fdas steven galson letters may to the may commentary "our lawless fda" is bothersome dr galson appears to justify the suppression of one drug arcoxia from the market because of a higher incidence of adverse side effects compared with approved alternatives naprosyn and arthrotec i dont have access to the underlying studies but one must expect the subset of people with adverse reactions to one drug will differ from those with adverse reactions to a rival therapy if there are patients who do not tolerate naprosyn say they may benefit from arcoxia unless of course arcoxia is prevented from reaching the market in the first place i would hope my own physician would be sufficiently conscientious and intelligent to choose a drug therapy based on available science if the first drug of choice falls short i would hope he would have access to other drugs even if they are inferior for the "average" patient tim ozenne torrance calif
