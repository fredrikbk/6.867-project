style &amp substance polos high stakes balancing act how ceo ralph lauren keeps the focus on luxury while selling to the masses over the past years designer ralph lauren has built a &# billion fashion empire by maintaining a bulletproof facade of luxury and snob appeal through lavish fashion shows and splashy advertising spreads depicting beautiful people in lush locales the year old bronx born chairman and chief executive of polo ralph lauren corp has created a rarified corporate image in the s amid a luxury boom polo ads featured items such as a &# mahogany highboy with tartan patterned

article aside from the outlets polo operates stores world wide under the polo umbrella including ralph lauren rugby and rrl the company also has club monaco stores a separate brand it acquired in "ralph lauren is the king of public perception " observes bud konheim chief executive of fashion house nicole miller inc "he had the guts early on to spend on advertising being the modern great gatsby to manipulate the perception of american fashion that is upscale no matter if you buy a polo shirt at macys or at costco the luxury image is unshakable " mr laurens ability to juggle so many brands in so many price categories and retail channels without tainting his luxury image is increasingly a model the rest of the fashion industry is seeking to emulate other brands from calvin klein to tiffany have seen their cachet erode when they expanded too far into lower price goods but mr lauren has defied conventional wisdom building a luxury goods empire with a major portion of sales from moderately priced brands the company yesterday said fiscal fourth quarter net income rose a higher than expected and shares rose to &# at p m on the new york stock exchange mr laurens high low straddle has succeeded largely because of a meticulous focus on his high end image all of the labels including lauren by ralph lauren rrl rlx polo sport rugby and even chaps bask in the halo of polos vaunted "black label" collections shown on new york runways twice a year featuring &# shirts and &# suede jackets at the mass market end the designer has kept both "polo" and "ralph lauren" off the brand names but many consumers know that polo designs chaps for instance so the company still benefits from the association "its very clever the way ralph lauren slices and dices his brand under all those different labels that all have different prices and merchandise without an overlap of items between them " says david wolfe creative director at doneger group retail consultants for example the company might produce a variety of navy blazers across the polo labels but the styles and their quality are very different mr wolfe says yet the labels are consistent in their classic ivy league and british sensibilities "ralph lauren doesnt have to advertise all those brands because all the lauren labels are feeding off the same aspirational image " he says "it is an effective look that works in america in hong kong in london " says new york fashion historian valerie steele j c penney bills american living as its most ambitious launch and expects it to eventually become a &# billion brand "for a long time ralph has talked about bringing a design sensibility to the core of america that deserves great design and great style " says penney chief executive myron "mike" e ullman iii who served as a director on polos board from to penney follows a deal polo did with kohls in polo changed the name of its lowest price "chaps by ralph lauren" label to "chaps" and began selling it exclusively at the discounter that chaps can still draw from polos upper crust image shows the companys ability to deftly interpret its look at popular prices linda broadrick an administrative assistant in stockbridge ga says she buys &# chaps shirts for her husband but has little interest in polo ralph laurens other labels "im not into shopping luxury brands if i can get a good deal " she says while the mass market represents growth potential for polo it carries some risks james wright of lippicott mercer brand consultants notes that the penney and kohls labels could be confused with polos labels sold through federated department stores inc s macys chain "it is all up to polo to control expectations at retail " he says but federated says polo brands are key "polo is a very strong status brand that is consistent with our strategy for offering differentiated product at macys federated chairman and ceo terry lundgren said in a statement "it is clearly distinguished from product sold elsewhere under other names we expect that macys will remain a preferred destination for polo " the rise in polo shares from their &# range a year ago is a testament to the companys strategy it has boosted revenue by buying back licenses opening stores and adding lucrative initiatives such as kohls "in the past five years polo has become the best apparel vendor in the world " says robby ohmes an analyst at bank of america sharing the credit for this corporate makeover with mr lauren is roger farah polos president and chief operating officer since april mr farah who has a degree in economics from wharton spent much of his career at federated "he has excelled for his merchandising skills and ability to attract and mobilize the best talent " says mr ullman of j c penney mr lauren shows no signs of slowing down yet there is growing concern about polos future leadership because there is no heir apparent many industry watchers agree that if he were to go mr farah would be an obvious choice only one of mr laurens three children david lauren works for polo as the companys senior vice president of advertising marketing and corporate communications yet he lacks broad fashion industry experience and would need to prove to wall street he is ceo material
