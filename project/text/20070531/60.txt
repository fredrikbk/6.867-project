in the fray needed an organ transplant new york this saturday music director lorin maazel conducts the new york philharmonic in the first of two programs that include the noble "german requiem" of brahms one of more than orchestral works containing an organ part it will be played on a recently purchased walker technical digital organ that by all accounts is a significant improvement over its year old digital predecessor yet the very presence of an electronic organ at avery fisher hall underscores a glaring deficiency the internationally renowned new york philharmonic based in the classical music capital of the u s lacks a pipe organ in its concert hall something that orchestras in boston chicago cleveland dallas los angeles philadelphia and seattle already enjoy as do orchestras in smaller cities like madison wis naples fla and portland maine it wasnt always that way when philharmonic hall now avery fisher hall opened in it boasted a four manual keyboard pipe aeolian skinner organ that instrument was removed in prior to a total rebuilding of the auditoriums acoustically challenged interior now with the first phase of major improvements under way at the lincoln center campus there is talk about installing a world class pipe organ should avery fisher hall undergo another makeover it started during the s when kurt masur the philharmonics music director at the time lobbied for a pipe organ and a german donor provided &# million toward its purchase zarin mehta the philharmonics president and executive director says that he and the philharmonic board are totally committed to getting an organ if funds can be raised for the renovation but lincoln center owns avery fisher hall and formidable challenges remain funding for the renovation must be secured considerably more than the original &# million price tag lincoln center still must raise &# million of its &# million commitment to the th street redevelopment project which includes improvements to alice tully hall the promenade and central plaza since any changes to avery fisher hall must take place within the existing structure space must be found to house the administrative offices and percussion studio that currently occupy part of the original organ chamber and the philharmonic must find a suitable place to perform while the hall is closed most crucially lincoln center must officially approve the organ installation asked if a renovated avery fisher hall would definitely include a pipe organ lincoln centers president reynold levy replied "we will address the pipe organ and many other important items like it as we go forward " unfortunately lincoln center doesnt have the greatest track record where organs are concerned in during a previous attempt to provide more bass response and warmth in avery fisher hall a new lower ceiling was installed over the stage that cut off about half of the aeolian skinners organ chamber as a result says piano technician peter batchelder who did some tonal work on the skinner at that time much of the organ sound was projected into the ceiling rather than into the auditorium mr batchelder is the technician for the four manual pipe kuhn organ at smaller alice tully hall that could have been rectified during the renovation which virtually gutted the hall when the lower ceiling was removed for acoustical reasons but the skinner was sold to the crystal cathedral in southern california where it was merged with a large fratelli ruffatti organ a press release from that time suggests that the organs removal would provide greater space and versatility for the renovation with alice tully hall closed for major aesthetic and functional alterations lincoln center has a golden opportunity to enhance tullys dry acoustic unflattering to strings and organ alike however although the elegant kuhn instrument will be refurbished during its absence from the hall no acoustical makeover is planned "we have an excellent hall in alice tully by every account we can think about " says mr levy "and we want to keep it that way but whenever you renovate a hall you impact acoustics so as we redo walls of the hall as we place new seats in the hall well be extremely attentive to acoustical considerations " too often the king of instruments winds up being an afterthought in such undertakings in a committee appointed by the new york city chapter of the american organists guild presented an advisory report to mr mehta but a pipe organ would affect lincoln center as well since installation tonal finishing and future maintenance can disrupt rental income why not form a task force of organists other experts and lincoln center officials to oversee organ issues at the campus and ensure that any architectural and acoustical plans for avery fisher hall allow ample space for an organ chamber from the outset the group could also play a role in organ decisions should the philharmonic opt for electric action or the potentially more expressive mechanical action favored by many critics including this one should there be one console or two one stationary and one mobile to facilitate concerto performances although a well designed pipe organ would add visual interest to a renovated avery fisher hall the main reason to have one is musical historically the organ has been used in orchestral works to support choral singers and enhance the bass line as in the brahms requiem lending its distinctive voice to the instrumental texture to star as soloist in concertos like the one by poulenc or to provide occasional drama like the low pedal tones in holsts "the planets " digital organs obviously can be used to play these pieces the best of them which utilize sampling technology like the state of the art walker instrument have advanced considerably in the past decade ironically the walker includes archives of sounds from more than aeolian skinner organs though not the one that graced philharmonic hall but the biggest drawback is that they project these recorded sounds through loudspeakers often an unhappy experience for symphony lovers "with a pipe organ " says kent tritle the philharmonics organist "every pipe sets a column of air in motion and this effect is something that cannot be matched " a pipe organ at avery fisher hall might or might not bring in new listeners the record is mixed in that regard but it would give the new york philharmonic the world class instrument it deserves and enhance other appealing new features in store for lincoln center how can lincoln center maintain its standing as a symbol of artistic excellence if it lacks the gold standard for organ performance or as mr mehta aptly puts it "i think it would be a huge mistake for new york if the hall is redone and we spend all this money and dont put in a pipe organ " ms jepson writes about classical music for the journal
