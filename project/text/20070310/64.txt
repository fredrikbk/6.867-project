democratic heavyweights connecticut sen christopher dodd chairman of the senate banking committee and rep barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee identifying the problem is the easy part coming up with a viable solution will be tougher "we will have had a lot of discussion but now its time to get on with it whatever it is " says hal scott a harvard university law professor who headed the committee on capital markets regulation mr scotts committee proposed raising the bar for private litigation and suggested congress cap auditors liability the problem is it will face formidable opposition from the plaintiffs bar and perhaps democrats another report commissioned by new york sen charles schumer a democrat and new york city mayor michael bloomberg advised that u s immigration laws be relaxed to make it easier to attract skilled workers and foreign businessmen good luck getting some members of congress to agree to that the chamber report will be interesting

member of the chambers commission said the commission will urge all public companies to stop giving quarterly guidance companies in europe and asia dont do it that is significant because it could mean less of a focus on short term results the need to make quarterly numbers and not disappoint the street authorities say drove the accounting scandals of recent years it is unclear how that will attract companies to u s exchanges but it may be a reform that will be welcomed by corporations that complain that too much focus on the short term distracts from long term growth media fraud trial looms for jet setting publishing mogul by emily steel conrad black the larger than life canadian newspaper publisher turned british lord goes on trial in chicago this coming week on fraud and racketeering charges while similar cases in recent years make the storyline alleged financial chicanery by a highly placed corporate executive a familiar one for american audiences this trial promises to be a dramatic spectacle nonetheless more than many of his counterparts put on trial in recent years mr black personified the jet setting executive a self made media mogul whose former company hollinger international inc owned such properties as the london daily telegraph jerusalem post and chicago sun times mr black gave up his canadian citizenship to become a british knight with residences in new york london toronto and palm beach fla he hobnobbed with the likes of henry kissinger and margaret thatcher and wrote erudite books about historical figures such as franklin d roosevelt a seamier side of mr blacks lifestyle is presented by the prosecutors who allege the mogul and three other former hollinger international executives diverted more than &# million from the company through a series of multimillion dollar noncompete payments paid without proper board approval or disclosure they also allege that mr black used hollinger international funds to cover personal expenses including a trip to bora bora a birthday party for his wife barbara amiel black and a park avenue apartment in manhattan mr black has pleaded not guilty to the charges the highlight of the trial is likely to be the appearance on the witness stand of mr blacks former business partner david radler who has struck a plea bargain and will testify for the prosecution testimony by mr radler hollinger internationals former chief operating officer is expected to be a key part of the governments case the government also is drawing evidence from a special investigation commissioned by the company and led by former securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden that resulted in a page report famously labeling hollinger internationals business practices "corporate kleptocracy " if convicted mr black faces as many as years in prison although his toronto based lawyer edward greenspan says he doesnt consider a conviction a possibility "we are here to win this trial " says mr greenspan this is the first case he is trying in u s courts more than members of the press some of whom report for papers mr black once owned have registered for media passes to the chicago courthouse where jury selection for the case is to begin wednesday and opening arguments are expected to start march the outcome of the trial is expected to have little impact on mr blacks former publishing powerhouse from which he was ousted in since then hollinger international has sold its big name properties and renamed itself sun times media group inc it still owns the chicago sun times and about local newspapers and web sites in the greater chicago area "this is between conrad and his crew and the u s government " says tammy chase spokeswoman for sun times media group "we have to look forward we cant get fixated on this trial " pharmaceuticals glaxos faith in lab is tested by jeanne whalen pharmaceutical giant glaxosmithkline plc is counting on a big breakthrough this coming week the u s food and drug administration is scheduled to rule on tykerb a cancer drug that is the product of glaxos new approach to research and development under chief executive j p garnier the worlds second biggest drug maker by sales behind pfizer inc has changed how it develops drugs to give its scientists more decision making power mr garnier has promised that his plan would help glaxo to bring a wealth of new drugs to market and tykerb is one of the first big tests tykerb treats an aggressive form of breast cancer that affects to of women who have the disease tykerb has been shown to work in some patients who dont respond to herceptin the blockbuster treatment sold by genentech inc and roche holding ag glaxo also hopes that further tests will show that tykerb helps to stop tumors from spreading to the brain which happens in some women taking herceptin it is one of five products glaxo aims to introduce this year including a vaccine for cervical cancer and a drug for allergic rhinitis a condition similar to hay fever it isnt clear how the fda will rule the fda declines to comment on drugs under review in a phone interview mr garnier said he believes tykerbs chances are good the fda is considering tykerb for only limited use as a backup for women who dont respond to herceptin glaxo is conducting additional clinical trials that could allow tykerb to be used at an earlier stage of the disease citigroup analysts predict tykerb could eventually achieve gbp billion &# billion in annual sales making drug discovery more productive is the biggest challenge facing pharmaceutical companies today when glaxo was formed through a merger of glaxo wellcome and smithkline beecham in its pipeline of drugs in development was particularly weak tykerb emerged from glaxos new r&amp d structure which was designed to boost innovation by giving more decision making power to scientists in the lab mr garnier and then research chief tachi yamada divided glaxos research scientists into seven separate groups each concentrating on a specific disease area such as cancer psychiatry and respiratory disease each group controls its own budget and decides which projects to pursue with this new authority scientists in the cancer group moved tykerb off the back burner and made it a priority dr yamada later left the company to work for the bill &amp melinda gates foundation "weve worked very hard to change r&amp d in the past seven or eight years " mr garnier said "tykerb is everything we want in a compound its a life saving drug its an excellent piece of science " one fda approval wont prove a total renaissance is under way in glaxos labs of course and there are some worrying signs that not all is well in r&amp d early this month glaxo based in brentford england published an updated list of the drugs it is developing noting that experimental compounds in midstage development had been scrapped these losses were only partly offset by the seven compounds that glaxo moved into midstage or phase testing from phase testing morgan stanley analyst andrew baum noted in a research note "our pre existing concerns over the strength of gsks much hyped pipeline have grown " mr baum wrote mr garnier calls the report an overreaction to the kind of attrition that is common in early and midstage drug research
