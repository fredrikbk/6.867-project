remembrances ernest gallo brought wine to american mainstream while encouraging upscale shift ernest gallo helped change america from a nation that preferred cocktails and coca cola to one that sipped chardonnay starting as a purveyor of bulk wines and sweet easy to quaff brands such as thunderbird the co founder of e &amp j gallo co later advertised heavily to encourage customers shift to more upscale brands such as gallo family vineyards chardonnay sold in bottles with corks instead of jugs with screw off caps in an oral history unsealed this week after his death march at age mr gallo explained his populist philosophy of wine quality "i simply judge a wine by pouring a glass and drinking it " he told a historian at the university of californias bancroft library in "if i feel like another glass and have a desire for it to me its a good wine " he relied on his younger brother julio who was killed in a auto crash to oversee winemaking which still is centered in modesto calif ernests job was to sell the wine and as the oral history makes clear he did it with marketing genius and unsentimental toughness that sparked fights with foes ranging from farmworkers to family members the introduction of thunderbird which for many years was gallos top seller triggered criticism that the gallos were exploiting minority groups and the "misery market" by fortifying the wine with higher alcohol content and stressing its cheap price in ads that started "whats the word thunderbird " in the oral history ernest gallo describes how the company came up with the lemon flavored wine after watching "black consumers dumping a can of concentrated lemon juice in a bottle of our white port and thinking its great " born in the foothills of californias sierra nevada mountains to italian american immigrants ernest lived as a young child with his maternal grandparents in the fertile san joaquin valley he experienced his first hangover as a five year old after sipping wine from a tin cup that workers had left behind coming of age during the depression and prohibition ernest traveled frequently to chicago as a teenager selling the grapes his family grew to home wine makers and bootleggers who collected a four cent per box "hoodlum tax" on every box of grapes that left the railroad yard in about six months before prohibition was repealed their mother told julio she didnt care what happened to her as long "as my boys get along always " according to the brothers autobiography "our story " the next day ernest and julio learned their parents had died of gunshot wounds in

fight with their younger brother preventing him from marketing cheese under the joseph gallo name his marketing team fought grassroots battles store by store using tactics such as moving rivals

contract with the company to the teamsters a national boycott of gallo products cut as much as of sales in some areas mr gallo was symbolically tried by university of california at berkeley students for "crimes against the people " mr gallo countered ufw suits that alleged unfair labor practices by seeking injunctions against the union "we believe we have turned the other cheek too long " he told the new york times in mr chavez called off the boycott in he also forged ties to politicians including contributions to former u s sen alan cranston who in helped push through a law dubbed the "gallo amendment" that allowed ernests and julios heirs and those of other wealthy families to spread their estate tax payments over a decade gallo with ernests son joseph chief executive and other family members in the business always insisted the company remain privately held a position it reiterated after his death gallo sold an estimated million of the million cases of wine sold in the u s last year according to gomberg fredrikson &amp associates a wine industry consulting firm but in an early s exchange with michael mondavi son of the famous vintner robert mondavi mr gallo suggested size

ernest gallos son joseph becomes chief executive officer charles f ehret scientist offered solution to victims of jet lag jet lag sufferers as diverse as president ronald reagan the mormon tabernacle choir and rock group aerosmith relied on the advice of charles f ehret for relief a bronx born zoologist specializing in chronobiology or the science of circadian rhythms mr ehret probed the effects of light and diet on biological clocks starting with single celled organisms as subjects in the s before turning to jet lag he developed an foot spectrograph to determine the effects of wavelengths on the mating habits of paramecia a colleague once dubbed him "the kinsey of the protozoa " the spread of long range travel in the s introduced an unforeseen ailment jet lag and brought mr ehret an opportunity to extend his research to multicellular organisms opinion was mixed on how to combat the fatigue and disorientation that were the effect of rapid transit across time zones though most seemed to agree that some mixture of sleep and diet were involved in after more than a decade of study mr ehret released the "argonne anti jet lag diet " a regimen of diet and sleep designed to alter the bodys internal clock the argonne national laboratory where he worked from until he retired in distributed hundreds of thousands of cards with a short form of the diet in mr ehret published a more comprehensive version in "overcoming jet lag " a licensed version of the argonne anti jet lag diet is available online at antijetlagdiet com he recommended a four day lead up to jet travel with a diet sometimes abbreviated "feast fast feast fast " feast days included big protein filled breakfasts to amp up metabolism in the morning and carbohydrates at night to slow it down he warned against the tendency of the american diet to do the opposite "sugar cereal and sugar drinks for breakfast thus tend to tell you to go back to sleep again " while a steak and eggs breakfast or a lower in cholesterol equivalent is actually just what you need " "every cell in the body is a clock " he wrote "and theyre all brought together by a special pacemaker in the brain " among his more intriguing findings is a bit of wisdom familiar to any american who has visited europe jet lag is worse traveling east than west because "it is easier to slow down the biological clock than to speed it up " mr ehret added a few other caveats those traveling east should seek sunlight in the mornings and drink coffee at night while westbound fliers should drink coffee in the morning and limit sunlight exposure to the afternoons also abstain from alcohol and wear comfortable clothes mr ehret told people magazine in that he first tested out his theories on his own family during a trip to vienna on which they were "feeling terrific" while "everyone else on the plane was zonked out " his diet got great publicity in when president reagan followed it during a trip to tokyo he used it again the next
