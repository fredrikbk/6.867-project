basel switzerland plans to launch its rival product cera this spring despite a bitter patent battle with amgen that has divided the onetime partners fda officials said the black box was sparked by recent studies that have pointed to risks tied to the drugs particularly when doctors used them for very aggressive treatments karen weiss deputy director of the agencys office of oncology drug products said the "bulk of the data that has raised concerns" came when patients were given higher than recommended doses whether they were suffering from anemia tied to kidney problems or cancer

off guard amgens chief executive kevin sharer said he wasnt surprised by the move because the firm has been working to revise the product labels the fda also said that marketing claims that the drugs improve patients quality of life by reducing fatigue and other conditions will have to be reviewed and in some cases should stop in cancer patients the agency never approved such claims for labeling
