head to a panel of experts who decide how to bridge the gap between players and management fantasy arbitrators rule on whether trades should go through or whether a roster move conforms to a leagues constitution many fantasy leagues have full constitutions often written in high level legalese the impartiality of arbitrators is especially important because many league commissioners have their own teams in the league which could compromise their capacity to govern making it more difficult is that many of these fantasy participants are pals so says robert burghardt "blame us go ahead if you dont
