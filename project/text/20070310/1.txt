a penny not saved new york and several other states california illinois massachusetts michigan new hampshire north dakota rhode island and sometimes in connecticut have an "item pricing law" ipl requiring that for most goods in retail stores each item have its own individual price sticker in other states a simple price tag on the shelf is considered sufficient the argument for the ipl is that without individual price tags consumers could not tell if pricing errors are made how do these laws actually work in practice in a recent paper my co authors and i examined the economics in detail since a principal benefit of an ipl to consumers is that they can prevent overcharges the reasonable question to ask is how common are these pricing errors for evidence the most recent and comprehensive study is by the federal trade commission in this study found that overcharges occurred in about of the items sold and that the average cost of overpricing for all items was less than one cent per item undercharges were about equally likely thus estimates of the potential benefits of ipls are less than one cent per item the ipls also have costs however it is expensive and time consuming to put labels on each item and it also makes changing prices more expensive than otherwise meaning that stores are less likely to have sales of covered items in a competitive industry like grocery retailing any cost increase will translate into a price increase we would therefore expect ipls to lead to higher prices how much higher there is no discussion in the existing literature of the effect of ipls on prices this is what we studied in order to estimate the effect of the laws on actual prices an area where one could compare similar stores subject to different laws is best and the tri state region of suburban new york new jersey and connecticut is ideal this region has similar socioeconomic characteristics and markets are comparable in many respects new york is an ipl state and new jersey is not in connecticut stores must either have item prices or use electronic shelf labeling systems so that there are some stores subject to ipls and some stores that are not we gathered data on prices of identical items in grocery stores in these three states in two rounds in the first round we sampled products four times in four stores two ipl stores one store exempt because it was in connecticut and used electronic shelf labeling and one store in new jersey a non ipl state in the second round we sampled prices of two categories of products in stores ipl stores three stores exempt from ipl because of electronic shelf labeling and five non ipl stores in both rounds we included stores from the same chain located in different states altogether we collected price observations results were consistent across both sets of data prices in ipl stores are cents to cents higher per item than in non ipl stores stores in connecticut with electronic shelf labels were in the middle with prices cents lower than in ipl stores and cents higher than in non ipl stores because electronic shelf labels are more expensive than old fashioned labels but cheaper than item pricing all results are highly statistically significant the maximum estimate of the benefit of avoiding overcharges to consumers through ipls is less that one cent per item the costs exceed cents per item the laws are a bad deal for consumers how significant are these price differences about a quarter per item the average price of the items in our sample was about &# so there is a difference this implies that prices of groceries are almost higher in ipl stores food represents about of the average familys budget ipls therefore reduce the real incomes of families by more than a nontrivial amount in sum our study shows that ipls impose net costs on consumers much greater than any potential benefit jurisdictions without them should not pass them and jurisdictions with them should repeal them in new york city where costs and so prices are already very high consumers would greatly benefit from a reduction in grocery prices mr rubin is a professor of economics and law at emory university the study discussed in this essay was coauthored with mark bergen daniel levy sourav ray and benjamin zeliger and will be published in the journal of law and economics see related letter "letters to the editor item pricing and overcharging in groceries" wsj march
