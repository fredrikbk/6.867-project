pursuits leisure &amp arts in the fray art for putins sake an exhibition shows moscows craving for respect and its artists reluctance to take on the regime moscow the march launch of the second moscow biennale of contemporary art was sandwiched in time between the beating to death of an ethnic politician in moscow by suspected nationalists and the violent pro regime attack on opposition demonstrators in st petersburg days later those events followed the notoriously public murders of prominent anti putin critics around the world and were succeeded in recent days by a mysterious double poisoning and a defenestration against such a background the kremlin desperately needs good pr the fact that moscow hosts a biennale at all and the art world attends in force undoubtedly benefits the regimes pretenses to respectability on the other hand with political art back in fashion everywhere you would also think the biennale offered a perfect platform for russias artists to express antiregime protest or even for the world to express its outrage to and for russians of the latter form of expression there was precious little in evidence no surprise perhaps and no change from the soviet period throughout the first days schedule of openings in vast fashionably raw spaces the worlds arts intellectuals have always preferred to take potshots at the west not least because the west doesnt shoot back at them but even rewards them with fame and funds and this surely presented the kremlin with a prickly conundrum to appear half way respectable mr putins biennale needed a little disrespect the west always has it so should moscow how could he get some in just the right token amount at first sight moscow seemed to have everything else required of a thoroughly modern biennale not least the presence of such art world luminaries as mathew barney the guggenheim award winning video star and art basel chief sam keller among a slew of curators and collectors and gallerists it had all the requisite corporate sponsorship by russian companies grown fat on putin approved success and their offshoots in the form of glitzy private museum collections it even had the perfect deconstructed and fixed up artist style venues the first nights videofest above a glam bergdorf goodman like fashion store occupied an entire raw concrete upper story with a standard global mix of utterly forgettable video imagery and absolutely no political critique of the kremlin indeed almost no politics at all but for a caustic image or two of condoleezza rice and donald rumsfeld the next venue at the unfinished federation tower skyscraper some miles out of town served up splendid views from high up and three bare floors of exhaustingly derivative world art again the kremlin got off scot free clearly mr putin had not solved his conundrum here nor later at the main biennale location at the abandoned winzavod winery which i trawled for days in vain the next days opening of a marat guelman gallery private show seemed promising though staged at the state run house of artists marat guelman one of the handful of famous moscow gallerists left from s got beaten up last year within an inch of his life by nationalist thugs after mounting an all ethnic show mr guelman himself is a paradox he also made his name as a loyalist political consultant helping the kremlin steer politics its way disgusted he then turned to dissent through his gallery and suffered for it now he plans to launch the international party later this month to integrate russias ethnic minorities into politics to do so he needed permission from the minister of justice in effect a nod from mr putin he got it proving that even dissent requires kremlin approval mr guelman says "rock music used to be the medium of protest now popular rock bands open for rallies of pro kremlin parties art is potentially the new the last medium of opposition " but as one skeptic said mr putin can afford that kind of opposition since almost no one sees it mr guelmans show however didnt feature much opposition the nearest thing to it a portrait of the dying polonium victim alexander litvinenko in bed carried a weirdly opaque caption that read in part "when im in a crisis i can barely move " a russian art critic standing nearby explained it as an example of subversion through irony at last at an official show in the state owned new tretyakov gallery paradoxically i found the most dramatic antiregime displays or perhaps not paradoxically here at least mr putins officials could allow protest in precise doses the exhibition chronicled "independent" art from the soviet era which produced artists like komar and melamid to the present mr putin certainly didnt intend the three bare corridors empty of the chinese contributions that hadnt been released through customs this was one form of protest albeit mute against the corruption that bedeviled so many parts of the biennale one heard endless complaints from foreign curators about the incessant bribery needed through customs and beyond about the arrogance of officials and guards all byproducts of an increasingly state centralized power system the shows contemporary section featured two photos of chechen war events provocative enough considering that the mass media air nothing about chechen troubles anymore what wasnt shown what was removed from the walls was a satirical depiction of a recent military scandal in which officers were forcibly prostituting young male conscripts and pocketing the income that no doubt proved a protest too far at a party at mr guelmans house i asked artists about the paucity of political protest art especially considering its ubiquity now in the u s "it doesnt sell yet in russia " said one "and theres so much money in art now irony sells " others complained about the fear of marginalization the fading of the artists role as dissident some objected asking why should artists be political because i said when things get bad enough not to be political is not to be an artist i got this rather wary reply "we all know if putin goes it could be worse it could be chaos and nationalism we are all trying to manage the situation he knows that and uses it he allows just enough violence and just enough protest so he thinks its a dangerous game " mr kaylan writes about culture for the journal
