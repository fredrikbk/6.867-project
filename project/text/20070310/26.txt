journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources china new law backing individuals property rights highlights divisions about economic change chinas imminent adoption of a law that will give individuals greater property rights goes to the heart of the countrys struggles over economic overhaul the economist in a cover story examining the debate over the law tells how the latest measure aimed at lessening the states grip on the economy has widened the gulf between business leaders and the urban middle class on the one hand and those who see themselves as defenders of the communist ideology on the other maneuvering within that breach are chinas president hu jintao and prime minister wen jiabao who hope to continue to foster economic growth without alienating traditional socialists rhetorically messrs hu and wen have tilted more to the left than their predecessors to appease the party faithful while at the same time allowing the private sector to flourish under their watch the new law is mainly aimed at reassuring the fast growing middle class that their assets are secure its ratification expected later this month would give private property the same legal protection as state property until now state and local officials have been able to seize businesses and land for housing and factory construction in return for little or no compensation moves that have led to widespread protests while the new regulation represents what the economist calls a "great symbolic victory" for both economic overhaul and the rule of law it is far from a revolution for one the law will do little to diminish the growing economic gap between the urban middle class and the rural poor peasants still wont be able to sell the land on which they farm or borrow against it two steps that would aid tens of millions of people in the countryside whats more the government has been aggressive in tamping down on the fierce public debate that the proposed law has sparked the state still controls the media and lavishes resources on "the best cyber censorship money can buy " the economist notes the property rights bill is in many ways a breakthrough the newsweekly says but it does little to address the "simmering resentment in the countryside " ultimately it reflects the governments desire to "keep all constituencies happy but the middle class a bit more so than others " the economist march politics background as organizer in chicago molded obama while barack obamas background as a political organizer has drawn less attention than his high profile years at harvard law school the roots of his political style and philosophy point directly to those early experiences in chicago on the surface that connection is surprising says ryan lizza in a largely flattering profile of the presidential candidate in the new republic twenty years later mr obama presents himself "as a post partisan consensus builder not a rabble rouser " when he is campaigning sen obama endorses practical and nonideological solutions contributing to the impression that he is above the partisan fray "a fresh face who is a generation removed from the polarizing turmoil of the s " yet rather than distance himself from his activist past mr obama embraces it when asked whether there were links between his organizing work in the s and his current campaign the senator replies "i think there is i dont think you need to strain for it " mr obama whose grass roots work focused on addressing housing problems and other urban poor concerns says organizing workshops are where he learned the concept of "being predisposed to other peoples power " he also learned how to play to peoples core needs "the key to creating successful organizations was making sure peoples self interest was met " he tells mr lizza "and not just basing it on pie in the sky idealism " mr obamas deft politicking as editor of the law review at harvard is now well known a skill mr lizza says stems both from the consensus building side of mr obamas organizing years and from his familiarity with motivating people to act equally important was the connection mr obama forged with chicago area religious leaders although he initially avoided attending church services in the s he eventually joined the trinity united church of christ on the citys south side whose motto is "unashamedly black and unapologetically christian " some political observers have speculated that mr obamas nonconfrontational style could become a liability during a hard knuckle presidential campaign perhaps speaking to those doubts mr obama says that one of the lessons he drew from his organizing days is that in politics what really moves things isnt public interest or grand principles but "money and votes and power " the new republic march technology web search services stumble when required to act locally why is it technology columnist stephen wildstrom wonders that the web can quickly turn up the complete text of "canterbury tales" in middle english but it still cant easily locate a pharmacy open in your neighborhood at a m search tools are brilliant at finding the obscure and global he says but in a test of major search companies local services all came up short mr wildstrom first sought to track down an all night drugstore near his home in washington d c only yahoo inc s local search delivered reasonable results he reports google inc s google local and microsoft corp s live surfaced some irrelevant choices while ask com found nothing matching his request a search for an indian restaurant near his home fared somewhat better the main reason local search does so poorly is that the tools that are used to scour the web are based on keywords and sites popularity the algorithms dont know that "a hour refill phone line is different from a hour store " fortunately mr wildstrom says alternatives exist services such as citysearch or yelp which incorporate human input are better at finding restaurants and the all night pharmacy that had eluded the search engines turned up quickly in an old fashioned look at the yellow pages businessweek
