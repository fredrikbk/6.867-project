the new sources of inflation your front page article on the relationship between unemployment and inflation "policy makers at fed rethink inflations roots " feb leaves out several important ideas it is true that the fed and others obsessed on the relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate and the idea of "expectations" from the s until a few years ago this orthodoxy was upended during the second half of the s because very low unemployment failed to trigger the inflation the fed and the macroeconomists expected unemployment fell to and inflation didnt materialize so now the fed and academics are trying to explain what happened it shouldnt be so hard the real reason inflation has been decoupled from low unemployment in the u s is obvious when you observe the changes that have taken place in the economy quite simply there is more intense competition than there was in the s and s and this competition limits the ability of companies and unions to raise prices and wages import competition starting in the s broke the industrial oligopolies in autos steel and most other manufactured products effectively ending inflation from weak competition in this area deregulation pushed through in the late s did the same thing for trucking airlines railroads pipelines telecommunications and several other industries financial deregulation starting in the s created competition for traditional lenders the nasdaq came on with a push from congress and the white house to challenge the big board regional banks challenged new york and junk bonds created other borrowing options for rising companies borrowing got cheaper a similar thing happened in retailing wal mart broke the system of traditional markups transformed retailing and largely ended inflation from this quarter todays situation is a validation of this argument from where is todays modest inflation coming not surprisingly it is from specific sectors like energy health care and education where weak competition slows cost reducing innovation in energy opec is an international cartel and the u s lacks the political will to adopt policies to conserve and develop competitive alternatives health care is dominated by local monopolies that prevent payers and patients from comparing and shopping among doctors and hospitals for the best care at the best price and of course education is dominated by local monopolies almost impervious to competition for students and the financial resources they should bring to good schools and take away from bad ones inflation was and is about weak competition and government policies that permit it low unemployment and expectations have little to do with it if the fed thinks it has a way to deal with inflation in energy health care and education id like to hear it but interest rate adjustments wont do it paul a london ph d washington
