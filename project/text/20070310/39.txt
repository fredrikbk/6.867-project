picking winners more kidneys for transplants may go to young policy to stress benefit to patient over length of time on wait list the nations organ transplant network is preparing a major change in how it rations scarce kidneys that would favor young patients over old in an effort to wring more life out of donated organs today a donated kidney generally goes to the person who has been waiting longest in the region in which it becomes available with exceptions made for certain medical factors a kidney from a year old donor could be transplanted into a year old who is likely to die years before the kidney would have stopped working the new policy is being developed by the united network for organ sharing the nonprofit body that develops organ distribution policy under a government contract surgeons and others leading the process expect the final proposal will rely significantly though not exclusively on the concept of "net benefit " which seeks to give kidneys first to those who will benefit most from them "waiting time is arbitrary " said alan leichtman a university of michigan kidney doctor helping to craft the policy "it seems like a real shame that were not being better stewards of the organs " the concept is gaining traction among transplant doctors but creating anxiety for some patients and surgeons who worry the new system wont be fair to all "is it correct or permissible for the system to say the five or six more years of life that a year old is going to get are less valuable less important than the more years of life the year old is going to get " asked richard freeman a transplant surgeon at tufts new england medical center in boston the unos board has yet to receive a specific proposal and any decision by the board must be approved by the u s department of health and human services because of the concern over the "net benefit" approach waiting time is likely to remain a factor in the formula calculating who gets a kidney deceased donors provided kidneys for transplant in another came from living donors who usually give to a close friend or relative but those organs fall far short of meeting demand and the waiting list for a kidney has grown to more than people the reasons include the surge of diabetes a principal cause of kidney failure and the aging u s population some people die waiting each year the federal government through the medicare program pays for kidney transplants which account for more than half of all organ transplants the question of how to distribute kidneys from deceased donors presents a classic conflict between utility which seeks to provide the greatest good for the greatest number and equity which seeks fairness for all individuals the rules for allocating kidneys have been revised before to downgrade the importance of tissue matching between donor and recipient for instance but the changes now under way are the most significant since a national allocation policy was first developed years ago the department of health and human services directed unos in to revise its allocation policies and submit them for review specifically the department said unos should seek the best use of donated organs and de emphasize waiting time in favor of objective medical criteria unos has already overhauled its rules for livers hearts and lungs "we understand that some people will gain and some people will lose but in the end the purpose is to make the system a more sensible one " said gabriel danovitch medical director of the university of california los angeles kidney transplant program under current rules said dr danovitch who is helping shape the new policy he may be offered a kidney from an year old and the first name on the waiting list is a year old "i say ok thats the rule in my heart i say thats not right " he said supporters of keeping the current approach say its the fairest because it ensures that those waiting if they hold out and stay alive will eventually make it to the top of the list "we need a system which offers hope to all regardless of age " said glenda rosenbloom a liver transplant recipient at a recent forum in dallas organized by unos ms rosenbloom who spoke on behalf of the transplant recipients international organization said she is in her s the new kidney proposal was impelled by research suggesting that donated kidneys could bring considerably more years of life to recipients under a different system statistics show that age is by far the biggest factor predicting how long someone will live after a transplant a typical year old diabetic will gain an extra years of life from a transplant while a typical year old diabetic will gain only extra years according to the scientific registry of transplant recipients which is administered by a private group in ann arbor mich and tracks data under a government contract other factors affecting survival include underlying illness and whether a person is overweight or has had a previous transplant they too are included in the "net benefit" calculation transplants performed under the existing system generate about extra years of life for the people who receive new kidneys each year according to the registry if all kidneys were distributed using a net benefit calculation that number would rise to more than years it says the registry has also calculated how the ages of recipients would change if net benefit became the decisive factor the calculation shows that the share of kidneys going to patients in their s would rise to from today just of kidneys would go to patients and up versus today young diabetics would get a particular boost they typically do poorly on dialysis where a machine performs the blood cleansing function of the kidney but well with a transplant older diabetics who developed the disease as adults now get of the kidneys but would get just under a pure net benefit system talk of change makes some patients nervous clive grawe a traffic engineer for the city of los angeles fears for himself and his daughter they both have polycystic kidney disease a genetic condition that typically doesnt cause problems until middle age those who take care of themselves can forestall kidney failure until they are older said mr grawe but that would make it harder to get a transplant "should my daughter be penalized for living a healthy life if her kidneys fail at rather than in her s " he said "its not only for me that im fighting but its for my daughter too " kevin sandes of raleigh n c sees it differently the former restaurant manager has been on dialysis since thanksgiving and is on disability "after doing the dialysis the first couple weeks youre like i cant do this for five years because its horrible " he said "if this policy change happened when i was or years old i dont know how i would feel about it then right now i feel like it makes perfect sense " transplant doctors and others involved in the discussions have pushed unos to modify the system to give older patients a better shot "i dont think we should say waiting time doesnt count for anything " said john roberts chief of the division of transplantation at the university of california san francisco mark stegall chairman of the unos kidney committee said it is working to refine its original concept in a way that would gain more life from existing kidneys while maintaining "as much hope and equity in the system" as possible the committee is likely to revise the net benefit formula to account for how long someone has been on dialysis dr stegall said under the leading idea he said the healthiest kidneys would be distributed through a formula that relies largely on net benefit while the formula for kidneys coming from older or sicker donors would give greater weight to time on dialysis in effect this system would tell older people who have been on dialysis a long time that they could still have a shot at a kidney but the chances would be much better if they took a lesser quality one patients working with their doctors could calculate the odds and decide how poor a kidney they were willing to accept this system could have the added benefit of getting more patients to accept marginal kidneys when they are offered experts said as it is patients near the top of the waiting list often pass on these kidneys when they become available knowing they will remain at the top of the list for the next high quality kidney the unos committee has sidestepped one explosive issue computer modeling shows that african american patients do better than average on dialysis and therefore gain less "net benefit" with a transplant the committee specifically ruled out using race as an explicit factor in allocating kidneys still some worry that elements of the new formula will tend to hurt black patients anyway for instance it was going to give a boost to people who have a particular antigen or protein that is advantageous in extending life but that blacks are less likely to have that provision may be scrapped the committee is likely to make a tweak that would help black patients blacks are much more likely than whites to have blood type b but there are not as many "b" organ donors thats a major obstacle for blacks waiting for kidney transplants the committee is considering allowing certain a blood type kidneys which work effectively in both a and b patients to be made available to patients with blood type b the new policy is also likely to scrap rules that automatically send a donor kidney to anyone who is a "perfect match" on six antigens relevant to kidney transplantation this policy which accounts for how of the donated kidneys are distributed does less to improve outcomes nowadays because of better antirejection drugs to protect those who have been waiting a long time already the committee may gradually phase in changes to the system see related letters "letters to the editor donor compensation could solve kidney
