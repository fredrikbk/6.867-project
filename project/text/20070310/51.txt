pursuits sports golf journal giving kids a shot in pasadena two coaches bring golf to low income teens pasadena calif imelda treto a freshman at john muir high school here was so nervous in anticipation of tuesdays golf match against pasadena high school that she couldnt get down lunch this was an improvement over her state of mind before the teams previous match her first ever when she wasnt able to eat either breakfast or lunch the stakes were high in this match between two predominantly hispanic and black schools struggling to get their golf programs going not only are muir and pasadena archrivals their annual season ending football competition called the turkey tussle takes place in the rose bowl but this match was the only one either team had a realistic chance of winning muir lost its previous match by points to a team with several players capable of shooting even par ms treto who jerked her opening drive out of bounds high over a chain link fence recovered well enough to finish with a despite her being the only girl that was the best score on her team largely because she is one of the few players on either squad with any significant exposure to golf her father is a greenskeeper at a local municipal course for two of the pasadena players tuesdays round was not only their first competition but also their first time to play on an actual golf course "muir is a tough school " says al lucero jr whose son albert iii plays on the team "but golf is good for teaching these kids etiquette and how to be gentlemen and ladies also for dealing with temper i tell al that youre not playing against someone else youre playing the course and you have to learn to deal with your own mistakes " the golf industry through initiatives such as first tee and the pga of americas "play golf america " has been trying to open the game to more low income and minority kids but as a look at the situation in pasadena reveals its a tough challenge at both muir and pasadena high schools previous efforts at establishing golf programs failed because of overcommitted staff undertrained golf coaches funding crunches and lack of interest among the kids my own take is that school programs because of the team friendships and continuity they offer are really the ideal place for kids without golf in their lives to learn what the game is all about the current programs at pasadena and muir now in their second years appear more promising if only because of the commitment of the coaches both are essentially volunteers even though the school district does pay them small stipends to defray expenses at muir coach fred robledo is a retired newspaper sportswriter who attended the school in the s when it was more prosperous during spring break last year he arranged for his four players with the highest grades to stay at his time share apartment in palm springs and receive two days of instruction with his friend and former pga tour player mac ogrady this year five team members will make the trip mr robledos brother danny a football coach also works daily with the team at pasadena the coach is eli harris a recently retired film industry electrician assisting him is reginald bedney a former dentist who ran a junior golf clinic in pasadena for nine years until funding ran out "im not saying anybodys going to be a professional golfer " mr harris says "but from my experience i know how great golf is for making friends and networking whatever and i just want these kids to get a shot at that " by far the hardest part of starting up a program at schools like these is getting students to take part "everybody thinks its boring but thats because they dont know how to play " says rogelio villarreal a broad shouldered senior who is pasadenas top player "i was that way at first it made me mad and i wanted to quit but then i got used to it and i started practicing all the time " all but nine of the or so students who showed up at the pasadena golf team organizational meeting last fall eventually dropped out most didnt realize how hard it was just to hit the ball or were put off by the initial sessions on school property hitting half shots with wiffle balls others had to take after school jobs or became academically ineligible but when the teams were finally allowed by interscholastic rules to go off campus to practice last month some got the hang of it right away muir won tuesdays nine hole match to the players clearly had a blast and the camaraderie contrasted sharply with what i am told are the tensions that usually accompany football games between the schools most players hit the ball reasonably well off the tee but their short games and poor recovery skills reflected their lack of on course experience last fall mr harris told all potential players and their parents that he was looking primarily for freshmen and sophomores "if we want to make this thing grow we have to have kids that are going to stay with it " he says "getting kids to stick with golf three or four years in a row thats how i would define success then theyll have a game they can play until their bodies dont need oxygen anymore " email me at
