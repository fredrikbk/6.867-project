pursuits books vietnam revisited an antiwar son a marine father family quagmire anyone the father of all things by tom bissell pantheon pages &# when tom bissell pondered his fathers war having heard about it in family conversation over the years the vietnam conflict seemed the stuff of poetry "for all its dreads " as the younger man imagines service there "in vietnam you never lost the simple human awareness of being alive it was a young mans land covered in a dew of terrifying possibility " but when mr bissell and his father john actually tour vietnam in at the behest of harpers magazine poetry gives way to outrage the war was an atrocity bissell jr simply cannot get over the crimes of his own country especially as he has gleaned them from his pre trip research and a searing visit to the war remnants museum in ho chi minh city since he shares some of his fathers genes he seems to worry that he shares some of the guilt as well "the father of all things" purports to be a meditative travelogue and a portrait of father son bonding but politics is nearly everywhere in the book intruding on the past one of the rare unpolitical moments comes when tom asks his father if he had a marine corps nickname yes "nice guy " it was earned when bissell sr stopped to compensate a vietnam peasant for a water buffalo accidentally killed by his patrol while a general overhead in a helicopter demanded that the marines keep moving his son seems astonished by the paradox of kindness in the killing fields yet such moments are part of every war including vietnams as i saw during my own months as a reporter there for the most part american soldiers are kind mr bissell has less difficulty believing his own countrys crimes of course they were by his reckoning continual awful and unforgivable and were repeating them today in iraq he doesnt make the connection explicitly instead when he tallies lyndon johnsons mendacities for instance mr bissell likens them to those of "another president " not named for the sins of vietnam he especially blames lbj adviser walt rostow and nixon adviser henry kissinger largely it seems because they never apologized for their crimes "a disgustingly evasive book " the bibliography says of mr kissingers "ending the vietnam war " "by a thoroughly disgusting statesman " well at least we know where our chronicler stands mr bissell blames fools as well as criminals for vietnam such as the washington bureaucrat who said that he believed himself better off without military experience since the omission freed him to think creatively i take mr bissells point but what is true for bureaucrats is also true for reporters some first hand knowledge really does come in handy the lack of it leads for instance to mr bissells thinking that u s special forces conducted "unconditional warfare" in vietnam when their specialty was unconventional warfare does it make a difference i think so in the end i found myself liking the father more and the son less mr bissell writes well and he has read widely from bernard falls prescient "street without joy" to david butlers affecting "the fall of saigon " and he did go to the trouble of walking the ground even if it was long after the shooting stopped but mr bissells disgust is so pervasive that i wearied of it wasnt there one decent human being in the u s war effort military or civilian democrat or republican in saigon or washington was every motive sinister was nobody ever simply mistaken most important was there no cause worth fighting for mr bissell could have spoken to a few of the vietnamese boat people who fled the communists after the war they might have shown him a different perspective the bissells visit to hue the city near the demilitarized zone where during the tet offensive the u s marines won the battle but lost their countrys support captures the flavor of "the father of all things " when the two men arrive at the citadel an imperial palace complex bissell sr pronounces the enclave "neat " thats not good enough for bissell jr who prods his father throughout the trip for therapeutic exchanges that never come at hue bissell jr chides his father "come on neat " and then launches into a description of how the french who once ruled vietnam found it "humbling" that vietnamese culture was "hundreds of years older than french culture " thus bissell jr says the french were willing to negotiate once war started he asks his father repeatedly whether he is "bitter" that the marines didnt train him in cultural sensitivity bissell sr wont confess to bitterness on that score but after sucking his teeth and thinking a bit he allows that the u s could have accomplished a lot with humanitarian aid in rural areas if we had understood the country better the author might want to improve his own grasp of vietnamese culture he tells us that the citadel is "ancient " but in fact construction on it started in besotted with the settings beauty and supposed antiquity he finds himself envying the simple pride shown by hien their guide "soon hien was no longer leading us instead he seemed pleased simply to stand amid the astonishments of such a storied place " mr bissell himself he confesses has never felt a similar awe at any of his own countrys cultural monuments the lincoln memorial say he asks his father "why is that " "because youre an ungrateful little prick " replies john nice guy bissell mr ford is the author of "flying tigers claire chennault and his american volunteers " forthcoming from harpercollins
