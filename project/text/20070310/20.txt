google gains on goal of controlling and targeting tv commercials google inc has established a toehold in pursuing of one its next big ambitions controlling which television ads viewers see and tailoring them to consumers interests the mountain view calif company honed the highly profitable internet model of search advertising that is selling ads targeted directly at consumers based on the terms they enter into web search engines last year the eight year old company racked up more than &# billion of revenue by brokering online ads for itself and its partners now google has begun a test run serving up tv commercials to cable subscribers in concord calif people familiar with the matter say the pilot project to bring its approach to cable boxes represents a foray into the &# billion u s market for tv advertising much bigger game than googles online turf while the effort is in its early stages the progress underscores how google could bring changes to how tv commercials are sold and delivered to viewers other internet companies are also pursuing an entree into tv advertising and any major google success could eventually challenge the traditional tv and advertising powers in the concord test google has been steering tv commercials to subscribers of cable provider astound broadband a unit of wavedivision holdings llc since last year according to four people familiar with the matter when those consumers watch tv some of the commercials they see have been sold to advertisers by google and delivered to the cable company so that they appear in the normal breaks in tv programming as other ads do if the system is successful google could eventually try to establish itself as a middleman for purchasing tv spots furthering its stated goal of offering advertisers one stop shopping for ads across virtually all media there is no assurance though that google can repeat its success in online search advertising a field in which it had little serious competition in the crowded highly competitive arena of conventional media the previously undisclosed concord effort being conducted with a small group of advertisers is aimed at testing the computer and network infrastructure needed for google to broker and deliver commercials to cable systems more widely in the test advertisers are buying commercial placements through an auction system people familiar with the matter say but it is at an early enough stage that the buys are being handled manually by google salespeople rather than through a full fledged automated auction system like the one google uses to sell ads online one of the people says google chief executive eric schmidt in january told analysts the company was experimenting with tv advertising without offering specifics but he said the company intends to use its technology to better target tv commercials to users rather than every household seeing the same commercial google in theory might tap databases with information about the demographics of an individuals neighborhood and examine the content of the program being watched at a given moment to better select which ads to beam through the tv so for example a household in an area with lots of children might be more likely to see commercials for minivans than for sports cars while federal privacy law restricts what cable companies can do with "personally identifiable information " the theory is that consumers will be better served seeing ads more relevant to them and will perhaps agree to share information about their habits and interests with google such data eventually might allow google or others to more specifically tailor ads to individual households such as beaming ads for dog foods to viewers who own dogs "advertisers in particular will pay much higher rates for ads that are targeted than ones that are untargeted " mr schmidt noted at this stage the commercials arent targeted to specific households in concord which isnt far from googles northern california headquarters people familiar with the matter say and the company likely wont on its own tap information about a specific households buying patterns or other behaviors in order to choose the commercials because of the privacy concerns one of the people says a spokeswoman for wavedivision couldnt be reached for comment but an executive with astound which has more than subscribers confirmed the test with google is taking place "as we have stated publicly we think we can add value to tv advertising by making this important medium more relevant for users measurable and more accountable for existing and new advertisers " a google spokesman said "as part of this we are currently running a small early phase trial working closely with a small number of partners and advertisers " googles interest in tv commercials comes as the cable industry itself is turning to advertising as a promising source of revenue one reason technology developments are starting to make it possible to target ads to specific households as google envisions the internet and cable players all want to play a role several of the largest cable operators have also had discussions with google about teaming up to do some form of tv advertising google has broached the subject with comcast corp the countrys largest cable operator with more than million subscribers as part of broader negotiations focusing on whether google will continue as the search engine on comcasts broadband portal comcast net their current deal expires at the end of this year some cable industry executives are wary about giving a behemoth like google too much power over their advertising but many also recognize that google will likely be a major force in the business "we all believe as advertising moves from one way to two way the winners are the googles of the world and others that can provide truly two way addressable advertising " said steve burke comcasts chief operating officer during a recent earnings call googles attempts to extend its ad brokering to traditional media arent expected any time soon to contribute significantly to its revenue of which came from internet ads last year its traditional media advertising efforts have also been bumpy to date googles executives admit to problems with the companys first tests of print ad sales they have given the system a major overhaul analysts say google hasnt yet lined up enough radio ad inventory to make its efforts there significant while some advertisers are pushing for an internet based system for tv commercial sales such as google might provide a group of them chose to team up with online auctioneer ebay inc instead even then the tv networks and some advertisers and media buyers have proven resistant to such efforts to overhaul how tv ads are sold some cable operators make as much as of their revenue by selling mostly local ads in the time slots they get as part of their deals with the cable networks they carry but cable companies feel they could greatly increase ad revenue by introducing a wide range of interactive features they see as the holy grail of advertising the ability to target different viewers with different commercials suited to their interests much as google imagines "were talking about delivering to advertisers things they increasingly like about the internet " says glenn britt time warner cable inc s chief executive time warner cable had "preliminary conversations" with google but the talks didnt advance because time warner executives didnt feel google had much to add to its advertising effort according to mr britt "we have the technological capabilities to do those things " he said "we dont really need them " comcast is separately planning targeted ad serving tests this year with three vendors that have been working close with cable operators on new forms of advertising including opentv corp visible world and invidi technologies according to people familiar with the matter but comcast executives caution that next year would be the earliest the company would launch this type of advertising "in its going to be baby steps " said charlie thurston president of comcast spotlight the operators advertising arm cable operators have to be careful about what they disclose to advertisers and others on customer viewing habits federal law privacy restricts what cable companies can do with "personally identifiable information " and while its unclear exactly how big advertisers and madison avenue might welcome google and other internet players butting into the tv ad brokering business some say they are receptive "the concept is a homerun with advertisers " says tracey scheppach a vice president and video innovations director at starcom usa a media division of publicis groupe "there is just so much inefficiency and a system that allows us to serve the right ad to the right person is one that will be welcomed with open arms "
