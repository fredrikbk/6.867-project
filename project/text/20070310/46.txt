pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece charles lambs letters his missives show him to be a great whistler in the dark anatomy of a classic charles lamb the great romantic essayist made a forced march between two london confinements nearly every day for three decades in the mornings he set off for an accountants job keeping track of the vessels sent forth by the east india company earning what it took to support himself and the sister he came home to each night the occasionally mad mary who had slain their mother in a fit but on quiet evenings lamb could dispatch his own fanciful vessels wonderful letters full of gaiety and verve as good as the greatest of his essays indeed some of the essays we best remember "a dissertation on roast pig " for instance got started as private communications to friends like coleridge we love lamb for his constant susceptibility the way his feelings are excited by food "god bless me here are the birds smoking hot " tobacco and certainly drink but the gusto reported throughout his letters never proceeds from anything like ease unworthiness prompts his sympathies for the wretched "i killed a rat the other day by punching him to pieces and feel a weight of blood upon me to this hour" and melancholy often keeps him from being genial company the food he loves is usually better eaten alone and this bachelor so known for his love of teeming london who writes wordsworth that man was lucky to have sinned his way out of the too green garden of eden takes many of his urban delights from an odd solitary remove "the wonder of these sights impells me into night walks about londons crowded streets and i often shed tears in the motley strand from fulness of joy at so much life " marys mental episodes "twelve or thirteen weeks every year or two " take "a tedious cut" out of her existence and his lamb hopes for the best and blames himself for anything else his devotion to those who are out of their minds is a kind of propitiation against the threat madness presents to his own shaky nature when the essayist and poet george dyer experiences a fit of insanity in it is lamb who takes him in "he came thro a violent rain with no neckcloth on and a beard that made him a spectacle to men and angels and tapd at the door " lamb tells his friend john rickman "i shall not be sorry when he takes his nipt carcase out of my bed but i will endeavour to bring him in future into a method of dining at least once a day " when lamb finds himself living alone it is usually madness and death that have created the situation on may he writes coleridge hetty a servant died on friday night about eleven oclock after eight days illness mary in consequence of fatigue and anxiety is fallen ill again and i was obliged to remove her yesterday i am left alone in a house with nothing but hettys dead body to keep me company to morrow i bury her and then i shall be quite alone with nothing but a cat to remind me that the house has been full of living beings like myself my heart is quite sunk and i dont know where to look for relief a sheet of stationery would often suggest itself lamb is letter writings great whistler in the dark his productions a singing kettle put on for both the recipient and the writer himself two centuries later we still grab for their gossip their overstuffed descriptions "each individual flake of cod presents a pleasing resistance to the opposed tooth" their harmless japes in which a man so hemmed in by circumstance can tinker with reality in april he complains to henry crabb robinson "i have these three days been laid up with strong rheumatic pains in loins back shoulders i shriek sometimes from the violence of them i get scarce any sleep " in his next letter he admits that this was all just one upmanship to irritate the genuinely rheumatic robinson "i have no more rheumatism than that poker " lamb deprecates his letters for a tedium they never have "dull up to the dulness of a dutch commentator on shakespeare" and more honestly apologizes for the scarcity of time he has to write them innumerable distractions keep him from "epistolary purposes" chief among them is his job which he curses to wordsworth in "thirty years have i served the philistines and my neck is not subdued to the yoke " he wishes "for a few years between the grave and the desk " but when they finally arrive adjustment proves difficult he now writes letters to pass the time he never had "i pity you for over work " he writes bernard barton in "but i assure you no work is worse the mind preys on itself the most unwholesome food " if the letters of keats his younger contemporary are prescriptions for living tickets into the world lambs mood driven miniatures are respites from it little globes unto themselves complete and welcoming and for all that still hard to bear "the rooms where i was born the furniture which has been before my eyes all my life a book case which has followed me about like a faithful dog only exceeding him in knowledge wherever i have moved old chairs old tables streets squares where i have sunned myself my old school these are my mistresses " even now he is the long gone friend from whom we would most like to hear mr mallons new novel "fellow travelers " will be published in may
