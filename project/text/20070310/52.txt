pursuits style menswear in the windsor circle big knots return men wrestle with the resurgence of a wide angle look a helping hand for forest whitaker the giant tie knot last widely seen in the disco era is making a comeback spurred by the popularity of spread collar shirts and thicker "seven fold" neckties the reappearance of big knots has some men weighing the look and others fumbling in front of the mirror to master the tricky windsor knot but thicker knots raise some issues for one theres the problem of relearning something most men havent had to think about for decades how to tie a tie theres also the question of whether a look most often seen on italian businessmen hollywood stars and the occasional british royal will pass muster in the american workplace mark sunshine president of a financial services company and commercial lender based in west palm beach fla says the big knot look isnt for him though he likes the way it looks on others "in light of what i do for a living i would feel funny like i was taking a risk " he says mr sunshine who favors point collar shirts says a big knot might be seen as over the top at his company the most common american necktie knot and the one most men learned from their fathers is the four in hand which involves passing the tie through a loop twice but getting a bigger knot typically means learning a new tying style most often the windsor knot also known as a full windsor or double windsor which requires three passes through the loop the half windsor which is tied with a double loop isnt as effective at producing a big knot first timers at this are likely to see messy results on their first few tries "its a lot of trial and error " says michael markiewicz director of business management services at accounting firm marks paneth &amp shron llp mr markiewicz says he decided to try a big knot after a trip to italy where he saw the look everywhere he struggled at first with getting the length right but says hes since improved his technique though it still takes him longer to tie a bigger knot some retailers are addressing this issue by offering instructions brooks brothers recently posted a step by step guide to tying classic knots on its web site a response to customer requests the company says the new mens catalog from saks fifth avenue includes detailed tying instructions as well "its our responsibility to help " says mens fashion director michael macko "you cant just say heres a tie good luck with it " the windsor knot first caught on in the u s in the s after a visit by the duke of windsor the duke himself it turns out produced his big knots by wearing ties specially made by britains turnbull &amp asser that were so thick that he didnt actually need to tie a windsor the triple loop knot nevertheless became known as a windsor though the spread collar and thick tie knot is common on european executives its less familiar in the u s the look does have some longtime champions in american business and government though including treasury secretary henry paulson new york police commissioner raymond kelly and viacom chairman sumner redstone the knot has also been showing up lately on the red carpet tom cruise and will smiths son jaden wore them to the oscars and forest whitaker wore one to the golden globes hip hop moguls such as shawn "jay z" carter and sean "diddy" combs have been sporting big knots for several years in the u s the groundwork for this trend was laid three years ago when more men started ditching their ties altogether and buying shirts with short wide collars known as spread collars long the collar of choice in britain and italy this style looks better unbuttoned than a collar that points down men who still wore ties soon started snapping up these shirts too as spread collars gained momentum theyre now the fastest growing collar style in dress shirts according to phillips van heusen the worlds largest shirt maker tie makers saw an opportunity to push heftier ties with heftier price tags since these ties make bigger knots no matter how theyre tied they do a better job of filling the wider gap of a spread collar sales of ties costing &# or more which tend to be heavier and produce thicker knots rose in the months ended jan compared with flat sales for ties costing less according to market researcher npd group brooks brothers is now expanding its collection of seven fold ties and along with phillips van heusens neckwear division is widening and thickening other ties in its collection late last year robert talbott thickened its seven fold ties by increasing the number of times the yarn is twisted even j c penney thickened the lining in its stafford executive ties to make them beefier the "skinny ties" that came into vogue in menswear a few years ago which wont produce a very prominent knot even when tied in the bulkier windsor style have been giving way to wider ones some tie makers are also lengthening their neckwear by as much as an inch british clothier charles tyrwhitt for instance introduced a line of longer full bodied woven ties for spring big and tall clothing line jared m lengthened its already long ties for its new line for casual male stores the reason a big knot uses more fabric than a small one and can result in a tie thats too short stylists say that the thicker knots work better for some body types than others "if you have a small frame or if you are on the short side a big knot will overpower you " says stylist clinton kelly co host of tlcs "what not to wear " big men with large heads also should avoid supersizing their knots so they dont look even wider says glenn laiken an image consultant and designer in culver city calif whose clients include dr phil and pro basketball coach phil jackson image consultant carolyn gustafson who has offices in new york and north carolina says big knots and spread collar shirts work best with wide jacket lapels for a sense of proportion some shirt makers have continued to adjust their designs to accommodate big knots raising the collar band to sit higher on the neck phillips van heusens line of sean john dress shirts feature collars as much as a quarter inch higher than those on standard dress shirts windsor fans say their knots are more prominent and less likely to slip throughout the day than other styles "it shows off the tie a little more " says mr kelly the new york police commissioner whose father taught him how to tie a windsor espn sports analyst and former nba all star allan houston says the windsor knot shows that the wearer is making an effort it says "youre taking it to a different level " he says still tying a big knot can be unnerving mr whitaker the actor says hes struggled to get it right "if i keep going at it for awhile i can do it " he says for the golden globes he wore a nine fold tie by italian designer domenico vacca who personally tied a windsor knot for the actor
