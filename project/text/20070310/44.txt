pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations thats not nice here is what has been said the past week or so that sparked argument bill maher on hbo said a lot of lives would be saved if vice president cheney had died and ann coulter at a conservative political meeting suggested john edwards is a "faggot " she was trying to be funny and get a laugh he was trying to startle and get applause what followed was the predictable kabuki in which politically active groups and individuals feigned dismay as opposed to what many of them really felt which was grim delight conservatives said they were chilled by mr mahers comments but i dont think they were they were delighted he revealed what they believe is at the heart of modern liberalism which is hate liberals amused themselves making believe they were chilled by ms coulters remarks but they were not they were delighted she has revealed what they believe is at the heart of modern conservatism which is hate the truth is many liberals were dismayed by mr maher because he made them look bad and many conservatives were mad at ms coulter for the same reason i realized as i watched it all play out that theres a kind of simple way to know whether something you just heard is something that should not have been said it is did it make you wince when the winceometer is triggered its an excellent indication that what you just heard is unfortunate and ought not to be repeated in both cases mr maher and ms coulter when i heard them i winced did you i thought so in modern life we wince a lot its not the worst thing but its better when something makes you smile one of the clearest statements ever about the implied limits of legitimate political discourse was made by the imprisoned socrates in his first dialogue with crito when he said "thats not nice " actually it was your grandmother who said "thats not nice " shes the one who probably taught you the wince it is her wisdom encapsulated in those three simple words that is missing from the current debate we tie ourselves in knots trying to explain why it is or why it isnt always or occasionally helpful or destructive to use various epithets or give full voice to our resentments but the simple wisdom of grandma "thats not nice" is a good guide i should say that when i was a kid grandmas were older people who had common sense they had observed something of people had experienced life directly not only through books or tv almost all of them had religious faith and had absorbed the teachings of the bible almost all of them sat quietly at the kitchen table and even when i was a kid they were considered old fashioned they were often ethnic and had accents as a matter of fact all of them were i think that as america has grown more academic or aware of education the wisdom of grandma has been denigrated or ignored or stolen and dressed up as something else for instance rudy giulianis success in cleaning up and reviving the city of new york is generally attributed to his embrace of what is called in academic circles the broken window theory it holds that when criminals see that even small infractions are met and punished they will understand that larger infractions will be met and punished it also holds that when neighborhoods deteriorate criminals are emboldened people from harvard won great prizes for these insights but all of broken windows theory comes down to what grandma always knew and said "fix the window or theyll think no one cares when people think no one cares they do whatever they want " there was not a single grandmother in america circa who didnt know this but no one wants to quote grandma shes so yesterday and her simple teachings have been superseded by more exotic forms of instruction fifty years ago no one speaking at a respected political gathering would say would even think of saying that adlai stevenson is a faggot nor would arthur godfrey or jack paar have declared on their television shows that wed be better off if eisenhower died is our discourse deteriorating yes it is part of the reason is that grandma had more sway in the public sphere years ago which is to say common sense and a sense of decorum had more sway another part is that privately people felt they had more room to think or say whatever they wanted without being shamed or shunned it let the steam out we think of the s as buttoned up but in a way america had more give then men were understood not to be angels our country now puts less of an emphasis on public decorum courtliness self discipline decency america no longer says "thats not nice " it doesnt want to make value judgments on "good" and "bad " we have come to rely on censorship to maintain decorum we are very good at letting people know that if they say something we dont like well shame them and shun them even ruin them but censorship doesnt make people improve themselves it makes people want to rebel it tells them to toe the line or pay a price people who are urged in the right direction and taught in the right direction will usually try to discipline and improve themselves from within but they do not enjoy censorship from without they fight back they are rude in order to show they are unbroken this is human and grandma would have understood this too i think the atmosphere of political correctness is now experienced by normal people not people who speak on tv but normal people as so oppressive so demanding of constant self policing that when someone says something in public that is truly not nice not nice at all they cant help but feel that they are witnessing a prison break as long as political correctness reigns the more antic among us will try to break out with great streams of tourettes like forbidden words and ideas we should forbid less and demand more we should exert less pressure from without and encourage more discipline from within we should ask people to be dignified hope theyll be generous expect them to be fair when theyre not we should correct them but we shouldnt beat them to a pulp because thats not nice
