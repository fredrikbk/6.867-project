kim the counterfeiter drinks flowed as north koreas top negotiator and his american counterpart met in new york this week in celebration of pyongyangs promise to give up its nuclear weapons it was hard to believe that just five months ago north korea actually exploded a nuclear weapon for which it was roundly condemned but that condemnation is gone today as is any frank discussion of the criminal nature of the regime including its highly sophisticated operation to counterfeit u s currency troubling signs indicate that the bush administration is prepared to push aside north koreas illicit activities "resolving" issues surrounding macau based banco delta asia which was found to be complicit in the counterfeit operation regardless of the outcome surrounding banco delta asia active vigilance against north koreas robust and global illicit activities is essential confronting north korea on its illicit activities as a study i will release on monday shows makes the denuclearization of the korean peninsula more likely not less remarkably north korea is the first country since hitlers germany proven to counterfeit anothers currency and in a little noticed report sent to congress last september the treasury department found that the forgeries high quality "supernotes " are "being produced and distributed with the full consent and control of the north korean government " this includes both &# and &# bills from the older series to the newer "big head" notes approximately &# million of them have been seized from circulation since estimates on the amount of revenue generated from pyongyang counterfeits range from &# million to &# million per year but the actual amount may be considerably higher as one government analyst put it "we have no idea how much theyre counterfeiting because its so good " left unchecked these counterfeits could eventually weaken confidence in the u s dollar with global consequences alarmingly some countries such as ireland taiwan and peru have temporarily refused accepting our &# bills north koreas counterfeiting network is global employing a diplomatic presence in more than countries an ira splinter group leader has even been arrested for distributing these bogus bills including drug trafficking and other illicit activities the criminal sector is responsible for to of north koreas exports for kim jong il crime does pay and given its ties to international criminal organizations pyongyang has access to a vast smuggling network that could allow it to move almost anything in or out of the country including weapons of mass destruction realizing this the administration stood up the illicit activities initiative in its task was to attack the criminal lifeblood of the regime which it did the designation of banco delta asia as a "willing pawn" of the north korean government in september led banks throughout the region to sever contacts with the country shaking pyongyang and leading the regime back to the negotiating table when north korea rejoined the six party talks its representative wanted to discuss one thing money pressure not appeasement worked but in a concession to pyongyang the u s committed to "resolve the issues concerning banco delta asia" within days of the feb agreement it is unclear what this will mean exactly but now that a deal has been made u s officials who once pressed the case against pyongyangs counterfeiting are talking about the "broader interest " they are lately referring to the north koreans as "only depositors" at banco delta asia as if kim jong il was attracted by its interest rates the illicit activities initiative has now become enmeshed in the state departments bureaucracy losing the coordination energy and access to top officials it previously enjoyed and losing steam some may believe that tolerating north korean counterfeiting is a small price to pay for disarming pyongyang of its nuclear weapons this discounts the potential impact on the worlds economy it also sends the unhelpful signal to the north koreans that as long as they make promises on their nuclear weapons the u s will bend on its laws ending north koreas nuclear weapons program must be our primary objective however the aggressive enforcement of our laws enhances rather than conflicts with the diplomatic effort to do so putting a stop to pyongyangs counterfeit operation and other criminal activities would sever a key subsidy for north koreas weapons of mass destruction program and frustrate kim jong ils payments to his inner circle it would also condition pyongyang into respecting international norms can we really expect a regime that counterfeits our currency to abide by a nuclear weapons agreement only when north korea ends its criminal behavior are prospects for peace and security in northeast asia real lets help pyongyang go straight mr royce is a member of the house foreign affairs and financial services committee
