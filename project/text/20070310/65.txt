the weekend interview with ayaan hirsi ali free radical new york ayaan hirsi ali is untrammeled and unrepentant "i am supposed to apologize for saying the prophet is a pervert and a tyrant " she declares "but that is apologizing for the truth " statements such as these have brought ms hirsi ali to world wide attention though she recently left her adopted country holland where her friend and intellectual collaborator theo van gogh was murdered by a muslim extremist in she is still accompanied by armed guards wherever she travels ms hirsi ali was born in in mogadishu into as she puts it "the islamic civilization as far as you can call it a civilization " in at age her family gave her hand to a distant relative had the marriage ensued she says it would have been "an arranged rape " but as she was shipped to the appointment via europe she fled obtaining asylum in holland there "through observation through experience through reading " she acquainted herself with a different world "the culture that i came to and i live in now is not perfect " ms hirsi ali says "but this culture the west the product of the enlightenment is the best humanity has ever achieved " unease over muslim immigration had been rising in the low countries for some time for instance when the gay right wing politician pim fortuyn "i am in favor of a cold war with islam " he said and believed the borders should be closed to muslims was gunned down in it was widely assumed his killer was an islamist there was a strange sense of relief when he turned out to be a mere animal rights activist ms hirsi ali brought integration issues to further attention exposing domestic abuse and even honor killings in the dutch muslim "dish cities " in she won a seat in the parliament as a member of the center right vvd party for peoples party for freedom and democracy the next year she wrote the script for a short film called "submission " it investigated passages from the quran that ms hirsi ali contends authorize violence against women and did so by projecting those passages onto naked female bodies in retrospect she deeply regrets the outcome "i dont think the film was worth the human life " the life in question was that of van gogh a prominent controversialist and the films director at the end of an islamist named mohammed buyeri shot him as he was bicycling to work in downtown amsterdam then almost decapitated him with a curved sword he left a manifesto impaled to the body "i know for sure that you oh hirsi ali will go down " was its incantation "i know for sure that you oh unbelieving fundamentalist will go down " the shock was palpable holland which has the second largest per capita population of muslims in the eu after france had always prided itself on its pluralism in which all groups would be tolerated but not integrated the killing made clear just how apart its groups were "immediately after the murder " ms hirsi ali says "we learned theos killer had access to education he had learned the language he had taken welfare he made it very clear he knew what democracy meant he knew what liberalism was and he consciously rejected it he said i have an alternative framework its islam its the quran " at his sentencing mohammed buyeri said he would have killed his own brother had he made "submission" or otherwise insulted the one true faith "and why " ms hirsi ali asks "because he said his god ordered him to do it we need to see " she continues "that this isnt something thats caused by special offense the right jews poverty its religion " ms hirsi ali was forced into living underground a hard line vvd minister named rita verdonk cracking down on immigration canceled her citizenship for misstatements made on her asylum application which ms hirsi ali had admitted years before and justified as a means to win quicker admission at a time of great personal vulnerability the resulting controversy led to the collapse of hollands coalition government ms hirsi ali has since decamped for america in effect a political refugee from western europe to take up a position with the american enterprise institute but the crisis she says is "still simmering underneath and it might erupt somewhere anywhere " that partly explains why ms hirsi alis new autobiography "infidel " is already a best seller it may also have something to do with the way she scrambles our expectations in person she is modest graceful enthralling intellectually she is fierce even predatory "we know exactly what it is about but we dont have the guts to say it out loud " she says "we are too weak to take up our role the west is falling apart the open society is coming undone " many liberals loathe her for disrupting an imagined "diversity" consensus it is absurd she argues to pretend that cultures are all equal or all equally desirable but conservatives and others might be reasonably unnerved by her dim view of religion she does not believe that islam has been "hijacked" by fanatics but that fanaticism is intrinsic in islam itself "islam even islam in its nonviolent form is dangerous " the muslim faith has many variations but ms hirsi ali contends that the unities are of greater significance "islam has a very consistent doctrine " she says "and i define islam as i was taught to define it submission to the will of allah his will is written in the quran and in the hadith and sunna what we are all taught is that when you want to make a distinction between right and wrong you follow the prophet muhammad is the model guide for every muslim through time throughout history " this supposition justifies in her view a withering critique of islams most holy human messenger "you start by scrutinizing the morality of the prophet " and then ask "are you prepared to follow the morality of the prophet in a society such as this one " she draws a connection between mohammeds taking of child brides in the first century a d and modern sexual oppressions what she calls "this imprisonment of women " she decries the murder of adulteresses and rape victims the wearing of the veil arranged marriages domestic violence genital mutilation and other contraventions of "the most basic freedoms " these sufferings she maintains are traceable to theological imperatives "people say it is a bad strategy " ms hirsi ali says forcefully "i think it is the best strategy muslims must choose to follow their rational capacities as humans and to follow reason instead of quranic commands at that point islam will be reformed " this worldview has led certain critics to dismiss ms hirsi ali as a secular extremist "i have my ideas and my views " she says "and i want to argue them it is our obligation to look at things critically " as to the charges that she is an "enlightenment fundamentalist " she points out rightly that people who live in democratic societies are not supposed to settle their disagreements by killing one another and yet contemporary democracies she says accommodate the incitement of such behavior "the multiculturalism theology like all theologies is cruel is wrongheaded and is unarguable because it is an utter dogmatism minorities are exempted from the obligations of the rest of society so they dont improve with this theory you limit them you freeze their culture you keep them in place " the most grievous failing of the west is self congratulatory passivity we face "an external enemy that to a degree has become an internal enemy that has infiltrated the system and wants to destroy it " she believes a more drastic reaction is required "its easy " she says "to weigh liberties against the damage that can be done to society and decide to deny liberties as it should be a free society should be prepared to recognize the patterns in front of it and do something about them " she says the west must begin to think long term about its relationship with islam because the islamists are ms hirsi ali notes muslim birth rates are vastly outstripping those elsewhere particularly in western europe and believes this is a conscious attempt to extend the faith muslims she says treat women as "these baby machines these son factories we need to compete with this " she goes on "it is a totalitarian method the nazis tried it using women as incubators literally to give birth to soldiers islam is now doing it it is a very effective and very frightening way of dealing with human beings " all of this is profoundly politically incorrect but for this remarkable woman ideas are not abstractions she forces us back to first principles and she punctures complacencies these ought to be seen as virtues even by those who find some of ms hirsi alis ideas disturbing or objectionable society after all sometimes needs to be roused from its slumbers by agitators who go too far so that others will go far enough mr rago is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal see related letter "letters to the editor cold
