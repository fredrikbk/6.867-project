pursuits books writers block a german reckoning one day a year by christa wolf europa pages &# memory is a treacherous thing at the mercy of time and circumstance not to mention fear and desire it can distort the past more than preserve it but the past has a way of coming to light unexpectedly and not always in a flattering way in the past few years two german writers have had their moral authority shaken by long forgotten or long suppressed episodes in their lives last summer just before his autobiography was to be published in germany gunter grass suddenly remembered that he had served in the waffen ss as a year old in this fact had not prevented him for many years from hectoring others about their obligations to face up to the past in the end it was mr grasss six decades of silence that commentators most harshly condemned not his military service christa wolf too has undergone a late reckoning throughout the s and s she was the first lady of east german letters in part because she managed to balance oblique criticism of the "real existing socialism" of east germany with direct criticism of patriarchy and the west pacifying both censors and her readers in "cassandra" her most admired novel she offered a feminist reworking of the fall of troy from the point of view of the prophetess the reader was allowed to interpret the foolish vindictive and self destructive trojans as an emblem either of east germany or of the west in after her country had disintegrated ms wolf finally published a direct critique of the east german regime in a collection called "what remains " the title story described a prominent writer under menacing surveillance by the stasi east germanys secret police ms wolf had written it in but had kept it in a drawer the medias response was ferocious they roundly condemned her for waiting to publish "what remains" until it was safe to do so and for opportunistically presenting herself as a victim in ms wolf was back in the pillory when a journalist reported that he had found three files in the stasi archives detailing her activities as an unofficial collaborator with the secret police from to ms wolf explained when the stasi files were revealed that she could no longer recognize the naive dogmatic believer that she was during the years of her unofficial collaboration she was in her early s at the time one would think that "one day a year to " a core sample of her changing selves over four decades would show evidence of this personal evolution and help her readers understand the hold that idealism has had over her better judgment instead the book presents an otherwise insightful mind resorting to trivia and generalities as a way of avoiding unpleasant truths for years ms wolf set out to describe a single day sept as "accurately as possible " the idea originated with an assignment in when the moscow publication izvestiya asked writers from around the world to write about sept ms wolf dutifully recounted her own experience on that date and then decided to do so the next year and the next she wanted to preserve she says the fleeting moments of her life and to use the annual stock taking as an "exercise against blindness to reality " "one day a year" offers too little insight to meet such a lofty purpose in the entry a month after the wall was built ms wolf laments the dividing of germany but notes her relief "when the borders were closed " that factories would no longer be "stripped of engineers and technicians " who were being lured away by the promise of freedom and wealth in the west the engineers and technicians preferences apparently were beside the point amid the minutiae of shopping housework and visits from friends she occasionally refers to the political difficulties of others in ms wolf notes that she appealed to erich honecker east germanys leader for leniency toward a man who had been imprisoned merely for requesting an exit visa but ms wolf never condemned her governments actions publicly that might have brought exile and no matter how bad things were in the east the west was never an acceptable alternative could she even write in the west she wonders "where everyone has to appear in the proper light in order to be noticed at all " this at a time when her countrymen were going to great lengths to avoid notice from the secret police in the entry ms wolf muses on the paths of the two germanies she ignores the bankruptcy and pollution of east germany and rhapsodizes about its state ownership "no private property with respect to the means of production no private firms with their devastating consequences we had always focused our eyes on that when despair with respect to this state was about to overpower us in recent decades " ms wolf then wonders whether her marriage to writer gerhard wolf they met and married as students in the early s could have survived the challenges of living in the west "would it have endured as it has done here where the external pressure causes the wish for one certainty for one durable element to become so strong the wish for a person upon whom you can depend unconditionally " she simply had to be aware at the time of the number of east germans who were informed on by their spouses who had no one upon whom they could depend conditionally or otherwise there were six million stasi files known as the gauck documents in a population of million at least of those files covered even the wolfs private lives in one of the books most revealing passages ms wolf recounts a conversation with gunter grass in when mr grass lamented that there would soon be nothing left of east germany ms wolf quipped "yes there will the gauck documents they promote forgetting while apparently fortifying memory " her idealistic tunnel vision skews the past as well the british journalist timothy garton ash who lived in germany in the s called his own stasi files "poisoned madeleines " still they probably provide a clearer view of the past than christa wolfs years of wishful thinking ms lewis is a translator and an advisory editor of the hudson review
