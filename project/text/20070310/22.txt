hes back newt gingrich left congress in disgrace but now he ponders a presidential run rallying the right washington the queue for newt gingrichs autograph started forming at p m at the conservative political action conference here earlier this month by the time the former speaker of the house of representatives took out his pen two and a half hours later the line snaked across a hallway around a corner and down two flights of stairs halfway back in the line deborah reppenhagen a retired defense department controller held four of mr gingrichs books that she was determined to get signed and explained her enthusiasm "i want him to be my president " she said president gingrich nine years after a spectacular fall from political power mr gingrichs name still triggers winks and eye rolls among many people who remember his budget showdown with democrats that closed the federal government his moralizing and his snit on air force one when he complained that president clinton didnt talk to him on their way home from the funeral of israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin even so without forming an exploratory committee cajoling an endorsement or raising a campaign nickel mr gingrich ranks third in national polls for the republican nomination and second in a few state surveys former new york mayor rudy giuliani led in the wall street journal nbc news poll taken last week of likely republican primary voters with followed by for arizona sen john mccain for mr gingrich and for former massachusetts gov mitt romney mr gingrich years old says in an interview that he has no campaign staff isnt raising any campaign money and is "consciously not showing up at any presidential cattle calls" like debates forums or photo ops he may not even want the job he adds "the oval office isnt big enough" to do everything that needs doing he told the cpac audience which responded with whoops of encouragement but hes keeping his options open he keeps up a heavy speaking schedule nine speeches last week alone including california and alabama and occasionally pops into iowa south carolina and new hampshire "we thought it would be too cute" to go too often he adds hes churning out books eight since and in september he plans what he calls a "national workshop" to mark the th anniversary of his contract with america the legislative agenda that catapulted republicans into power on capitol hill and for that hes drafted a st century contract for america that proposes tax reform math education and "recognizing the creator in public life " gingrich volunteers wear t shirts proclaiming "countdown to september " the possible trigger date for his campaign if the other candidates have picked up his ideas and have launched what he calls a civil dialogue by then "there will be no reason for me to have to run " he says and if not "then well seriously take a look " "all the candidates will resemble bad reruns of survivor by august " mr gingrich predicts "and its not like my name recognition is going to go down over the next seven months " he adds whether he runs or not the very notion of a gingrich candidacy says as much about the glum mood among republicans and the seeming weakness of the current crop of candidates as it does about mr gingrich within the partys powerful conservative base mr giuliani is tainted by two messy divorces and his generally moderate stands on social policies mr mccain is openly reviled for his support of campaign finance reform his previous criticisms of the religious right and his support for easing the path to citizenship for illegal immigrants conservatives view mr romneys mormon faith and shifting social positions with suspicion since the collapse of the campaigns of former senators bill frist of tennessee and george allen of virginia theres also no prominent southerner in a race that southern voters largely shaped for the past generation while former arkansas gov mike huckabee is courting conservatives mr gingrich a one time congressman from georgia could better fill the void mr gingrichs nomination would depend on the campaign of one or two of the current leaders stumbling or "rolling off the highway " says grover norquist president of americans for tax reform who is uncommitted in the campaign but has worked with the former speaker in the past mr gingrich "is next in the door if it opens " he says a huge share of mr gingrichs appeal to the republican base is his pivotal role in the congressional elections when he returned the party to power after four decades in the minority mentions of that sweep and of the contract with america that fueled it draw huge applause from his audiences "they want to return to they remember when politics was about ideas " says frank luntz a republican strategist currently unaligned but who helped mr gingrich craft the message of the campaign but mr gingrich would also enter a presidential race sure to be dogged by the controversies that brought him low in after republican losses in the mid term elections ethics investigations into his use of tax exempt funds two divorces and the revelation that mr gingrich conducted an affair with a young staffer now his wife while seeking president bill clintons impeachment for among other things his affair with a young staffer "its the marriages and the girlfriend problem " says phyllis schlafly founder of eagle forum a traditional values group mr gingrich admitted his marital indiscretions this week in an interview with james dobson founder of focus on the family a conservative christian group saying he had "fallen short of my own standards theres certainly times when ive fallen short of gods standards " mr gingrich eventually was cleared of the ethics charges although he agreed to pay &# from his personal funds to cover the cost of the investigation paul weyrich founder of the free congress foundation a conservative think tank says he hasnt decided whether to endorse mr gingrich but he believes his members will accept mr gingrichs contrition "he says he has gone down on his knees to ask gods forgiveness for his weakness our people are very oriented toward accepting that " says mr weyrich still polls regularly show mr gingrich with high negatives even among fellow republicans in the latest wall street journal nbc poll of potential republican voters said they "would definitely not" vote for mr gingrich for president only sen mccains negative vote was higher against this mr gingrich brings vast name recognition a torrent of ideas and what republican pollster tony fabrizio whos uncommitted in the race calls "an insurgent personality" that impassions his supporters at the cpac conference which acts as an early casting call for republican aspirants attendees gave a polite reception to mr giuliani mr romneys detractors passed out flip flop sandals a comment on his changing positions mr mccain skipped the meeting mr gingrich his silver hair easy to spot on the conference jumbotrons waded to the stage through a cheering chanting audience many of whose members were in grade school when he last held office supporters passed out wonkish policy statements rather than buttons and placards and mr gingrich devoted much of his speech to calls for "an idea oriented campaign" and health care reform but the biggest cheers and much of his popular appeal were for his red blooded appeals to patriotism religious faith and a muscular foreign policy "why is it we dont have a law " making english the language of government or enshrining "one nation under god" in the pledge of allegiance he asked to roars of approval how dare the north koreans test an atomic weapon and how could new orleans remain a moldering mess he demands "hes got wisdom and i think he listens to god " susan mason a telecommunications program planner said afterwards mr gingrich says hell spend the next seven months talking about those ideas he has hundreds of them on everything from the judiciary to an electromagnetic pulse attack by terrorists and offering his policy advice to the candidates vin weber a former congressman and a policy adviser to mr romney says the romney campaign is "in active and direct discussions" about policy with mr gingrich mr gingrich says he has been in touch with other republican campaigns and will make the same offer to democratic candidates too mr gingrich rates mr romney "a competent businessman" who is off to a reasonable start he says mr mccains campaign will right itself soon though based on polls he predicts mr giuliani will be the candidate both the giuliani and mccain camps claim they relish the idea of mr gingrich in the race they say hed split the conservative vote and weaken mr romney whom both men see as more electable than mr gingrich in a general election hed also "soak up the hard right vote " freeing mr mccain and mr giuliani to stake out the partys more populous moderate center gloats a mccain strategist mr gingrich spreads his ideas and keeps his profile high through a vast media network thats energized by speculation about a presidential run theres a daily radio address on stations a weekly online newsletter with subscribers newspaper op eds speaking tours and even a bi monthly magazine column for clergymen mr gingrich says hell make speeches this year hell reportedly make &# to &# each for of them hes in the eighth year of a fox network contract for commentaries and hour long specials mr gingrichs for profit health care think tank churns out more ideas that are shared with corporate customers how to reduce the incidence of diabetes how to develop therapies for alzheimers disease how to plan for avian flu a staffer says mr gingrich spends about of his time at the think tank whose members including auto insurance and pharmaceutical companies pay as much as &# each to attend meetings and seminars and the groups web site says for "access" to mr gingrich on the political side a "movement resolutions" service helps local level republican clubs and legislators write conservative legislation a "newttube" contest invites fans to create videos on the economic perils of tax increases and his steady stream of books includes novels policy tomes and "rediscovering god in america " a walking tour of religious imagery in washington public monuments mr gingrich regularly tells audiences that the government shutdown led to a balanced budget and that his take no prisoners leadership style resulted in welfare reform he admits the irony of his appeals for bipartisanship "i know i know " he says but the man who practically invented modern partisan warfare now says todays problems are too deep for either party to go it alone as long as mr gingrich remains an undeclared candidate he can keep talking about those ideas earning money from the public appearances they generate and promoting his image as the love me for my brains candidate political strategists say that would change when mr gingrich announced his candidacy they add the public glare would shift to his personal life which many conservatives still view suspiciously given his name recognition crowds greet him with chants of "newt newt newt" mr gingrich could "get by on fumes " says a former staffer thats important because the compressed primary calendar will force candidates to buy television time in lots of states simultaneously rather than depend on the results of one primary carrying their names into the next mr fabrizio the republican pollster calculates the cost of television ads alone in the states that will hold their primaries on feb at &# million per candidate "newt could run a race with much less " he predicts most republican strategists agree that mr gingrich could finish in the top three in iowa and south carolina which lead off the political season in a series of state polls this year the american research group a non partisan polling group found mr gingrich in second place behind mr giuliani in california and alabama and in third place behind mr mccain as well in some other early primary states strategists disagree about what happens next though mccain and giuliani advisers predict mr gingrich would lose steam as the campaign moved on particularly as republican voters come to conclude he is unelectable in a general election where voters typically search for the political middle "he doesnt have the crossover or moderate appeal " says one but mr fabrizio believes mr gingrich could target states that award their convention delegates proportionally and focus on voters only in conservative districts "the nomination comes down to a few early states and a kind of buzz "says republican pollster kellyanne conway whos uncommitted in the race few politicians do buzz as skillfully as mr gingrich at a recent joint appearance featuring mr gingrich with former new york democratic governor mario cuomo a line of ticket hopefuls curled around the block the setting was new yorks cooper union the engineering school where lincoln in laid out his measured argument against the spread of slavery into the western territories lincoln running third in his party then went home to illinois to give republicans time to think about his ideas eleven weeks later they nominated him midway through a discussion of social and foreign policy mr cuomo stopped and turned to the former speaker "i think you would make a great candidate for president on the republican ticket " he said mr gingrich gave a polite smile let it grow gradually wider as the applause grew then finally turned to the audience to show off a happy grin newt gingrich  born in harrisburg pa son of career army officer  married his former highschool
