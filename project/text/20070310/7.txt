biofuels pact likely to hit hurdles president bush and his brazilian counterpart unveiled a new biofuels partnership between their two countries with much fanfare but the reality appeared to fall short of the rhetoric at a huge ethanol storage facility on the outskirts of sao paulo friday brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva described the agreement as "a new moment for the global car industry a new moment for fuel and possibly a new moment for humanity " mr bush concurred "we see the bright and real potential for our citizens being able to use alternative sources of energy that will promote the common good " messrs da silva and bush expressed hope that increased production of biofuels such as ethanol by latin america will lift incomes for millions of the regions poor while reducing demand across the americas for gasoline which produces more greenhouse gases believed to contribute to global warming the pact complements a bush administration initiative to develop a broad based u s ethanol industry and reduce the countrys dependence on overseas oil mr bush also aims for the partnership to provide a political counterweight to venezuelan president hugo chavez who has used his countrys oil wealth to promote his militant brand of leftist populism throughout latin america the agreements moderate terms appear to undercut these ambitions according to a u s government summary the agreement technically a memorandum of understanding aims to increase cooperation on industry technology promote development of biofuels production in impoverished central america and the caribbean and work toward better international standards on fuel ingredients but the summary gave no details about specific commitments for example on funding the research nor did it mention joint construction of pilot biofuels plants an idea that had been floated by brazilian officials but that had stirred opposition among some powerful members of congress who worry about overseas competition for the fledgling u s biofuels industry u s administration officials didnt respond to requests for more details sen charles grassley r iowa among the u s lawmakers who had raised concerns said in a statement friday that he is "glad the accord doesnt explicitly call for the joint construction of a pilot ethanol plant " he added he would monitor developments since the agreement was broadly written major practical hurdles also loom in developing big biofuels markets in latin america and the u s both brazil and the u s have set ambitious goals for increasing the use of biofuels which include ethanol and biodiesel the bush administration for example proposes a sevenfold increase in such use over the next decade to billion gallons but even if that effort were successful it would account for only about of current u s motor fuel consumption in addition because the u s currently produces almost all its ethanol from corn it would have to develop ways to make ethanol economically from other sources such as wood chips corn stalks and grasses to fulfill mr bushs biofuels usage goal through domestic production if those efforts fall short a lot of u s biofuels would have to come from overseas sources such as the sugar cane brazil uses to make ethanol u s producers are nervous about that potential competition environmentalists also worry that a surge in ethanol production could lead latin american farmers to seek more farmland to grow sugar cane and other crops destroying rainforests moreover a variety of trade barriers now prevent u s needs for biofuels from being supplied from abroad the biggest barrier is a u s tariff that exists on brazilian ethanol with imports from central america and the caribbean restricted to a lesser degree a u s government fact sheet specified that fridays initiative "does not include discussion of united states trade tariffs or quotas " the u s trade barriers are zealously defended by american farmers in the midwest and their allies in congress which recently extended the brazil restriction until the head of the u s renewable fuels association bob dinneen offered qualified praise for the agreement "working with our brazilian counterparts makes good sense and good policy " he said energy consultant rafael schechtman a director at the brazilian center for infrastructure in rio de janeiro said the visit had "more of a political aspect than a commercial or technological one " mr da silva later chastised mr bush at a news conference over u s protectionism he warned that eliminating trade barriers "is the only way the fuel of the future will be able" to reach its potential for his part mr chavez the venezuelan leader isnt surrendering any of his petroleum fueled influence without a fight he traveled to argentina to stir opposition during mr bushs next stop in neighboring uruguay which was set to begin friday evening mr chavez spent much of friday at argentinas presidential residence on the outskirts of the capital lunching and signing a raft of agricultural and energy accords he criticized the u s biofuels effort saying the u s "is trying to plant the good lands that remain in the south and use our fresh water reserves not to grow food for people and animals but to feed its vehicles to sustain the famous american way of life "
