green thumb bulletproofing your mortgage with delinquencies rising and lenders feeling the pain heres how to spot looming risks in your home loan its tempting to write off all the mortgage bad news rising delinquencies lenders in crisis as someone elses problem after all the misery seems to be concentrated in loans to the riskiest borrowers if you have any kind of mortgage where the payment terms change over time however you should be asking yourself how likely is it that youll get hit with a big jump in your monthly payment that would mess up your personal finances it isnt as far fetched as it sounds the exotic loans and more liberal borrowing rules that led to the recent industry troubles arent limited to people with poor credit or lower incomes for instance adjustable rate loans offering cheap payments for the first few years are the only thing that enabled some families to stretch and buy the new home they loved but didnt think they could afford other borrowers yanked equity from one home to buy a second one or else to invest the money in stocks or a small business if they used interest only mortgages which can require no payments toward principal for years the payments can spike later in the "jumbo loan" category which currently refers to most mortgages for &# or more though its been lower in years past of purchases and of refinancings were done at adjustable rates in according to first american loanperformance a mortgage data company so now is about when the pain from higher payments is kicking in for many of those borrowers the mortgage business has been shaken in the past few weeks in recent days for instance new century financial corp one of the nations largest subprime lenders stopped making new loans altogether oddly most people pay less attention to their home loan likely the biggest debt theyll ever take on than they do to their investment portfolio where the balance is often a lot smaller now is a good time to change that habit especially if youre in a mortgage of any sort with a payment that can be or has changed "we havent been through a downturn with some of these untested mortgages " says financial planner elaine scoggins of seattles merriman capital management who has seen a number of affluent individuals end up in foreclosure over the years the easiest out switch into a year fixed rate the national average is currently according to consumer loan data provider hsh associates thats low by historical standards and better than most rates available in the past months here is a set of questions to test whether your mortgage is truly bulletproof if it isnt there are ways to get a new one while avoiding key mistakes first a set of old fashioned financial planning queries are you spending more than of your pretax income on mortgage principal and interest payments plus property taxes and homeowners insurance or do these four items plus all your other debts add up to more than of your gross income mortgage bankers used to deploy these benchmarks religiously in their zest to issue new loans however some have decided its just fine if the figures are up into the s or s you dont want to go up there for long after taxes and a k deposit eat up or percentage points of your income youll need money left over for milk and meat and the fridge going on the fritz and if your mortgage payment is about to spike higher youll be that much more vulnerable to unexpected calamities then theres the spouse test ask yourself what your significant other would think of the terms of the mortgage if he or she only knew about it when jeffrey seymour of triangle wealth management in cary n c sits down with new clients he often finds that the husband handles the finances and hasnt told his wife that the monthly mortgage payment on say the beach house could rise by four figures over the next several years the revelation isnt always a happy one but it can lead to productive conversations "frequently theyll have different views on risk and they might not even know it " mr seymour says finally imagine a confluence of nasty events hitting you all at once take say a young family in a fixed rate interest only mortgage where they pay nothing toward principal for years until the monthly payment resets to higher levels the husband has a solid job the wife is finishing training for a high paying career say a doctor and considering all of that theyre comfortable with the higher bills ahead several years later the couple gets divorced or she has quit the practice of medicine or one child is ill or perhaps a combination of such events suddenly they cant afford the new payment they need another dwelling and the value of the house has dropped then what "do you have sufficient reserves to ride it out " asks christopher van slyke of capital financial advisors in la jolla calif "and if you tightened your belt without reserves could you make it " all of this may seem overly risk averse but mr van slyke is merely prudent not timid in his own case he says back in when he bought his first house he financed of the &# price tag but one factor that gave him the confidence to do that was that he knew he would be willing to take in roommates if things really went south everything went fine and he now lives in a different bigger house if your own circumstances give you pause when faced with the questions above its worth at least shopping for a fixed rate mortgage that could give you some stability there are excellent calculators at mtgprofessor com to help compare your current situation with other options before you research rates go to myfico com to buy your credit score which is the figure that most mortgage lenders consult when considering your creditworthiness a fico score of between and or so is the rough dividing line between prime good credit and subprime more risky borrowers anything above or so out of probably wont give you a much better rate if youre on the lower end improving your score is especially important because many lenders who service that market are tightening their standards or getting out of the business altogether to get your grade up pay every bill on time and try to lower any outstanding credit card debt dont open a bunch of new credit card accounts but dont close any either because the length of your credit history factors into the score once your credit is in shape it could take as many as days to see results go shopping when you find a loan you like dont sign anything until you understand everything incredibly there are still plenty of smart people getting mixed up in mortgage loans with terms and reset rates that they dont understand your neighbor or friend may have the confidence financial reserves and mental fortitude to bet on interest rates with adjustable rate loans they tell you that fixed rate loans are for suckers but theres no shame in sacrificing square footage or incremental stock market gains in order to avoid mortgage risk rather than gambling on the biggest loan youll ever take on why not bet on something more fun the ncaa basketball tournament begins this coming week send interest rate and tournament
