hot topic wounded warriors at walter reed the washington post military commanders were in the hot seat this past week as congress investigated problems with soldiers outpatient care at walter reed army medical center the facilitys commander and the secretary of the army lost their jobs after a series of articles in the washington post last month highlighted unsanitary conditions in an outpatient facility at walter reed one of the nations premier military hospitals some soldiers had been placed in rooms soiled by mice cockroaches and mold and were left to negotiate a confusing bureaucracy in order to receive proper treatment elected officials and veterans have warned that the problems at walter reed represent the "tip of the iceberg " after more than five years of sustained combat soldiers are returning to a bureaucracy unable to handle the coming crush this past week president bush created an independent panel to see how well the government is helping veterans return to civilian life heres a closer look at the crisis why didnt soldiers receive better care at walter reed of the nearly soldiers wounded in iraq and afghanistan around have been to walter reed officials admitted that the centers outpatient system became overwhelmed by an unexpectedly high number of soldiers returning from war reaching a peak of outpatients from a prewar level of about those numbers grew because military medicine has dramatically improved the odds for soldiers to survive a serious injury and because better body armor prevents fatal wounds in world war ii two soldiers were wounded for every soldier killed and in vietnam the ratio was nearly but in iraq nearly soldiers are wounded or get sick for every soldier killed other factors may have exacerbated the problem at walter reed the hospital was one of the military installations slated for closure during a review and it will close in operations also have been outsourced to private contractors a memo from a top commander last year warned that the outsourcing and threat of closure had led skilled staff members to leave the hospital in three months and that "patient care services are at risk of mission failure " how has care suffered as a result soldiers evacuated from the combat zone to walter reed still receive state of the art medical care from prosthetic limbs to treatment for shrapnel injuries and burns few if any

to wait months and in some cases years to receive continuing care or disability checks provided by veterans affairs how widespread are the problems as the hearings this past week illustrated the

worse as more soldiers return from war as many as returning soldiers could flood the disability benefit system in the coming years according to a study by harvard public finance professor linda bilmes

spouses told of being rejected for mris to test for brain injuries and of being rejected for disability claims for mental illness which can be harder to prove than more obvious physical wounds nick
