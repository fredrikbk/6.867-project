eurolinks daily view gas exporters moves to increase collaboration raise concerns online edition while the long term goals the gas exporting countries forum more influence over gas markets and greater political clout over clients in europe asia and the u s face some major hurdles they could yet prove to be achievable with major members like iran openly talking of someday creating an opec like cartel for gas exporters the forum an assembly of of the worlds largest gas producers meets monday and tuesday in the qatar capital of doha to lay the foundation for greater collaboration and consider establishing a central institution that could act like opecs secretariat as bhushan bahree russell gold and gregory l white report the moves coming as gas grows more critical to global energy needs are ringing alarm bells in western capitals currently the world gas business amounts to a patchwork of regional markets because gas is mainly distributed through pipelines confined to individual big markets such as the u s lng a super chilled form of gas that is loaded on tankers has the potential to change the market because it can be shipped around the world making it a truly global commodity like oil but that tradability also makes lng more susceptible to price swings prompting the producers to start thinking about a cartel opecs genesis was in it was created by venezuela saudi arabia iraq iran and kuwait after standard oil of new jersey the predecessor to exxon unilaterally cut the price it paid for oil it wasnt until the s however that the cartel wrested pricing power from the western majors and began setting official selling prices the forum wants to put in place the kind of research that opec uses in monitoring markets such as supply and demand modeling that could be the foundation for a true cartel should the forum opt to form one in the future read bhushan bahree russell gold and gregory l whites report http online wsj com article ""sb html rome moscow inc no sooner has russias state owned oao aeroflot russian airlines announced its interest in alitalia spa than italian oil giant eni spa and utility enel spa have won the bidding for some of the prized former

energy giant which made a deal with the italian companies shortly before the auction began to buy either all of or majority stakes in the assets they were about to acquire european regulators have raised concerns about gazproms expansion particularly as fears grow that the kremlin could use its vast energy resources to exert political pressure so far those worries have been outweighed by the economic logic of deals in individual countries under a broad pact with eni reached in november the russian gas giant this month plans to begin selling gas directly to italian industrial consumers and is likely to purchase a stake in enis electric generation unit yukos once russias largest oil firm was driven into bankruptcy by huge back tax claims last year in a case widely viewed as a politically motivated attack by the kremlin on yukoss founder and former ceo mikhail khodorkovsky who now is serving an eight year term for fraud and tax evasion in a siberian prison the participation in the deal of eni and enel two large western energy companies helps moscow legitimize an auction process that was widely criticized as being part of the governments aggressive policy of reasserting control over
