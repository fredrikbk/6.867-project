horsepower nation new car models boast speed size power while washington buzzes about biofuel at new york auto show big is beautiful the supreme court may have set the stage this week for aggressive new regulation of auto emissions and congress may want the government to take global warming more seriously but for car makers america is still horsepower nation at the new york international auto show which opens to the public friday and runs through april major auto makers are spotlighting a flock of new production and concept models that appeal to the u s car industrys traditional marketing values speed size and power "its fine for politicians to rumble about these things but the world isnt going to turn around and drive small cars tomorrow " says johan de nysschen head of audis u s marketing arm car makers did offer a few nods to the small is beautiful aesthetic such as a trio of tiny chevrolet prototypes general motors corp displayed wednesday but gm was equally eager to promote a pair of buick "super" models with v engines rated at close to horsepower gm also touted a new version of its hummer h sport utility vehicle with a horsepower v engine a standard h has a five cylinder engine rated at horsepower and miles per gallon city highway the hefty horsepower flaunted by some models unveiled at the auto show cant be put to full use on regular u s roads with posted speed limits but car makers juice up their products anyway in an effort to lure auto enthusiasts who crave power and speed ford motor co opened its auto show presentation yesterday by showing a new ultra powerful version of its mustang muscle car dubbed the shelby gtkr the new mustang boasts a liter supercharged v engine with an upgrade racing pack that boosts output close to horsepower the car available in limited numbers next spring is "the most powerful mustang ever " said mark fields fords executive vice president the cars namesake race car driver turned designer carroll shelby said mustang went from "a race car that you could take out on the street to a street car that you can take out to the race track " ford also promoted the ford f foose a custom pickup designed by street rod designer chip foose the truck uses a horsepower supercharged v engine that puts out pound feet of torque ford says the foose will be the most powerful half ton pickup when it hits the market next year a little while later amid showers of sparks and fire daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz went out of its way to re emphasize its commitment to uber performance mercedess cl amg features a liter

mercedes executives say is a "street legal version" of a race car the car has a horsepower version of the amg liter v engine which goes from to in seconds and a shell of a back seat the better to cut weight so the car can more quickly achieve its top speed of miles per hour not to be outdone volkswagen ags audi luxury brand featured a sleek new sports coupe the s with a horsepower v that can boost the car to miles per hour in seconds its not clear whether consumers worried about gas prices will embrace high horsepower across the board last year consumers shifted to passenger cars and away from pickup trucks and suvs amid skyrocketing fuel prices a declining housing market exacerbated matters as slowing home construction damped demand for pickups products that u s auto makers rely on more heavily than their european and japanese counterparts for high margins u s light truck sales were off last year according to autodata corp while passenger car sales increased modestly still there were some signs suggesting that auto makers could be safe touting high priced powerful vehicles to enthusiasts with cash to burn ford mustang sales increased slightly last year for example various mercedes models posted mix results but overall its sales rose hummer sales remained strong for up mike jackson chief executive of autonation inc the nations largest publicly traded dealership chain says fuel efficiency has consistently ranked behind cup holders and sound systems in consumer desires over the past years "you have to look past what the consumer says theyre going to do and the moment where they write a check " says mr jackson "thats the moment of truth they want size and speed " but some customers are clearly asking for better fuel economy as well toyota motor corp s yaris which gets miles per gallon in city and mph highway for its automatic version sold about more cars in march than february honda civic hybrid sales increased nearly last year mike stanton head of the association of international automobile manufacturers which represents car makers such as toyota honda motor co and nissan motor co says auto makers find themselves in a conundrum when it comes to fuel economy he says that the oil shock in the s didnt lead consumers toward more fuel efficient vehicles en masse as many expected "we dont know what its going to take to get joe six pack out of his suv and into a yaris " says mr stanton "how do we provide and meet consumer expectations at the same time " car makers are getting better at using technology to squeeze out more power without decreasing fuel efficiency but environmentalists and government regulators criticize the industry for using technology such as more sophisticated fuel control systems to boost power instead of mileage of course auto makers are also working on vehicles that get better fuel economy and have been talking up those efforts in washington d c toyota has led the way in marketing gasoline electric hybrids with the prius sedan and hybrid versions of its highlander wagon and camry midsize sedan still the japanese car maker has started offering incentives to help sell the prius for the first time this year and at the new york auto show one of toyotas featured models is a big v powered lexus suv gm ford and chrysler visited the white house last week and showed president bush three so called flex fuel vehicles which are capable of running on biofuels or conventional fuels like gasoline or diesel gms e capable chevrolet impala which can run on a blend of ethanol and gasoline fords edge hyseries an electric plug in vehicle with a fuel cell generator that isnt yet in production and chryslers biodiesel capable jeep grand cherokee biodiesel is a diesel blended with renewable fuels like soybeans the blend has lower emissions than regular diesel detroits big three auto makers have pledged to make half of their fleets e or biodiesel capable by but auto makers who stress making such vehicles successful requires upped alternative energy production more alternative fuel capable filling stations and government investment in better technology for electric plug ins arent exactly clamoring for the government to mandate higher fuel efficiency standards although the overall luxury market is "stagnant " audis mr de nysschen says demand for large luxury suvs among the least efficient models sold in the u s is growing mr de nysschen says his company will respond to pressure for better fuel efficiency by bringing to the u s in late versions of its q large luxury crossover wagon with diesel and hybrid gasoline electric power plants ford president and chief executive officer alan mulally says the supreme court ruling earlier this week that federal environmental regulators have a duty to consider limits on the carbon dioxide chugging out of vehicle tailpipes made him even more committed to improve fuel efficiency develop alternative fuels technology and advanced engines "the citizens of the u s are really going to decide what we want to do about energy and what do we want to do about the environment " mr mulally said in a dialogue with reporters on the sidelines of the show "the cars you see today are what customers want the customers are going to decide not ford " general motors vice chairman for product development robert lutz says shaving horsepower isnt the solution to cutting co emissions instead he says the government should help auto makers invest in "transformational" technology such as plug in hybrids he challenges industry critics to "come to my office show us your technology if the technology were readily and easily available what on earth would be our motive for withholding it "
