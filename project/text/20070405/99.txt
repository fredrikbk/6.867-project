the coming tax increase what with the big stories of iraq and the presidential horse race and the non story of the u s attorneys the beltway press corps seems all tapped out that does leave the small matter of economic policy however and the big but uncovered news that congress has just lit a fuse for the biggest tax increase in history the new house and senate majorities have now passed budget resolutions five year budget outlines that include the repeal of the bush tax cuts of and republicans are overstating things when they imply this means a tax increase this year the bush tax cuts dont expire until the end of and democrats arent about to tip their tax hand before the election but under the cover of zero media attention democrats are constructing a budget process that will make a tax increase all but inevitable the ploy here is "pay as you go" budget rules that democrats are implementing in the name of "restoring fiscal responsibility " a few journalists even quote that phrase with a straight face but everyone in washington knows that "paygo" is all about making tax cuts more difficult and not about slowing the growth of spending under "paygo " extending the bush tax cuts is itself a tax cut that must be offset either with cuts in entitlement spending or with other tax increases and paygo merely constrains the growth of "new" entitlements entitlement rules already in place dont count under paygo rules so medicare medicaid and the new "childrens" health care program schip will keep growing on autopilot so called discretionary spending defense education highways etc isnt affected at all this is a big enough political con but an even bigger ruse is the democratic media chorus that the bush tax cuts must be repealed because theyve left the treasury high and dry the nearby chart tells the modern story of federal tax revenues as a share of the economy and what it shows is that tax receipts did plunge earlier this decade from their late s heights reaching a trough in fiscal of of gdp the economy was still recovering from the collapse of business investment and the stock market bubble and no doubt the lower bush rates played a role in reducing revenue for a time but the lower rates also provided a spur to incentives that led to a rebound in investment stock prices and ultimately in economic growth individual incomes and corporate profits this produced in turn a very sharp rebound in federal tax receipts to of gdp in fiscal and in the congressional budget office now run by democrats predicts it will reach in fiscal this is slightly above the year historical average of and cbo says it will climb again in each of the next two years before dipping in despite the bush tax cuts or we should say because of them federal revenues are above where theyve been for most of the last half century the government is far from starved for cash what democrats really dont want you to know is what will happen to receipts after if the tax cuts expire cbo says the feds will grab a huge additional chunk of the economy to spend more than of gdp a year in extra tax revenue by at in that year taxes as a share of the economy would exceed every postwar year except for the of when the stock bubble and bonuses tossed many taxpayers into higher tax brackets now we hardly take cbo projections as gospel theyre usually wrong beyond the first year or so because they ignore the impact of higher or lower tax rates on incentives and growth so cbo is surely mistaken that letting the bush rates expire would have little effect on growth and that tax receipts would continue to mount a tax increase of that magnitude could well lead to a recession and a plunge in receipts our point in citing these cbo projections is to show that the tax increase fuse has now been lit do nothing and taxes will rise as much as they have at any one time since world war ii democrats have made the decision to obscure this burning fuse and the press corps is ignoring it but that doesnt mean the rest of the country has to play along how to handle those looming tax hikes is the most important economic choice the congress and next president are likely to face its a debate we should start having now before the fuse burns down
