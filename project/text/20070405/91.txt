the evening wrap chryslers new customer online edition daimlerchrysler management was tight lipped about a possible sale of chrysler at yesterdays annual meeting but today kirk kerkorian a catalyst of the companys merger got the gossip mill spinning again with an offer to pry the auto giant apart the billionaire investor who was a vocal chrysler shareholder back before the merger with daimler benz wrote that his tracinda investment outfit is ready to offer &# billion to acquire chrysler in a breezy letter to ceo dieter zetsche kerkorian right hand man jerome york recalled meeting mr zetsche three years earlier "when gasoline prices were still below &# a gallon" and "before three more years of rampant healthcare inflation " chrysler a maker of gas drinking sport utility vehicles with a vast family of aging retirees is of course acutely afflicted by both headaches to make clear that his offer is being dangled in good faith mr kerkorian would put &# million on the table but tracinda also desires exclusive rights to conduct due diligence on chrysler a process it expects would take about days various other buyers are said to be kicking the tires on chrysler including magna international a canadian auto parts maker in addition there is a posse of private equity firms including cerberus capital management which has lately showed a healthy interest in auto assets and a pairing of blackstone group and centerbridge capital partners significantly mr kerkorian also stipulated that any deal would be contingent on chrysler sealing a "favorable" contract with the united auto workers that may be hard unions have vocally opposed a chrysler sale and they have been especially outspoken about the notion of the auto makers being sold to a private equity firm who they fear would strip chrysler down like a k car left along the cross bronx expressway in order to cover their financing daimlerchrysler has sought to ease such worries by saying that it is looking for a buyer who has a long term plan for the company mr york a former chrysler executive played upon those notes in his letter he said the "right meaning exceptionally patient private ownership" can afford "the initial five six or seven year period it will likely take to build chrysler into a robust and lasting stand alone entity " mr york said that investors who must fetch a faster return wont have the time to repair chrysler and that would leave the company once again looking for a mechanic when the buyers "quick fix" faltered some daimlerchrysler investors might wonder about mr kerkorians capacity for patience tracinda mounted a public push to get general motors to agree to an alliance with carlos ghosn led nissan motor and renault but when the three auto companies couldnt reach a deal tracinda loudly dumped its stake in gm and stormed off but that may be only a secondary worry for daimlerchrysler shareholders the primary issue for most of them may be that mr kerkorians offer just isnt very rich to be sure chrysler has dropped steeply in value from its purchase price of &# billion but analysts think that chrysler is now worth between &# billion and &# billion leaving tracindas bid short of the mark all the same daimler shareholders may simply be happy to envision chrysler in the rearview mirror its u s shares increased by in p m trading on the new york stock exchange stocks inch
