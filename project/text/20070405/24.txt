fashion journal ensuring that your cartier is really a cartier existing efforts to weed out welter of fakes fall short a labor intensive solution with prices of designer handbags high end watches and crystal vases skyrocketing some retailers envision a kind of blue book for luxury goods trade in your orrefors decanter for a certain price and head straight to bergdorf goodman for the new model an established secondary market for luxury goods would not only simplify the resale market but encourage consumers to buy authentic if used goods instead of fakes "customers who might have bought fake can buy pre owned the beauty of it is its an asset you can trade it again " says michael sheldon a former private equity banker who founded portero an online auction site for luxury goods online sites like ebay were supposed to streamline the resale process for buyers instead of dragging your balenciaga bag or cartier watch to the consignment shop you could simply post it online but as anyone whos tried to buy such items online knows all too well rampant counterfeiting makes the process treacherous "luxury goods are particularly vulnerable to fraud online because they are design intensive it costs a lot to make the first one and it costs very little to make the rest of them " says travis brown general counsel for buysafe inc a company that bonds all sorts of online merchants the biggest problem until now has been that because of the deluge of items involved most attempts to police internet counterfeits have involved certifying sellers as honest rather than certifying the myriad goods as authentic the theory is that an honest seller will sell genuine goods or refund the money if they mess up but this isnt always the case buysafe com for example investigates online merchants much as a lender would and has bonded of them like an insurer buysafe offers a virtual mall of these insured sellers at www buysafeshopping com and it works closely with some vendors on sites such as overstock coms auction site www auctions overstock com and ebay but just because sellers are bonded doesnt mean they are able to police every item they sell ebay the worlds biggest online seller has a sort of finger in the dike program that it calls vero verified rights owner designers and manufacturers may join vero they are responsible for searching out counterfeits on ebay and asking to have the items removed from the site but this doesnt appear to have held back the flood of fakes on the site ebay argues that it cant guarantee everything that trades on its site so buyers should get to know sellers ask for close up pictures and research the goods the problem with the buysafe and ebay models is that they leave me the dummy consumer to authenticate my purchase and chase down a refund if necessary after experimenting with this method for a prada bag i concluded it would be easier to get a second job and earn money to pay retail there is just no way to ensure the real mccoy by inspecting photographs and emailing with sellers one of the best options on the web for buying authentic merchandise right now is portero com an online auction site that does the dirty work manually authenticating every item that trades on its site the solution is labor intensive for the company but not for consumers at a warehouse in armonk n y a team of authenticators evaluates jewelry watches and collectibles they are sold by portero a name that means "gatekeeper" in spanish or a consignor and are delivered with a money back guarantee of authenticity the companys claim to fame not a single item returned as fake in auctions manufacturers see value in a healthy secondary market and porteros approach the swiss luxury conglomerate compagnie financiere richemont sa has provided financial backing for portero which sold &# million worth of goods last year lalique is certifying its crystal and other items luxury watch giant tourneau trained porteros sleuths to weigh watches open their backs and inspect second hand movements and placement of serial numbers portero has been evolving for three years it started out as dropshop on ebay when mr sheldon feared ebays trouble with fakes was pressuring his prices he changed the name then abandoned ebay the latest web site launches publicly on april but it is already up and running porteros main drawback is that its selection is severely limited at least for now the other issue dont expect the same kind of dirt cheap deals that fuel the fantasies of ebay aficionados there are no &# omega watches here most items range in price from about &# to &# its revenues which include a roughly commission on consignment goods have to cover the overhead required to authenticate and photograph the goods in return portero has weeded out anything that smells fishy such as a fake cache of david yurman jewelry whose five pieces weighed too little and whose soldering wasnt typically clean one of the portero sleuths all time favorite
