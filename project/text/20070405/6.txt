acer seeks happiness in its land of sorrow the first time acer inc tried to sell its personal computers in the u s it was a &# billion dollar misadventure that nearly sank the company this time though the taiwanese pc seller is pushing into what its chairman jokingly calls "a land of sorrow" on quite a roll acer has emerged as one of the biggest turnaround stories in the history of the pc industry it is the fourth biggest pc vendor in the world by unit sales and soon expects to leapfrog lenovo group ltd to become no behind just hewlett packard co and dell inc this year acer expects the number of pcs it sells to grow by three to four times the industry average of a feat it accomplished last year already acer sells nearly as many notebook computers world wide as dell "we still have a lot of room to grow " said chairman j t wang in a recent interview at the companys headquarters outside taipei and that means the u s where despite formidable challenges the company appears to be well positioned to exploit changing dynamics in the industry in the past few years buying behavior in the pc world has changed drastically with most growth in the u s coming from consumers not businesses companies that relied heavily on american corporate sales such as dell and lenovo which bought international business machines corp s pc business two years ago have struggled shunning the internet sales model dell pioneered acer focuses on traditional distributors and retailers to reach consumers with pcs that are less expensive than the competition acer also sells mainly notebook pcs which are more popular among consumers than desktop models acer could yet stumble it still has nowhere near the brand recognition of bigger u s rivals and is smaller in terms of revenue which means it carries less weight with distributors acers business model also carries inherent risks the company is heavily dependent on retailers to move its products making acer especially vulnerable to inventory management problems computers begin depreciating the moment they leave the factory so even a temporary slowdown in consumer pc sales could significantly cut into acers profit "the bottom line is acer has a more volatile business model than hp or dell " says chris foster an analyst at technology business research in hampton n h "and acer has razor thin margins so any slowdown can have a devastating effect " acers dominance in europe means it needs to succeed in the u s in a big way to sustain its extraordinarily high growth rates the company is still relatively unknown in the worlds largest pc market with just a share of all pcs sold in the u s last year according to research firm idcs worldwide quarterly pc tracker but its u s sales are growing far faster as much as annually in recent years than those of most of its larger rivals as it becomes more prominent in the worlds biggest pc market acer is increasingly bumping up against its powerful competitors h p filed a federal suit last week claiming acer had infringed on its patents and demanding that it stop selling certain models in the u s analysts say the lawsuit creates uncertainty but that it targets older technologies and isnt a serious problem for acer "this is a competitive weapon " says kirk yang a technology hardware analyst for citigroup in hong kong it shows "acer is a serious threat now to the large pc companies " he says todd bradley executive vice president of h ps personal systems group says the lawsuit is defending the company against "another form of piracy" and discounts any competitive pressure from acer "i dont think its a threat or anything else that they want to run an unprofitable business " he says a decade ago acer was flailing with a confused strategy and a brand that was bleeding money at its founding in as multitech it had focused on manufacturing computers for other brands eleven years later it changed its name to acer and began its push to build an international brand in the mid s it tried to grab market share in the u s the company flooded its u s distribution chain with pcs but couldnt sell them before effectively retreating in it was "a bloody lesson that almost killed the company " says mr wang a year veteran at the same time acer struggled with a conflict that cut to the core of its business model as recognition of its brand grew contract customers that it made computers for began fearing they were feeding a potential rival then when ibm then one of acers main customers stopped selling desktop pcs to retail customers in acer lost a huge share of its orders in acer executives decided to split the manufacturing operations into a new company what remains of acer is a pure sales marketing and service operation that outsources manufacturing to the same handful of taiwanese contract manufacturers that also make pcs for h p dell and other big brands acer focused on the increasingly marginalized distributors and retailers who had traditionally brought pcs to consumers because it had been losing money it could afford to charge less than competitors give a cut of sales to retailers and make more profit on each pc than it had before acer still operates on lower profit margins than many of its competitors dell for example despite its recent difficulties reported an operating profit margin of in the latest fiscal quarter ended feb acers was just over for its latest quarter through december according to analysts estimates acers first big push was in europe where unlike in asia and the u s it didnt face a major domestic challenger to head its european charge it tapped gianfranco lanci a cappuccino swilling italian executive who had come to acer through an acquisition after his promotion in mr lanci began crisscrossing europe to hash out deals with distributors and stores quickly making it the top selling brand in several countries mr lanci was promoted to be acers president in a rare example of a foreigner holding a top job at one of taiwans tech companies now mr lanci is helping to oversee the companys push into the u s by late acer was preparing for a return to the u s but chastened by acers history mr wang ordered his u s executives to practice restraint "dont be in a hurry " he recalls telling them "if you dont make money thats okay but you cannot lose big money " acer quickly found willing partners in april it signed a strategic alliance with ingram micro inc one of the worlds biggest technology wholesalers to distribute acer notebooks in the u s it won deals for shelf space in circuit city stores inc wal mart stores inc compusa inc and others emeka diribe a year old math teacher in orange county calif is the kind of customer acer is counting on he decided recently he needed a new notebook to play games and do online video chatting with his brother after extensive research he settled on an h p model priced at about &# but when he walked into circuit city to buy it a display featuring an &# acer caught his eye mr diribe says the acer had a bigger screen a better microprocessor and a nicer keyboard "id never heard of acer until then " says mr diribe who bought the acer "it was a real bargain " a long sought deal earlier this year with retail giant best buy co should increase acers total revenue growth this year to from estimates tony tseng an analyst who covers acer for merrill lynch &amp co in taipei while mr wang says the best buy deal is "big" he isnt increasing growth targets "we understand that the u s is different " he says with a slight smile "because the market leaders are all in the u s its their home market " kris hudson christopher lawton and chiu piling contributed to this article
