patients risk return trade off on drugs marcia angells critique letters april of my recent piece "drug crazy " editorial page march raises the key question of what types of expertise are needed in formulating fda policy dr angell who has no training in law economics patents or industrial organization takes me to task on medical grounds for my view that the fda keeps too many drugs off the market for insufficient reason yet she utterly misses the institutional case against the current fda rules as a lawyer i make no judgments as to what medicines individual physicians should prescribe to individual patients but as an economist of sorts i take due note of the revealed preferences of informed consumers who disagree with dr angells universal prescriptions they want more choices not fewer perhaps painkillers like advil mixed with prilosec may work for some people but her categorical judgment that it is "simply wrong" to run the increased risk of heart attacks from cox inhibitors does not square with the choices of many physicians and patients whose behavior suggests otherwise risks and benefits from given treatment are not constant but vary across individuals what dr angell has to explain is why her judgment based on supposed generalizations should override the choices of people with every incentive to make the right risk return trade off dr angell attempts to carry this burden by referring to fda studies that indicate that of newly approved drugs do not exhibit marked advances of existing treatments so what she is the champion of the single most destructive policy recommendation on fda policy to come forward in recent years when she urges that the fda be authorized to keep me too drugs off the market unless they outperform the current incumbent under some collective measure of health that horrific rule would use the fda to create a gigantic monopoly that the patent law would never tolerate with adverse consequences on both innovation and price it also reveals her soviet style mindset whereby bureaucrats at the center dictate standardized drug treatment for all when more decentralized decision making is desperately needed given that all people are for drug purposes not created equal a far more sensible proposal is to take the fda out of the business of measuring effectiveness which can be better done in the private sector richard epstein stanford calif
