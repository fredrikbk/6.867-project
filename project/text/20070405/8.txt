apollo explores sale of stake in a private deal buyout firm may join recent rush to cash in mr blacks drive to win apollo management lp possibly joining the rush by buyout firms to cash in on their successful investment records is exploring the private sale of a stake in the firm for &# billion people close to the situation say the firm has retained investment bankers to study such a deal which would allow founder leon black and his partners to sidestep the hassles and heightened scrutiny involved in a public stock offering these people say apollo which is based in new york has invested more than &# billion in over corporate buyouts according to a recent offering document for one of its investments funds its biggest deals in recent years include a share in the &# billion buyout of casino operator harrahs entertainment inc the &# billion buyout of real estate concern realogy by an apollo affiliate and the &# billion purchase of chemical maker ondeo nalco co like other private equity buyers it hopes to retool the companies it acquires so it can sell them later at a profit mr blacks financial savvy and understanding of capital markets have helped produce impressive returns in recent years for investors in apollos funds now the wall street veteran may be seeking to parley that success into a hefty personal payday by offering a piece of the firm itself to institutional investors like pension funds such a deal would offer apollo a backdoor route to becoming a publicly traded stock a person close to mr black cautioned that he has yet to make a final decision but doesnt want apollo to become a public company right away indeed this person added that mr black might choose to do nothing however should apollo pursue a deal that values of the firm at &# billion mr black could net as much as &# million thats because this person says mr black owns more than of apollos general partnership structure apollos exploration of a private placement deal is part of a trend that some market watchers say may signal that the private equity business has peaked in recent weeks blackstone group another big private equity firm has disclosed plans to sell shares to the public in a &# billion initial public offering slated for later this year another firm fortress investment group llc which is a hedge fund and a private equity firm has already gone public and is trading well above its offering price private placementthe regulatory guidelines for private share placements like the one apollo is considering dont require a company to register with the securities and exchange commission and limit the financial details that must be disclosed to the public after the investors in the placement own the stock for a specified period of time sometimes six months the stock is registered with regulators and can be traded on the public market but that route to a public listing can be controversial those who buy into the stock after it goes on the open market typically smaller investors sometimes find that they have arrived at the party too late mr blacks firm is working with j p morgan chase &amp co and goldman sachs group inc in recent days j p morgan bankers have approached a variety of investors to gauge their interest in apollo shares say people familiar with the matter among those who might participate in a deal would be pension funds and insurance companies desire to one upon wall street mr black is known for his desire to one up his competitors and the idea of selling a stake in his firm privately may be designed to do just that by more quickly achieving the same end as an ipo carl icahn a longtime friend and fellow financier has been duking it out with mr black on the tennis court for years after beating mr icahn in a match several years ago mr black had a mock news article with the headline "black manhandles icahn" printed mr black left the article on all the seats around mr icahns seat at the u s open mr icahn says some successful investors characterize their careers as about more than money "i dont think leon worries about that " he said in an interview last year "i think he is out to make a lot of money " as more private equity firms consider ipos or other ways to generate more cash for their partners they are grappling with the complicated matter of how to structure such deals while ipos could allow the principals to cash out at a lofty price those principals also typically want to maintain tight control over their firms and avoid as much as possible drawing the publics attention to their lucrative management fees and generous pay packages blackstones solution to this quandary was to take public a slice of its management company as a master limited partnership disclosing little information and giving public shareholders such circumscribed rights that they cant even elect directors aside from any desire to minimize scrutiny mr black may be eyeing a private offering because of concerns about flooding the public market with more shares of private equity companies than it can absorb says a person close to him if apollo followed a blackstone ipo with its own it could drive down the valuations of both firms shares people familiar with the matter say mr black got his start on wall street at drexel burnham lambert inc where he rose to become a top executive and helped popularize the use of junk bonds the below investment grade securities that fueled the leveraged buyout boom of the s when drexel collapsed in amid insider trading charges and a bond market plunge mr black played the contrarian believing the bonds of many drexel clients undervalued he launched apollo staffed it with former drexel employees and began buying apollos partners today include some of the original drexel team as well as executives from other wall street firms mr blacks first big deal was a &# billion purchase of the junk bond portfolio of a former drexel client executive life insurance co that investment coupled with others in companies that werent drexel clients helped apollo post an average annual return of on its first two investment funds according to apollo marketing material apollo has relished its role as an outsider in the private equity business it has traditionally eschewed so called club deals in which several buyout firms team up to buy out a company it specializes in buying companies considered too troubled or difficult to decipher by its rivals mr blacks modus operandi is simple identify a vulnerable company negotiate ferociously to buy it cheaply then fix it up and sell it for more than he paid more recently apollo has turned up as a bidder for big deals sharing its role with other investors for example it teamed up with texas pacific group now known as tpg in its deal to buy harrahs mr black said in an interview last year that apollo has begun pursuing bigger deals because of an influx of capital into his funds and others from pension funds "anything is fair game there is so much capital " he said last year in the interview at his manhattan office overlooking central park bigger price tags mr black also said that bigger price tags and pitched competition for deals have amplified the risks in the business "the more you pay the lower your return will probably be " he says "it doesnt leave much room for error " apollos deals have mostly been successful since its inception in investors in its funds have enjoyed an average annual return of about after fees according to people close to apollo apollo collects of all profits from its funds and a annual management fee if apollo moves forward with a sale of a stake in the company it wouldnt be the first time apollo has tapped the public markets in apollo investment corp an apollo unit that lends to small and midsize companies undertook an ipo on the nasdaq stock market that offering was followed last summer by a &# billion offering in europe neither of those offerings sold a direct stake to investors in apollos mainstay private equity funds however which have until now been available only to big investors like pension funds robin sidel and dennis k berman contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications blackstone group the private equity firm that announced plans to undertake a public offering of about of its stock on march intends to raise
