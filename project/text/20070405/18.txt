chinas probe vindicates drug critic in a chinese drug maker was developing a version of clarithromycin a popular antibiotic used mainly to treat respiratory infections but to begin selling the medication the company zhongxiang kangshen medicine co needed approval from chinas drug regulator so luo yongqing director of zhongxiangs research department called his top employees to a meeting according to gao chun a research scientist who attended mr luo tossed a box of antibiotics made by abbott laboratories on the table and told the scientists to use the american drug makers pills in their application for approval from the countrys drug watchdog zhongxiangs own drug wasnt ready yet mr gao says but the company didnt think that should get in the way some of the researchers agreed to substitute the pills mr gao says but he refused "i thought it was immoral and against the law " he says a short time later mr gao stopped working for zhongxiang and launched a decade long fight against the drug and against government regulators whom he accuses of taking bribes from his former employer to look the other way the company won approval for the drug and has been selling it ever since mr gaos case failed in the courts but the picture he painted of a system gone wrong has received surprising vindication a major corruption probe has targeted chinas former top drug regulator a man with whom mr gao had an angry confrontation as he pursued his case the central commission for discipline inspection the communist partys anticorruption watchdog began investigating the regulator zheng xiaoyu in december and announced his expulsion from the party on march alleging that he abused his power by taking bribes from drug companies it is unclear whether he will face criminal prosecution mr zheng couldnt be reached for comment it still isnt clear what prompted the investigation into mr zheng but he is one of a number of high officials who have been investigated for possible corruption last fall chen liangyu the top communist official in shanghai was dismissed after authorities accused him of theft and other crimes minimal oversight of chinas burgeoning drug industry has allowed low quality and fake locally made medicines to plague chinas pharmacies and hospitals for years last fall an antibiotic made by a drug company in anhui province was linked to the deaths of at least people and the sickening of many others in late january the state food and drug administration announced that the production licenses for nearly medicines including some drugs registered during mr zhengs term would be reviewed chinese vice premier wu yi has asked the sfda to crack down on corruption "we urgently need to reform the system to remove loopholes in food and drug administration and set up an effective mechanism for clean governance " ms wu told a meeting of the sfda according to chinas xinhua news agency mr gao who is in his early s is rare in a society where speaking out against corruption can often lead to intimidation and persecution he has since left the medical industry and now works in guangzhou doing odd jobs such as delivering goods chinas lack of legal protection for whistleblowers has prompted calls for new legislation after he left zhongxiang mr gao spoke with local drug regulators in the provincial capital of hunan the province in which zhongxiang was based he says he realized the agency officials had no interest in finding out the truth when they tried to destroy the pills he had presented as evidence and got into a scuffle with him an official at the sfdas office in hunan says the episode took place too long ago to investigate but he adds that "now many companies have undergone reforms " the drug administration in beijing didnt respond to written questions about the accusations reached by telephone mr luo the manager mr gao accuses of ordering the fraud says "i wouldnt like to comment on this " adding that mr gao "likes to talk let him talk " jennifer smoter a spokeswoman for abbott in the u s says she has no comment because "we had no knowledge of this companys activities with regards to clarithromycin " a few months after he and the others were told to substitute the pills mr gao says he took a train to beijing in the hope of arranging a meeting with someone at sfda headquarters in the capital officials there refused to see him he says so he spent days camped outside the buildings entrance in protest eventually mr zheng then the sfdas head agreed to a meeting and told mr gao that he would investigate the case and punish any wrongdoers "when i met zheng i felt he was very nice " mr gao says "he said to me if we found out that any officials accepted bribes we would definitely investigate and punish them " but nothing happened in september zhongxiang which is located in yueyang city in hunan province changed its name to tonglian medicine co after shenyang tonglian pharmaceutical co a privately owned drug maker in northern liaoning province purchased a stake in it mr gao says he filed a lawsuit in against the drug administration in beijing for not taking action against zhongxiang he says the suit was dismissed by the beijing no peoples intermediate court and later on appeal by the countrys supreme court a spokesman for the beijing no peoples intermediate court declined to answer questions over the telephone mr gao says he called mr zheng to complain again but the conversation ended in a shouting match he says that mr zheng cursed at him and that he responded by calling mr zheng "the no corrupt official " liu jianyun tonglians manager says he isnt clear about the details of the companys drug approval application more than a decade ago but he says he doesnt think the company did anything wrong mr liu does say that in a separate case involving the high blood pressure drug terazosin hydrochloride the company probably used a sample that it hadnt produced when it was applying for government approval he says the application process is "time consuming" and that "for a company time is just money " tang hanting contributed to this article
