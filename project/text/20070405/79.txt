politics &amp economics capital why u s economic ills arent as contagious as thought an old cliche holds that when the u s economy sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold now comes the international monetary fund to say that it aint necessarily so it is a timely and welcome observation at a time when the u s economy is slowing down the logic behind the old saying is clear the u s accounts for slightly less than a third of global economic output at current exchange rates and about a fifth adjusted for local purchasing power the u s imports more than any other country sucking in about a fifth of all globally traded goods the u s has seen a larger increase in its trade with emerging markets and poor countries in the past couple of decades than have japan or the countries that share the euro u s financial markets are by far the largest in the world representing of global stock market capitalization and nearly half of all private debt outstanding all five u s recessions in the past years were accompanied by recessions elsewhere in the world no surprise there given that u s imports usually shrink sharply during a downturn latin america usually feels the most pain it sends more of its exports to its rich northern neighbor nearly of latin americas total gross domestic product than most other regions do but imf economists in an essay titled "decoupling the train " to be published in the new imf world economic outlook say the relationship isnt as simple as those facts suggest an accompanying chapter is similarly upbeat it may take a much smaller drop in the value of the dollar to rebalance the world economy than academic and government analysts have suggested the imf says but another chapter finds that globalization and technological change are squeezing workers share of income in rich countries the essays are to be posted at www imf org contrary to the cliche downturns abroad have been considerably smaller than the u s recessions or slowdowns in growth on average a one percentage point decline in u s economic growth is associated with a point decline elsewhere though the impact is larger in mexico and canada which are heavily dependent on exports to the u s but the size of the spillovers as the economists call them from the u s to the rest of the world seem to be growing over time probably because the u s is increasingly integrated with the global economy in trade in goods and services as well as finance of course when two things happen at the same time it doesnt mean one causes the other in fact as the imf economists note the synchronization of various economies in the s and early s probably reflected a common reaction to surging prices rather than a disease spread by the u s to others but in the past years or so economic ills moving from one country to another seem to be playing a more significant role than these common global shocks financial markets also are more tightly linked than ever as recent volatility in global stock markets demonstrates one gloomy fact correlations among markets are stronger during bear markets and recessions "this may help explain why global contractions tend to be more highly synchronized across countries than global expansions " imf economist peter berezin writes recent research suggests the u s plays a key role in propagating financial shocks one study pins about of the variation in prices of european financial assets of all sorts and a whopping for stocks on the u s only of the variation in u s asset prices can be traced to europe all this sounds ominous at a time when the u s economy has just ended its fourth consecutive quarter with growth below and forecasters arent anticipating much of a rebound in the current quarter but the imf economists led by thomas helbling find an unexpected silver lining the current weakness of the u s economy stems largely from housing woes and housing is less global than say computers and other parts of the u s economy that is good news for the rest of the world if the current u s slowdown were driven by a sinking stock market or by widespread dissipation of confidence the impact on the rest of the world would be bigger "the fact that the import content in the housing sector is relatively small has helped to mitigate the spillover effects on other countries " they say sometimes a sneeze isnt contagious
