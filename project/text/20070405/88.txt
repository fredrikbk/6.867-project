the colorful life of capitals champion prophet of innovation by thomas k mccraw belknap pages &# why to broach a perfectly reasonable question that hardly ever gets asked is capitalism so wonderful one reason the question doesnt get asked is that the wonderfulness seldom makes the daily report on the capitalist system which obliges us to keep reading about fraud stock option backdating layoffs arrant inequality and other nastiness another reason is that the systems real wonders which mainly have to do with ever rising living standards keep happening in slow motion and therefore tend not to be noticed in the u s personal incomes have doubled every or years joseph schumpeter an austrian german american economist who died in but whose reputation is also ever rising spent his professional life studying the capitalist dynamic he concluded and showed with an avalanche of data that the ultimate source of growth and income gains was the "creative destruction" wrought by entrepreneurs they destroy established enterprises by coming at them with new products fresh competitive techniques and innovative technology the warfare is eternal no company is safe managers who fail to innovate who think that they can stand pat on winning formulas will find instead that they are in schumpeters words "standing on ground that is crumbling beneath their feet " the innovator himself is presented by schumpeter as a truly fearsome character he is not taking all the risks of innovation just for the money he is also an adventurous type with "a will to conquer" and a yearning to establish an empire of his own by representing this adventurer as a desirable citizen schumpeter was repeatedly at odds with conventional economic thinking he believed for example that income inequality in capitalist societies is inevitable and because it nurtures competitive instincts desirable indeed he believed it was important to have inequality within the highest income groups and for this reason cautioned against the familiar complaint that entrepreneurs earn absurdly high payoffs for their success schumpeter was also distressed by activist anti monopoly policies since monopoly is precisely what the innovator has in mind he argued persuasively that all monopolies except for those protected by government are temporary his private life was no less fascinating than his public message in "prophet of innovation " thomas mccraw emeritus professor of history at the harvard business school artfully weaves the two together schumpeter was born in into a catholic family in a small austrian town he studied at the university of vienna spoke six languages and prided himself on being more than an economist his views are recurrently laced with data from sociology psychology and history at he was secretary of state for finance in the new austrian republic several years later he became chairman and president of a vienna based private banking corporation earning a salary then regarded as prodigious the equivalent of about &# today he had two elaborate residences owned a race horse and a riding horse spent a fair amount of time in beau monde dalliances leading mr mccraw to call him a womanizer and seemed on top of the world but two events brought him down one was the sudden out of the blue collapse of the vienna stock market in this led to the failure of several small start up companies in which schumpeter held sizable positions he suddenly found himself deeply in debt on top of everything else he had imprudently guaranteed loans made by an old college friend who was also caught in the crash and wiped out it took schumpeter a dozen years to pay off his creditors which he did mainly by giving paid lectures in the early s when harvard recruited him for its economics faculty a major attraction was the high salary then set at &# but schumpeter still had to pay for the steamship ticket and found that a few more lectures were required the second setback was far more devastating he fell deeply passionately in love with a young lady some years his junior they were married in november she died in childbirth in august the child died as well earlier that month his beloved mother had died unexpectedly mr mccraw tells us that this convergence of tragedies was the pivotal event of schumpeters personal life he was transformed from a bon vivant into an anguished widower whose sorrows never ceased although never formally religious he now made daily pilgrimages to his wifes grave his diaries were now cast as prayers to his "hasen" a german term of endearment entreating his wife and mother to help him in his work despite these internal miseries schumpeters final years the years in america were a professional triumph his classroom lectures at harvard were immensely popular as was his eccentric habit of giving abundant time to his students even those of no special ability in he was elected president of the american economic association his presidential address delivered to an overwhelmingly keynesian audience featured a rip roaring attack on keynesian logic and was nevertheless followed by a prolonged standing ovation all of which led to a diary entry in which he wrote "o gott and hasen thank you " schumpeters most popular book first published in and still widely read is "capitalism socialism and democracy " in it he asks and answers a portentous question "can capitalism survive no i do not think that it can " that answer is hedged in later passages even so it will seem wildly counterintuitive to readers who have read schumpeter on capitalisms huge successes but the successes have been in the economic realm and the threat is a social phenomenon the heart of the matter is that capitalism changes the way people think by reducing lifes decisions to costs and benefits it "creates a critical frame of mind which after having destroyed the moral authority of so many other institutions in the end turns against its own " the wealth created by the economic system ends up subsidizing a class of hostile intellectuals one could see this phenomenon most clearly during the era of vietnam related protest when our elite campuses the world of the upper middle class viewed america as a "sick society " nothing quite like that is discernible these days but there is no doubt that capitalist democracies still produce large numbers of protest prone citizens who dont exactly know whats good for them i e capitalism mr seligman is a contributing editor of forbes
