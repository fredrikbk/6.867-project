politics &amp economics a catch keeps willing army officer out of iraq new schooling requirement ends career as military faces manpower shortage tikrit iraq as u s navy capt leonard hatton pinned a bronze star to the lapel of army lt fred nicholson who spent the past year serving alongside him in one of iraqs most dangerous cities he said "you know this means youre always welcome in the navy " "good the army doesnt want me anymore " lt nicholson replied indeed the stocky year olds return to the u s is triggering a forced discharge from the army ending his military career and preventing him from receiving a much needed military pension the reason isnt lt nicholsons performance which by all accounts has been stellar it is the armys shifting educational requirements and the militarys unwillingness to bend them in his case when lt nicholson was commissioned as an officer in the army required just two years of completed college course work that is what he has today the military requires all officers to be college graduates and the military says the rule change leaves them no choice but to expel lt nicholson who never finished his degree "if the speed limit changes you cant fight a ticket by saying that the law used to let you drive faster " army lt col eve seibel a reservist who handled the nicholson case for the army during her own recent year in iraq said in an interview "the educational requirements are set in stone " the nicholson case is at odds with the militarys current trend toward looser personnel standards though the manpower strains caused by the prolonged wars in afghanistan and iraq have led the military to break with longstanding policies by recruiting soldiers who lack high school degrees have criminal records or are so overweight they would once have run afoul of military physical fitness requirements lt nicholson is in many ways precisely the type of officer the military is desperate to retain but the army is nevertheless insisting on discharging him lt nicholson is trapped in a catch "ive put my life on the line but when i get back the army will say youre out were through with you " he said lt nicholson joined the military in at age to escape what he describes as a "dead end life" in his small colorado hometown he excelled and was allowed into a prestigious program that gives enlisted soldiers a chance to become commissioned officers of the soldiers who began the course with lt nicholson fewer than a dozen others made it through he was soon promoted to first lieutenant his current rank at the time young reserve officers like lt nicholson didnt need college degrees he had finished two years of course work and was taking evening classes toward a planned degree in architectural engineering in the army sent him to germany for several months for a war game exercise by the time he returned to the u s he had lost his spot in the university and didnt have the money to resume his classes in the meantime congress approved the reserve officers professional management act which put in place a new requirement that all officers have college degrees part of a peacetime effort to raise the overall educational level of the military the shift meant lt nicholson was on borrowed time the army discharges anyone who twice fails to win a promotion and without a degree lt nicholson couldnt be elevated to captain in the summer of he received formal notice that he was being discharged because he lacked a college degree lt nicholson returned to colorado and opened a small construction company then came the wars in afghanistan and iraq which dragged on far longer than expected triggering widespread manpower shortages that forced the pentagon to look for ways of bringing old soldiers back to active duty in the summer of an army human resources officer in st louis called lt nicholson and told him he would be promoted to captain potentially salvaging his military pension for which he needed five more years of service if he agreed to a yearlong stint in iraq lt nicholson says army officials at the time desperately short of officers for iraq werent being rigid about the educational requirement at the officers direction lt nicholson sent a written request for a waiver of the armys educational requirements and made his way to fort jackson in south carolina in february two months before he was slated to deploy to iraq the army sent lt nicholson a letter telling him the education waiver had been denied the personnel officer told lt nicholson that he "must be discharged" no later than aug for failing to have a college degree lt nicholson says his only solace was that his scheduled discharge date was just a few months after he was supposed to be sent to iraq he doubted the army would send him to iraq in april and bring him home in august the army had a different solution though officials told lt nicholson they would delay his discharge until his unit returned from iraq he arrived in iraq in april and was assigned to a government reconstruction team in bloody salahaddin province he made regular trips into samarrah one of iraqs deadliest cities and was awarded a bronze star for chasing down gunmen who ambushed him one afternoon in the nearby city of bayji the armys decision to discharge lt nicholson has infuriated some high ranking officers here several of whom have written senior army officials asking that he be given time to complete his degree and resume his career "there is very strong feeling on this side of the world that being told on one hand that you can die for your country but on the other that you are being kicked out for lack of a college degree is a travesty " retired maj gen eric olson wrote capt hatton lt nicholsons commanding officer in tikrit wrote the army last fall that lt nicholson "served his country only to be used and thrown out on the back end of his mobilization " a situation he described as "appalling " "he gets a medal and a shove out the door " capt hatton said in an interview senior military commanders say lt nicholsons case represents an extreme example of a broader problem soldiers and officers who confront shifting rules about how often they can be deployed to war zones and how long they have to spend in the military before resuming civilian lives for the moment the militarys decision stands col ken sanchez of the colorado national guard lt nicholsons former unit said the education rule cant be waived "each of us has individual requirements placed upon us to remain in service " he said in an email interview lt nicholson plans to drive to the military human resources center in st louis to make a final attempt to press his cause in person a retired marine general has promised to help him in any potential litigation to lt nicholson it is a matter of economic necessity he wasnt able to save much money when he ran his construction company so his ability to retire one day depends on receiving a military pension that would be approximately &# a month "were not talking about a lot of money but its an issue of survival for me " he says "and its an issue of fairness " corrections

politics &amp economics article yesterday about his case incorrectly said the issue was keeping him out of iraq a summary box accompanying the article incorrectly said he already had been discharged
