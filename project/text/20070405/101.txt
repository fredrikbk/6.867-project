what next on global warming now that the supreme court has decided that the epa must deal with global warming under the clean air act what will happen not much if the past is prologue the statute called for reducing all then known pollutants to healthy levels by yet million americans still breathed unhealthy air even in and many still do this failure should be laid at the doorstep of congress it crafted a law that members could vote for to achieve an end but left the means the rules and regulations of achieving that end to others that way legislators could take credit for a popular goal but shift the blame to the epa for the costs of achieving it no wonder they voted for the statute all but unanimously even better congress could then get additional credit by coming down hard on the epa when voters complained about the cost of its proposed rules not surprisingly the agency found that delay was the easiest course of action under democratic and republican presidents alike when green voters complained that the epa failed to achieve clean air on schedule the legislators took more credit by thumping the agency again the most important progress came only after the charade went on long enough for voters to blame congress thus congress delegated to the epa the power to make rules on emissions from power plants and other stationary sources in but the agency did nothing much on carcinogenic air pollutants and acid rain for two decades only when blame fell on congress did it take responsibility in for making the hard costly choices progress also came from the states which did more to clean up power plant emissions in the s than the epa accomplished in the s according to brookings institute scholar robert crandall "the assertions about the tremendous strides the epa has made are mostly religious sentiment " because the provision of the clean air act under which the epa now must deal with global warming leaves the hard choices up to the agency we should expect delay and when that becomes impossible we should expect the epa to take action of only marginal importance environmental groups understand this so their claims of victory in the supreme court quickly segue into calls for congress "to pass the kind of bold legislation that our planet so desperately needs " there would be no need for new legislation if the old legislation were any good the real importance of the courts decision is that it will increase pressure on congress to pass a special statute but any new statute is unlikely to be bold like their forebears in the s the sponsors of the leading bills trumpet their zeal to achieve environmental goals but deny that there will be much impact on voters how the answer will be like the one provided in government will improve technology and put the burden on big bad polluters rather than ordinary folks in the s however pollution control technology did not improve nearly fast enough to produce healthy air on schedule the direct costs of environmental regulation today add something like &# per year to the prices and taxes that the average family pays the price is surely worth it but the failure of congress to own the costs of cleaning the air delegitimated tough agency action in the s just as it will delegitimate it with global warming congressional blandishments of painless global warming control are likely to produce a federal statute like californias global warming solutions act of here too the state legislature established a popular goal to bring californias global warming emissions down to levels by but left a state agency to make the rules needed to achieve the goal the law would be more accurately labeled the global warming wishlist act of a "bold" global warming statute requires congress to do more than mouth the phrase "cap and trade " it will need to decide which caps on which constituencies those are choices congress will be disinclined to make for many years unless voters see through the promises of a free global warming lunch what about a tax on global warming emissions a tax requires legislators to leave their fingerprints on a measure imposing palpable costs to voters when he was president bill clinton supported such a tax but its not in the bill sponsored by sen hillary clinton if congress leaves the hard choices to the epa the president takes the blame for the costs its better for the president if congress shares the blame when it is willing to do so we will know congress is serious until then we are left with the supreme court reading the clean air act to mean that the epa is responsible for solving each and every pollution problem that reading is correct what is incorrect is the laws premise that leaving the hard choices up to the epa is a sound way to solve any pollution problem mr schoenbrod teaches at new york law school is a senior fellow at the cato institute and is author of "saving our environment from washington how congress grabs power shirks responsibility and shortchanges the people" yale university press
