study shows flaw in mammography tool popular computer aided method yields more false positives than less expensive approach risk of unnecessary procedures a commonly used computerized mammography system touted as a tool to help radiologists better detect breast cancer may actually do more harm than good in a study of mammograms performed at medical centers over a four year period mammography with computer aided detection or cad was found to be no better at finding cancer than traditional mammography and resulted in more false alarms that caused women to undergo unnecessary biopsies "this is a substantial hit for this technology " says ferris hall a radiologist at the beth israel deaconess medical center in boston "this study suggests that it may actually be harmful " stephen taplin one of the study authors and a senior scientist at the national cancer institute said some women may now decide it isnt necessary to have a mammogram conducted with a cad system and insurers may also start to balk at paying for the added cost of the technology radiologists typically get about &# more for mammograms with cad than regular mammograms which are priced from about &# to &# apiece depending on the equipment cad has been widely adopted since initial studies in the late s suggested radiologists were better able to spot cancer tumors with the aid of computer enhanced screening radiologists were also attracted to the technology because of the higher reimbursement more than million women in the u s get a mammogram each year and about one third of those are conducted with the aid of a cad system dr hall and other radiologists cautioned that the study which was funded by the national cancer institute and the american cancer society isnt the last word on cad they said the technology continues to evolve and that larger studies are needed to confirm and expand upon the results of this study which appeared in todays new england journal of medicine some radiologists also said the performance of cad could be improved with better training of the doctors using the technology cad systems use complex algorithms to identify suspicious areas of a mammogram for a radiologist to review their use is considered a second set of eyes alerting radiologists to potential problems they may have missed overall the study found there was little difference between the two approaches in detecting cancer regular mammography screening found cases of cancer per women screened while mammograms using cad found cases per thousand the authors said that the difference wasnt statistically significant the rate of false positives however was about higher in the cad group the study authors estimated that women would be called back for more screening which would detect one additional case of cancer using cad of the women would get a biopsy the false positives are considered harmful because they lead to more testing such as biopsies that may be invasive or uncomfortable and added doctor visits that can be stressful for patients women "need to be thinking about it and not just assuming that it helps them " dr taplin said of cad "after this study we need to look more closely at this technology and not assume it is working when it might not be " hologic inc the maker of the best selling cad system whose technology was used in the study said many other studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cad in picking up cancers rob cascella the companys president also noted the new england journal study found that the cad system found more earlier stage breast cancer than regular mammography this difference however wasnt statistically significant study authors said meaning no valid conclusion could be drawn from it "we have a tool that helps us find smaller abnormalities and earlier indications of the disease " mr cascella said hologic a bedford mass maker of digital mammography machines acquired the cad technology when it bought r technology inc last year other cad makers include icad inc of nashua n h and eastman kodak co detection of earlier stage cancers has been shown in other studies to have little impact on reducing the breast cancer mortality rate says robert a smith the director of cancer screening for the american cancer society mr smith said that with improvements cad might be a useful tool even though this study found it to be "associated with an increase in costs and harms with only a small improvement in the detection of small cancers " the study authors estimated that if every mammogram center in the u s used the computer assisted technology the national cost of screening mammography would increase by or &# million a year dr hall of beth israel in an editorial accompanying the study in the new england journal said the cad technology was quickly adopted despite little evidence based data to support its use he said congress mandated reimbursement for cad after heavy lobbying by the industry "we have been using cad for three or four years " he said of his own practice "we got it not because we are saving extra lives but because insurers are paying us for it the payback time on the cost of the system is only three years if you are a busy practice and as a radiologist i am getting extra bucks just for pushing a button " test results what the study found regular mammography and computer aided detection found roughly the same number of cancers the rate of false positives was about higher among women who had computer aided mammograms an estimated women who had cad mammograms would be called back for more testing of those women would get a biopsy
