politics &amp economics broader issues keep gulf tensions high irans release of britons brings relief oil price drop but power struggle continues the end of a standoff with iran over captured british sailors and marines calmed world oil markets and drew expressions of relief in london and elsewhere but did little to defuse the increasing tensions enveloping the persian gulf despite its peaceful resolution the incident seems certain to add more fuel to the regional power struggle unfolding across the middle east between tehran and washington in the end iran emerged strengthened in some ways and weakened in others the incident deepened unease among arab gulf states about the potential for armed conflict between the u s and iran causing some to distance themselves from washington but events also underscored irans unpredictability to some europeans likely making them more receptive to economic penalties that might help rein in irans nuclear program senior u s officials who had expected the incident to drag on far longer are now debating whether to respond by showing a firmer stance toward iran or to back away from moves that might be seen as provocative one point of contention within the bush administration is whether to go ahead as early as next week with another round of persian gulf naval maneuvers this time involving destroyers and cruisers the prior maneuver which involved the two aircraft carriers that the u s now has patrolling the waterway was taking place when the british group was seized at gunpoint march in disputed waters of the northern persian gulf with of the worlds oil supply transiting through the persian gulf crude prices had soared on worries the standoff would escalate into a military confrontation the incident sent oil prices spiraling to six month highs before they eased this week as diplomatic efforts showed promise crude prices immediately fell on irans announcement that the crew would be released exactly why iran decided to seize the british sailors remains a matter of debate in u s and european policy circles some officials argue that tehran which claimed the sailors were in iranian waters wanted to drive a wedge between the u s and britain while others contend iran wanted to hit back at the west following the passage of a second round of united nations sanctions aimed at persuading iran to end its nuclear program others have said irans move was orchestrated by hard line factions in tehran to undermine a push among some moderates there to be more amenable to the west a u s defense official who focuses on iran said he doesnt expect the seizure of the british personnel to be the last provocative action iran takes as the standoff over its nuclear program continues he said that as economic sanctions take hold and tehran feels more isolated the regimes revolutionary guard its elite military force or iranian proxies such as hezbollah in lebanon could take further actions to threaten washington and its allies "its very much a tit for tat proxy war " the official said "and unfortunately things could get worse " equally unclear is why iran decided suddenly to end the standoff the british government insisted it didnt negotiate for the release though the iranians said london had promised not to enter the same area in the gulf again u s officials in washington also denied that the u s had played any role in the sailors release and said no agreement had been made about granting iran access to five iranians under u s detention in northern iraq iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad turned his decision to release and "pardon" the british personnel into a bizarre form of theater he made the announcement midway through a two hour news conference and then met each of the sailors and marines one by one in front of iranian television cameras by then the men were decked out in new business suits while the lone woman wore a head scarf and a baggy shirt and sweater as each of them smiled and talked politely with the president still the seemingly amicable denouement wont ease all worry that diplomats and oil traders have about heightened tensions in the gulf and irans increasing willingness to flex its muscles there while irans military isnt capable of closing the gulf any military confrontation would significantly disrupt normal oil transport operations there for instance jacking up shipping and insurance rates and sending tanker captains steaming to safer ports also not likely to go away soon is the underlying dispute over who controls what areas of the persian gulf which could rebound to irans favor in washington the dispute prompted at least one high level meeting of diplomats lawyers and intelligence officials at the state department this week to try to clarify the u s position on exactly where the international boundaries fall within the strategically vital waterway one u s military official said iran in its discussions over recent days with british officials had won a de facto recognition that the international boundaries in the gulf remained ill defined at best some in the bush administration worry the dispute could spark an international legal dispute that might end up crimping u s naval forces operating in the region others though argue the standoff undermined irans credibility "this is not going to help iran on the nuclear issue because it reminds the world they cant be trusted " said patrick clawson deputy director for research at the washington institute for near east policy yesterday standing in front of no downing street british prime minister tony blair praised what he described as his governments "measured approach firm but calm not negotiating but not confronting either " addressing his remarks to the iranian people he said "the disagreements that we have with your government we wish to resolve peacefully with dialogue " that said those in washington arguing that tehran cant be trusted now have more ammunition moreover iran proved to have enough influence to prevent britain from winning passage of a strongly worded u n resolution condemning the taking of the sailors carrick mollenkamp and
