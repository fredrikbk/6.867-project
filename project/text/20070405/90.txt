the daily fix columnists bid fond farewell to a college football legend online edition eddie robinson the legendary grambling coach who sent more than players to the nfl in a career that spanned nearly six decades died late tuesday at leaving columnists to try and take the measure of an extraordinary man robinsons career could serve as a microcosm of sports and race in america when he began his career in grambling was the louisiana negro normal and industrial institute and his coaching duties included laundry and driving the team bus before he was done hed won games nine black college national championships and southwestern athletic conference titles hed also graduated of his players he once wrote that "if a boy cant tackle we show him how i sometimes wondered if anybody cared enough to teach him to read " the newark star ledgers jerry izenberg who helped publicize robinsons many accomplishments in a late s documentary produced with howard cosell writes that robinson "had been the first college coach to win games the first to coach a black school in a bowl game against an integrated mainstream university the one who developed the first two significant black nfl quarterbacks the first who hell there must have been firsts but he did not carry them as trophies to him they were simply footprints indelibly stamped into the highway that was his lifes journey and he understood that journey a lot better than most of us understand our own all i want he would say many times when i was going to write about him is for my story to be an american story not black and white just american i want it to belong to everybody " "the mount rushmore of college coaches has to include bryant paterno and robinson not necessarily in that order " michael wilbon writes in the washington post adding that "to try to discount the level of competition grambling faced would be to ignore history with southeastern conference schools unwilling to even recruit black players until the late s a great many perhaps even most of the best black ballplayers the first years of the th century went to historically black colleges by position historically black colleges could field a team on offense and defense that would challenge most super bowl teams in terms of credentials integration may allow black football players to matriculate at louisiana state now but it doesnt wipe away decades of history you want to argue that tackling walter payton and covering jerry rice would have been harder if they had played in the big ten instead of jackson state and mississippi valley state respectively " "whats strange is that the praise grambling state universitys icon will be getting in retrospect now is the sort of thing he had always strived to deflect " greg cote writes in the miami herald "the son of a cotton sharecropper and a domestic worker managed to both rise above his humble roots and never forget them on the day he surpassed alabamas legendary paul bear bryant for most career coaching victories in college football robinson said im no better than any other coach but ive heard the best in america and learned " in the baltimore sun david steele tries to get past the numbers writing that "you dont have to go much further down to see and hear the tales of how he raised six decades worth of productive citizens many during a time when men like him and his players were not considered real citizens of this country to be black in the s s and s in america particularly where grambling is located in louisiana generally meant settling for less than what this country promised robinson taught his followers not to settle for anything less the word taught is not used lightly here robinson was a teacher the way all college coaches at every level say they are but too few actually manage to be what he taught was the american dream " in the new york daily news t j quinn writes of the lifelong love affair between robinson and his wife doris "the little home on a country road on the edge of the town of grambling with no sidewalks was a monument to the year love affair between eddie and doris robinson and the children they raised not a shrine to his football life " he writes "asked she proudly pulled out scrapbooks and photo albums and pointed out the famous people they knew the players who were part of their lives but during a visit to the robinsons home in the late summer of doris robinson talked more of the courtship that began in baton rouge when they were both and in the seventh grade that relationship continued through their high school years even after doris parents sent her to a boarding school miles away to break them up eventually they went to the same college transferred to another when eddie felt the football coach was ignoring him married and became louisiana royalty " make sure you read to the bittersweet end of that one the masters has begun in augusta with arnold palmer the honorary starter and tiger woods and phil mickelson heading the field looking for a green jacket though the fixs golf guru tim carroll is betting on someone else in the new york daily news wayne coffey looks back at the masters won by woods and the repercussions of that victory as seen by black workers at augusta that may sound contrived but in the hands of a writer as skilled as mr coffey it works take what augusta caddie frank jones "the day of woods breakthrough at the masters years after lee elder became the first black man to play in the tournament remains as vivid a memory as frank jones has watching at home on tv seeing the th green lined with african american workers recalling all the courses he was shunned from as he tried to play a round with his k mart clubs his arms were filled with goose bumps his eyes with tears you couldnt believe what you were seeing jones says the next day it was like a new halo over the clouds " mr coffeys colleague hank gola lots of great stuff in the daily news today has a troubling question what happened to the post tiger golf boom among black kids a decade after that masters win woods is the only black face on the pga tour "tim oneal is still trying to make the leap from the nationwide tour while a couple of young players kevin hall and stephen reed are on the mini tour circuit looking for exemptions into bigger events " mr gola writes "and the pipeline isnt all that promising either perhaps everyone was naive to think it could happen so soon yet it is even more mind boggling when you consider there were more black players in an era when discrimination was still a major factor an all time high african americans played the pga tour in the year after tiger was born and from to pete brown charlie sifford lee elder jim thorpe and calvin peete combined for pga tour victories peetes win in the money tournament of champions is the last by an african american other than woods " why mr gola has a possible answer that may startle you on the surface augusta is decidedly anti tech as andrew tolve writes on slate get caught with a cellphone and youre shown the exit never to return the scoreboards are manual the only prominent clock is a sundial electric vacuum cleaners arent allowed in the clubhouse but look deeper "while the masters brass has carefully cultivated a technology hating image all this luddism is a facade " mr tolve writes "beneath the clubs manicured greenery lies an arsenal of technological wonders that keeps the course looking timeless and pristine indeed take a deep enough divot at augusta national and youll unearth the most technologically advanced setup in golf " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
