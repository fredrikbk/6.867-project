probe into college lender ties widens subpoenas turn spotlight on obstacles students face in finding best financing new york attorney general andrew cuomo intensifying his probe into student lending is investigating stock grants to officials at columbia university the university of southern california and the university of texas at austin by a company that won a coveted spot on the schools lists of "preferred" lenders mr cuomos office subpoenaed student loan xpress inc a unit of financial services company cit group inc and columbia new york officials also sent letters to usc and the university of texas to determine whether the financial aid officials received shares in the company in exchange for placement on the preferred lists such an arrangement could disadvantage students if they are being steered to companies that arent offering the best lending terms in a statement columbia said it had discovered that a top aid official david charlow "had a financial interest in one of our preferred lenders " the school said it placed the mr charlow on paid leave pending the investigation and notified the attorney general in an investigation that has shaken the image of financial aid offices just as students are receiving acceptance letters from colleges mr cuomo is examining universities and six student lenders for what he has called widespread conflicts of interest in college aid offices earlier this week eight universities including the university of pennsylvania new york university and syracuse university settled allegations of loan kickbacks by agreeing to stop accepting payments travel and other perks from student lenders the colleges denied wrongdoing five of the eight schools agreed to refund &# million to students because of revenue sharing agreements in which schools received a percentage of loans they referred to lenders an arrangement mr cuomo called a kickback mr charlow the associate dean of student affairs at columbia owned shares and warrants of education lending group inc the parent of student loan xpress at the time of a september stock offering education lending said in a securities and exchange commission filing lawrence burt associate vice president of student affairs and director of the office of student financial services at the university of texas at austin is listed in the offering document as owning shares and warrants so is catherine thomas associate dean and director of financial aid at the university of southern california new york state officials said mr charlow made a total profit of at least &# selling those shares in comparable figures werent available for mr burt and ms thomas mr charlow and ms thomas couldnt be reached for comment james grant a usc spokesman said the school "will now review the information in the letter" from the attorney general "and respond " in a letter to the university of texas benjamin m lawsky deputy counsel and special assistant to mr cuomo said the state was "deeply concerned" that mr burt may have received shares in exchange for placing student loan xpress on the schools list of preferred lenders "students may therefore have been left with the false impression that the company was preferred because it was best for students when in reality the company was selected because of its stock grants" to mr burt he wrote in that letter and a nearly identical one to the university of southern california mr lawsky wrote that new york state has "reason to believe" that the officials received shares "directly from the company either as shares outright or as subsequently exercised options to purchase shares " in an interview mr burt said he bought shares in the predecessor of education lending group in for &# after a long time friend now president of student loan xpress suggested they could be a good "high risk" investment at the time mr burt said the company didnt make loans to students but consolidated those already made he said he believes he was bought out of the shares when cit purchased the company and figures he earned between &# and &# in the transaction he said he believed that the company in or joined the schools preferred lender list he said there was no connection to his stock ownership and that it was one of lenders picked for service and benefits "i did not do anything wrong " he said juan c gonzalez university of texas at austins vice president for student affairs said the school was "very concerned about any allegations of impropriety regarding our "preferred lender list " he said the school will be reviewing the process a university spokesman said mr burt hadnt been disciplined calling such a move "premature " mr charlow has made a testimonial for student loan xpress on its web site he is quoted as saying "we have worked with the student loan xpress team for many years because they consistently meet the very high standards for service that our students and parents expect not only from our university but also from our partners " in a statement cit said it acquired education lending group the parent company of student loan xpress in and the transactions involving financial aid officers predated that purchase "we are currently seeking to determine the facts surrounding those transactions " the company said last year students took out &# billion in loans to pay for ever rising tuitions and the latest revelations are sure to lead to further questions from those just now calling financial aid offices with acceptance letters in hand many of those loans such as those made through the popular stafford program are government guaranteed and bear set regulated rates though some companies offer discounts it is unlikely that students borrowing through such programs could have received poor terms because of any alleged improper deals mr cuomo has focused much of his attention on the smaller but faster growing market for "private" loans that arent backed by the government through such loans lenders can charge varying interest rates depending on borrowers credit and other factors so experts advise students to shop around even if the school that accepts them offers a deal on a private loan through its preferred list for its part the organization representing aid officers says students can still rely on most college officials earlier this week the national association of student financial aid administrators lashed out at mr cuomo saying he "needlessly tore the fabric of trust between schools and students" by exaggerating problems the organization called abuses "rare " adding that "student aid administrators work tirelessly to get students the best terms on student loans so they can achieve their higher education goals and maximize their career potentials " david
