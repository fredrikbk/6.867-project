the morning brief parsing a resolution between iran and u k online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here there is something to be said for anticlimax when it comes to geopolitical crises as the face saving resolution of the british iranian standoff demonstrates the british sailors and marines held for nearly two weeks after their capture in waters disputed by iran and iraq flew home this morning seated in business class on a commercial british airways flight and bearing the handicrafts pistachio nuts and persian sweets bestowed on them before departure by iranian authorities following what the times of london calls a two hour "rambling monologue about religion and britains history of meddling in his countrys affairs " president mahmoud ahmadinejad surprised the world yesterday with news of the captives imminent release he declared it a "gift to the british people" in honor of the prophet muhammads birthday easter and passover mr ahmadinejad also took the occasion to lavishly praise and decorate members of the revolutionary guards who seized the british as they carried out united nations mandated patrols in what much of the world considers iraqi maritime territory as the new york times notes both he and british leaders portrayed the outcome as a victory prime minister tony blair suggested it was vindication of the "measured approach firm but calm not negotiating but not confronting either " taken by his government and in a statement that seemed to contradict the message of many british media he said britain wont hold the incident against the iranian people and that it respected irans "proud and dignified history " the bottom line as the n y times puts its is that britain "agreed only to disagree with iran about exactly what had happened " the ill defined nature of the resolution also muddies up an already cloudy western perception of irans internal power games the seizure of the british and unstinting support for london from most of the international community werent popular among iranians and the n y times suggests the incident hurts mr ahmadinejad in his rivalry with more pragmatist factions in the government for influence with irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei but close observers of iran tell the los angeles times it was the hard line president who probably gained more from the standoff than those who have argued for a more cautious tack in the region especially as iran faces another international confrontation over its nuclear program "iran wanted to make a point that it cannot be bullied and that it plays hardball " vali nasr of the naval postgraduate school tells the l a times "if anything this is a victory for ahmadinejad iran can be reckless flex its muscles and not face consequences " as antiseptic as the outcome was portrayed from seizure to release the incident was clearly part of larger regional power plays revolving around the war next door in iraq both sides insist the release wasnt the result of a secret deal as the guardian reports and president bush flatly declared this week that there "should be no quid pro quos " but questions will likely continue over the timing of a u s military announcement yesterday in iraq that it would let the red cross visit five iranian officials detained there three months ago and suspected of aiding anti american forces maj gen william b caldwell the top u s military spokesman in the country wouldnt say when that visit took place or whether it was connected to the events in iran the washington post reports and as the wall street journal says the incident only seemed to heighten the tension now enveloping the middle east it "deepened unease among arab gulf states about the potential for armed conflict between the u s and iran causing some to distance themselves from washington " the journal says "but events also underscored irans unpredictability to some europeans likely making them more receptive to economic penalties that might help rein in irans nuclear program " new economic epidemiology for the u s the latest bit of worrisome news about the u s economy comes from the often stalwart service sector which recorded the weakest pace of growth in four years as measured by the institute for supply managements survey of the sectors purchasing managers at the same time the isms barometer of costs increased stoking inflation fears as the wall street journal reports those developments renewed talk of stagflation though it should be remembered that growth however much slower is still growth but the increasing evidence of u s economic slowing makes timely a new report from the international monetary fund as journal columnist david wessel points out it has long been held and for good reason that the american role of purchaser in chief for global goods meant that poor economic health in the u s infected economies abroad after all mr wessel notes "the u s accounts for slightly less than a third of global economic output at current exchange rates and about a fifth adjusted for local purchasing power" the u s imports about a fifth of all globally traded goods its trade with emerging markets and poorer countries in recent decades has grown faster than that of japan or the euro zone and "u s financial markets are by far the largest in the world representing of global stock market capitalization and nearly half of all private debt outstanding " but the new imf study called "decoupling the train " and set for inclusion in the imfs upcoming world economic outlook portrays a more complicated relationship than those numbers suggest it says a u s slowdown shouldnt necessarily drag down the rest of the world as long as the u s doesnt fall into a full recession the financial times reports and the study concludes that factors currently slowing the economy "primarily housing and manufacturing" will have a "limited global impact" because they are so specific to the u s according to the ft still theres no question the u s is by far the most important economy world wide the imf notes making a recession there a serious problem for everyone else gonzales crams before giving testimony congress may be out of session but a least one prospective witness at a capitol hill hearing is hard at work bush administration officials tell the washington post that attorney general alberto gonzales "has retreated from public view this week in an intensive effort to save his job spending hours practicing testimony and phoning lawmakers for support in preparation for pivotal appearances in the senate this month " the officials say mr gonzales and his aides are treating the april and april testimony as seriously as a confirmation proceeding and that top political operatives are working with him to plot strategy "the department has scheduled three days of rigorous mock testimony sessions next week and gonzales has placed phone calls to more than a dozen gop lawmakers seeking support " the post reports but his efforts are hindered by legal conflicts that have kept the white house from providing much assistance and prevented mr gonzales and his team from consulting with some of his closes aides said one justice department official "we are hampered because some senior officials are not able to discuss the facts as they know them in the same room for fears of additional accusations of misleading congress " also of note associated press u s agents
