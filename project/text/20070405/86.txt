success itself not money is a begetter of happiness i couldnt agree more with arthur brooks "whats wrong with billionaires " march that money by itself doesnt bring happiness indeed it is success that brings happiness and money is simply an indicator of success we have been too hard on our misunderstood billionaires who are actually driven by a burning desire to successfully create value not to accumulate more money his exhibit a the fact that most of the billionaires on the forbes magazine top earned their own fortunes this is one of the primary reasons that i support a healthy estate tax i do not want to begrudge any american the opportunity to create his or her own wealth if that were to happen if most billionaires were to simply be handed their wealth they would not have the opportunity to create value and to therefore attain happiness and the added bonus of keeping a healthy estate tax is that we allow todays billionaires to do precisely what mr brooks maintains they have the willingness to do give it away in this case they can fund the public systems such as schools and police and public colleges that will enable future generations of americans to attain the kind of success that "spills opportunity and economic abundance onto all of us directly or indirectly " and that of course makes them happy andrea batista schlesinger executive director drum major institute for public policy new york see related letters "letters to the editor please give the government your wealth its for your own good" wsj april
