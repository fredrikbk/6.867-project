can asia control the hot money even some investors endorse cash controls to fight speculators asian finance officials plan to meet in thailand today and high on the agenda doing something about the money pouring into their countries from foreign investors so it doesnt whipsaw their economies on the way back out capital control regulations can be controversial last year when thailand slapped controls on moving foreign investments out of the country thai shares fell a record in one day as overseas investors fled yet many foreign investors are starting to warm to the idea of controls on "hot money" speculative investors who move in and out quickly analysts say limited restrictions help prevent highflying markets from collapsing if foreigners decide to suddenly pull up stakes potentially causing economic damage many countries are "vulnerable to speculators looking for a fast profit and that can stoke inflation and inflate bubbles " says gary kleiman of washington d c emerging markets consulting firm kleiman international "controls to prevent that are a legitimate policy tool " increased restriction would be a step back from the trend of the past decade or so toward more open markets that move toward openness to money from abroad has helped make stock markets in india brazil and russia some of the best performers in the world this weeks meeting of finance and central bank officials from the members of the association of south east asian nations or asean along with representatives from china japan and south korea has already produced an agreement for greater financial cooperation including a plan for pooling foreign reserves that any member could draw on in the event of a currency crisis today in asia they are expected to discuss how to address the speculative money flows that have been rattling many of their markets some u s mutual fund managers say the sort of controls they consider potentially helpful are those that would target hot money but wouldnt necessarily disrupt longer term investors these restrictions cover a range of measures intended to manage speculative investment flows in brazil for instance there is a tax on some transactions of securities sold within days of being bought in india foreigners are restricted from participating in some of the domestic derivative markets while foreign investors in argentina are subject to a day minimum holding period for all debt purchases this new open mindedness toward government regulation can be tied in part to recent outsize gains in many of these markets investors are more likely to be quiescent when they are making money argentinas bond market returned last year while indias and brazils stock indexes advanced and respectively in vietnam where hanoi is grappling with what many analysts say is a stock market bubble that threatens to burst some investors say they would actually welcome state action "youd want the government to prevent a stock market meltdown " says cliff quisenberry who manages the eaton vance structured emerging markets fund and invests in vietnamese stocks "controls may be useful " when thailands shares tanked late last year after the government tried to make it tougher for foreigners to move money out of the country mark headley of matthews international capital management in san francisco says he viewed it as a buying opportunity this despite the fact that he has been burned in the past in he was among the investors whose money got trapped inside malaysia when the government there barred foreigners from repatriating funds amid the asian economic crisis then unfolding today mr headley takes a more benign view of thailands actions he says the new thai government was worried about a strengthening currency hurting thai exporters "and they panicked thats profoundly different from malaysia where they were trying to stick it to foreign investors " thailand later rolled back its restrictions slightly mr headleys attitude represents a change from a decade ago when malaysias controls turned the southeast asian nation into a pariah among foreign investors the motivations for controls today arent the same mr kleiman says "where malaysia tried to keep foreigners from getting out the controls today are aimed at keeping overeager money from coming in " he says "thats a big difference " not to everyone however some say any government interference is bound to create inefficiencies and is doomed to fail "it takes a sure policy making hand to avoid trouble " says stuart schweitzer global markets strategist for jp morgan private bank "markets do a better job " back in he points out several asian governments curbed their banks ability to lend currency an attempt to frustrate speculators betting those currencies would fall but after a brief rise these currencies resumed their declines that eventually forced those governments to abandon their currency controls the pent up pressure sent the currencies tumbling kicking off the asian economic crisis not all investment restrictions are done for the same reason colombia in imposed a one year "residency requirement" that prevented investors from withdrawing their money from the country for months the stated rationale was to prevent hot money flows from causing the colombian peso to appreciate but analysts say it was really a bow to political pressure from exporters who wanted the currency to stay weak the currency appreciated anyway because direct foreign investment in colombian companies continued when the stock market started to tumble last year the government abruptly removed the lockup rule in hopes of luring foreign fund managers back three months after thailands move officials scrapped restrictions on stock investors but controls on currency trading remain some think those controls may actually have helped the country weather more recent market turbulence "like many analysts we were negative on the bank of thailands capital controls " morgan stanley analyst stephen jen wrote in a recent report "however we note that thailand experienced the least volatility in the past two weeks and wonder if the capital control was that bad after all "
