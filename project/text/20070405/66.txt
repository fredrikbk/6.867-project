obamas funding rivals clintons illinois senators big haul presages hot primary race a marathon not a sprint washington whatever aura of inevitability may have surrounded new york sen hillary clinton in her bid for the democratic presidential nomination dissolved with the news that illinois sen barack obama nearly matched her &# million in fund raising in the first quarter furthermore mr obamas &# million likely gives him more money for the nomination fight mrs clintons sum is believed to include a larger share that can only be spent in the general election campaign if she is her partys nominee "with barack over &# million the democrats are in for an amazing race " said jack oliver formerly president bushs campaign finance director both senators have asked deep pocketed donors for &# apiece reflecting the &# limit for both the primary and general election but mrs clinton has been doing so for a longer time mr obama says &# million of his total is primary funding the clinton campaign has declined to provide a breakdown the tally yesterday from mr obama the last of both parties major presidential candidates to provide a january through march fund raising figure also confirmed that the democrats cumulatively have out raised the usually better financed republicans in the race to succeed president bush the disparity roughly &# million for democrats to &# million for republicans was interpreted among strategists in both parties as another sign that democrats are more energized to take back the white house while many republicans are demoralized by the war in iraq and dissatisfied by their field of candidates similarly the crowds at the top democrats events have far exceeded those for the republicans still said mr oliver who hasnt endorsed any republican "the presidential campaign is a marathon not a sprint the gop will have all the resources we need to win the battle of ideas and win the white house in " the first quarter totals also put the campaign on a path to be the most expensive presidential contest by far perhaps the first billion dollar election mr obamas report underscoring his challenge to the democratic front runner mrs clinton follows the earlier eye popping figure from republican mitt romney that shook up his partys nominating contest mr romneys &# million for the first quarter dwarfed the &# million of arizona sen john mccain the onetime front runner even as former new york mayor rudy giuliani has overtaken both men in national polls mr obama used his announcement to underscore his anti washington message "weve exceeded all of our hopes and expectations " he said in an email to supporters yesterday "youve sent an unmistakable message to the political establishment in washington about the power and seriousness of our challenge " said clinton campaign chairman terry mcauliffe "congratulations to him ive said from day one that were going to have to work hard for this nomination no one is going to give her the nomination shes got to earn it " for the first quarter mr mcauliffe added "we still won the war we brought in the most " for the longer term he said both candidates have shown they will have enough money for a primary campaign of unprecedented length with more than nine months still to go until the first vote is cast meanwhile mrs clinton leads mr obama and the rest of the democratic pack in polls by a significant margin the fund raising figures have been provided by the candidates campaigns and provide a much anticipated sign of their viability and support final reports of their first quarter money chase with details about contributors and spending are due april at the federal election commission strategists in both parties who are unaffiliated with any candidate say even more important than the money raised is each campaigns "burn rate" how much theyve spent few of the candidates disclosed their cash on hand democrats said mr obama seems to have capitalized on his message of change his status in the democratic field as the candidate who opposed the iraq war from its start and his history making potential as the first black president "what he did is tremendously impressive " said tad devine a top operative in past presidential campaigns for democrats al gore michael dukakis and walter mondale "thats a huge amount of money raised in a short amount of time from a heck of a lot of people " the obama campaign said its total of at least &# million it is still adding up checks came from individuals "thats a base to build on " mr devine said it is twice the number of contributors that the clinton campaign reported on sunday and compares to about contributors for mr mccain and half that for mr romney unlike mrs clinton whose fund raising network has been built up since her husbands first presidential campaign in mr obama started from scratch he hired julianna smoot who worked on the senate democrats campaign with new york sen charles schumer an effort that raised a record sum for congressional democrats and saw them reclaim the majority in both parties the first quarter results now raise the stakes for candidates in the second quarter mr mccain already has begun an overhaul of his fund raising operation yesterday in an effort to boost his campaign he said he would give three major policy speeches this month on the war economy and domestic policy culminating in a tour to officially announce his candidacy april
