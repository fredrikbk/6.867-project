gas cartel gains traction with alliance set to meet producers to weigh opec like group big hurdles remain western leaders have long had to contend with opec which leveraged control of a large share of world oil trade into geopolitical punch now the west may begin facing a new energy nemesis a potential natural gas cartel the gas exporting countries forum an assembly of of the worlds largest gas producers will meet monday and tuesday in the qatar capital of doha major members such as iran are openly talking of someday creating a version of the organization of petroleum exporting countries for gas an increasingly important energy source and raw material for consumers and companies world wide a group with opecs market swaying might is highly unlikely to emerge anytime soon but the effort to lay the foundation for greater collaboration as the gas trade expands and grows more critical to global energy needs is ringing alarm bells in western capitals the groups long term goals more influence over gas markets and greater political clout over clients in the u s europe and asia face tall hurdles but may be achievable a major aim of the forum is to gain firmer control over the fast growing market for liquefied natural gas or lng said a top negotiator for one of the groups largest producers the world gas business amounts to a patchwork of regional markets because gas is mainly distributed through pipelines confined to individual big markets such as the u s lng a super chilled form of gas that is loaded on tankers has the potential to change the market because it can be shipped around the world making it a truly global commodity like oil but that also makes lng susceptible to price swings prompting producers to start thinking about a cartel the official familiar with the group says the doha meeting will consider establishing a central institution an opec style secretariat of sorts and other technical groups these institutions to be based in doha for now could become the basis for broader and more meaningful agreements among lng exporters as this market expands people familiar with the groups plans said the idea of establishing formal institutions is prompted by a desire to put in place the kind of research opec uses in monitoring markets such as supply and demand modeling that could be the foundation for a true cartel should the forum opt to form one in the future to coordinate such activities gas producers would need a central headquarters with a functioning secretariat such as opec has in vienna doha for now is likely to play that role the urge to get a grip on the market comes as lng goes through a growth spurt global gas consumption was trillion cubic meters in of which only was delivered in the form of lng and by international pipeline shipments according to the bp statistical review an industry reference global lng capacity is expected to rise to billion cubic meters by from billion cubic meters a year in says the international energy agency the trading of lng is fast maturing as well providing a possible opening for a cartel lng has been sold almost entirely in long term contracts between a supplier and a buyer leaving little room for a cartel to meddle as recently as lng had only a negligible spot market where commodities are bought and sold for immediate delivery by of lng was delivered under short term contracts of less than two years according to andy flower an lng consultant in london and former head of bp plcs liquefied natural gas activity that is expected to grow to by vast sums of money are at stake for the producers the gas industry both investor owned energy companies and their resource holding partners is expected to invest more than &# billion in the five years ending on lng facilities and tankers according to the iea a stronger suppliers institution could further a related aim enabling suppliers to stand up to consumers the members of the gas exporting countries forum which include heavyweights russia iran qatar and algeria control of gas output opecs members control about of oil production the forum was formed in and hasnt met since but political and economic changes have provided more impetus for concerted action for russia holder of the largest gas reserves interest in cooperating comes amid a deepening chill with the west and a revival of moscows great power ambitions though the russians have been careful to deny any plans to form a true cartel for iran the forum is another way to cozy up to russia and stand up to u s pressure algeria has been frustrated by what it views as european efforts to block access to key markets another galvanizing issue for the gas exporters europes attempt to introduce more competition in its gas market which had long been ruled by restrictive long term bilateral contracts more competition could lead to lower prices if suppliers duke it out for market share "this is viewed exclusively as a political idea as a way to show strength to the west " said vladimir milov a former russian deputy minister of energy europe whose reliance on russian and north african gas is growing as north sea output declines is taking note european union energy minister andris piebalgs late last month warned gas exporters that if they considered forming a cartel he would push for development of nuclear power and clean coal as alternatives ileana ros lehtinen ranking republican on the houses foreign affairs committee urged secretary of state condoleezza rice in a letter april to "vigorously oppose the establishment of this global extortion racket " the gas exporters face big challenges to forming a group as strong as opec which itself has suffered from internal squabbling russia an oil titan that never joined opec has long courted middle eastern countries like iran but has been unwilling to take steps that would provoke a deeper breach with the west as joining a gas cartel might the gas giants have some conflicting interests a core forum member qatar has a close relationship with the u s and strong ties with exxon mobil corp and other u s companies the forum also faces a threat opec doesnt yet confront the possibility of substitution gas burns more cleanly than other fuels but it can be replaced by other sources such as coal to produce power and heat but opec looked weak at the outset too in opec was set up by venezuela saudi arabia iraq iran and kuwait after standard oil of new jersey the predecessor to exxon unilaterally cut the price it paid for oil it wasnt until the s that the cartel wrested pricing power from the western majors and began setting official selling prices marc champion contributed to this article
