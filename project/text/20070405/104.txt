when photographer and art critic are one jeff wall museum of modern art through may new york to commemorate its jeff wall retrospective the museum of modern art has released two books a catalog of the show which runs through may and a page collection of essays by and interviews with the canadian photographer this is unusual many artists harbor fierce opinions but prefer to let their art or museum curators do the talking for them critical thinking is not ordinarily part of their skill set when moma produced books of essays for its mammoth exhibitions on jackson pollock and jasper johns most of the writing was done by others the statements by each artist amounted to scarcely more than some sketchy aphorisms mr wall grew up in another era and is nothing if not articulate born in he attended school in vancouver and nurtured himself in the s and s on theories about everything from the futility of painting to the insidious nature of the spectacle under capitalism trained as an art historian at the courtauld institute in london he became equally ensorcelled by the writers around the british magazine screen which analyzed films through the prism of psychoanalysis and linguistics sample any of mr walls written or spoken words and its clear that he possesses a formidable and wide ranging analytic mind had he never made a photograph he would have earned a footnote in postmodern art history for his provocative essays on manet on his colleagues dan graham and on kawara and for his insights into some of the challenges of still photography as art his paragraphs may be clotted with neo marxist rhetoric but its a flexible tool in his hands the arguments about the viability of artistic production that have consumed him and others who belonged to minimalist or conceptual schools over the past half century are knotty and mr wall helps to untie them he can also be wry "maybe it is time to think about the death of the death of painting" and graceful "the soft body of the brush the way it constantly changes shape as it is used was the primary means by which the genius of composition was placed at risk at each moment and recovered transcendent in the shimmering surfaces of magical feats of figuration " he seems moved and inspired by the art of the past the same cannot be said for many of his contemporaries when they pick up a pen his standing as a photographer has seemed less firm even if he is among the most collected artists of our day until this show i had suspected mr wall of securing a place in the art establishment by staging pictures that confirm its vague guilt over societal malaises or that knowingly quote from slide libraries of european painting his pictures flatter art critics and graduate students who in deciphering his theories and references feel justified for those years of university study the slow and calculated process by which he produces his work tableaux of contemporary life that he hangs on walls as color transparencies backlit by fluorescent tubes also accedes too readily to the desires of the art market which likes photographers who do more than react and push a button the news media and collectors prefer artists these days who make large photographs as mr wall does by hiring actors to act out a scene and crews to light it the elaborate artifice provides good copy and the labor added value he has created fewer than photographs in his career and the asking price for a new print in a small edition is about &# million it was shrewd of him to adopt an advertising medium large scale transparencies in light boxes are used primarily by companies to entice pedestrians in order to position himself outside the fine art tradition of either painting or photography his images in their metal cages have a sculptural presence and the interior light source as in film projection gives everything a stained glass glow a traditionalist in many ways he has shown little interest in electronic video he employs digital techniques mainly to keep precise and sharp control over every element in the picture moma has selected only photographs but their huge size and self actuating light make the show feel much grander "he wants to confront high art with the sensuality and the pictorialism of mass culture " the dutch curator els barents wrote in the introduction to a interview reprinted in the moma book "and mass culture with the intellectual political and aesthetic traditions of the avant garde " the most successful pieces at moma hold these tensions in a fine equilibrium "a sudden gust of wind after hokusai " from is an enormous feet inches by feet inches revision of a famous japanese woodblock print that depicts a group of strangers blown about on an autumn day here updated to the present with an industrial canal to direct the eye toward the horizon and no mount fuji above it has the detail of realist painting the action and characters of cinema and the captured transitory mood of a photograph there is even an implied political message about the ruination of the earth gravitating toward marginal people and places mr wall adores the nondescript a series of three "diagonal studies" examines a grimy janitors space and tools in medium close up an unnerving view of how incompatible strict modernist principles of composition can be when applied to kitchen sink realism "staining bench" has this same sense of something deeply observed that is seldom even noticed a dark corner turned into art the drips of pollock and cylinders of c&amp eacute zanne are also slyly quoted here in "a view from an apartment" a boy a girl their generic furnishings with the laundry basket in the foreground are artfully arranged to achieve a spontaneity that is riveting because we suspect it to be utterly planned in other instances mr wall is just not up to the job of director like many photographers he is a thwarted filmmaker "dead troops talk " made in and a favorite of susan sontag has its own room at moma an imagined battlefield scene from the afghan soviet wars in which maimed and bloodied soldiers rise from the killing ground and ascend a trail it incorporates some of mr walls worst tendencies academic name dropping this time from french depictions of napoleons retreat from moscow with leaden execution as a parable of horror it never rises above the farcical from the artists own writings and the excellent catalog essay by momas peter galassi co curator along with neil benezra from the san francisco museum of modern art one can learn about mr walls brainy intentions for example the stylized gestures derived from baroque painting that are supposed to announce the self consciousness of the photographer at the press opening mr galassi exclaimed from the podium that "maybe we should just admit that jeff wall is smarter than we are " perhaps happily in recent years he has seemed to unbend a little "overpass " in the last room of the show is a great picture nothing could be more banal than four anonymous travelers their backs to us dragging their luggage on a concrete sidewalk over a roadway all of us have seen or endured that drudgery and yet in its heroic scale and troubled sky the photograph gives this self same ordinariness an emotional weight stooped by their manual labor they are as timeless as millets peasants and as contemporary as the suburban commuter whats more they are likely headed from or to the place where illuminated images like mr walls are common the airport in this work and one or two others now at the marion goodman gallery he achieves an impromptu monumentality that neither history painting nor documentary photography has enjoyed on its own after years of experimentation mr wall may at last be fulfilling the mission that baudelaire urged on all of his th century comp&amp egrave res he is becoming a vital artist of modern life mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
