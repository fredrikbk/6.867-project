why icahn is betting on wcis florida condos amid softening home prices rising foreclosures and turmoil in the mortgage industry billionaire financier carl icahn is making a contrarian bet on a troubled pocket of the u s housing market high end florida condominiums how mr icahn fares with his wager could help answer whether this states housing downturn is a cloud that will soon blow over or a storm that will linger for years the board of wci communities inc a home builder that has erected hundreds of high rise condos along the florida coast could decide today whether to accept mr icahns tender offer of &# a share for the builder that many consider a good barometer for the states priciest real estate that offer which totals about &# million is slightly higher than wcis &# price yesterday in p m new york stock exchange composite trading mr icahns pursuit of wci has puzzled many on wall street who believe the bonita springs fla company is highly exposed to the swelling glut of condos dotting florida beaches and golf courses in the fourth quarter wci which has a market value of about &# million had more defaults on condos and cancellations of typical single family homes which it also builds than it received orders for new homes mr icahn appears to be counting on florida real estate to make a comeback "my investment philosophy generally with exceptions is to buy something when no one wants it " he said yesterday "we made a fairly large investment and took control of several energy companies seven or eight years ago when they were way down housing is somewhat analogous " mr icahn who has put up a slate of nominees for the wci board declines to comment on what if any plans he has for the company in a jan securities and exchange commission filing mr icahn said he beneficially held or million shares in wci and that he intended to contact the company to discuss how to "unlock the inherent value" of its shares his tender offer is conditioned on the wci board pulling its recently enacted poison pill provision intended to ward off hostile takeovers wci declined to comment citing a "quiet period" after the tender offer in an interview before he made his march tender offer he said "on a medium to long term basis there are a lot of factors that will help florida " among them baby boomers reaching retirement age are moving south with prices as high as &# million for some prime units wci condos seem suited to wealthy buyers wci also boasts a large amount of undeveloped land across florida with many parcels located near its current developments some investors believe that land will prove valuable when the florida market recovers mr icahns offer comes at a crucial time for wci and for the florida condo market generally the company is expected to open about condo developments across florida this year many of the units within these developments were sold to investors several years ago as the speculative market roared along now those buyers are choosing whether to close on their units and move in or walk away from hefty deposits or try to resell their condos in a softening market wci buyers put down average deposits of on units with an average sales price of &# million while the speculative overhang of newly constructed single family homes may have peaked in some markets across the country the full force of floridas condo glut is still unfolding because in many cases it has taken two to three years to complete the high rise buildings in miami dade county alone condo units are expected to open this year while an additional units will open in followed by units in says jack mccabe a housing consultant based in deerfield beach fla fewer than condos were built in miami dade between and "its not a pretty picture " mr mccabe says "this stuff was built five years too soon the first real wave of baby boomers will retire in and florida is going to be one of the most vibrant markets but before that we are going to see a lot of people lose money " many investors agree as of march wci was among the most heavily shorted stocks with short interest comprising of its float short sellers bet that a stock price will fall many short investors are betting wci will be hit by a wave of defaults as buyers walk away from their deposits or buyers try to rescind their contracts through lawsuits "you have a dire situation " says credit suisse analyst ivy zelman who has a "sell" rating on wci "there is too much inventory not enough sales and price deflation its the perfect storm " charles may put down a &# deposit on a wci condo in bal harbour near miami in december before he decided to buy the approximately &# million condo he says wci sent a limousine to his house delivering champagne and fancy bathrobes three years later the condo tower isnt finished and mr may expects he will have to resell for a loss mr may is suing the company to get his deposit back claiming the project is behind schedule wci says its default rate or rate of condo buyers who dont close on their unit and walk away from a deposit this year may rise above its historical average of about but it doesnt expect that rate to exceed while on the rise that measurement is much lower than what many other builders are experiencing other builders have higher cancellations in part because they require smaller deposits for single family homes buyers of wci units have been more reluctant to walk away from their bigger deposits a surge in defaults could be especially painful for wci because the company needs cash to pay down its debt wcis debt to capital is roughly compared with an average of among other builders says credit suisses ms zelman to be sure some analysts say wci could limp along collecting as much cash as it can one source is the deposits that the company gets to keep when buyers walk some analysts also believe mr icahn could refinance the companys debt and possibly sell off some of its land mark zilbert a miami real estate agent who runs a web site called the condosupercenter acknowledges the moment of reckoning for floridas high end condo market is approaching "the big question on everyones mind is where will all the buyers come from " he says mr zilbert shares mr icahns bullish long term view noting that resales have been picking up in recently opened condo towers around miami including wcis mosaic tower
