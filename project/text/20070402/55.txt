politics &amp economics history frames iran standoff resentment runs deep over past british hand in oil trade governing the standoff over captured british sailors in iran which is entering a second week with little sign of resolution is being fueled in part by more than a century of troubled history between the two countries as rhetoric escalated and small blasts shook the british embassy in tehran yesterday analysts said irans decision to hold british marines and sailors seized in disputed waters days ago is a message of defiance to the u s as well as to britain and other countries trying to limit irans regional influence and nuclear program concern that the crisis could escalate has driven world oil prices higher tehran says the sailors entered iranian waters illegally and denies any ulterior motives but if tehran is using britain as a proxy for the u s analysts say the country irans conservatives have called the "little satan" is also a target in its own right at various times in the past two centuries britain controlled irans oil production and industry split control of the country with russia and deposed or installed iranian leaders as a result britain still faces a deep rooted reputation for deceit and hostility "the iranian government suffers from a serious hysteria when it comes to relations with the united kingdom " said amir cyrus razzaghi president of ara enterprise a consultancy that serves foreign investors in tehran "historical evidence from the past two centuries has led to a wide belief that britain is constantly conspiring against iran " british officials said yesterday they were exploring potential for dialogue with the iranians after an exchange of diplomatic letters that appeared to leave some room for compromise but rhetoric on all sides is escalating president bush weighed in publicly for the first time on saturday describing irans behavior as "inexcusable " speaking at camp david in maryland where he was meeting the president of brazil mr bush said "iran must give back the hostages theyre innocent " united kingdom prime minister tony blair expressed "disgust" at irans televised broadcast of an apology by a second british captive friday the european union foreign ministers also issued a strong statement friday demanding the sailors return although they stopped short of threatening trade sanctions the eu is irans largest trading partner meanwhile iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad blasted the u k and others for arrogance during a speech in southern iran "instead of apologizing over trespassing by british forces the worlds arrogant powers issue statements and deliver speeches " said mr ahmadinejad according to irna irans official news agency iran has hinted that it could put the sailors on trial it has also complained that british troops fired shots in the air outside the iranian consulate in basra iraq mr ahmadinejads language chimes with a common iranian stereotype of british foreign policy as both arrogant and underhanded analysts say as recently as mr ahmadinejad accused britain of complicity in terrorist bomb attacks that killed five people and injured more than in southern
