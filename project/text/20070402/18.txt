boss talk after the storm at aig ceo sullivan guides insurer past accounting scandal income rises but stock lags after two years of upheaval american international group inc finally seems to be stabilizing in february the giant insurer disclosed it had received subpoenas regarding its accounting a month later maurice r "hank" greenberg the companys legendary leader abruptly stepped down leaving one of his proteges martin sullivan at the helm the silver maned mr sullivan a year old native of england has guided aig through a &# billion settlement with authorities over its accounting as well as the costly hurricane season the company has emerged on what appears to be solid footing judging by a leap in net income for yet investors remain wary aig shares are basically unchanged months after the settlement in an interview at his new york office mr sullivan described how he has tried to preserve the entrepreneurial atmosphere fostered by mr greenberg while tightening oversight excerpts wsj mr greenberg was known as a demanding ceo you have an easy going manner how did people in the organization adjust mr sullivan one of my colleagues defines me as "somebody who allows us to manage but ensures we dont go off the reservation " i worked with mr greenberg for years and clearly during that period of time he could see that we had different management styles but nonetheless i had a very successful career theres different ways of getting the best out of people there are people you have to put your arm around and cajole to get better out of them and there are others you seriously have to kick i have an open style of management i will tell you that people realize when im not pleased though and thats where it has effect because its rare wsj how do you get people to change the things you want them to change and not change the things you dont want them to change mr sullivan it was important for me to make sure that the message was getting out that we shouldnt lose focus on our customers one thing about aig its a reasonably flat management structure so i havent got to tell too many people before it starts cascading through the global franchise wsj was there dissent within aig about the changes to make mr sullivan no i think everybody wanted to maintain the entrepreneurial culture that differentiates aig from the rest but recognizing that we had to employ the best governance and compliance that we possibly could theyre not mutually exclusive what weve done over the last two years is demonstrated quite clearly that we can do it for me to wake up and find the entrepreneurial culture of aig had disappeared after years im not sure id know what to do wsj aig operates in more than countries did you have to travel to these other places mr sullivan initially a lot of my attention was on pine street and a lot of time was spent on that very couch clearly there were things i had to address in new york city and then i sent out a couple of key executives who traveled around the world really just answering employees questions it was really making sure they were getting out there before i could then follow up wsj did you have to persuade people to stay mr sullivan there were different people that were going through different feelings and i addressed them as required and clearly reasonably well i hope im not tempting fate the next guy in here will probably resign certainly people were confused a little bit so there were people that needed some advice some guidance and really mentoring wsj has aig turned the page mr sullivan im not sure and i wouldnt know because im a lifer here but im not sure how many other companies could have actually gone through what aig has gone through and come out of it in the position that aig is at the end of as per our results we had to conduct what many consider the most extensive internal review in corporate america weve gone through two restatements weve enacted what i consider to be and many others consider to be a very high standard of corporate governance weve added seven new directors and weve come out of that at the end of with adjusted net income of &# billion just shy of &# trillion in assets over &# billion in shareholder equity whilst we were tackling the issues that had to be confronted we didnt lose focus on the business wsj where do you see aig going in the coming years will the company look largely the same as it does now mr sullivan building out on the global franchise that we have is clearly a key priority for us there are opportunities for us to add to that footprint our foreign general insurance business we do billions in japan for instance we have market share on the nonlife side so when my colleagues tell me were outperforming the market or were doing better than the economy i say so we should theres of the market we dont have if an m&amp a came across the transom that made sense then obviously we would seriously consider that and then all the time over and above that were dropping little seedlings in around the world thatll grow vietnam for instance which im very excited about we have a life and nonlife business there and i think in years time were going to look back and start thinking about vietnam very similar to the way people were looking at shanghai years ago wsj aigs share price has been trading about where it was when you announced the settlement in february some competitors have done better whats going on with aigs share price mr sullivan the management needs to stay focused on generating the quality of the earnings that we can and hopefully whatever hesitations there are in the stock will dissipate so i think from my perspective just drive the business forward and hopefully you wont have that analysis to make on our share price
