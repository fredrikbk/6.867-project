nike gets back to basics reinventing the t shirt for years a vast army of apparel designers at nike inc has tinkered with the seemingly simple task of making a t shirt the result was a cache of more than different designs often with only tiny differences shirt sleeves that hung an inch or two longer or bottom hems that were curved rather than straight some designs were skin tight others hung loose like sacks for the past year however a design team at nike has been seeking to end the t shirt proliferation the result is a garment that the company says will be a template for its t shirts no matter what color or fabric in the new design each shirt will have sleeves that hit the bicep in the same place a neckline that resists stretching over time and a fit that is consistent even after multiple washings "at some point you had to ask did we really need all these " says trevor edwards vice president of global brand and category management for nike its a question thats been asked a lot lately at the beaverton ore company the new shirt is part of a companywide effort to simplify its product lines and focus on its most popular styles for years the company has flooded stores with thousands of variations on its famous "swoosh" products resulting in a vast array of products that were expensive to manufacture and keep track of and that often confused shoppers the new t shirts along with sleeveless versions shorts and womens capri pants are the first pieces of a collection called "sports essentials" that will likely later include other basics like fleece hoodies and sports bras the suggested retail price for the sports essentials crewneck t shirt is &# the shorts are &# after the collection officially launches today nike will begin evaluating whether to phase out old versions the sports essentials project is part of a fiscal plan for the company to reach &# billion in revenue by a boost of from this year by focusing on fewer high return opportunities it also represents an attitude shift at the worlds biggest sport shoe and apparel company where designers could count on being able to rejigger designs year after year "in the past " says mr edwards "we focused more on the technology than the need of consumers " in fact most of nikes sales come from just a few areas last year of nikes footwear styles accounted for of revenue in apparel of styles drove of total sales in while air jordan and air force are among the best selling sneaker franchises ever other nike products never gained a following and dragged down the companys results with their costs for design development transportation and storage "theyre realizing they dont need to kinds of jordan shoes " says j p morgan analyst robert samuels "theyre really focusing on those things that are selling " nike isnt the only one following the less is more strategy columbia sportswear co recently said its streamlining the number of the styles for its wind breakers and other outdoor apparel says mr samuels nike is also reorganizing to focus on its highest revenue generating categories basketball running soccer sport lifestyle mens training and womens products all six categories are under the nike brand those areas are expected to account for about of nikes revenue this year the emphasis on six areas puts a longtime nike sport like tennis on the corporate backburner its also a departure from nikes longtime practice of scattering its design and marketing muscle across nearly the entire sporting goods world tiger woods however wont have to worry hes part of nike golf which like the jordan brand which centers on hoops legend michael jordan is a separate division of the company nike has gone through shifts in the past for instance many senior nike executives disagreed with the decision to give its jordan brand its own hub of dedicated design and marketing staff in according to people familiar with the move but the maneuver paid off with the jordan brand which sells basketball and nonbasketball sportswear grabbing some of the biggest revenue gains at the company posting &# million in sales a double digit jump from the year earlier a similar move has also worked for nike skate which designs and markets skateboarding shoes albeit with far smaller gains many nike executives feel that focusing on fewer high return areas is a way for the company to connect more deeply with people who are devoted to a specific athletic field such as basketball fanatics soccer kids or yoga lovers the jordan brand and nike skate represent a precursor to this kind of thought for sports essentials nikes apparel group wanted to make the best possible t shirt market it aggressively so consumers would recognize it and be confident that it would always be available "what were looking to do is evolve into a predictable business thats driven by key styles " says roger wyett a longtime nike executive who took the apparel helm in april to do that mr wyetts group obsessed about design details the group decided to use a fabric that combines cotton with a moisture wicking material designers used flatter seams to reduce chafing while moving side seams back to reduce bulk on the sides of the shirt double needle top stitching increased the durability of the neckline which in other designs often gets stretched out the group also tested numerous t shirt prototypes mr wyett says he saw variations on the neckline alone the tops come in core colors about double the typical palette for mr wyett it was a challenge to redesign what many consider an "unglamorous" product "the hardest assignment to do is something as simple as a t shirt " he says
