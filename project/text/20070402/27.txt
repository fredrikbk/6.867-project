golf a special report my son the golfer i couldnt understand why a young person wanted to play an old persons sport when my son samuel picked up a tiny tennis racket at age he swung it with grace later he was good enough to earn a spot on a top ranked belgian club soccer team on a trip to america he hit a home run in one of his first baseball games at camp yet one by one his athletic passions dropped away in tennis tournaments parents screamed on the sidelines samuel tensed and all too often he came off the court in tears he dropped off the elite soccer team too finding it too stressful then he proceeded to turn in a strange direction to golf i couldnt understand why a graceful athletic child would turn to an old persons sport when i was growing up my dads country club didnt let me play the course manufacturers didnt even make clubs small or light enough for kids under besides that the game seemed slow and boring what youngster wanted to emulate a pudgy something pro as sam and i began playing together my apprehensions fell away golf i soon discovered had changed a lot since i was a kid it had become a young persons game as well as an old mans pastime with new standards for athleticism and rigor at the same time it had changed from a cloistered sport into a family activity the greens are often filled with parents and kids playing together ive learned a lot about my son out on the course and weve grown closer thanks to our shared passion these days ive even begun playing with my year old daughter julia and year old son benjamin not surprisingly one man is largely responsible for updating golfs old fogey image tiger woods he broke into the big time in his early s and made golf appear youthful cheerful and athletic nowadays high school players spend just as much time in the weight room getting in shape as they do practicing their drives on the course "tiger made the game cool " says sam now years old here in europe the national federations hold regular junior tournaments in the u s more than top high school players now compete in american junior golf association events for many parents golf is an appealing prospect for their kids its a "good" sport free of drugs and physical injuries ivan lendl the former tennis star was at last years orange bowl junior golf tournament in miami watching two of his teenage girls isabella and marika compete he told me how he began training his daughters to play tennis by the time they were they had dropped out "the physical exertion and training for tennis is just too grueling on the body " said mr lendl perhaps the greatest "grinder" in the history of tennis "look at how all the modern players are getting hurt all the time " golf much more sedate has just enough juice to appeal to youth it also has an individual nature that team sports lack as child after child told me you are playing against yourself you are in control you are not subsumed into a team "i like the idea of challenging myself not competing against anybody else " says sam "i like the calmness of the game its just you and the ball out there " my own history with the game had a much more ambivalent beginning when i was a child in new jersey i dreamed of playing professional tennis my dad played golf with his friends or with my mother but the game was never a passion of mine i managed holes on occasion with my own friends and took only a few lessons after i graduated from college i began to enjoy the game more joining my father and mother when i returned home but i became serious only when sam took it up when he was years old his grandparents bought him his first set of clubs which he used to whack small whiffle balls around the garden soon sam was out on the adult courses swinging away with scaled down golf clubs the turning point came five years ago during a summer at my parents home he took lessons from a golf pro and got hooked when he returned to belgium he wanted to play seriously so we joined a club and began playing on weekends he took more lessons won a few adult club tournaments in the process and qualified for the belgian national competitions just a few weeks ago he shot a and his pro believes he could be a or handicap within a year the game has made a tremendous change in him despite a preference for grunge skateboard outfits he agrees to dress up in conservative polo shirts and slacks to go out on the golf course although he is shy and avoids most adults he agrees to play in tournaments with year old duffers because thats the only way to lower his handicap i was delighted to see my son succeed whenever we played together i rooted for him to beat me and he now does regularly i groaned when he missed a short putt or pushed wide an iron even my golf game steadily improved because i practiced with him my handicap was down to thanks to his encouragement and the fun we had playing together the game also brought together the generations of our family some of our happiest moments are when sam my dad and i can play together some of the most poignant too two years ago on a trip to ireland the three of us my father then my son and i played the famous ballybunion and lahinch links courses for my dad the wonderful experience was bittersweet at least in one way at ballybunions third hole the foot tall sam smashed his drive close to yards farther than my dads "the wee little one can sure hit it " said a course worker who was watching my dad told me about it later with a chuckle and a big smile on his face last year on a trip to scotland it was my turn i whacked a wind aided yard drive that brought a delighted smile to my face then sam now foot teed up he drew the club back farther than i could and whipped it down crack the ball shot off at a lower trajectory than mine climbed a bit and kept going he had hit his drive yards after sams thunderous drive my game collapsed for months i could no longer hit a ball straight every shot seemed short i began to recover only after i accepted that i needed to approach the game differently than my son i began using longer irons and reaching the greens on par fives in three shots while sam comes close to getting there in two and i started thinking about larger matters as sam gets better i see him heading upward with life full of great possibilities and my own life on the downward slope that makes me wonder if i am going to become an insupportable parent who lives through his child i keep saying to myself "dont push for fear of turning him off " sam says he has no intention of becoming a professional though he would like to make a college golf team and he lets me know if i crowd him he dislikes when i try to coach him and has ruled out my caddying for him in tournaments too much pressure he says he wants independence he also hates when i "brag" about him though as he improves and gains confidence he is becoming proud of receiving praise somewhat surprisingly he thinks the idea of this article is "pretty cool " thankfully we still enjoy afternoons out on the course together sam says he feels lucky to share the game with me and on the course my quiet son will unveil his feelings and experiences after we couldnt play our normal sunday round one recent weekend because sam had a tournament he came up to me and said "dad i felt bad leaving you without a game " mr echikson is bureau chief for dow
