politics &amp economics edwards seeks to balance the personal and political heightened attention to wifes illness may be a double edged sword at a town hall meeting in new hampshire tonight democratic presidential candidate john edwards will announce a new policy statement on predatory lending will it get lost in the emotional glare the event marks the first time he has appeared in public with his wife elizabeth since the two stood before cameras on march described her incurable cancer and vowed jointly to press on with the campaign the unusually open disclosure the edwardses made their doctor available to reporters and the subsequent public outpouring of sympathy that included president bush has put an indelible mark on mr edwardss campaign on the one hand his low profile campaign overshadowed by those of democratic front runners hillary clinton and barack obama is getting a much needed lift meanwhile the public parts of the edwards candidacy the policy statements the stump rhetoric and the other trappings of a standard campaign have faded into the background but for his campaign to prevail mr edwards will probably have to move the focus of attention from the personal to the political and that may prove difficult mr edwards has already offered statements on subjects such as universal health care antipoverty initiatives and global warming and tonight television cameras on hand in durham may well record his musings on predatory lending but the headline likely will come from the moment that the couple meets on stage the power of such moments isnt lost on the former senator and vice presidential nominee he recently admonished voters to cast a cold eye on his policies and not to support him out of pity and as he pursues his run mr edwards has doggedly stuck to the issues his policy crammed web site contains scant references to his wifes illness and even as he draws ovations for the mildest comments about elizabeth edwards such as last week when he told a crowd of union members in washington "she says to send you her love" the fundamental bones of his campaign rhetoric have changed very little at that speech mr edwards showed that the guts of his message a populist fusion that relies heavily on worker rights universal health care and "growing the great middle class in this country " matched his rhetoric of a month ago the composite characters he often uses to embellish his speeches such as a working dad with no health insurance and a homemaker whose son was recently killed in iraq continue to pepper his speeches like old friends what has changed is the size of the media scrum that follows him at a recent event in san francisco to tout his new "clean coal" energy policy the edwards campaign counted television camera operators in attendance when in the past there might have been three such attention appears to be having an effect already a time magazine poll taken shortly after the cancer disclosure showed mr edwards gaining six percentage points on his rivals this is generally uncharted territory for a political organization while conventional campaigns generally dish personal information in carefully calibrated doses in this inside out candidacy the most wrenching details of the edwardses private life are on public display indeed even the cancer announcement sparked debate among members of the campaign that continues more or less today it is a question of emphasis more than content how to continue answering questions about mrs edwardss cancer without appearing exploitative according to a campaign official who took part in the discussions questions of probity began almost immediately after mrs edwards was diagnosed the official said the question never involved whether to quit the race but instead focused on how to convey the decision to the public one school of thought held that the decision to continue the campaign should be dispatched through an ordinary press release but the prevailing view was that both reporters and the public needed more context "it seemed important for americans to see john and elizabeth together talking about it " the official said "there was no way any quote on paper could capture it " as the campaign progresses mr edwardss senior staff appears content to let him and his wife calibrate the tone of the campaign and the balance between the public and the personal more on gut than on anything this in itself is somewhat remarkable given the highly choreographed nature of most modern political campaigns "not everything is that calculated you know " says jennifer palmieri a senior campaign adviser "does he have to talk about it he wants to talk about it "
