stock market quarterly review wall street cranks out stocks bonds issuance climbs despite weakness in subprime market despite weakness in the market for risky home loans that spooked some investors wall street underwriters saw another mammoth quarter for issuing new stocks and bonds the first quarter saw &# trillion in total deal volume an rise from a year ago according to data provider thomson financial that made it the second busiest quarter by volume in history after last years fourth quarter in which deal volume came to &# trillion underwriting fees rose from a year ago to &# billion according to thomson and freeman &amp co a new york advisory and consulting firm "its difficult to find anything to complain about when there is so much liquidity and buying power in the market " says david topper co head of equity capital markets for the americas at j p morgan securities a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co the most new securities deals accounting for more than &# billion in volume were in investment grade corporate bonds but growth in that area was marginal from a year ago the most significant volume spike came from emerging market corporate securities which rose to &# billion and convertible bond issuance which climbed to &# billion during the same time frame in mortgage backed securities volume rose from the year earlier period to about &# billion reflecting the continued strong activity that fervor may not last stock investors were shaken in february by mounting defaults and delinquencies among high risk borrowers who received so called subprime mortgage loans the stocks of major securities firms many of which had extended credit to subprime mortgage companies and packaged pools of subprime loans into mortgage backed securities took a beating the broad market also swooned with the dow jones industrial average dropping more than points in one day feb amid subprime worries the index has recovered since then but isnt back to its levels from before the market shock most deal makers say subprime concerns havent infected the rest of the market and the hiccups that occurred during the quarter may have been beneficial one example the widening of credit spreads or the gap between the interest rate on a particular security and the rate on comparable risk free government debt which is viewed as a measure of the securitys risk spreads for several bond classes widened in late february but in recent weeks narrowed back to the levels they were at in early january "many of the investors felt that spreads had gotten to a point where maybe they did not reflect value " says jim merli managing director of the global fixed income syndicate group at lehman brothers holdings inc he believes that the pullback in spreads set the stage for warier investors to re engage in the markets which encouraged a spate of corporate bond issues of the investment grade corporate debt offerings some of the quarters biggest were in the financial sector bank of america corp of charlotte n c raised &# billion last week in january morgan stanley of new york raised &# billion another significant deal was the late february &# billion debt offering of united kingdom mobile phone concern vodafone group plc high yield or junk bond activity was up from the same quarter last year says thomson big volume offerings in that space included the los angeles based spanish media concern univision communications inc s march offering of &# billion and philadelphia food service provider aramark corp s january offering of &# billion heavy convertible bond activity that began during the latter half of last year pressed on during the first quarter underwriting executives say that increase was driven partly by strong activity in corporate mergers and acquisitions which led some companies that had financed combinations with debt to need fresh equity capital afterward "m&amp a driven equity issuance has been important and will continue to be important through the rest of the year " says tyler dickson head of global equity capital markets for citigroup inc of new york "weve seen heavy activity in almost all geographies " a good example of a postdeal equity capital fund raising effort he adds was the &# billion stock and convertible offering from freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc in late march the new orleans mining company raised &# billion in convertible debt and an additional &# billion in stock according to thomson helping to pay down the debt from its &# billion acquisition of phoenix rival phelps dodge corp which was completed march freeport also raised about &# billion of high yield corporate debt march initial public offerings of stock were up compared with last year for total global underwriting citigroup hung on to its dominant spot from last year with volume valued at &# billion and a market share up slightly from its share a year ago according to thomson financial j p morgan was second with &# billion for an share and deutsche bank ag of frankfurt was third with &# billion and a share with &# million according to thomson and freeman j p morgan took in the most in fees citigroup was a close second with &# million and merrill lynch &amp co of new york was a little further behind with &# million strong levels of new stock issuance are likely to persist in the near term say wall street underwriters the deals in the pipeline span a range of sectors but two particular areas to watch could be financial institutions such as hedge funds and private equity funds and technology "we continue to see good participation across virtually all the different sectors " says jeff bunzel head of equity capital markets for the americas at credit suisse a unit of the swiss bank credit suisse group but even with the bounce back in credit spreads and some regained ground in the broad stock market it is unclear how long the run will last some investment bankers are urging potential issuers of stocks and bonds to strike while the irons hot "the volatility creates a greater sense of urgency for the borrowers " says raj dhanda global head of fixed income capital markets at morgan stanley "as issuance windows open and close they pay closer attention than in the past there is greater concern now that the credit cycle has peaked " whos no leading stock and bond underwriters by volume first quarter change in first market share #
