stock market quarterly review abreast of the market investors brace for nd turn surprise selloff volatility spur cautious forecasts for new quarter the stock market took investors on one of its roller coasters in the first quarter leaving them a bit shaky about what is to come few stock market predictions came true blue chip shares again lagged behind small stocks despite expectations that big name stocks would prosper as safer bets in a slow growing economy prospects for an interest rate cut by the federal reserve dimmed the opposite of what many investment professionals foretold and no soothsayer warned investors to beware the end of february when a selloff tested everyones nerves and ended what had been a steady rise since last summer the dow jones industrial average ended the quarter down points or at after some sharp moves up and down the blue chip average plunged points or on feb it has rebounded since hitting a closing low march but remains below its level before the one day selloff though they could be wrong again expectations for the next few months are modest at best with little hope for a significant rally as investors battle fears about the impact of mortgage defaults and the housing downturn on the economy other looming hazards include slowing corporate earnings growth energy prices that have crept higher lately and lingering uncertainty about the feds next move "i dont think the market is going anywhere in the near term " says douglas peta a market strategist at investment management firm j&amp w seligman &amp co "i would be worried if it were that would mean the mood had gotten so upbeat that people were overlooking risks they shouldnt be overlooking " mr peta still expects broad market measures to rise more than by the end of the year but he says the real run toward that target may not begin for another two months mostly because of the murky economic picture uncertainty about the economy left the broad standard &amp poors stock index little changed for the quarter up or points to also after some wild gyrations over the past two months yardsticks tracking riskier companies fared somewhat better the tech stock focused nasdaq composite index ended the quarter up or points at the small stock russell index gained or points to end at analysts say mixed signals about the economy made it tougher for many investors to decide whether to batten down with old big name standbys or plunge into more entrepreneurial companies that do well when the economy is humming along "a movement back to large cap stocks hasnt happened in any major way " said citigroup inc strategist tobias levkovich referring to companies like the dows components that have market capitalizations in the tens of billions of dollars "it hasnt developed the way you would normally expect it to " during uncertain economic times amid the recent contradictions readings of employment and wages have remained surprisingly strong supporting consumer spending but the annual rate of inflation has stayed stubbornly above the level generally regarded as the feds comfort zone for cutting its interest rate targets rate cut hopes dwindleinvestors and professional traders alike have been reassessing their hopes for a fed rate cut which would lower borrowing costs throughout the economy encourage investment and consumption and spur corporate profits in late december futures contracts in chicago indicated that a rate cut by the middle of was a near certainty futures traders now place the likelihood of a fed cut by july at less than "the feds view at this point is similar to wall streets in that they agree the economic picture has gotten worse " says strategist jack caffrey of j p morgan private bank "but its still not clear that they have a basis for shifting their rate policy " fed policy makers have kept their short term target rate at since last june in the weeks ahead analysts say the market will have to deal with good but not great earnings reports for the quarter that just ended probably the slowest growth in more than three years analysts consensus expectations are for a gain of around although data tracker thomson financial predicts that aggregate first quarter earnings at s&amp p companies rose about in the first quarter "actual numbers always come in above expectations " says thomson research director mike thompson noting that corporate executives often try to steer analysts away from high earnings estimates so that any surprises are on the upside "were just not going to get growth this quarter if that happens ill eat my hat " if mr thompsons prediction is right that would snap a record streak of double digit percentage growth every quarter for more than three years an eye on spendingin a recent note to clients mr thompson pointed to another development that may prove to be a mixed blessing for investors capital spending by s&amp p companies has risen sharply up in the fourth quarter of last year compared with the previous year the most recent period for which thomson has complete data by contrast a recent report by the commerce department on purchases of capital goods by businesses in february was below analysts expectations despite the apparent contradiction mr thompson still believes that executives at public companies are spending aggressively confident that the economy isnt headed into recession "the thing is the government data represents a survey of everyone whos hung out a shingle to do business " including small nonpublic companies says mr thompson "but in the s&amp p specifically profits have been so strong the last few years that the companies have clearly become flush with cash and willing to spend it " coming into the first quarter many hoped that low share prices relative to earnings would produce rallies in the s&amp p and dow but while the shanghai composite index has recovered from its feb drop to hit a high the dow s&amp p and nasdaq have yet to return to their pre selloff levels many analysts now interpret the selloff in asia as a catalyst but not the underlying cause of the u s decline the overseas plunge reminded american investors of pitfalls in their local markets such as defaults on subprime mortgages that may spill into other sectors of the economy or lead to a crimp on other forms of credit "you walk into every meeting now and its the first question " says citigroups mr levkovich "we get to oil or other things way down the list " oil prices meanwhile rose in the quarter to &# a barrel fueling concerns about inflation mr levkovich doesnt expect a worst case scenario to play out but some say concerns about the economy could help to build the strength in big name stocks like those in the s&amp p and dow something wall street has been predicting all year
