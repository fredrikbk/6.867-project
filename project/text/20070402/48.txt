msnbc jockeys for attention online campaign is designed to distinguish site in crowded news field its no secret that the web with its ability to disseminate news at the touch of a button has become the go to outlet for breaking news but as competition increases and advertising dollars follow consumers online news sites increasingly are trying to distinguish themselves msnbc com the no ranked news web site behind yahoo news is starting its first branding ad campaign this week instead of selling itself as a "breaking news" destination as it once did the site is trying to highlight the range of news and entertainment it offers spots in print on tv outdoors and online will carry the tagline "a fuller spectrum of news " highlighting both msnbc coms original reporting and its partnerships with news outlets such as nbc newsweek and the washington post msnbc com jointly owned by microsoft and nbc universal is spending &# million on the campaign which runs through june not including the cost of spots on nbc owned networks new york communications firm ss+k designed the campaign the marketing push comes as msnbc coms market position long one of the strongest in the news sector thanks to its microsoft ties shows signs of strain msnbc coms traffic fell in february despite strong growth in the overall news category according to comscore media metrix yahoo news cnn com foxnews com and aol news each posted double digit percentage gains msnbc coms executives say its internal figures backed up by another firm nielsen netratings show that its traffic is increasing they say the campaign isnt a response to traffic patterns but a desire to differentiate the site from other online news hubs even so the campaign shows how online news is maturing when msnbc com began in it aimed to be a destination for breaking news on the web says merrill brown editor of the site for its first six years aside from promotional support on msn and onscreen references on nbc owned networks particularly msnbc the site did little in the way of traditional marketing things have changed the web has become a conventional medium for news almost million people visited online news sites in february up from the year earlier period according to comscore media metrix "for a long time people viewed this as an experiment the experiment in our opinion is over we are mainstream news now " says charlie tillinghast president and publisher of msnbc com but that shift has intensified competition and has made it harder for sites to stand out with advertisers shifting dollars from newspapers and tv to the web most papers and tv networks are pouring resources into their web sites not only do most sites now offer breaking news a variety of other features are standard including video blogs and podcasts as a result customers find it hard to tell one news site from the other according to the american customer satisfaction index a survey of consumer behavior by foresee results and the university of michigans business school msnbc com hopes its marketing campaign will give its brand name a clearer definition for consumers and draw more direct traffic to the site right now msnbc com

loaded as the standard home page on personal computers while cnn com has a smaller audience more come directly to the site of februarys traffic comscore estimates because they are choosing to go to

frequently create material both for the cable network and for the web cnn also has devoted a lot of energy to promoting its site aside from journalists mentioning the web hub on the air cnn has run marketing campaigns for the site with taglines such as "the power of cnn under your command " much of msnbc coms content comes from other outlets but the site also is focusing on increasing original video and reporting for the web msnbc coms editorial staff about people is relocating from new jersey to nbc news headquarters in new york to promote more integration between the two organizations
