the doctors office a family doctor tries harder to diagnose depression online edition the teenager in the cryptic looking black hooded sweatshirt thought his moms concerns about his mood were overblown she didnt his creative writing projects at school were all about death was he the next stephen king waiting to be discovered or a severely depressed guy who didnt realize how much help he needed i fired up the depression screening questionnaire on my laptop and left the room giving him time to fill out the survey he seemed more comfortable left alone answering multiple choice questions non judgmentally offered by the computer than asked by the doctor in a few minutes we had the results of his test they showed he was depressed and indicated that he had considered suicide we talked about his issues i started him on antidepressant medication and referred him for counseling without the computers help i might have written off his odd thought process as just a teenage phase we both are curious to see how treatment of his mood problems will affect his writing primary care physicians treat a lot of depressed patients but they miss a lot of depression too see this study im working to change that in my practice by using my computer to help many general practitioners rely on their intuition and their suspicions to guide them but dont evaluate each patient in a systematic way or use a computer to double check their initial impression i pay about &# a month for medical history taking software i can pull out individual psychiatric surveys that have been researched validated and referenced in journals i dont think them up on my own perceived time pressures may keep other doctors from using them when youre already overworked it can be hard to try a new thing besides why pay &# to do something you already think youre doing well i pay up because i think its especially important for a family doctor in a rural area far from an academic medical center to be in tune with depression without a psychiatrist or a trained counselor in the community the family doctor sees most of the mental health problems there are limited resources for treatment i treat most depressed patients i see myself and refer some many patients dont want to travel miles or so to see a counselor even though i think they should one in five patients i see for medical care has depression and on some days it seems like more other than creating an atmosphere where the patient has enough time to really talk to the doctor we dont do anything to specifically to attract these patients they come from all walks of life the bank manager the stay at home mom and the welfare recipient thats never held a steady job in the seven years ive known her the computer had some interesting findings for a stay at home mom with three kids recently she was taking three medications for a combination of anxiety and adult attention deficit disorder from another doctor without much success the computer indicated she may have bipolar disorder instead i referred her on for a psychiatrists evaluation shell travel an hour from my office to have that done potentially suicidal patients are a particular challenge especially if they are uninsured they must be transported by ambulance to a big city e r to make sure they get there in one piece once at the e r they must have a medical evaluation to see if they are "medically stable " this is often a repeat of the exam that i did in the office mental health intake workers interview them and too often for my comfort they are sent home without seeing a psychiatrist at all now they have an ambulance and e r bill for thousands of dollars and no practical way to follow up with anyone other than me or the county mental health facility miles away last year we volunteered our office as a research site for a three year study of post partum depression funded by the national institutes of health weve identified one suicidal post partum patient in the last year in the course of the research work and found several others in need of treatment finding one severely depressed person that we might not have found otherwise makes the extra effort worth it write to dr benjamin brewer at thedoctorsoffice wsj com
