the china tariffs can practicing protectionism promote free trade that seems to be the strange logic of the bush administration which on friday met congressional pressure to get tough on china with new tariffs on coated paper imports wed have thought the white house had learned the futility of this exercise from its steel tariff fiasco but apparently not the commerce department announced duties ranging from to on high quality paper from china in the name of fighting government subsidies "the china of today is not the china of years ago " secretary carlos gutierrez declared "just as china has evolved so has the range of our tools to make sure americans are treated fairly " u s stocks and the dollar promptly sold off on the news investors understandably worry when the worlds economic leader starts picking trade fights the move came in response to complaints from the u s paper industry but it signals a major shift in trade policy that is certain to invite further protectionist demands for more than two decades the u s has refrained from imposing duties on nonmarket economies because nonmarket economies are directed by the state the logic went its difficult to untangle the extent of "illegal" subsidies to any one company or industry better instead to impose "safeguards" against import surges or look at the end price to the u s consumer to prove "dumping " china is already subject to those protectionist "tools " but now commerce is also claiming that chinas economy has "evolved" enough to treat it like a market economy and thus can be subject to an entirely new set of tariffs other u s industries facing chinese competition are now sure to claim the same subsidy damage we oppose subsidies as much as anyone and its true that chinas economy has advanced in large part by introducing market reforms but its financial system is still a government controlled mess in measuring low interest preferential loans to the chinese paper companies commerce itself says chinese interest rates "are not reliable as benchmarks" because of the "pervasiveness" of government intervention "there is not a functioning market for loans " commerce notes which is also the case treasury secretary hank paulson makes as he lobbies china to reform its financial system the point is that by commerces own admission its difficult if not impossible to determine how much chinas government meddling affects the price of coated paper exports commerce also decries tax incentives and debt forgiveness handed out to paper companies through chinas five year plans but while such industrial policy is grossly inefficient it isnt necessarily illegal under world trade organization rules whats illegal is to give tax breaks to companies explicitly to promote exports which distorts international trade flows in any case the proper place for washington to take its trade complaints is to the wto in february the u s trade representative filed a case against chinese subsidy programs aimed at promoting exports a few weeks later china retracted one of those programs rather than head to a wto arbitration board the u s will not get china to play by global trade rules by acting unilaterally itself meantime in the name of punishing china the bush administration is punishing u s paper consumers who will now have to pay higher prices than their global competitors u s officials concede much of this in private but claim they have to do something to head off even harsher anti china measures now moving through congress any number of protectionist measures have been introduced including a bipartisan bill sponsored by artur davis d alabama and phil english r pennsylvania to allow commerce to apply countervailing duties against nonmarket economies the white house also hopes that a show of "toughness" on trade will make it easier for democrats to support an extension of trade promotion authority that was the same too clever by half logic that caused president bush to impose steel tariffs in mr bush got his trade negotiating power which we think he would have won anyway but the tariffs and subsidy laden farm bill of that same year undermined u s trade credibility and sowed the seeds of failure for the still floundering doha round of global trade talks rather than be appeased by these china tariffs congress big labor and various business interests are far more likely to claim policy vindication and demand more the bush administration is playing with matches and we hope the economy doesnt get burned
