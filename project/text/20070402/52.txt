pension funds may feel little subprime strain conservative picks diversity should keep any contagion at bay pension funds may be sideswiped by woes in subprime mortgages and the broader housing market but they arent likely to be totaled from the crash the funds hungry for high yield in a low interest rate environment have bought up some of the high yield high risk securities backed by such mortgages and some have clearly lost money as the subprime market has deteriorated some pension managers worry is this contagious but many experts believe that pension plans are generally so well diversified and conservatively positioned that it isnt likely they will suffer substantial losses unless the subprime storm begins to take a heavier toll on the broader market "this is a large pool of assets that are professionally managed in highly diversified portfolios and theyre in it for the long term " said keith brainard research director for the national association of state retirement administrators representing retirement systems with combined assets of more than &# trillion "short term events tend not to result in shifts in asset allocations " if public pension funds which have about &# trillion in assets "started reacting to every market event it would be untenable " he said julia coronado senior u s economist at barclays capital inc in new york said the same holds true for private pension funds which have about &# trillion in assets pension funds may be exposed to the risks of the subprime lending market where loans are made to risky borrowers in several ways subprime mortgages have been turned into asset backed securities and sophisticated bonds called collateralized debt obligations some of which were sold to pension funds the funds also may have exposure to such securities through other alternative investments such as hedge funds in addition as lenders have tightened credit the subprime woes have bled into other areas which could affect pension holdings sales of new u s homes declined for the second consecutive month in february and the supply of unsold homes continued to rise any contagion of the subprime issues means that pension funds investments in real estate or home builders could be affected but the conservative stance of most pension funds leaves them well insulated ms coronado said most have the majority of their assets generally just under two thirds invested in indexed or actively managed domestic or international equity funds which arent "out on the edge of risk taking " she said to the extent that the overall market experiences a downturn from builders stocks that will feed through to pensions portfolios ms coronado said she noted however thats "a pretty small portion" of the equity market and that even with the volatility experienced so far this year the broad equity indexes are basically flat through the first quarter the end result could be lower returns this year but pension funds had "phenomenal" returns last year she said some public pension funds may have a tactical asset allocation of to of their assets targeted to more fast moving market events mr brainard said and may be responding to events in the subprime market with that allocation however that is a relatively small portion of a very large pool of assets he said on average public pension funds have about of their assets in fixed income securities and a portion of that is likely to be in high yield bonds he said in addition mr brainard noted public pension funds may have some exposure through hedge funds but he said their total exposure to the subprime market is relatively minimal as for private sector defined benefit plans the federal reserve flow of funds report shows that in all mortgages accounted for &# billion of their &# trillion in investments or less according to the employee benefits research institute thats less than pension funds allocations to real estate through real estate investment trusts direct real estate holdings or asset backed securities also tend to be fairly small relative to the overall portfolio said ms coronado private pension funds hold about of their portfolios on average in real estate which is mostly in equities she said in addition their assets in asset backed securities tend to be the safer government backed securities rather than the risky tranches of cdos she said public pension funds may have a heftier exposure to real estate the largest state pensions have on average about of their portfolios invested in real estate equity the &# billion california public employees retirement fund the nations largest public pension invests most of its assets in equity index funds according to clark mckinley a spokesman for the california public employees retirement system its real estate allocation is about while calpers "could see a hit from the fallout overall it wouldnt be something that would really threaten the fund overall " ms coronado said "it would maybe drag on returns to some extent " as of june calpers held shares of troubled subprime lenders new century financial corp and fremont general corp valued at nearly &# million and more than &# million respectively a fraction portion of the overall portfolio those shares were held in the index fund and the funds external managers "may do some tweaking of their index funds here and there " mr mckinley said the pension fund also has about &# billion in bonds backed by subprime loans however those are in pools of bonds issued by various entities and all are triple a rated the safest to hold mr mckinley said "the mortgage companies could go bankrupt and our bond assets still would be protected " chief investment officer russell read told calpers governing board march that the fund hadnt been materially affected but said there were concerns about contagion "the perf public employees retirement fund has not been affected directly by new century nor has it been affected materially in the problems in the subprime lending market in general " mr read said "although we are concerned about possible contagion effects upon markets such as the high yield bond market all in all we do not believe that overall stock market conditions and bond market conditions are perilous in fact we would view any significant future corrections in these markets as a buying opportunity " about of the funds real estate portfolio is related to housing but the weakness in that market is "not particularly problematic" for the fund mr read said on march he anticipates that the lackluster housing markets will continue throughout much of the year he said "without any further correction in global stock markets we have positioned the portfolio in a relatively neutral posture over the coming months " mr read told the governing board "we anticipate international bonds real estate and private equity will be the leaders over next few months " the new york state teachers retirement system which had &# billion under management at the end of last year held more than two million shares of new century valued at about &# million at that time john cardillo a spokesman for nystrs said in an email that the shares were part of its indexed fund holdings and represented less than of the systems total portfolio nystrs doesnt comment on individual holdings or companies involved in litigation he said peter hapgood founder of public pensions inc a southbridge mass public pensions consulting firm said pensions are unlikely to suffer greatly "they all have a piece of it and they might get dinged like anybody else but that is all in their risk profile "
