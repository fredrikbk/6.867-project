the afternoon report zell takes tribune online edition the grave dancer is doing a jig around the tribune tower sam zell the real estate tycoon with a reputation for gobbling up businesses most other investors wouldnt touch has prevailed in the bidding war for a media colossus tribune which publishes the chicago tribune and the los angeles times and owns the chicago cubs and a fleet of television stations announced that it will go private in a bid from mr zell that values the company at about &# billion as proposed the deal would unfold in two stages that ultimately leaves tribunes employees in control of the companys shares and mr zell ensconced as chairman with a warrant entitling him to acquire of the common stock the deal also includes a small break up fee of &# million which could entice los angeles businessmen ron burkle and eli broad to make a competing bid the pair had aggressively chased tribune offering &# a share earlier this year and then diving in with another bid similar to the one from mr zell last week but tribune said mr zells offer "provides the greatest certainty for achieving the highest value for all shareholders and is in the best interest of investors and employees " the companys shares increased by in morning trading mr zell turned up late to the tribune auction but his arrival helped spice up what had been a sleepy process the company put itself up on the block last summer after grumbling from shareholders the chandler family but even with private equity firms in a feeding frenzy in virtually every sector of the economy tribune lured just a smattering of meager proposals in a first round of bidding the battle between mr zell who is chicago based and the burkle broad camp thus gave tribune the auction it had craved but if the back and forth made for some compelling drama wall street analysts appeared to think the denouement left something to be desired frederick searby of j p morgan said the deal valued tribune at times earnings less than the multiple newspaper publisher mcclatchy paid when it bought rival knight ridder last year a deal that mcclatchy ceo gary pruitt recently bemoaned for its "awful" timing mr searby said that that "may dampen sentiment" on the sector as a whole it may be hard to envision how sentiment toward the newspaper business could get much worse papers have watched their revenues slide as more readers and advertisers stream on to the web and many have been painfully slow to adapt that almost surely played a role in keeping even the most adrenaline addicted investors from flinging themselves into the tribune auction the downturn has also wounded morale in many newsrooms including at the los angeles times and a number of senior editors left that paper over the past year amid some ugly battles with the tribune mothership over job cuts and other cost saving efforts besides the significant tax advantages it provides the company giving tribune employees ownership rights could help ease the turmoil that has bedeviled the media giant but if the plan gives workers a stake in any potential rebound it also exposes them even more to the problems that are stalking the company and the industry workers at least will no longer have any exposure not of the economic sort anyway to the cubs who will be sold after the season which starts today factory data deals leave stocks mixed the institute for supply managements tepid reading on the factory sector and a flurry of corporate dealmaking left markets narrowly mixed in morning trading the dow jones industrial average gained about points to near noon while the nasdaq composite index and the standard &amp poors index were little changed treasury prices were higher flattening the year yield down to about and the dollar was weaker
