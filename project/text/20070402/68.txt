seafood fight u s shrimpers haul cash from lower cost rivals foreign firms fear they must pay up or face new tariffs tarpon springs fla for the better part of three decades john williams made a good living netting shrimp from the gulf of mexico these days he is landing a different catch cash payments from foreign rivals mr williams executive director of the southern shrimp alliance co founded the group in to help american shrimp fishermen fight competition posed by cheap pond raised shrimp from asia and latin america the alliance petitioned the u s government to slap tariffs on shrimp imports from six countries at the end of arguing they were dumping crustaceans in the u s at unfairly low prices but after winning the case which both raised tariffs and eventually netted &# million in compensation for u s shrimpers mr williams and his alliance wanted even more with the help of their new york law firm the shrimpers filed a special appeal with the u s government that threatened the overseas shrimp producers with even higher tariffs the action spooked more than foreign shrimp suppliers into paying millions of dollars to the u s shrimp alliance in return for its promise to drop the action the alliance says it is using the money to help the u s industry recover from a flood of cheap imports the payouts have funded lawyers to spearhead trade actions and pay lobbyists to rally government support for the industry among other priorities "we now have a voice we never had before " mr williams says the practice has sparked a fight over the shrimp alliances winnings as well as concern that u s shrimpers unjustly exploited laws designed to protect domestic businesses from unfair trading practices "we know its unfair but have to play the game " said vuong quang khanh head of international sales for can tho import export seafood joint stock co a vietnamese shrimp exporter that says it paid &# to the shrimp alliance dan ikenson of the cato institute a free market think tank says "theres something unseemly about the domestic industry extorting large sums of money from foreign shrimp producers " for nearly years u s law has protected domestic businesses from aggressively low priced imports current law allows domestic businesses to seek tariffs to mitigate the price advantages of foreign competitors when they ship to the u s at below production costs in order to grab market share more controversial is the byrd amendment which since has enabled the government to funnel antidumping tariffs to u s companies that had complained about low priced imports that law is set to be abolished in october because the world trade organization said it punished exporters twice hitting them with tariffs and then handing over the money to rivals critics fear the shrimp alliances tactics will point the way for other enterprising u s industries to win payments from overseas competitors even after the byrd amendment expires mr williams years old grew up in a north carolina coastal fishing community and moved to florida to work as a boat hand before buying his own vessels in the s domestic industry was thriving with more than american shrimp trawlers plying the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and atlantic ocean from the carolinas down to florida in tarpon springs a long line of boats their outriggers bristling above the waterline tied up along the anclote river which feeds into the gulf of mexico "there was a lot of competition but everyone made money " mr williams recalls changes were afoot farmers in asia and latin america taking advantage of their regions warm climate and cheap land and labor began raising shrimp in ponds carved out of rice paddies or coastal mangroves unlike american shrimpers who spent weeks at a time on open seas the foreign producers raised shrimp larvae in carefully controlled conditions the four month cycle allowed for three harvests a year by the s water filtering and other technological advances enabled some foreign shrimpers to export at prices far below market prices in the u s the volume of imported shrimp in the u s surged between and and prices tumbled by according to data of the u s government and international trade commission today foreign producers provide almost of the shrimp eaten by americans each year as shrimp prices fell mr williams faced a cash crunch and had trouble making debt payments especially on his boats he canceled his medical insurance and turned over his wifes chevy suburban to the dealer because he couldnt make the final year of payments he began looking for ways to fight back in mid at a hotel outside new orleans mr williams and fellow shrimpers convened the first of several strategy sessions bringing together boat operators and processors from eight coastal states across the south the group agreed to lodge a "dumping" complaint that would trigger an investigation by the commerce department and the international trade commission if successful the case would lead to tariffs on shrimp imports under the byrd amendment revenues from the tariffs would go to u s shrimpers and processors the shrimpers which had organized into the southern shrimp alliance selected new york law firm dewey ballantine llp to explore whether a case could be won on dec the firm delivered pages of petitions and supporting documents in two vans to the commerce department and itc the petitions cited imports from brazil china ecuador india thailand and vietnam in february the commerce department imposed tariffs ranging from to more than of the value of shrimp imports from those countries for mr williams and the other shrimpers the decision meant the price advantages of foreign competitors stood to be eroded it also opened the prospect that byrd money would soon flow indeed later in hundreds of shrimpers and processors would divvy up &# million under the byrd law but as unfolded alliance leaders worried shrimp prices were still too low and imports high moreover at the end of congress was moving to repeal the byrd amendment and end the fishermens new source of cash mr williams and other alliance members decided to turn up the heat on foreign competitors the goal was to persuade commerce to raise tariffs or to win additional concessions outside the trade case under u s law any party in a dumping case can seek a commerce department review of tariff levels at the annual anniversary of the imposition of the tariffs such a request can be withdrawn within days ending the government review for u s shrimpers the right to withdraw would serve as critical leverage in negotiations with overseas competitors in february the first anniversary of the shrimp tariffs the alliances lawyers filed a sweeping review request citing some foreign producers and processors the scope caught many foreign producers off guard "ive never seen anything done on this scale thats for sure " says ken pierce a partner at vinson &amp elkins llp who represents shrimp producers in thailand and vietnam that request along with another that the commerce department ultimately rejected added to the uncertainty facing foreign exporters rather than fight many quickly offered to settle with the alliance among the first was charoen pokphand foods pcl a thai agribusiness which in exported &# million in shrimp to the u s mr pierce cp foods lawyer feared the deck was stacked against his clients bradford ward of dewey ballantine says the alliance was not interested only in money the group wanted foreign producers to stop using antibiotics that were banned in the u s in its shrimp ponds it wanted to prevent shrimp from being shipped through third countries or mislabeled in the country of origin in an effort to skirt the u s tariffs mr ward says lawyers for the overseas producers brought up cash settlements first "they approached us and in essence said what would it cost " he says in may cp foods agreed to pay a cash settlement to the alliance in return for its withdrawal of the company from the tariff review request list the company also agreed to address food safety and transshipment concerns cp foods wasnt the first firm to settle but the compromise by such a major player set the stage for others to follow suit can tho import export or caseamex had already seen profit margins shrink on its imports to the u s after getting hit with a tariff in to fend off further tariffs it agreed to pay the shrimp alliance the equivalent of of its u s shrimp sales in the payout was expected to rise to over the next three years the foreign shrimpers admitted no wrongdoing but said they settled with the alliance to eliminate market uncertainties "its very risky doing business in a place where you dont know what the price and the value of the tariff will be " said nguyen hoang phuong a director at vietnams ut xi aquatic products processing corp he said his company paid the alliance because it needed to know how to price u s bound shrimp eventually mr williamss group reached settlements involving cash payments with foreign shrimp companies unlike the byrd money which was divided among individual shrimp producers and processors the settlement payments went to the shrimp alliance the alliance and foreign exporters declined to give dollar figures stephen claeys commerces deputy assistant secretary for antidumping says the department was not party to the settlements "that was purely an agreement between private parties " he says that hasnt stopped free trade advocates from decrying the deals as a tax on the shrimp eating public wally stevens head of the american seafood distributors association which represents u s importers of seafood says the payments amount to "extortion " mr williams bristles at the criticism "we never approached anyone " he says adding "i dont care how you spin it if the foreign shrimp producers hadnt violated trade laws we wouldnt be here today " mr williams says the alliance has used some of the money to pay its legal bill at dewey ballantine the firm charged for its services by the hour and the bill has reached more than &# million sources said and continues to climb the alliance is also paying lobbyists on capitol hill who last year pushed for government funding to assist the industry some money is being used to raise consumer awareness of u s caught shrimp the money is also helping to pay for the alliances office rental and has allowed the group to lower annual membership dues to &# from &# but the same old pressures loom for mr williams and the rest of the industry in tarpon springs only a half dozen boats now regularly tie up along the anclote down from or so three decades ago mr williams says he only puts two of his four boats out on the water at a time given what he expects to make in sales he stopped going out to sea in the mid s to focus on business operations last year mr williams received &# in byrd payments he also gets a &# salary as the alliances executive director still mr williams says he remains saddled with debt carrying more than &# on his credit cards alone "im one of thousands in the same shape" in shrimping communities across the south he says in february on the tariffs second anniversary the shrimp alliance requested the government conduct another broad tariff review but now new shrimper factions want a piece of the action a group representing shrimpers and processors the louisiana shrimp association has filed its own review request the southern shrimp alliance didnt "give us a dime" of the last settlement with foreign producers complains fisherman a j fabre who heads the barataria la based group meanwhile the state of louisiana which had provided early funding to the shrimp alliance has made inquiries about alliances finances and whether the state should receive a share of the money mr williams says no money has been paid to louisiana and that the alliance has explained its handling of the money to state officials a spokeswoman for the louisiana attorney general says the states inquiry is continuing squeezing into a booth in the back of a restaurant on the anclote river near the boat docks mr williams scans the menu and decides against shrimp probably not locally caught he muses ordering a burger instead "were not asking for anything out of the ordinary " he says defending the hardball tactics "were asking for whats fair " thu nguyen contributed to this article
