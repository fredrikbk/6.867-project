golf a special report the masters voice billy payne chairman of the augusta national golf club talks about the past present and future of the tournament billy payne is a bulldog in more ways than one the year old georgia native played football for the university of georgia bulldogs earning all southeastern conference honors in his final year in he also is a bulldog in that once he decides on something he rarely if ever lets go in the winter of mr payne took the lead in atlantas efforts to host the olympic games a quest he describes as a "significant uphill fight " nine years later the centennial olympics long thought destined for athens greece instead took place in athens ga and other venues in the atlanta area now mr payne a lawyer who is a partner in the investment banking firm gleacher partners and chairman and partner at centennial investment properties is the sixth chairman of the augusta national golf club he took over this very private club last may from hootie johnson who became a most reluctant celebrity in for his resistance to a movement for women to become augusta national members there remain no women members five years later as he prepared to oversee this weeks masters tournament his first as augusta nationals chairman mr payne spoke with the wall street journal about the event golfers await each year as a rite of spring and about his club his golf game and the changing game itself here are excerpts the wall street journal is it fair that your predecessor hootie johnson is going to be known forever as the man who wouldnt let women into augusta national mr payne no i dont think so im thinking hes going to be remembered principally as a man who took on the very significant challenges to our wonderful golf course caused by the advances in distance that were a consequence of some advances in technology he took some very bold steps in order to ensure that our course kept its competitive nature notwithstanding the fact that the average driving distance since the founding of our tournament is up some yards wsj can we expect the club to change the way it does business with the world some changes long sought by golfers have happened the entire hole broadcast on sunday and partial internet coverage for instance will you ever consider putting all holes online for say the thursday and friday rounds those of us stuck at work would certainly appreciate it mr payne we believe that one of the mandates of the masters tournament is to expose as many people as possible to this great sport of golf and to do so in an environment that entices them to want to play it to enjoy it and to learn more about it clearly new media specifically the internet has a great future in fulfilling that mandate we also i think as you know move very slowly in most ways this year were going to continue streaming video of amen corner the crucial th th and th holes were expanding our utilization of new media so you can watch it more in your office as you indicated and we will begin that by every day of the four day tournament adding an additional hour of internet coverage on the front end wsj officials at the u s golf association say the worst thing you can do for your golf game is join the staff of the usga you think youre surrounded by great golfers and will get to play all these great courses but that quickly proves not to be the case you were quoted in your olympic days as saying golf is your "singular release in life " you like to play fast often by yourself and at dawn now you have an office a wedge shot away from the first tee of one of the greatest golf courses on the planet so hows your golf game mr payne i think the first part of your sentence was the most accurate in that it is suffering considerably while im here three or four times more often than previously i dont spend most of my time playing golf and so its not too good i shot yesterday though which is better than ive been doing recently so theres some hope wsj one of the changes outside augusta national is technology for a long time it was the ball augusta national threatened to impose a tournament ball something that ohio did for some of its statewide events lately the usga and the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews seem to be focusing on club face grooves do you feel as if youre in some sort of nuclear arms race against the ball and club makers is an augusta ball still a possibility how about augusta clubs mr payne we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the competitiveness of our golf course against the challenges of these great and very talented players and against equipment changes which allow them to hit the ball farther and to spin the ball more as a consequence i think we remain diligent as we measure and look at those kinds of increases and those kinds of challenges to our course but last year as you recall one of the tours longest hitters was the winner phil mickelson and a close second was one of the tours shortest hitters in tim clark so we felt that that was demonstrative that the course was a fair challenge to players of all lengths so we think we got it about right now we are encouraged by the fact that the regulatory governing bodies both the tour and the usga and r&amp a are themselves looking at ways to either diminish the increases in length and or to affect the spin of the ball all of which has an indirect consequence of making folks not want to just hit it as far as they can whether or not it goes into the rough wsj the clubs first chairman was clifford roberts he was to run the day to day operations of the golf course while bobby jones handled the golf if youre the finance guy now who is the golf guy i ask because jack nicklaus hasnt had nice things to say about some of the recent changes to the golf course so who do you go to for advice on golf course changes mr payne i would have to say that in a very broad sense we only have one chairman so that at different times to meet the various challenges we would seek professional advice when and as we thought appropriate from a number of sources but i think in a real sense it would be the chairmans responsibility my responsibility to make those ultimate decisions wsj another change this year is that fred ridley a longtime usga official is setting up the golf course for the first time in the past sunday hole locations have seemed to be in spots where amazing things could happen take the th hole there were two holes in one in and tiger woodss jaw dropping chip in for birdie two years ago when he used the greens ridge as a backboard the usga seems to have different thoughts on how to set up a golf course as viewers can we expect to see the sunday fireworks continue mr payne it would be fair to say that the imprimatur you will see imprinted on the golf course the final sunday and especially on the second nine will be as you have seen it traditionally at augusta we hope the setup will allow those fireworks that you refer to to continue because thats what people want to see i think thats the way the players prefer it as well wsj when you became chairman last year you said that while youd like to keep the field at about competitors you also said it was possible that the automatic invitation that came with winning an event on the pga tour might be reinstated you said that you didnt feel it was fair to change midyear the manner of how invitations were offered after the masters this week will pga tour winners again be automatically invited mr payne we are strongly considering changes where tour winners are once again invited to play the masters we have what we describe as a model competitive field of to and so we continue to tweak and to measure wsj in thinking about change has the makeup of your membership changed in any significant way mr payne i have been chairman for months and as i said in my initial press conference matters of membership will continue to be dealt with amid deliberations of the membership and other than that i dont have anything to say about it wsj finally for people attending the masters one of the traditional delights is to buy a beer for &# and a pimento cheese sandwich for &# will the price of a pimento cheese sandwich change anytime soon mr payne no sir mr carroll is a news editor for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j he can be
