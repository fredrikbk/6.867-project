the daily fix ohio state seeks sweet revenge in title game against florida online edition in the first two installments of a budding rivalry between florida and ohio state this season the gators scored decisive victories tonight the buckeyes have a chance to even things in the mens basketball championship game last december defending champion florida then ranked no in the nation hosted the no buckeyes the gators romped two weeks later the two schools football teams met in the putative national championship game the result another florida romp this time by points now the two giant public universities basketball teams meet in another national championship game whats that you say these are two entirely different sports and the connection is strained the fix was inclined to agree with you until reading the words of ohio state basketball players who are after all classmates and friends of the football players there really is a grudge here thats what cleveland plain dealer columnist bill livingston found out when he asked ohio state stars greg oden and mike conley jr two freshmen who have quickly picked up school spirit "you want to win the game for the football team i have a lot of friends on the football team and i know that hurt them " mr conley told him mr oden added "that really did hurt we were watching that game and it hurts when youre driving down the street and somebody does that gator bait stuff to you that takes the pride out of you so you really dont want to lose " their teammate jamar butler received a text message from a buckeye football player about the game chicago tribune columnist mike downey reports and a former ohio state football player told hoops player ivan harris "its time for you to step up and win for us and get revenge " "this situation is unprecedented " mr downey writes "never before have universities clashed for division i championships in football and basketball in the same school year no duke football team ever put its basketball team in a position like this thats for sure ucla and unlv gridiron guys never did this to a john wooden or jerry tarkanian squad " but this situation may repeat itself with success in one of the two high earning college sports breeding success in the other and the have nots falling further behind "football is the cash cow that feeds everything " paola boivin writes in the arizona republic "ohio state and florida take charter flights to every away game the arizona schools dont the buckeyes and gators stay at nice hotels with pillow mints the night before home games the sun devils dont and the wildcats do only occasionally although those perks dont make the sole difference between wins and losses they help coaches drop that information while recruiting the odds of being rested for a game after a charter flight or hotel stay are better than a two connection trip or a dorm room " espn coms pat forde agrees with the megaprogram thesis and suggests five other schools that could make a run at national titles in other sports something accomplished by just seven schools including just one private university syracuse and both of tonights contestants florida advanced to the title game saturday by beating ucla in a rematch of last years championship game rout that was no closer despite the deceptively close final score of floridas four star sophomores famously returned for a junior year attempt at another championship in what columnists are calling a victory for the college experience "with each passing conquest these s are reminding us suitemates can prosper without jealousy or resentment that its ok for college guys to play with stuffed animals and that there are still some young athletes willing to put the collective good ahead of immediate gratification " mike berardino writes in the south florida sun sentinel hartford courant columnist jeff jacobs adds "deep down we know the four junior roommates represent everything we would want for ourselves and our children from the college experience " one of them joakim noah is participating in that traditional college activity of making political pronouncements heres sportslines dennis dodd on the polarizing gators star messrs oden and conley of ohio state are comparative neophytes but after their defeat of georgetown in the other saturday semifinal the two rookies and high school teammates have a championship streak of their own to preserve they last lost in a tournament four years ago as freshman at lawrence north in indianapolis "counting the traditional school season youth leagues and the current college season the two have played about games together " jeff rabjohns writes in the indianapolis star "theyve lost five during the summer travel season six at lawrence north and two at ohio state " birmingham news columnist kevin scarbinsky checks in with uabs robert vaden one of the stars on the last team to oust the freshman duo from the tournament hes rooting for the buckeyes tonight for ucla the loss to florida was a painful reminder that the bruins lack championship level offensive firepower bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "the bruins definitely need to alter a philosophy that creates the playmakers who can carry them on only one end of the court with all those great defensive stars eligible to return next season could be a balanced blast " the washington posts thomas boswell sees similar hope for georgetown next season the hoyas defeat reminds him of marylands final four loss in the terrapins won the national championship the next season "they call this clambake march madness for a reason one the hoyas may now grasp " mr boswell writes "sometimes you have to experience it once and be its victim before you can return keep your sanity and claim the prize " tennessee and rutgers will meet in the womens championship game on tuesday after both advanced in the semifinals sunday night rutgers is the big surprise a no seed that enters the title game on a major roll after upsetting top ranked duke in the sweet sixteen the scarlet knights won their next two games by a combined points including a rout of lsu last night "after plus years bad karma maybe this is just the year of the knight " steve politi writes in the newark star ledger "first the football team emerges as a top team shocking unbeaten louisville and winning a bowl game for the first time in its history and now the rutgers women are on the verge of what could be the biggest moment in the history of the athletic program at least since a few hard nosed students beat princeton in that football game " but unlike the aforementioned profitable mens basketball programs there is little synergy between football and womens basketball at rutgers as the records john rowe points out the hoops program lost &# million this season playing before an average of just fans that will create a tough decision about whether to re sign respected coach c vivian stringer meanwhile it is certainly not the year of the lsu tiger "the lady tigers are for final fours the results from four consecutive appearances becoming progressively worse the efforts becoming increasingly more futile the experiences becoming alarmingly more unsatisfying " john deshazier writes in the new orleans times picayune sec rival tennessee also has struggled in recent final fours leaving its last five without a championship the lady vols almost exited on a futile note for a sixth straight time before coming back late to beat north carolina last night espn coms mechelle voepel breaks down the eight minute turnaround welcome back baseball in a rematch of last seasons nlcs the new york mets exacted an infinitesimal measure of revenge by beating last years champs the st louis cardinals it was tom glavines st career win and it came in typical fashion "glavine blows people away without knocking them down a whispering wind felling sequoias " jeff passan writes on yahoo sports mr passan cites a changeup that struck out preston wilson "glavine could stand on the mound shout that hes throwing his changeup aim for his favorite spot outside corner and low like leo mazzone taught him and get the same result he did from wilson a swing and a miss followed by a second of stillness like man howd he do that again " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to
