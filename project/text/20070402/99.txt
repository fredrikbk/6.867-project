wall street firms vie to expand trading floors goldman sets off race for space that adds to office market frenzy theres a new force driving the frenzy in the new york office property market trading floor envy goldman sachs group inc widely viewed as a pacesetter by the citys financial institutions is building a gleaming new building in lower manhattan that will feature six gigantic state of the art trading floors that project has set off an arms race of sorts among wall street investment banks who are scouring the city in hopes of building or leasing new facilities equipped with all the latest technological bells and whistles the office space race underscores how firmly new york has retained and even strengthened its standing as the nations financial capital in the past years after the sept terrorist attacks many city officials feared that wall street employers would flee to the suburbs instead many have stayed and thrived boosting the citys economy and helping sustain its pricey housing market as they hired tens of thousands of employees partly as a result manhattans vibrant market for office space is as tight as it has been in years with vacancy rates of about at the end of according to reis inc a real estate research firm at the same time the recent boom in debt and equity markets has made trading a more profitable business for wall street investment banks and has spurred them to hire more traders the banks are also feeling pressure to put their stock bond and derivatives traders in a centralized location to make it easier to cater to clients who increasingly want one stop shopping for their financial services that has created the need for vast hangar size trading floors on todays trading floors hundreds of traders are typically packed closely together to make it easier for them to communicate with one another as they assemble and execute trades of stocks bonds or other securities each trader may have several computer screens showing prices charts news and other market data these phalanxes of computers require an abundance of electrical power as well as backup power sources and raised floors which provide access to the space beneath are the preferred way to accommodate all the wiring the machines also generate lots of heat posing a challenge to even the most sophisticated climate control systems ceilings generally are required to be high in part to damp the din of dozens of phone conversations punctuated at times by "squawk box" announcements of news research calls details about large orders or expressions of interest in specific securities though still noisy the advent of email and instant messaging has made trading rooms somewhat quieter than they were or years ago when more information was communicated by shouting the current space race isnt solely about envy some of it is driven by real need leases are up at some firms and others have maxed out capacity at their existing locations one real estate broker characterizes the current frenzy as need and "looking over their shoulder " whats clear is there arent too many places in the city big enough to house trading floors the size being built by goldman nonetheless some of the biggest investment firms are in the hunt lehman brothers holdings inc only five years after moving into a new building near times square is considering a deal with vornado realty trust to build a headquarters and trading floors at the current site of the hotel pennsylvania on seventh avenue the center of a massive planned midtown redevelopment involving the pennsylvania station commuter hub and madison square garden lehman has declined to comment merrill lynch &amp co working with year old trading floors is the most serious about finding new space because its current lease expires in it also is eyeing the hotel pennsylvania site as well as the new world trade center area now under construction but merrill is said to be leaning toward staying at its current home also in lower manhattan in the world financial center where its landlord brookfield properties would build new trading floor space merrill will say only that it is exploring all options j p morgan chase &amp co will keep its headquarters in midtown manhattan but is in discussions with the port authority of new york and new jersey to build additional offices and trading floors at world trade center tower the former deutsche bank building the proposed skyscraper cant be built until the current building which was heavily damaged in the sept attacks is demolished j p morgans talks with the port authority are progressing but not a done deal says one person close to the situation morgan stanley has talked with several landlords about spaces large enough for improved trading facilities though its plans are unclear a spokesman for morgan stanley declined to comment some of the maneuvering for space is driven by the need to remain competitive with goldman a lucrative partnership and the worlds no merger advisory firm the firm which is both widely loathed and admired by its competitors was the first to make a big push into trading with its own money rather than just that of its clients a strategy that has been avidly copied by other big brokerage firms more recently goldman has become a leader on wall street in private equity investing in which it uses large sums of its own money along with other funds to buy public companies and take them private with an eye toward improving their efficiency and selling them at a profit other firms are also making big bets in this area but their clout has yet to rival goldmans goldmans new facility to be located at west and vesey streets in battery park city near the hudson river will house six trading floors of square feet each with room for more than traders on each floor the optimum for a modern trading floor is now considered to be at least square feet free of any supporting columns says robert alexander chairman of the new york region of cb richard ellis a real estate services firm that would dwarf even some of the newer spaces in late bear stearns cos a firm long known for its trading prowess began using a new headquarters tower near grand central terminal where the trading floors measure just square feet of course theres plenty of space in the suburbs but brokers say the young men and women who make up their trading ranks generally prefer to live and work in the city some of goldmans own traders balked several years ago at a plan to have them work in a huge new story building new jerseys tallest across the hudson river from manhattan in jersey city the quest for trading space may kick up some political tensions as well other investment banks on the prowl may seek to match the nearly half billion dollars in government subsidies that goldman received in the wake of sept for keeping its headquarters in manhattan but mayor michael bloomberg seems less inclined to play ball now that the real estate market has rebounded and construction at ground zero is no longer mired in uncertainty the banks "should not expect a deal of similar scale from the city that was a product of a unique moment in time " says daniel doctoroff new yorks deputy mayor for economic development "goldman was a unique situation in that it was at a precarious time in lower manhattan before we helped resolve the situation at the trade center " a deal struck last year between the sites owner the port authority and private developer larry silverstein created a viable financial plan for rebuilding after nearly five years of bickering mr bloombergs tough stance against further subsidies likely will enhance the negotiating power of the few landlords with large lots in the city one of these is mr silverstein who fought government agencies to maintain his lucrative role at the world trade center site and now is building three new towers two with trading floors at ground zero he has the advantage of timing construction will start within the next year and his costs are subsidized through insurance proceeds from the terrorist attacks yet even the new world trade center towers wont have trading floors the size of goldmans both tower and tower as they are known will have at least four floors reserved for trading but none larger than square feet potential tenants also remain wary of the politics and construction delays that have plagued the site until recently securities firms and banks once clustered in lower manhattan to be near the new york stock exchange and the federal reserve when they still relied on paper and "runners" to move records with the advent of computers and electronic trade processing many firms moved to midtown to get closer to clients at corporate offices fine dining theater and museums the landscape was reshaped again after the terrorist attacks which heavily damaged the downtown headquarters of lehman brothers and destroyed the main new york brokerage offices of morgan stanley in the world trade center the investment firms that already are in manhattans midtown area closer to the commuter hubs of penn station and grand central terminal would probably prefer to stay there brokers say "when you hire in the thousands it does matter if you have good subway and train access " says peter riguardi president of the new york office of real estate services firm jones lang lasalle inc but finding large lots in midtown where real estate is the scarcest and priciest in the city is a major problem "in this market in new york city especially in midtown you cant find the perfect space you have to be creative " says doug harmon an investment broker with eastdil secured a real estate investment banking company the hunger for space has been building for several years in morgan stanley completed a large building in times square near its headquarters that would give it space for traders between the two buildings but when lehmans operations were badly damaged in the sept attacks it bought the new building from morgan stanley and turned it into a new headquarters already out of room lehman recently took a large block of space at one building on avenue of the americas is negotiating for lease space at another and is contemplating an entirely new headquarters perhaps as large as million square feet say sources close to the discussions meanwhile after sept morgan stanley acquired an office complex in suburban westchester county to spread out its operations after its main new york brokerage operations were destroyed in the terrorist attacks now it is also facing space problems having once sold prime trading space to rival lehman morgan stanley has recently signed two big leases in midtown and is still looking for more space to meet its trading needs say people close to the search wall streets space race nonetheless hardly seems likely to make or break the industrys titans "as each competitor increases their advantage in recruiting or in efficiency the people left behind feel like they have to catch up " says david arena president of the new york office of grubb &amp ellis a real estate services firm "these guys are doing fine none of them is going out of business because they dont have enough space " adds mr arena robin sidel and kate kelly contributed to this article
