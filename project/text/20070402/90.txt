theory &amp practice does it pay to tell investors extra compensation details many u s corporate directors are grumbling about complex new federal rules requiring more disclosure of executive pay perquisites and retirement benefits yet a surprising number of major corporations are going beyond the requirements offering investors additional details about compensation in the name of improved transparency nearly of proxy statements filed so far this year contain supplemental pay information estimates mark borges a principal at mercer human resource consulting el paso corp intel corp corning inc emc corp and pfizer inc are among those disclosing more than the securities and exchange commission requires the most common extra details alternate summary compensation tables that typically include the initial value of equity grants numerical performance targets and potential conflicts of interest involving boards pay consultants though such moves are aimed at staving off investor complaints stemming from the secs confusing proxy rules they could backfire by sowing suspicion enhanced disclosures "may not ward off public criticism about excessive ceo pay " warns connecticut treasurer denise nappier who oversees a &# billion public employee pension fund that is the case at el paso the houston natural gas producer and pipeline concern offers investors a one page profile for each top officer featuring a photo a biography the initial value of equity grants and related pay highlights chief executive douglas l foshee wanted "to be as transparent as possible " explains bruce connery a vice president "its meant to supplement not take the place of whats required in the proxy " lucian bebchuk a harvard law professor and el paso investor who has clashed with the board isnt impressed he says the profiles dont comply with the sec rules leaving out for instance total compensation and are more prominently placed than they should be last year mr bebchuk sought to revise el pasos corporate bylaws to require more disclosure about executive pensions his proposed amendment received nearly of the votes cast mr connery says the vote didnt prompt this years additional disclosures other businesses are exceeding the requirements by disclosing specific performance targets such as increasing revenue by or recording earnings of &# a share for executive bonuses or equity grants the sec allows companies to conceal such targets for competitive reasons and nearly half of big companies didnt disclose them according to an analysis of proxies by consultants watson wyatt worldwide emc discloses some but not all of its targets the hopkinton mass technology company says top officers earned their targeted bonuses because emc achieved its earnings goal of cents a share excluding expenses for stock options for targeted bonuses emc must increase per share earnings by increase revenue by a set amount and boost free cash flow but emc doesnt disclose the specific targets for executives to make money from restricted shares tied to performance hurdles the proxy says only that the shares will start to vest in if emc reaches "a threshold cumulative eps goal" between and without revealing the goal michael mccauley corporate governance director for floridas state board of administration applauds the specific disclosure about bonus targets but he says that omitting the targets for the restricted shares means shareholders dont understand "what performance is being incentivized " the florida board manages about &# billion of public employee pension assets and owns about million emc shares divulging the earnings target for the restricted shares would go beyond what emc has told investors and might cause "competitive harm " says michael gallant an emc spokesman the role played by board pay advisers represents another way that some companies are going the extra distance in october ms nappier and officials of other large pension funds wrote big businesses seeking information about whether compensation consultants hired by directors had conflicts of interest activists fear a consulting firm wont give the board impartial advice about pay if the firm also advises management the new disclosure rules dont address such conflicts most of the recipients including pfizer agreed to disclose any additional work that the consultants do for the company pfizers latest proxy goes further it reveals that frederic w cook &amp co was paid &# for advising its boards compensation committee last year the proxy also says cook provided only one other item for the giant drug maker an executive compensation survey that cost less than &# pfizers proxy contained a similar description of that annual survey the companys latest proxy exceeds the sec rules in other ways such as specifying the value of equity grants made so far in and executives target bonuses for this year pfizer did "a very good job on disclosure" this year says richard ferlauto director of pension investment policy for the american federation of state county and municipal employees mr ferlauto was among the activists who last year criticized the compensation package for then chief executive henry "hank" mckinnell ironically the activists took advantage of pfizers voluntary proxy disclosure that he could have pocketed a lump sum of &#
