truckin with jimmy hoffa speaking of protectionism another bad economic omen is the way senate democrats are blocking access to the u s for mexican long haul trucks the truck opening was part of nafta and was supposed to be completed seven years ago in february the transportation department finally announced a plan to grant mexican companies permission to exceed the current mile limit on the u s side of the border for a one year period thus delivering their cargo to its final destination across america that would be good for u s consumers and productivity because distribution would immediately be more efficient it would also show that the u s keeps its treaty commitments but if mexican truckers dont have to hand their cargo to an american truck and driver it would also mean real competition for u s truckers thats anathema to the teamsters union which tapped democrats byron dorgan north dakota dianne feinstein california and patty murray washington to do its bidding by sponsoring an amendment to delay the proposal and attaching it to the iraq and afghanistan war supplemental spending bill the senators cite safety concerns but the mexican long haul truck record is as good as americas and the pilot project is a chance to see how it works teamsters chief jimmy hoffa was more honest when he crowed about his senate victory "the teamsters union has successfully led the battle to keep our border closed for the past years and we will not let up in our fight as this measure moves through congress " as mr hoffa admits democratic talk about "labor rights" is often nothing more than a front for union monopoly
