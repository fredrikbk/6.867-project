world war i veterans were killed in storm victims of neglect they were troubled souls misfits roughnecks and roustabouts many of them psychologically damaged and alcoholic they were world war i veterans who couldnt find their place in american society in in the depths of the depression the federal government shipped hundreds of them to isolated work camps in florida out of sight and thus out of the newspapers but the government inadvertently had sentenced many of these men who had survived artillery shells sniper fire and poison gas to death in the florida keys the story of how some world war i veterans were killed by the labor day hurricane of is also a sorry tale of bureaucratic arrogance and bumbling part of a long and continuing series of controversies surrounding the treatment of soldiers by washington once their duty is done in this case the chain of responsibility for what ernest hemingway described as "manslaughter" began in franklin roosevelts white house and extended to the florida statehouse the national weather bureau and administrators of the three island work camps the veterans jobs as part of a government relief program were to help build an overseas highway that would connect the keys to the mainland they were paid &# a day plus food and housing flimsy shacks and tents without plumbing or electricity and they were a handful of trouble on payday many were accused of drinking too much swearing in public picking fights and then passing out time magazine called the work camps "playgrounds for derelicts " but for most of the veterans who ended up in keys work camps there was little choice "the intense prolonged strain of combat had permanently altered their perception of the world and their place in it " wrote willie drye in "storm of the century " some had been camped out in washington d c as part of the so called bonus armys protest over delayed payments and were driven out in "they got through the war all right " julius stone a director of floridas emergency relief administration told congress "but peace was too much for them " the weather bureau knew a storm was brewing on aug but its crude instruments and poor communication made the predictions confusing the government was supposed to have a plan for evacuating the vets but it had never been tried and officials were reluctant to order an evacuation until they were sure the storm would hit the keys no one knew who was in charge federal or state officials the florida east coast railway was supposed to have a train ready to evacuate the vets at a moments notice but it took hours to get one moving out of miami before the train reached the vets it was swept off the tracks by one of the most powerful hurricanes in u s history in the camps the mens shelters were blown away as were most other buildings those who survived the flying debris were washed into the ocean by a massive tidal surge many bodies were never recovered more than permanent residents of the keys also were killed within a week the federal and state governments and the american legion had launched separate investigations the finger pointing began many people wanted to fix the blame on the weather bureau for its vague forecasts but why hadnt camp officials who had been told by some longtime keys residents that the men were in danger ordered a train earlier why had the director of floridas work camps taken a two hour lunch on labor day during which he couldnt be reached whose idea was it to put jerry built camps in low lying areas during hurricane season harry hopkins director of the works progress administration immediately sent a team to the keys "washington bureaucrats may be mixing a viscous vat of whitewash " commented a miami newspaper as one of the investigators john j abt later wrote "we were on a political mission to defend the administration against charges of negligence the investigation took all of a day " the report based on interviews with people ended "to our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an act of god and was by its very nature beyond the power of man to permit the taking of adequate precautions " investigators from the american legion came to a different conclusion the vets died because of the "inefficiency indifference and ignorance" of camp administrators they said congressional hearings in headed by john rankin a democrat loyal to president roosevelt were a charade over a period of six weeks only carefully selected testimony and facts were admitted to the record all supporting the contention that everyone in charge of the veterans had been blindsided by nature "it just happened that is all " aubrey williams an assistant to mr hopkins testified to congress "it would be a gross miscarriage of justice to say anybody had failed " but the surviving veterans werent so sure one of them justus schadt told a veterans administration investigator "we thought we were working for the government and the government aint going to let us be blown to pieces " email me at cynthia crossen wsj com see my books column readback every other week on wsj com
