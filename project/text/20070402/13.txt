crisis sparks oil supply fear u k iran standoff has traders pricing in risks of a disruption as the standoff over irans capture of british sailors drags on oil traders are thinking more about one of the top nightmares for western governments an obstruction of oil traffic through the persian gulf under the scenario iran in a bid to pre empt or respond to u s military action closes the strait of hormuz the persian gulf chokepoint through which of the worlds oil supply passes the consequence would be swift by most experts reckoning oil prices which ended the week just below &# a barrel would soar to &# and even higher potentially plunging the world economy into a depression the scenario may sound extreme but as the crisis over irans seizure of british sailors and marines enters a second week fear of a major persian gulf oil supply disruption is high on traders minds and is likely to remain a force supporting oil prices in the week since iran captured the sailors crude oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange climbed nearly as traders priced in the increased risk of a disruption "i dont know if anyone really believes there will be a supply disruption " said tom bentz an analyst at bnp paribas futures in new york "but the uncertainty is there that something could happen so it makes it very difficult to get too comfortable in either direction but the bigger risks still seem to be on the upside " the u k iran standoff comes as the u s is increasingly concerned about the islamic republic because of irans role in iraq and its nuclear ambitions the u s which recently sent a second aircraft carrier to the persian gulf launched war games further heightening tensions in this environment the question of why iran would choose to target forces from the u s s closest military ally has become a subject of debate while iran claims the british sailors were illegally in its waters analysts see the seizure as a show of force by tehran or even a calculated move to draw the western allies into a limited conflict "the iranians are playing a very very dangerous game " said bill callahan president of unitel a maritime security firm in new york "its now a question of who is going to blink first if this thing were to blow up over an incident everything will be affected " michael ohanlon a senior fellow at brookings institute said the likelihood of iran blocking traffic through the strait is "very low almost zero" at the moment still some fear that an aggressive move by the u s could lead iran to block the oil rich strait of hormuz while iranian officials say they have no such intention last year irans supreme leader ayathollah ali khamenei warned that "if the americans make a wrong move toward iran the shipment of energy will definitely face danger and the americans would not be able to protect energy supply in the region " with its mine warfare and shore and ship based antimissile capability iran does have the potential to disrupt shipping in the gulf by laying mines in shipping lanes through the hormuz having engaged in "tanker wars" during the s iran iraq war it has the experience too "they have an impressive naval guerrilla warfare capability " said mike eisenstadt a military and security expert at the washington institute for the near east a conservative leaning think tank "if the u s were not there they could probably close the strait of hormuz should they desire " but with two aircraft carrier groups in the gulf the u s has amassed its largest naval force in the region since the start of the iraq invasion the u s navy said its mission is to provide maritime security in the gulf and described the presence of the carriers as a warning to "any country not to miscalculate our resolve to help provide security and stability in the region " "what the u s has in the gulf is far superior than what the iranian navy has " said houshang arianpour a retired vice admiral in the iranian navy who is based in mclean va "therefore i see no future for the iranian navy if they fight " iran has far more to fear than the loss of its relatively small navy in the event of a disruption in persian gulf shipments the inability to export its own oil although iranian officials have said that the west stands to lose more than iran in any confrontation analysts believe a stoppage in million barrels a day of iranian oil exports could prove just as damaging to the struggling iranian economy iran has said it will attempt to block the strait of hormuz only in the event of an international embargo on the countrys exports through the gulf mr eisenstadt noted
