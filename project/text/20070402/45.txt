more strategies and tactics are proposed in the battle against microbes we applaud the attention henry masur and the infectious disease society of america have brought to the critical issue of antibiotic resistance "the microbial threat " opinion march he is correct that limiting use of antibiotics has the side effect of reducing the incentive of pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics but incentives to develop new antibiotics also have a side effect discouraging useful demand side policies specifically reducing hospitals incentives to use infection control practices such as hand washing and isolating patients with resistant infections dr masur illustrates the direct toll that antibiotic resistance has on patients with bacterial infections just as important however is the effect it has on patients with cancer hiv and kidney failure who are especially vulnerable to bacterial infections without effective antibiotics these treatments are much more dangerous the most important reason to control resistance to antibiotics is to ensure that other medical treatments have a chance to cure patients in a report titled "extending the cure policy options to respond to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance " also released march www extendingthecure org we present a host of policy proposals directed at both supply and demand for antibiotics to curb the growing threat from antibiotic resistance the report benefited greatly from consultation with the idsa anup malani professor of law university of chicago ramanan laxminarayan senior fellow resources for the future washington dr masurs call in "the microbial threat " for new antibiotics to counter the alarming rise in drug resistant bacteria in our hospitals is important but the first line of defense against these "superbugs" is rigorous hygiene practiced day after day drug resistant bacteria will not make patients sick if they never get inside the patients bodies these superbugs are transmitted from patient to patient on dirty hands unclean equipment and contaminated uniforms two decades ago holland denmark and finland faced similarly soaring rates of drug resistance and brought those rates down below how rigorous hand hygiene practices meticulous cleaning of equipment and rooms in between patient use identifying the patients carrying drug resistant bacteria and taking the isolation precautions needed to prevent these bacteria from spreading to other patients on gloves uniforms stethoscopes wheelchairs and other equipment and furniture a few hospitals too few in the u s are proving that these precautions work here too and have reduced drug resistant infections up to unfortunately most hospitals in the u s tolerate poor hand hygiene and allow stethoscopes blood pressure cuffs ekg wires and wheelchairs to be used on patient after patient without adequate cleaning yes new antibiotics are needed but in the meantime hygiene will protect patients no matter how the bugs morph betsy mccaughey ph d chairman committee to reduce infection deaths former new york lt governor new york dr masur is correct we do need additional antibiotic agents but that is not the whole story i think it was walt kellys cartoon character pogo who said "we have met the enemy and he is us " we have to enforce some common sense rules wash your hands with antiseptic soap and use hand sanitizer dr masurs two examples of fatal infections took place in hospitals how did that happen someone possibly a doctor did not wash his or her hands between patients how many hospitals have ultraviolet light filters in their air duct systems who writes all those prescriptions for people suffering from viral infections unfortunately we have to be on guard to maintain a healthful life style dont feel embarrassed to ask a doctor to wash his hands to paraphrase david ben gurion we should fight infection as if there were no antibiotics and search for antibiotics as if there was no proper sanitation charles plushnick brooklyn n y after reading "the microbial threat" by dr henry masur it occurred to me that the congress he is beseeching to increase research and development of new antibiotics before it is too late is the same congress that spends most of its time dancing around on the head of a pin what a sorry bunch of fools we have gifted with power pat schildknecht winnetka ill
