golf a special report a ticket to the top dave womack is living the amateurs dream he gets to play in the masters dave womack has a problem last september mr womack made a sliding downhill five foot putt to win the u s mid amateur championship with that win in the hole final mr womack garnered an invitation from the augusta national golf club to play in this years masters it was the first national championship for the georgia born insurance salesman mr womack calls the win a "super week " and when asked about going to the masters as a competitor and not a spectator uses words like "unbelieveable" and "amazing" and "super " the soft spoken year old uses "super" a lot so whats the problem well the invitation comes with only eight tickets and mr womack wishes he could take his whole hometown along mr womack is the quintessential amateur golfer unlike many top amateurs he was never a college all american he has won just two minor state titles he is a self professed streaky putter but he has caught lightning in a bottle earning a chance to compete against the games elite and even though he has only a slim chance of making it past the first two rounds hes determined to enjoy every minute of the experience in a way he can thank bobby jones for his ticket to the masters the legendary amateur golfer helped to design augusta national and the club has always held amateurs in high esteem so every year it invites top non pros to the masters for a chance to experience top notch golf firsthand the club has invited the winner of the u s mid am to play since while the lineup has changed over the years the other amateur invitees currently are the u s amateur champion and runner up the british amateur champion and the u s public links champion mr womack started out with hopes of going pro after graduating from georgia state university in he started playing on professional mini tours but he says he quickly figured out that it wasnt for him or rather that he wasnt for it the realization came after he made a double bogey on the last hole of a mini tour event in paducah ky costing him &# huge money at the time it occurred to him that "this is just a different game " he says "something is telling me to get back into amateur golf " so he applied to the u s golf association and got back his amateur status and he started working as an insurance agent which dovetailed with his golfing the job gave him the flexibility to play in tournaments and the game helped boost his career golf he says is a "tremendous networking avenue " mr womack had some success on the greens winning georgia state public links titles in and but nothing approaching the status of a national title that comes with a masters invitation then came last years mid am more than men tried to qualify for the championship which is open to amateurs and older who meet a basic ability test through two days of stroke play the field was whittled down to match play contestants mr womack needed to win six matches to take the title and an invitation to augusta when mr womack got back home to mcdonough ga just outside atlanta "the town threw me a huge party " he says "everyone was just awesome about everything my wife and my parents were there when i landed back at mcdonough pilgreens a local restaurant was packed " the well wishers have been extraordinarily understanding mr womack says nobody not even jokingly has asked him for a ticket to the masters his eight are all going to family members and close friends his mom and dad of course get two tickets and amber his wife takes a third look for his grandmother at least one day to be standing off to one side of the first tee and his grandfather l p mckibben who played the course as a younger man but doesnt get around as well as he used to will likely just sit near the first tee with a huge grin on his face the other tickets will be divided among cousins in laws and the like in addition one cousin walt lee will caddie for him during the tournament in effect giving mr womack a ninth ticket more important mr womack says this will fulfill a childhood promise when he and mr lee played golf together as boys each promised that if he ever got to the masters the other would act as caddie mr womacks own entree to the tournament came with a story masters invitations are mailed in plain white almost understated envelopes in mid december mr womacks wife found the invitation in the mail knew immediately what it was and hid it then she put the invitation in a box along with a green jacket like the masters winner receives to give to her husband as a christmas present but mr womack had seen on espn com that masters invitations had been sent when he didnt receive his for several days he was about to head to the post office then mrs womack did her santa impression and all was right with the world to prepare for the tournament mr womack has been practicing at augusta national he has driven up magnolia lane a total of six times before this week on one trip over he played the back nine with an augusta national assistant pro made the turn onto the front nine and found champion tommy aaron was about to tee off the two played nine holes together mr aaron who is "such a good person " says mr womack shared stories about past masters but they didnt talk much about how to play the course seemingly everyone else though has offered mr womack advice including dont be intimidated by the pros and do ask them if they want to play a practice round with you mr womack hopes to play with charles howell iii a fellow georgia native and someone he knows from their junior golf days dont take too many chances instead play conservatively sometimes because of the angle youre coming in from and the trouble nearby shooting at the flag can be the dumbest move shoot for the center of the green take your two putt par and move on to the next hole do stay at least some of the week in the crows nest the by foot room atop the clubhouse where the five amateurs are invited to bunk for the week for a nominal fee kevin marsh the mid am champ advised checking in early to grab a good spot but warned that you can hear a heavy snorer from any part of the room also by staying in the crows nest the amateurs can avoid washington road the narrow avenue in front of augusta national which becomes a veritable parking lot during the tournament mr womack says he plans to spend at least a couple of days nesting with the crows but will also stay part of the week with his family at the house theyve rented but the piece of advice that mr womack most intends to follow is this just enjoy yourself "to hit that first tee shot on that first tee golfers live their whole lives and they never even get to see the masters much less play " he says "to drive down magnolia lane and to be at a place with so much history its surreal its just a special place " mr womack says hed love to be the first mid am champ to make it to the weekend rounds not to mention be in butler cabin with the champion at the end of the masters receiving the accolades given the amateur with the lowest score but even though this might be a "cinderella story " as bill murray so famously mumbled in the movie "caddyshack " mr womack is under no such illusions no mid am champ has survived the halfway cut and played all four rounds of the masters only one danny green in has broken strokes shooting and missing the cut by a single stroke last year mr marsh the mid am champ shot to break the wrong way in short mr womack isnt expecting a green jacket he says the one he already owns is enough for him whatever happens he plans to play again in the mid am this year when its at bandon dunes in oregon starting in late september three men have been able to win the mid am twice since augusta national started inviting the champs to play so its not impossible he could win a return trip someday not as impossible it seems as
