golf a special report a masochists delight why oakmont country club home of this years u s open scares even the pros sam snead once made a quip about the speedy putting surfaces at undulating oakmont country club the year was and the u s open was being hosted for the fourth time by this legendary course of perilously canted fairways and fun house slopes outside pittsburgh on the gravity defying second green think glass not grass mr snead seemed to lose his equilibrium though not his appreciation for the absurd "i marked my ball with a dime " he snorted "and the dime slid away " its a one liner that still resonates with truth and tradition "weve been the benchmark for more than a century for green speeds " boasts a palpably proud bob ford the clubs head pro since "you know what they say about oakmonts greens we have to slow them down to host an open " hes not kidding though blazing greens arent the only enticement that keeps the u s golf association coming back for more "oakmont " says david fay executive director of the usga "was the big bad wolf of american golf courses when it opened in and it remains the big bad wolf years later theres nothing else quite like it " in june oakmont will host the open for a record eighth time as contestants strive to become part of an illustrious history tommy armour ben hogan jack nicklaus johnny miller larry nelson and ernie els all have oakmont beside their names on the open trophy so does a local club pro named sam parks jr who in studied the course daily for a month before shocking the world by defeating former open winners walter hagen and gene sarazen this course can "drive everyone batty " as mr fay says fiendish features abound like a yard par three no a yard par four no and a yard par five no bunkers more than of them yawn in wait to inflict punishment the church pews for example an expansive beachhead between the third and fourth fairways takes its name from the long grassy mounds that run in rows through it and its habit of bringing golfers to their knees "we are also judged as the benchmark for a penal golf course " mr ford adds "mr fownes wanted it that way " to fully understand oakmont it is necessary to know something about its founder h c fownes pronounced "phones" his son w c fownes and the angst producing vision of the game that father and son shared the elder mr fownes a pittsburgh industrialist who had made a fortune in iron and steel was years old in when doctors mistakenly informed him that the spots he was seeing after lighting a blowtorch without wearing a welding mask marked the onset of arteriosclerosis the doctors gave him three years to live determined to make the most of what he had left which turned out to be another years once the spots disappeared mr fownes sold his business to steel titan andrew carnegie and began to travel two years later back in pittsburgh mr carnegie a golf nut introduced the game to mr fownes who embraced it fully he got very good very quickly even reaching the quarterfinals of the u s amateur in that same year mr fownes decided there wasnt a golf course in pittsburgh tough enough to adequately test him so he set out to build his own on acres of pastureland miles from downtown armed with sketches of holes hed seen in his travels and in his spot free minds eye mr fownes walked the terrain coaxing his ideas from the landscape pinehurst in north carolina where he had watched the great donald ross at work influenced him so did traditonal scottish links theres no record of mr fownes traveling to scotland until later but "it seems that he had to have gone " says club historian john fitzgerald because what he essentially constructed was a traditional links miles inland "for a guy who was in the steel business to come out and design this out of nowhere was totally genius " says mr ford "there are features on it you dont see anyplace else " the course was wide open and airy but the crazy slopes of its greens some canting dangerously front to back away from the angle of play were ready from day one to turn most putts and approaches into gut wrenching thrill rides and its tilting fairways seemed designed to redirect even good drives toward the rough as good a golfer as h c fownes was w c was better he dominated golf in western pennsylvania for decades he won the u s amateur captained the first american walker cup team in and in the late s served as president of the usga w c fownes presided over oakmont from his fathers death in until he retired in the fowneses favored precise shots and severe penalties for mistakes and their course reflects that every shot requires careful placement from tee to green walter hagen once complained to h c fownes that oakmont offered golfers no respite to catch their breaths the founder happily agreed "surely " he countered "it is not asking too much of a champion to expect him to play every shot " fairway bunkers with their high front lips were to be avoided at all costs unlike on most courses better golfers actually prefer oakmonts rough to the sand and given the rippling and crinkling of the greens shooting for flags is fraught with risk the key is finding safe spots to land a ball with a chance to filter toward a beneficial place to putt from still no putt at oakmont has ever been safe "this is a course where good putters worry about their second putt before they hit their first one " lew worsham the open champion and oakmonts pro before mr ford is often quoted as saying as grounds chairman w c who championed a dark philosophy that "a poor shot should be irrevocably lost " made sure that no player would ever subdue oakmont on power alone he was notorious for installing bunkers precisely where hed witnessed particularly long drives landing by the s oakmont was buckling under the weight of more than bunkers an average of per hole with some harrowing pits on the short par four th alone yet it wasnt the number that sent shivers as much as the way the sand was maintained rather than smooth the surfaces the fowneses instituted an infernal system of furrowing that left deep chastising ruts created by wooden sawtooth rakes dubbed "devils backscratchers " big changes arrived in the s after the influential golf writer herbert warren wind deemed oakmont "an ugly old brute " the club hired architect robert trent jones to improve the course aesthetics which led to the planting of thousands of trees oakmont thus was transformed temporarily into a parkland course though it retained its brutishness the trees took root but in the long run they couldnt survive increasing complaints about the choked playing area and interference with shots not to mention jibes about losing sight of the fowneses original vision after the open the club began removing those trees first at night secretly so the majority of members wouldnt know eventually nearly trees disappeared long hidden bunkers reappeared and oakmont again looked much as it had in the s and s mr ford suspects that would very much please its founder one thing that has never changed is the clubs penchant for putting surfaces polished to a sheen w c had his own method for determining appropriate velocities hed stand at the back edge of the second green mr sneads bane and drop a ball if the ball failed to gather enough momentum to slide off the front edge yards downrange w c called on the course superintendent to remow with a machine specially rigged for the purpose a small patch of grass mowed to the nub diabolically rolled and kept just a little moister than the mojave the way oakmonts greens are kept can either constantly test a golfers resilience or shatter the players nerves determining the line that separates torture from test can be tricky for the open that job belongs to mike davis the usgas senior director of competitions oakmonts putting surfaces "are the fastest scariest greens we encounter " mr davis says "the margin for error is minute its really going to test players mental abilities " green speeds are measured in the number of feet a golf ball will travel after its rolled down a yardlong v shaped aluminum trough known as a stimpmeter held at a specific angle most greens on the pga tour "stimp" to between and while the local municipal course might stimp to only and a private club for the open at oakmont the usga plans to zip things along at a jaunty to slightly faster than last year at winged foot but well down from the daredevil that mr davis says he found at oakmont last fall so who will win the open the more appropriate question might be whos least likely to lose mr davis and oakmonts mr ford agree that the kind of self discipline displayed by tiger woods in last years british open would serve anyone well "a guy who just tries to bomb out of his mind will be in big trouble " says mr ford "you cant play out of the rough to these greens on the other hand a strategic smart player who putts out of his mind over four days is likely to win this championship " especially if the course is dry and the conditions dauntingly firm the way oakmont and the usga want them to be in when mr miller shot an unprecedented final round a mark never bettered in any round of an open he was playing a relatively tamed course oakmonts greens and fairways that day had been so softened by rain as to be altogether unrecognizable in their welcoming of mr millers tee shots and approaches the golf gods let him go flag hunting that day and his aim was impeccable "thats not the way mr fownes intended this course to play " says course superintendent john zimmers might there be another on the horizon "we hope not " says mr zimmers without hesitation mr silverman is a writer in chadds ford pa he can be reached at
