subprime pullback may crimp consumer spending with subprime mortgage lenders pulling back some working class americans are already finding it harder to buy a new home or refinance the one they already own the big question now for the nations economy will it also get harder for these consumers to buy cars shop at the mall and dine out like many american families subprime borrowers consumers with poor or sketchy credit histories have been able to use the combination of rising home prices and easy credit to live beyond their means in recent years as wages have stagnated that spending has helped to fuel the u s economys growth today with the housing market in a slump and defaults mounting in the market for subprime home loans some economists believe more lenders will tighten credit standards in the months ahead as concerns grow about americans heavy debt load and their ability to manage it "i dont ever recall a period in history where one credit problem didnt ripple through to other areas " says susan m sterne an economist at economic analysis associates inc in greenwich conn such a spillover might force consumers to rein in spending particularly lower income americans who have piled up debt at a faster clip than their wealthier counterparts in the past decade that could be a headache for the retailers restaurateurs and others who depend on their business so far there are only tentative signs that tighter credit conditions in the subprime mortgage market are spreading to the broader credit market in its january survey of senior loan officers the federal reserve reported that of loan officers said they had tightened somewhat in the previous three months on their standards for approving mortgage loans while just said they had done so for consumer loans other than credit cards and for credit card applications nor are there signs of a pullback by subprime auto lenders at least not yet issuance of all auto loans in february was on track to match the year earlier level of &# billion according to a report by fitch ratings a credit rating firm but issuance could fall modestly later in the year "in effect the best is over in the subprime space " says hylton heard director of asset backed securities for autos at fitch mr heard added that auto loans have remained solid so far this year and predicting how subprime loans will fare remains difficult until more default data come out over the next few months still a pullback by lenders could be a problem for working class consumers who have spent much of their borrowed cash on goods and services often reserved for the affluent "having a credit card is kind of like being a millionaire " says scott davis a year old facility maintenance worker who lives in arlington texas he says he and his wife whose household income is &# a year had "seven or eight" credit cards they used to buy sporting goods go on vacations and remodel their home mr davis isnt unusual according to fed data outstanding debt including mortgages for families in the bottom of earners those with household income below &# almost doubled to an average &# in from an inflation adjusted &# in debt outstanding in the top of households rose to &# in from &# in ray hooper education and housing director at consumer credit counseling service in dallas says with credit conditions so easy lower income consumers have been able to "get what they want even though they cant afford it " and the easy credit isnt just related to subprime lending "its not just the house " adds mr hooper "its the furniture the appliances the lawn mower " while house prices were rising the appreciation not only made consumers feel good about the future it fueled spending by putting cash in their pockets low interest rates led to a boom in home equity loans and so called cash out mortgage refinancings where consumers replace their old loan with a new loan and take out some of their equity as cash many less affluent homeowners spent that money on renovations vacations and shopping trips indicators such as last fridays commerce department personal income report show consumers have continued to spend but there are also signs those purchases are increasingly going on credit cards matt fellowes a fellow at the brookings institution found that among consumers who took out home equity loans the lowest quarter of income earners spent about of the money on investments including home renovations and education about on gifts and living expenses and very little on travel the next highest bracket earners in the second lowest quartile of earners spent about on investments on gifts and living expenses and on travel and weddings the two highest income brackets spent a higher proportion of their money on investments and less on living expenses and travel "that suggests that there is a higher propensity among lower income families to spend more money than they make " mr fellowes says reduced access to credit is one reason some economists are forecasting tougher times for retailers that cater to working class americans archstone consulting which follows the retail industry is predicting retailers that cater to the bottom of income earners merchants such as kmart wal mart and most convenience stores next year will see same store sales growth between and minus at locations that get a lot of traffic from lower income shoppers " is going to be a tough year for low income americans " says dave sievers a principal at archstone the outlook is more mixed for auto makers the current downturn in the auto market could actually lead some lenders to loosen standards in an effort to lure buyers still most subprime auto lenders say their standards havent changed this may not be the story for car shoppers trying to borrow from gmac financial services the lender formerly known as general motors acceptance corp thats because gmac has a big stake in the subprime mortgage market general motors sold a majority stake in the lender last year to a consortium of investors led by cerberus capital management continued weakness in the subprime mortgage market could force gmac to tighten standards for auto loans to help offset its exposure in the housing market a gmac spokeswoman says that the lender has seen a slight uptick in auto loan delinquencies but that losses remain at historically low levels the lender has "developed a very strategic approach to the subprime auto finance market that includes assessing risk and pricing appropriately " she says "we will continue to manage risk and act in a prudent manner going forward " the lending arms of other auto companies dont have similar subprime mortgage exposure still the best of times may be ending a report released by fitch in december suggests stable loan performance through this years first half but cautions that "the consumer is walking a thin line with household leverage and debt service burdens remaining at historically high levels " mr davis for example has already reached his breaking point when his credit card interest rates started rising he was forced to consolidate his debt and cut back spending even if the poorest customers curtail their spending it shouldnt be enough to shake the economy off of its trajectory of moderate growth in the cold science of economics rich people who have more to spend matter more to the economy than the poorer folks who dont according to the labor departments consumer expenditure survey the lowest of earners represent about &# trillion just a fifth of total consumer spending
