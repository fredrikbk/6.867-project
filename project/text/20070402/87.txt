the evening wrap supreme green online edition the supreme courts black robes took on a greenish tint today as the justices issued a pair of opinions that amounted to big victories for environmentalists in a decision that split neatly along the courts ideological faultlines the justices ruled that states and environmental advocates have the ability to sue the environmental protection agency over the agencys refusal to regulate auto emissions at issue in the case was whether the clean air acts definition of air pollution covered the carbon dioxide that is belched out of tailpipes and whether states and others have the standing to go to the courts and demand that the epa do something to limit them the federal agency had argued it held no such power and that even if it did it might choose not to clamp down on greenhouses gases due to uncertainty over whether they contribute to climate change not to mention the bush administrations insistence that other major countries first sign on to any such effort but the supreme court was unimpressed by that reasoning calling the agencys stance "arbitrary capricious or otherwise not in accordance with the law " justice john paul stevens wrote in the majoritys opinion that the regulators had "offered no reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change " he said that "greenhouse gases fit well within the clean air acts capacious definition of air pollutant " though this was the first broad global warming matter that the court has taken on the decision didnt truly break around the question of whether mans activity is causing a dangerous warming of the atmosphere to be sure justice stevens noted that "a well documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere " but the majority didnt command the epa to regulate greenhouse gases because they are altering the weather rather it said only that the epa must "ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute " regulators therefore must show that automobile emissions dont contribute to climate change or as the opinion states come up with "some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do " and the real source of the divide on the court wasnt ecological the opposition argued that the states simply didnt possess the legal standing to bring their complaint chief justice john roberts who sided with the epa said his position "involves no judgment on whether global warming exists what causes it or the extent of the problem " all the same environmentalists hailed the news carl pope executive director of the sierra club said in a statement that it constituted a "total rejection of the bush administrations refusal to use its existing authority to meet the challenge posed by global warming " but if the decision delighted greens it was a far less happy development for automobile makers the auto industry sued the state of california in an effort to overturn its tough emissions standards and the epas stance that carbon dioxide isnt an air pollutant was one of the biggest weapons in their arsenal now its a dud alden meyer director of strategy and policy for the union of concerned scientists said the court is "rejecting the arguments that the auto industry is making in the challenge to california " in another case that was a significant win for greens the court unanimously overturned a lower courts ruling in favor of duke energy and gave a boost to an initiative targeted at forcing utilities to install pollution control gear on aging coal fired plants court also rejects detainees appeal the supreme court wasnt focused exclusively on environmental matters the justices also rejected an appeal from terrorism detainees who wish to challenge their confinement at the military prison facility at guantanamo bay cuba in a u s court the case revolved around whether the prisoners can claim a right to habeas corpus review a tenet in the constitution that protects against unlawful imprisonment "this is a delay that is unconscionable " said michael ratner president of the center for constitutional rights which has led the fight to gain court access for the detainees white house spokeswoman dana perino said the ruling hadnt yet been fully reviewed but "i think that on first glance were very pleased with the decision " but in a sign that the court has not had its final say on the matter justices anthony kennedy and john paul stevens made clear that they were rejecting the appeal only on procedural grounds stocks inch forward the institute for supply managements tepid reading on the

with a warrant entitling him to acquire of the common stock the deal also includes a small break up fee of &# million which could entice los angeles businessmen ron burkle and eli broad to make a competing bid but tribune said mr zells offer "provides the greatest certainty for achieving the highest value for all shareholders and is in the best interest of investors and employees " mr zell was late to the tribune auction but helped spice up what had been a sleepy process the company put itself up on the block last summer after grumbling from shareholders the chandler family but even with private equity firms in a feeding frenzy tribune got scant interest the battle between mr zell who is chicago based and the burkle broad camp thus gave tribune the auction it had craved the cubs will

bidding bringing an end to a long running takeover saga germanys e on said it had reached an agreement with rivals acciona and enel to withdraw its bid for the spanish utility endesa in exchange for the potential acquisition of a portfolio of assets throughout europe acciona and enel together control almost of the endesa through stakes and equity swap arrangements making it extraordinarily difficult for another party to get a firm hold on endesa without their consent "accionas and enels involvement in endesa has made our original goal of acquiring a majority stake in endesa impossible obtaining a minority interest in endesa would have led to a stalemate between the shareholders and triggered unpredictable lawsuits " wulf bernotat the chief executive of e on said the agreement would
