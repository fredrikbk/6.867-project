trying to better understand female golfers women often start learning golf at an older age than men and are more likely to be unfamiliar with the rules and lack golf partners many men by contrast learn to play at an early age through friends or professional colleagues women also tend to shop for clubs differently the typical male golfer often is inspired to buy a club after watching a pro such
