politics &amp economics u s yields more to states on chemical plant security washington moving to appease critics in congress and many state capitals the department of homeland security will open the door for states to adopt chemical facility security regulations like those already taken in new york and new jersey according to officials close to the federal rule making process the new position will be spelled out today when dhs releases its final rules governing chemical plant security it is unclear whether the regulations will satisfy the chemical industrys wish for a single federally mandated regulatory environment at issue are concerns that a terrorist attack on a chemical plant that uses highly toxic materials could produce deadly gas clouds in the absence of federal regulations new york and new jersey have taken steps in recent years to regulate security at such facilities new jersey for example requires chemical plants to study whether "inherently safer technology" is available that will reduce the risk of an accident or potential harm from an attack other rules that have been considered but not adopted include requiring plants to use chemicals considered safer than those currently in use resistance to regulation by the industry and arguments inside the bush administration over the extent of control and which federal agency should be in charge of the process delayed any meaningful security rules for chemical facilities for more than five years after the terrorist attacks of sept preliminary rules drafted by dhs last december allowed for a federal pre emption of conflicting and perhaps more demanding state laws leading to charges by some lawmakers such as sen frank lautenberg d n j that dhs was actually weakening counter terrorism efforts while department spokesman russ knocke declined to comment on the specifics of the final rules before their release he said "it is our belief that those officials in congress and at the state level who have expressed concern with pre emption will be satisfied with what they see in the final regs " the apparent shift comes hard on the heels of an effort by homeland security secretary michael chertoff and the chemical industry to kill a congressional proposal to permit state governments to have tougher chemical plant security rules than the federal government the provisions were inserted by the democratic majority into emergency spending bills on iraq which president bush has vowed to veto nevertheless mr chertoff argued in a letter to lawmakers last week that any move to enshrine federal law as minimum standards for chemical plant security would compromise his ability to enforce national standards and undermine national security efforts now department officials close to the rule making process said that while dhs would never surrender the principle of federal pre emption of state laws when it comes to national security they have realized that the efforts of some states to secure chemical facilities that produce store or use any of a dozen toxic chemicals likely to be targeted by terrorists were complementary to the departments aims to protect the country as a result they say mr chertoff will today signal a greater flexibility and "collaborative" approach by clarifying that state efforts taken to date dont conflict with departments rules
