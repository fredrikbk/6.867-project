politics &amp economics democrats reach critical stage decisive session looms as pressure grows to show legislative results with lawmakers gone for the spring recess washington is at a tipping point between democratic calls for "a new direction" in government and the need for congress and the white house to show results soon in the space of days of democratic control the house has challenged president bush over the iraq war sent dozens of bills to an uncertain fate in the senate imposed tougher ethics rules and started reshaping the federal budget a fractious leadership team pulled together with each leaders skills proving crucial to unite the party in the war debate but few of the house passed bills have become law and signature issues such as raising the minimum wage and cutting student loan rates are adrift the iraq war debate consumes time and energy and if the year only produces senate stalemate and white house veto fights it will seem a very "old direction" to independent voters who helped democrats win control in the elections and put a priority on bipartisan results legislative action wont fully resume until mid april and the six week stretch from then to memorial day could be decisive for the new congress and define its relations with mr bush for the rest of his presidency speaker nancy pelosi was asked as she left last week for the mideast what she had learned about herself in her first months running the house the california democrat is the first woman to be speaker and her answer reflects her growing self confidence "i have a certain serenity about it all i really do" she said "its so much but i have a confidence about dealing with it its not a surprise to me but its interesting " but even now ms pelosi wont promise that the minimum wage bill will be done by memorial day and republicans say democrats will have to step back if they are to find the consensus needed to accomplish their goals the promise and danger of this period was captured in the senate last week debate was raging over the iraq bill as mr bush was blasting democrats before the cattlemens lobby downtown yet just off the senate floor cabinet secretaries and senior white house aides arrived in a flurry to meet with senators on immigration reform a subject demanding the utmost of white house and bipartisan cooperation hanging over both parties is the veto confrontation on iraq democrats left town prepared for white house attacks on their calling for withdrawal of most u s forces next year party members are being urged to directly engage veterans groups and local national guard units "our bill is more focused on the needs of the troops than the presidents request" is one talking point given to members ms pelosis planned stop in syria after speaking to the israeli government yesterday dovetails with her embracing a call for greater diplomatic efforts made by the bipartisan iraq study group in its advisory report late last year the white house officials continued yesterday in their public rebuking of the speaker for the syria visit but in doing so the administration revealed some of its own frustration defense secretary robert gatess candor on the problems in iraq has won the respect of war critics such as rep john murtha d pa more often the white house is alienating the same players past republican presidents relied on when they also faced democratic congresses sen daniel inouye d hawaii a highly decorated world war ii veteran and chairman of the senate appropriations defense subcommittee is dismayed by the administrations approach "on an issue of this importance " he said "we should get out of the confrontational posture and sit down and figure out something " for democrats still trying to establish themselves in control there are two risks first that the fight becomes so poisonous that nothing else gets done second that they make the president such a target they fail to work together there are bipartisan moments such as the hopes for some new trade framework amid wall street concern over mortgage markets treasury embraced a house financial services bill last week to tighten regulation of government sponsored enterprises such as fannie mae and freddie mac but the far greater test is immigration overhaul and what could be a make or break senate floor debate now scheduled in late may sen edward kennedy d mass will use the recess to finish drafting a bill but if the president moves to the right to appease republican conservatives who also back him on the war prospects for passage could be undercut for democrats a major priority after the recess will be getting a quick agreement on a final budget resolution for the fiscal year that begins oct there is pressure as well for a final house senate agreement on lobbying reform legislation long promised as the companion piece to opening day ethics rules changes house relations with senate majority leader harry reid d nev and his deputy sen richard durbin d ill are good both served in the house and share the house leaderships roots in the appropriations committees nonetheless senate filibuster rules and a narrow one vote democratic majority leads to inevitable house frustration "my theory is its our job to get the bills over there " says house education and labor committee chairman george miller d calif "after you pass the rotunda its like bringing your child into foster care " in ms pelosis words "each house in its own tempo is moving forward " but when she said she couldnt promise a minimum wage bill by memorial day an agitated looking democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d ill stepped in quickly "it is a pledge we made to the american people and it will get done " he said
