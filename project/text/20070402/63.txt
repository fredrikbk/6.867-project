home run list you can also walk down fix memory lane and review the results of last years contest s and s plus here are the guest picks from last year on to the picks the basics point value in parentheses  which six teams will be division winners points each alex belth red sox tigers angels mets cardinals dodgers jon bois red sox white sox angels braves reds dodgers yes the yankees are the best offensive team in baseball but in recent years theyve turned underachievement into some sort of eccentric form of performance art today these artisans are misunderstood but decades into a more sophisticated future pundits will watch film of alex rodriguez bobbling a routine dribbler for the th time and ask themselves what he was trying to express i like the twins but if you combine the positive energy of johan santana and the negative energy of sidney ponson youre left with a baseball sitting motionless on the pitching rubber for a few minutes until the umpires declare a forfeit atlanta will overcome mike hamptons freak injury and craig wilsons freak acquisition to retake the nl east the nl central is certainly the toughest division to call its like throwing six worms into a bucket and declaring a free for all deathmatch do they even want to fight do they even know the rules of the game difficult to say larry borowsky yankees twins angels braves cardinals padres nick dallamora yankees twins angels phillies astros dodgers i didnt have too much trouble picking the yankees phillies astros and dodgers i had a real hard time combing through the al central and picking a "winner " i almost picked cleveland for their somewhat rounded rotation but then chuckled to myself for having made a very funny joke ive been saying the angels will take the west this whole offseason but im also one of those naive folk who think rich harden is going to pitch in games for oakland this year jered weaver showed ace stuff last year but i think hes going to settle into the spot behind john lackey quite comfortably will leitch yankees white sox angels phillies brewers diamondbacks joe sheehan yankees indians mariners mets cubs diamondbacks i have no faith in at least three of those theres more parity now than theres been in years making it hard to separate teams in the al central al west and nl central i could see any of teams winning division titles paul steiger yankees indians angels mets cardinals diamondbacks the al central is tough only kc cant win it cleveland has a good mix of hitting and pitching youth and experience the cardinals are not a lock they nearly self destructed at the end of the regular season but the nl central is weaker and the cubs wont improve quite enough arizona is an unconventional choice but i really like their kids brandon stroud yankees indians rangers braves reds diamondbacks dave studeman yankees indians angels phillies cubs padres someday im going to look like a genius for picking the cubs and im not going to stop picking them until i do carl bialik yankees tigers as mets astros dodgers jason fry yankees twins angels mets reds dodgers teams in other divisions should be allowed to forfeit wins for a sept transfer to the nl central  which two teams will win the wild cards each belth indians phillies bois tigers mets the tigers just have to make sure they dont let the pitchers hold the wild card trophy pennant gift card whatever they might drop it and break it because they are bad at baseball get it borowsky indians brewers dallamora red sox mets picking the yankees to take the east became a lot easier when jonathan papelbon moved back to the closer role this past week without that ridiculously glamorous pitching rotation i bumped the red sox to a concrete wild card with papelbon in the pen it means julian tavarez will be the fifth starter for now although he showed up with his a game at the end of last season he lacks the ability to go deep into games expect jon lester shortly i hate that baseball season starts right after march madness because im thinking with that underdog mentality i really wanted to take the reds here but didnt have the heart theyve got a rotation full of sleepers and a decent amount of power hitting theyve got detroit tigers written all over them but nope mets leitch tigers cardinals sheehan twins dodgers these two teams could win division titles and they could miss the playoffs entirely steiger red sox dodgers these are two strong teams boston has a terrifying lineup and has improved its pitching it would win any of the other five divisions and might win the al east the dodgers have a weaker lineup than last year but stronger pitching and will have enough to beat philly atlanta and chicago for the wild card stroud twins cubs studeman red sox mets bialik red sox cardinals fry white sox braves picked the cubs changed my mind about the whole nl central forgot to change pick doh  which two teams will go to the world series each belth indians dodgers in a repeat of the favored mets fall to the dodgers while the indians avenge their loss to boston winning the alcs in bois white sox braves borowsky twins cardinals on the al side the yankees are burdened with that loser at third base the angels cant hit and the indians still dont have a bullpen in the nl the braves always find a way lose the brewers are still too green and the cardinals own the padres in the postseason dallamora red sox astros this is me assuming two things a gyroball exists and roger clemens rolls off the couch in time for the dance if the red sox do make the playoffs the three man rotation of schilling matsuzaka and beckett should be enough for a world series arrival leitch yankees phillies this is going to be a banner year in philadelphia one of those teams that the city just rallies around and goes crazy for and then the yankees will sweep them in the world series because philadelphia cannot handle happiness sheehan indians diamondbacks fox weeps steiger yankees mets the yanks will win the al with better pitching and a lineup that will benefit from addition by subtraction stroud twins cubs studeman red sox phillies wouldnt that be cool bialik yankees mets fry twins mets i will briefly attempt to heckle my decent midwestern friends who are twins fans before feeling bad about it  which team will win the world series belth dodgers bois braves anyone else notice the correlation between the braves postseason mediocrity and mark lemkes departure pete orr is this decades mark lemke and with tony pena jr gone he has a chance to play pete orr is a hustler a real teddy ballgame borowsky cardinals johan santana throws two no hitters but the cards win the other four games all by a score of and become the first team in history to win back to back world titles without cracking the win barrier dallamora astros theyve got very few holes brad lidge is the scariest closer left in baseball after jason isringhausen thanks to albert pujols scrambling his brain with that foot shot in and brad ausmus is a terrible hitter even for a catcher regardless theyre a consistent powerhouse and this year im seeing them taking it all leitch yankees everyone always says that the first championship just makes you hungrier for the second this is absolutely not true im rooting for the cardinals this year but if they finished last i would just pop in the dvd of game last year or game against the mets and my equilibrium would be restored sheehan diamondbacks this would give the s expansion teams four world series titles and the cubs none since steiger mets the mets will win early in the regular season with a monster lineup and late with young pitching that will strengthen month by month stroud twins studeman yankees im hedging my bets bialik mets fry mets on the other hand if my wishing made it so the mets would be gunning for their st straight championship and yankee fans would note their allegiance in furtive whispers  which team will have the best regular season record belth red sox daisuke matsuzaka j d drew and josh beckett all have strong seasons bois red sox borowsky yankees dallamora yankees leitch yankees sheehan yankees well i guess i mean they might have kevin mmahat starting the third game of the season at this rate steiger cardinals theyll dominate a weak division stroud yankees studeman yankees bialik yankees fry yankees i hate myself  which team will have the worst regular season record belth nationals its not the heat but the stupidity for dmitri young and his traveling band of all stars this summer in the nations capital bois nationals they probably owed of their wins last season to alfonso soriano borowsky nationals dallamora royals they squeaked past the devil rays by one win last year but this time the d rays get the last laugh perennial loss favorites the royals fired a middle finger to the fans by dumping &# million on gil meche i dont think that is going to be enough leitch nationals sheehan nationals and it wont be terribly close steiger royals stroud royals studeman royals the nationals are the trendy pick here but i have to call out the team that signed gil meche for five years at &# million a year bialik nationals fry nationals its going to be so so so so ugly down there  who will win the al and nl cy young awards each belth c c sabathia roy oswalt time for papa large to emerge as a dominant pitcher oswalt just keeps on keeping on bois johan santana chris young borowsky johan santana ben sheets dallamora johan santana jake peavy im trying to be playful with some of my picks as youll see when mvp talks arise later but theres just no sense in taking anybody but santana peavy is my annual pick because i never know whom to pick and i love him + ks with an era around sounds good to me his actual performance last year was not reflected in his record as baseball prospectus had him pegged as the second most "unlucky" pitcher last season leitch johan santana ben sheets sheehan johan santana roy oswalt finally in the latters case steiger mariano rivera brandon webb stroud johan santana randy johnson studeman johan santana carlos zambrano did i mention that im picking the cubs to win their division bialik johan santana ben sheets fry johan santana roy oswalt  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each belth vladimir guerrero albert pujols i know vlads skills might be fading but why not an mvp to help bolster a growing hall of fame resume i have no imagination but shouldnt pujols have more than just one mvp by now bois jermaine dye andruw jones borowsky grady sizemore albert pujols dallamora manny ramirez lance berkman manny and berkman are two of the most consistent run producers in baseball and its just a matter of time before these guys collect the hardware manny came to camp with a different attitude this year hes always had the strongest work ethic on the red sox but we all know he had the tendency to act a little should we say eccentric he seems more focused and happy to be playing baseball expect less drama and the same consistent production last year berkman was unfortunate enough to share a league with ryan howard and albert pujols god in cardinal form leaving him at third in the voting those guys are still around but i dont see the fun in picking pujols or howard here what so i can say "i told you pujols was a beast " leitch alex rodriguez albert pujols sheehan grady sizemore albert pujols steiger alex rodriguez albert pujols stroud travis hafner albert pujols studeman alex rodriguez albert pujols bialik alex rodriguez carlos beltran fry derek jeter jose reyes jeter wont deserve it but will get it anyway for not winning it in other years when he also didnt deserve it reyes not only will be the mvp hell capture a shockingly large write in vote for president in and win a grammy  who will win the al and nl rookie of the year awards each belth daisuke matsusaka chris young bois daisuke matsuzaka kevin kouzmanoff borowsky daisuke matsuzaka lastings milledge dallamora daisuke matsuzaka chris young it was either matsuzaka or delmon young in the al and i dont like youngs chances of staying out of trouble for an entire year ive been hearing about chris young ever since the white sox shipped him to the diamondbacks in the javier vazquez trade so well have to see how he produces hes shown enough potential to expect home runs and stolen bases this year leitch daisuke matsuzaka chris young sheehan daisuke matsuzaka chris young steiger kei igawa chris young stroud delmon young homer bailey studeman daisuke matsuzaka chris young isnt it weird that all the good japanese imports signed with the american league bialik daisuke matsuzaka kevin kouzmanoff fry alex gordon mike pelfrey toppss most all but not all destroyed alex gordon rookie cards will then underwrite economies this will allow keith olbermann to shove bill gates aside on the forbes ok maybe not but it wont hurt the nitty gritty points each all questions include regular season games only asterisk denotes partial credit will be given  which manager will be first to no longer be managing team whether fired retired resigned or otherwise not managing in belth mike hargrove mariners the human rain delay finally gets washed out of seattle bois buddy bell royals leaving the job midseason is kind of a kansas city tradition borowsky charlie manuel phillies we hardly knew ye dallamora mike hargrove mariners i wonder how many people put joe torre down here thinking that joe girardi was going to walk into his place wait can i change my answer leitch clint hurdle rockies sheehan john gibbons blue jays this is hard with seven new managers who youd figure will make it through the year ill go with gibbons as the jays will likely disappoint and hes got some black marks on his record steiger mike hargrove mariners stroud jim tracy pirates studeman mike hargrove mariners that would make the mariners blogosphere rejoice bialik mike hargrove mariners fry sam perlozzo orioles all decent people should feel sorry for sam perlozzo peter angelos on the other hand  who will be the highest salaried player based on salary released or traded belth carl pavano bois alex rodriguez borowsky pat burrell so many candidates carl pavano miguel tejada todd helton mark buehrle carlos zambrano even a rod could get dumped but ill go with burrell to the cardinals because theyre gonna really really need him dallamora eric milton i was going to say javier vazquez but i just read that it says in his contract that he cant be traded to teams in the al and nl west for family reasons milton is getting &# million to be the most mediocre pitcher in baseball which is a great pitcher in baseball nowadays with a plethora of starting pitchers on cincinnatis staff right now im totally seeing this happen funny how &# million suddenly became "shopable " leitch todd helton sheehan andruw jones i never get this right steiger greg maddux stroud carlos delgado studeman dontrelle willis hes not highly paid yet but something will give with dontrelle willis in florida before the end of july id also watch for possible changes with andruw jones a j burnett if hes healthy and the blue jays arent competing and miguel tejada bialik miguel tejada fry todd helton  starting pitchers greg maddux daisuke matsuzaka andy pettitte jason schmidt and barry zito all signed big contracts with new teams rank them in order of regular season wins most to fewest in belth schmidt matsuzaka zito pettitte maddux the mad dog wins plus games again but schmidt shines in l a bois matsuzaka schmidt maddux pettitte zito borowsky matsuzaka zito pettitte schmidt maddux dallamora zito matsuzaka maddux schmidt andy pettitte zito gets to enjoy the thrill of going from the dh league to the crappiest hitters in baseball league if he can post a era id expect him to be good for or wins daisuke is a huge question mark and hell probably end up breaking this question for me but hes been electric this spring im penciling him in for maddux is getting up there in years but lucky for him and san diego hes not a power pitcher he should start out strong and taper towards the end of the season killing his era wins are still there though or for maddux jason schmidt should expect more wins in dodger blue but or is all i see him taking welcome back to the american league andy pettitte here are your wins leitch matsuzaka schmidt zito maddux pettitte sheehan matsuzaka zito schmidt maddux pettitte thats mostly in order of innings steiger zito pettitte matsuzaka schmidt maddux stroud pettitte zito maddux matsuzaka schmidt studeman matsuzaka pettitte schmidt maddux zito if bonds stays healthy all year id move zito up to third and push schmidt and maddux down the list bialik matsuzaka zito maddux schmidt pettitte fry pettitte schmidt matsuzaka zito maddux maddux would win more if he didnt take himself out of games when he was still the best pitcher available its infuriating  rank these teams in order of regular season wins most to fewest nationals pirates orioles devil rays royals belth pirates orioles devil rays royals nationals i still think the ruination of the orioles is one of the worst things in baseball bois pirates devil rays orioles royals nationals borowsky pirates orioles royals devil rays nationals the orioles have the best team but the pirates play in the weakest division dallamora pirates orioles devil rays nationals royals i put the d rays ahead of the nationals because the rays have an advantage in getting to play the royals as for the best of the worst i think its a crapshoot since none of them try after the all star break anyway leitch orioles pirates royals devil rays nationals sheehan devil rays pirates orioles royals nationals steiger devil rays pirates nationals orioles royals stroud orioles pirates nationals devil rays royals studeman orioles devil rays pirates royals nationals hedging my bets again this is fun bialik devil rays orioles pirates royals nationals fry devil rays royals pirates nationals orioles the devil rays and royals will actually bask in the fitful sunshine of hope for a while yet the nationals know theyre going to stink angelos deserves it  what will be the most runs scored in any one regular season game in the majors this year by the two teams combined how many games decided by one run will there be in the regular season belth bois borowsky without question the highest scoring game will be started by jason marquis hell allow eight runs and drive in five against the rockies and josh fogg on june at wrigley field and the teams will combine to score a third of the runs will be unearned dallamora i guess im hoping chan ho park is somehow allowed to pitch for both teams for a game and that albert pujols would take his spot in the lineup leitch sheehan the rockies will beat the nationals at coors field some point steiger stroud studeman i would bet that the yankees will be one of the two teams in the highest scoring game there will be exactly games decided by one run book it bialik fry  which team will have the most improved record measured in increase in total victories belth indians bois devil rays borowsky cubs lou piniella alone is good for five or six wins over dusty baker the return of derrek lee is worth another five or six plus they were mildly unlucky last year four games worse than their pythagorean record i was very tempted to pick the indians whose pythagorean record last year was games better than their actual record it wouldnt take a lot of improvement for them to win this year the braves also look like a good bet to improve they underperformed their pythagorean by games last year theyre young and they had a strong second half dallamora cubs if the lineup derrek lee stays healthy they should manage to win to games which is a whole lot better than their last year mark prior looks like a little leaguer in the pros right now and kerry wood is bound to spend the entire season on the dl somehow but they certainly cant do any worse than last year leitch brewers sheehan diamondbacks the indians cubs and braves will be in this mix steiger cubs the lineup is much stronger with soriano and the pitching no longer depends on prior and wood being healthy stroud indians studeman cubs bialik indians fry cubs  which team will suffer the biggest decline measured in decrease in total victories belth yankees bois as borowsky as the mets may not have pedro at all this year and they werent as good as their record showed last year anyway pythagorean was only but im gonna go with the athletics who were only an win team per pythagorean and have lost barry zito they might be sellers at the deadline dallamora marlins a playoff contender with two weeks left last season the marlins surprised everyone the youngest team in the league by miles started out playing rookie ball but eventually turned some timely streaks into a front page worthy won loss record of course this means that practically the entire team is preparing for its sophomore slump leitch as i kind of think it all might fall apart for the as this year it was destined to happen sometime i do love the elephant mascot though sheehan blue jays and it wont be close steiger as barry zito is a huge loss stroud tigers studeman white sox itll be some team in the al central take your pick between the tigers twins and white sox ill pick the white sox to even out my unfounded enthusiasm for the cubs bialik marlins fry tigers no shame there theyll be back  how many postseason hits will alex rodriguez have how about derek jeter belth the yankees wont make the playoffs in the eyes of yankees fans a rod will have hits because it will be his fault for the team not getting there in the first place bois at least a rods getting traded to a playoff bound team borowsky a rods pr team will advise him that according to the survey data postseason hits are required to maintain the value of the a rod brand hell only muster the yanks will trade him to the cubs after the season and a rod will lead them to the world championship in dallamora i know im being generous with rodriguez the yankees should make it to the alcs and lose again so a rods looking at to at bats to sounds good to me jeters going to get it done like he always does leitch sheehan a rod just because each of jeters hits will drive in two runs to give the yankees the lead in their playoff wins causing people to forget the answer to the first part of this question steiger stroud studeman this of course is in my scenario in which the yankees win the world series bialik fry after which a rod will come to his senses go somewhere else and be the mvp each of jeters hits will be somehow infuriating  there were runs scored per game in the regular season by what percentage will that change in round to the nearest percentage point and specify a direction up or down belth no change bois borowsky + lets see daisuke matsuzakas in a big league rotation which should drive scoring down but so is jason simontacchi which will drive it right back up jonathan papelbon wont be starting games while braden looper will be scoring goes up but then joel piniero wont be making starts while adam wainwright will be scoring goes back down in the end im gonna go with the sammy sosa factor hes back in the big leagues and might be back on ste er back on track dallamora the pitching has got to make a swing sometime soon right right leitch sheehan steiger stroud + studeman as humidors are rolled out in every stadium bialik fry  name two teams that will have only one all star counting those who are on the active roster for the game and those who are chosen but skip it for each team you get correct belth nationals royals bois nationals royals borowsky nationals reds dallamora indians royals leitch giants royals sheehan nationals pirates steiger devil rays padres stroud mariners diamondbacks studeman nationals royals bialik nationals pirates fry orioles nationals the orioles "all star" will attend with a bag on his head they should just have anna benson jump out of a cake wearing orange and black feathers  on what date will barry bonds hit career hr no belth july hank aaron is going down and barry wont go away bois august you know they scheduled the giants at dodger stadium on that day for a reason borowsky july i asked my community at viva el birdos for help on this question unfortunately the day i asked was the day tony la russa got picked up for a dui so the folks werent too interested in bondss th but i did get one very detailed answer from a longstanding reader zubin who developed a th hr matrix bondss recent year playing time rates on one axis hr rates on the other using the matrix zubin came up with an answer of friday july th at home against the marlins ill go with that dallamora september when he hits home runs in a inning bloodbath against the nationals thats the only way id enjoy no leitch september sheehan july steiger august stroud august studeman august off ryan dempster to be specific bialik august fry aint gonna happen
