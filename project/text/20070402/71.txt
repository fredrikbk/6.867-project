stock market quarterly review essay denouement of subprime story yet to be written ripples from the downturn may dictate the fate of several parts of the economy theres nothing like financial turmoil to get wall streeters talking like experts but all the talk in the world wont be enough to figure out how the trouble in subprime mortgages will end subprime made a sudden leap into investors lexicon early this year when it became obvious that many mortgage lenders banks brokers and investors had badly underestimated the risks of loans to the least creditworthy borrowers in late february news that mortgage lender freddie mac was tightening standards on such loans contributed to the steepest percentage point decline in four years for the dow jones industrial average the dows second worst day of the year came in mid march when another raft of bad news about the subprime sector hit the market that included h&amp r block inc s announcement that difficulty in accounting for "rapidly declining loan values" at its mortgage unit meant it would have to delay reporting quarterly results there were two worries the first was that steep losses in securities backed by subprime mortgages would prompt investors to pull away from risky assets everything from emerging market stocks to high yield corporate debt for the moment that concern has receded financial markets regained their footing and recovered some of their lost ground in the second half of last month the second worry was that subprime woes would exacerbate the housing downturn to the point where the u s economy is in serious trouble even after all the jargon filled research reports and talk about second lien loans and delinquency rates and the like wall street is still trying to figure out whether thats likely investors have a lot at stake in the outcome several lenders are in trouble new century financial corp which had become the nations second biggest subprime lender appears headed for bankruptcy shares of accredited home lenders holding co fremont general corp and novastar financial inc have fallen sharply many home builders already hurt by the weak housing market also have mortgage operations that could get hit by troubles with risky loans last week beazer homes inc said federal officials are investigating its mortgage unit one difficulty in calculating the scale of the subprime mortgage mess is that it started with a series of miscalculations lenders had created many new types of mortgages to meet rising demand including loans requiring little or no documentation of borrowers incomes and assets and some requiring only a small down payment or none at all standard credit ratings known as fico scores werent always a good indicator of how these loans would perform some lenders didnt seem to recognize that borrowers who dont put any money down may behave differently from those who put down or so when they buy a home nor did they foresee problems these loans might encounter if home prices declined to the point where the amount owed exceeded the value of the property sometimes borrowers defaulted without making a single payment "weve never really extended credit to people who have no known ability to pay it back and have no skin in the game " says paul kasriel an economist with northern trust corp "its uncharted territory " it isnt clear whether the problem is just with subprime mortgages or if there is a more general problem with mortgages that first manifested itself in the subprime market loans that fall between subprime and prime known as alt a mortgages are a particular concern alt a borrowers have higher credit ratings than subprime borrowers but alt a loans often fall into the low doc and no doc category and they can require little or no money down "its the ability to draw a circle around the total number of risky loans thats so hard " says lehman brothers holdings inc economist ethan harris "does low doc mean youre lying because you cant make your payment or are you trying to hide your true income from the irs or your ex spouse or are you just trying to get through the loan process quickly we dont know which is which " even if its possible to get an accurate sense of how many loans will go belly up theres the effect on the housing market to consider when it reported a drop in quarterly profit tuesday home builder lennar corp said weakness in the housing market has "been exacerbated by the well publicized problems in the subprime lending market " if risky borrowing helped propel the housing market during the boom times lenders cutting back on the number of risky loans they make could cause some of the demand for housing to evaporate and home prices could get pushed lower that in turn would put more homeowners underwater on their mortgages which is a big part of how the subprime fiasco got started in the first place "if the prime driver is the downturn in home prices then this problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets better " says goldman sachs group inc economist jan hatzius of course at some point falling prices would also make housing more affordable which would eventually bring more creditworthy buyers and stability into the market but like everything else with housing nobody is really sure when or at what price level those buyers will come "how bad is it going to get we dont know " says northern trusts
