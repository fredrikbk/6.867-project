golf a special report how golf went off course the game has tried hard to draw new players but it may have missed a bigger opportunity getting more rounds out of its most avid golfers it may be time for golf to rethink its approach to the green for the past several years the major institutional components of golf have expended enormous energy and resources on getting new players to the course trying to build on the phenomenal popularity of tiger woods they have created a host of efforts directed at luring people who have never played before everything from training camps to celebrity studded marketing campaigns to special facilities catering to new players in some sense the efforts have been a success each year three million newcomers try out the game but in another sense the efforts havent worked as planned yes three million people play golf for the first time each year but about the same number quit whats more the total number of rounds played declined in and and has not recovered much since according to the records keeping national golf foundation even more striking last year for the first time in years more courses closed in the u s than opened thats bad news for the people in the u s who make their living from golf everyone from equipment and apparel makers to real estate moguls so the games movers and shakers have been doing a lot of soul searching to find ways to get golf growing again now many of them are calling for a change in strategy worry less about attracting newcomers they say and pour more energy into improving the golf experience for those who are already at the course speed up play so that harried people can finish a round in a few hours cut green fees and other expenses give amateurs even more technologically advanced clubs to improve their game "any practical business needs more time with its current customers than in wooing potential customers its a more efficient way of doing business " says joe steranka the ceo of the professional golfers association of america which represents club pros and teachers recruiting new players will remain a big part of the associations national level job but increasingly its putting an emphasis on gathering statistics and compiling research on the "best practices" that its members can use at the facility level to retain existing players and improve their experience to be sure no one would characterize golf overall as being in trouble the game has a vital image and is unmarred by scandal furthermore million people play the game in the u s and about half of them play often enough eight or more times a year to be what the national golf foundation considers "core players " but golf is a huge business and huge businesses by their very nature want to grow the many arms of the industry lets call it golf inc sell everything from clubs and balls to lessons mowers real estate and travel golf inc s revenue according to one widely circulated industry study from amounts to &# billion a year and golf inc s growth has stalled the number of core golfers is down from its peak in before put a crimp in golf travel and spending thats enough to get many insiders rethinking the wisdom of focusing on newcomers instead of existing golfers most of those efforts to lure new players stem from an industrywide initiative called golf which convened in and has held annual fall meetings ever since the name comes from a rosy prediction in the wake of tiger woodss astounding popularity golfs guiding gurus envisioned the number of participants rising to million by and annual rounds played doubling the highest profile initiative is probably the pgas play golf america program which includes free lessons a web site that links to a network of facilities that cater to new players and training for club pros on ways to make the game more accessible there are also several efforts for junior players such as first tee a program designed to bring less advantaged kids primarily from urban environments into the game while providing life lessons many of these efforts have seen some success last may play golf americas free lesson month drew more participants than it did the year before and more than two fifths of them went on to sign up for a subsequent tee time first tee has grown to facilities across the country in addition girls are showing an interest in golf the proportion of girls among players under has almost doubled since to about in part this reflects the growing popularity of the lpga tour and its attractive cast of young players such as paula creamer and natalie gulbis but the fact is that these efforts are small compared with the base of existing golfers and they havent been able to boost golfer retention rates significantly the retention rate for women is particularly poor since the late s women have taken up golf in unprecedented numbers in recent years about of all new players have been female but the total number of core women players has actually declined according to the ngf the number fell to million in the latest year for which figures are available from million in a better place to look for growth may be core golfers one commonly used benchmark in business is the so called rule eighty percent of revenue comes from the top of customers by that standard golf has substantial room to grow from within avid golfers defined by the national golf foundation as playing or more rounds a year constitute of all players but generate only of spending on fees and equipment "increasing the buy rate among existing consumer categories is much more efficient than attracting and retaining new demographics " says jim koppenhaver a former marketing executive at kraft foods who now is the head of pellucid corp a consultant to the golf industry golf might do well to learn from the sport of horse racing starting about years ago racing officials made a concerted national marketing effort to attract a younger crowd the hope was that the sport could re create the excitement of the s and s when crowds as large as would show up on thursday afternoons at urban tracks "the idea was if they could just come up with the right slogan year olds would drop their skateboards and come out to the track " says steven crist the chairman and publisher of the daily racing form but it didnt work "racing has always been an activity for slightly older people it takes time and a certain amount of disposable income to play " mr crist says "the more enlightened people in racing now have given up making it the big story in the papers it was years ago the focus now is on improving growth where the players already are " what would a similar strategy mean for golf there are a number of issues that keep golfers who have the desire to play more often from doing so the game is inherently difficult and in recent years it has become more expensive two income families face an ever increasing time crunch fathers want to spend more time with their families topping mr koppenhavers list of solutions is making the game easier to play to him controversially that means creating new standards for clubs the u s golf association golfs rule making body in the u s imposes performance limits on clubs and balls to protect what it believes are the games best traditions its stated purpose is to ensure that skill rather than technology remains the "dominant element of success throughout the game " but in practice the usgas equipment regulations target elite players the vast majority of amateurs cant swing well enough or consistently enough to even remotely threaten the integrity of the game critics like mr koppenhaver are calling for bifurcation a division of equipment into pro and amateur lines pros and possibly top level amateurs would play with clubs and balls that conform to the current rules but manufacturers would be unleashed to create clubs and balls for amateurs that flew farther and were more forgiving of duffers mistakes that would let players have more fun on the course and make them more likely to return "i dont play competitive golf i dont have anything in common with tiger woods i just want to have fun " says mr koppenhaver "so why not let me play with clubs that can help make that happen " an analogy to the ski industry is floating around golf circles these days if there had been a usga equivalent in skiing critics say there never would have been snowboards "ski resort owners gradually dropped their resistance to snowboards when they saw how much fun people were having with them " mr koppenhaver says "they began to build areas with the extreme conditions that snowboarders wanted both types of skiing now coexist and the change probably saved that industry " bifurcation is not likely to happen anytime soon a spokesman for the usga says the organization remains firmly committed to one set of rules for everyone most manufacturers are also reluctant to advocate bifurcation at least for now in part because their marketing efforts depend on the emotional connection everyday golfers make when they use the same clubs as the tour pros but the idea of bifurcation seems to be gaining a bit of traction and to some degree it already exists tour pros swing so consistently that they can be precisely fitted with top line clubs and balls that give them a huge advantage over amateurs its a subject that is not likely to go away soon another solution is speeding up the time it takes to play golf the old paradigm of spending all day saturday and sunday at the course and maybe also one weekday afternoon just doesnt fly much anymore starting years ago efforts were made to create more high end practice facilities with realistic targets short game practice areas nice amenities and sometimes affiliated par three or shorter than standard "executive" courses the concept was to make it possible for players to have a meaningful golf "experience" in just an hour or two many of these facilities have become economically viable but alternative golf has not proved to be the silver bullet solution that some had hoped for one idea making the rounds now is to build new regulation length courses or reconfigure old ones in three six hole loops rather than the traditional two nine hole loops that would provide players with the option of playing rounds of six holes holes or holes depending on how much time they have another strategy which the pga is testing through experimental programs is to encourage more two ball play in this method a foursome divides into two teams of two then the teams compete using one ball each the partners take alternate shots which significantly speeds up the game special times need to be set aside at a course for twosome play to proceed still another approach is simply marshaling the pace of play more aggressively the scott lake course in western michigan is among many across the u s that have had success promoting faster rounds hours tops if a group falls behind a marshal will accompany it for several holes and rather than folding his arms and glaring offer friendly helpful advice on how to speed up play "a lot of slow golfers simply dont know how to play faster " mr koppenhaver says meanwhile a handful of daily fee courses certify players as "fast golfers" and allow only them to play during certain times such as weekend mornings from a m to a m reducing costs could also boost the participation of core players the gradual escalation in golf costs over the past few years has affected all segments of the market to compete against the numerous new high end courses many formerly inexpensive municipal and daily fee courses boosted their green fees sometimes to reflect outlays for course improvements and other times just because they thought they could for many players the difference between paying &# and &# per round including cart is enough to make them cut back on rounds significantly so what are golf inc s chances of getting back on track not bad at all revenue from the sale of clubs and balls has been trending upward slightly despite the flat participation statistics thanks partly to ever more expensive high tech clubs and the net loss of courses last year primarily reflects a necessary culling after an ill advised building boom in the s the biggest positive for golf in coming years is the retiring cohort of baby boomers with more time on their hands to play and healthier bodies than their parents had boomers alone should increase rounds played to more than million by from roughly million now according to the national golf foundation that projection is based only on demographic growth it doesnt take into account any potential improvements aimed at enticing golfers to play more rounds if golf inc learns to do a few important things better it could see twice as much growth says joe beditz head of the ngf golf inc might even accomplish what its been trying to do all along bring in newcomers maybe someday golf will be so quick economical and easy to learn that even most rank beginners will stick with it mr newport writes the wall street journals golf journal column he can be reached at
