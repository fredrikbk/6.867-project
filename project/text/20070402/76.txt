stock market quarterly review commodities prices hit choppy waters commodity markets went on another wild ride in the first quarter and there could be more volatility ahead the quarter finished on a high note as oil copper and other commodities staged a big rally after some fell sharply at the beginning of the year by the end of march many analysts were scrambling to ratchet up commodity price forecasts just weeks after some were predicting further drops in the end commodities generally ended higher the dow jones aig commodity index climbed while the energy heavy goldman sachs commodity index recently acquired by the standard &amp poors unit of mcgraw hill cos rose in the three month period just ended when adjusted for "total return " which includes the costs investors incur when they sell expiring futures contracts and buy new ones these indexes also rose the goldman sachs indexs total return rose while the dow jones aig total return rose the big ups and downs in commodity markets during the quarter leave many investors uncertain about the long term outlook and whether the long running commodity bull market is finally peaking for now many say the cycle has room to run in part because demand from china remains strong and resources companies still struggle to keep up with orders overall "demand is still robust supply growth is still proving troublesome and stocks are still low in most commodities " says simon toyne an analyst at numis securities in london but analysts often disagree about which prices will rise and which will fall most are bullish about agricultural commodities which continue to get a push from demand for crop based alternative fuels like ethanol merrill lynch &amp co citigroup inc and other investment banks also upgraded their forecasts for some industrial commodities in late march including aluminum and coal despite concerns that slowing economic growth in the u s could lead to weaker economic activity world wide this year oil and mining companies are slowly but surely initiating new projects that should bring more supply onto the market especially for metals such as copper although many of those projects are experiencing unexpected delays or cost overruns they eventually should help bring supply back into harmony with demand taking away some of the pressure driving commodity prices higher over the past couple of years in one recent report analysts at goldman sachs group inc said they remained "neutral" on commodities amid a global deceleration of economic growth though they said that the outlook for energy was "positive" and that risks in their forecast are "skewed to the upside " the recent trajectory of oil prices illustrates the markets uncertainties after hitting a peak of &# a barrel last year oil began to slide amid milder than expected winter weather in the u s oil ended at &# a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange and then proceeded to fall further briefly below &# a barrel in january by march oil prices were soaring again because of signs of renewed growth in demand also the organization of petroleum exporting countries declined to raise production targets when it met in vienna in mid march oil closed at &# a barrel friday up for the quarter "global petroleum demand is now growing on all cylinders " merrill lynch analyst francisco blanch said in a recent note to clients he cited surging demand for autos in emerging economies among other factors but without much clarity on global growth and no obvious new trigger for a big leap in prices few are talking about the prospect of &# oil a price some thought possible a year ago "our sense is that were going to be going to the &# to &# region " said michael lewis global head of commodities at deutsche bank ag in london but "theres not much appetite for taking big bets right now" given the uncertainty about growth copper one of the most heavily traded industrial metals went on its own wild ride in the first quarter it tumbled below &# a pound in february to its lowest level in nearly a year in part because of fears of a slowing u s economy and fading demand for new houses which use a lot of copper by the end of the quarter copper was back up to &# a pound as china cranked up imports to replace stockpiles and the u s housing market failed to unravel as much as some analysts expected it is hard to predict where copper is headed citigroup recently said it expects a "second half rally" in copper merrill lynch said copper "is in a bear market" with possible oversupply the biggest surprise of the first quarter and some say the biggest commodity at risk of a correction in the months ahead was nickel an important ingredient in stainless steel demand for the metal continues to run red hot and there are only a handful of major new mines under construction world wide two of the biggest are facing cost blowouts and other problems some agricultural prices fell during the first quarter but many analysts believe prices will remain high by historical standards and could rise again over the next year thanks to the increasing demand for crop based biofuels after climbing much of last year corn slipped to &# per bushel during the first quarter wheat also fell but some analysts are now looking for other crops such as cotton and soybeans to enjoy additional upward price pressure as farmers shift more acreage to corn leading to lower harvests of other crops among precious metals gold rose to &# per troy ounce
