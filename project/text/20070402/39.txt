how an ibm lifer built software unit into a rising star increasingly the public face of international business machines corp is that of steve mills mr mills heads ibms rich and acquisition hungry software unit which has buoyed results in recent quarters he frequently represents the company at investor conferences and software customer gatherings and his rising profile reflects a new reality at the technology giant ibm still gets most of its reputation from its computers and most of its revenue from services but most of its profit growth comes from software after software acquisitions since for about &# billion the company is trolling for more mr mills says his group is likely to become increasingly visible because more than half of its revenue is finally coming from fast growing software areas offsetting declines in old mainframe related software "ive been doing off broadway for years " says mr mills "now its like i have a hit series " on a stand alone basis ibm would have had the second highest revenue of any software company after microsoft corp software revenue grew in the fourth quarter and reached &# billion last year software accounts for only of total revenue but of earnings fast growing ibm brands include websphere a variety of internet tools for business which gained last year tivoli which manages computer systems up and lotus which makes email software up mr mills is credited with helping to persuade the company to emphasize software and with taking a disciplined approach to making and integrating acquisitions ibm buys smaller often closely held companies with arcane products and little reputation outside the tech community the most it has paid for a company in the past six years is the &# billion it laid out in for rational software a maker of tools used by software developers the idea mr mills explains is to buy companies with unique products that can grow faster when sold by ibms giant sales force mr mills says he wont buy a company just to get more salespeople or new customers since ibm already sells some products to virtually all large enterprises instead he tries to make sure they "can accelerate their revenue two or even three times" as fast as part of ibm once acquired companies are put through an integration process that was initiated in at mr millss instigation john patrick a former software group executive says that one of the keys to ibms success in software was mr millss recognition in that the internet would be used by big business for more than advertising that led mr mills to order programmers to develop its websphere software using open standards that other companies could easily link up with a risky decision because it could have made it easy to replace it mr patrick says john swainson chief executive of rival ca inc who used to work for mr mills at ibm says his former boss "fought the battles when it wasnt popular to say that ibm had to be in software " mr mills years old is the same age as ibm chairman samuel palmisano so hes not regarded internally as a candidate for the top job both are likely to retire in five years at ibms normal retirement age of mr mills one of just two of ibms top executive team who hasnt been replaced or moved since mr palmisano became ceo is an ibm lifer he started as a mainframe salesman on the at&amp t account in new york city after graduation from union college and worked in finance for several years before taking over management of one of ibms software labs his total compensation was &# million last year today he says he still spends a number of hours each week with customers he jokes "i was a psychology major unlike most ibm executives i use my degree every day " ibms ever expanding suite of software touches some unexpected corners of corporate activity franklin alvarez manager of construction services for consolidated edison inc says that software made by filenet a ibm acquisition allows the new york utilitys construction workers to use wireless hand held devices to confirm they have signed permits from the city before they open up a street something that used to require couriers physically bringing the documents after acquiring a company mr millss person sales force has to move fast to get trained in the acquired software and to pitch it to their customers ibm says companies acquired from to averaged revenue growth the year after they were acquired including closely held candle corp which ibm bought for &# million in june and saw its revenue surge to &# million the subsequent year six years ago while acquiring database maker informix mr mills ordered executives to keep a record of what worked and what didnt in order to standardize the way acquisitions are integrated he also started ibms sophisticated "signature selling system" that categorizes and tracks sales opportunities on a weekly basis some salesmen groused about the paperwork but ibm later adopted the system for its entire sales force as soon as an acquisition is completed ibm sends in a transition team "every employee gets an ibm employee as a buddy " mr mills says on the very day ibm completed its acquisition of las vegas based srd inc in founder steve jonas says the new owner renamed all srd products "theres a process called blue washing " he says srd specialized in software that helps casinos comb public and private databases to check whether a job applicant might be living at the same address as someone nevada regulators had banned or if a contractor had an arrest record the u s department of homeland security adopted the software after to check on suspected terrorists last year mr mills asked mr jonas to speak about the products uses at a presentation he made to ibms top customers on wall street opening up another potential market the road to such a successful transition started before the acquisition mr jonas says when mr mills spent time with him discussing the technology and how it fit with ibm products he was mr jonas says "paying attention "
