lockheeds growth plan must overcome missteps cost overruns lost assignments weigh on new pacts after a string of high profile contract wins and a stellar run on the stock market lockheed martin corp is encountering turbulence in a number of weapons programs central to its expansion into new markets cost overruns have prompted the navy to demand tougher contract terms for a new warship that is intended to prowl enemy shores poor grades from the navy for work on helicopters for ferrying the president undermined lockheeds bid for a bigger &# billion air force chopper contract the coast guard has taken away some work from a joint venture between lockheed and northrop grumman corp because of snafus on a &# billion year project to overhaul the services ship and aircraft fleets circumstances differ among the programs and government agencies or lockheeds corporate teammates on the various projects share responsibility for the hiccups officials and industry executives say the navy for one changed aspects of its ship and helicopter programs after awarding the contracts still the cases highlight risks as lockheed the dominant warplane maker seeks to maintain growth by aggressively venturing into areas it is less familiar with as a prime contractor in such a role a company manages the design work subcontractors and relations with the government and typically receives the biggest share of profit the various problems arent likely to dent profit at lockheed based in bethesda md and the biggest u s defense company by sales which forecasts revenue of more than &# billion and operating margins of as it benefits from the boom in defense spending in the past two years lockheed has seen net income nearly double to &# billion last year and added nearly &# billion to its cash generation which was &# billion in its financial returns and wide ranging contract wins have made lockheed the top performing defense stock it gained in and is up over the past weeks but the current troubles could jeopardize future prospects and they are raising questions about a company that prides itself on its ability to integrate and manage advanced technology programs whether its the joint strike fighter combat plane a military communications network or the next manned space capsule "we wonder if the companys engineering base is stretched too thin or having trouble retaining talent " merrill lynch defense analyst ronald epstein wrote in a recent report byron callan of prudential equity group expressed confidence in robert stevens lockheeds chairman and chief executive and the companys overall operations but he said that recent challenges suggest lockheeds program "execution is not superior to other defense" prime contractors the stock doesnt deserve a premium to its peers he added lockheed spokesman tom jurkowsky said that the company is successfully performing on more than contracts "while we are disappointed with issues that have occurred on a few of our prime programs we understand that we are in the business of developing complex systems " he said "when issues occur we will work with the customer and commit the resources of the corporation to resolve any problem " lockheed faces a tight deadline to salvage its role developing the littoral combat ship or lcs a small swift supposedly inexpensive vessel that is designed for missions along enemy coasts navy secretary donald winter halted work on lockheeds second ship in january as cost projections for the hull of the inaugural ship climbed to between &# million and &# million from the navys target of &# million last month mr winter said lockheed could resume work if it agreed by mid april to switch to a fixed price contract instead of the current standard development contract in which the government reimburses the contractor for costs and pays a fee on top fixed price contracts shift risk to the contractor and typically are used by the pentagon only after development kinks are ironed out and full production starts lockheed executives have defended the companys performance and attributed the cost increases to higher steel prices a subcontractors faulty engine part which caused a week delay and a change of navy specifications for the ship in which added &# million several financial analysts believe that lockheed might reject a fixed price contract lockheed and the navy say they are negotiating the program but cant elaborate lockheed says it regularly reported the cost increases to navy program officials mr winter said he learned of them only early this year and he removed some senior program officials after the revelations morgan stanley analyst heidi wood says lockheed may have erred by not alerting top navy brass sooner "handling your customer as a ship prime contractor is new lesson learned for lockheed " she says but ms wood also questions the navys response saying "navy ships are commonly over budget which makes it difficult to point a finger solely at lockheed " veteran shipbuilder general dynamics corp is developing a rival lcs and experiencing cost growth of between and equivalent to lockheed a navy spokesman says the ship isnt as far along as lockheeds and mr winter says general dynamics may yet be required to work for a fixed price too general dynamics spokesman kendall pease says "our ship is complete so to give any meaningful cost estimate would be premature " lockheed has butted heads with the navy over the fleet of new marine piloted presidential helicopters after lockheed won the prestigious contract the sides haggled for months over navy requests for equipment and testing changes despite a tight delivery schedule navy officials say they now have confidence in the development plan but the navys earlier reservations dissuaded the air force from choosing lockheed and the same european built chopper as the services combat rescue helicopter
