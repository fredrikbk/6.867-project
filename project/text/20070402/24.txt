golf a special report a whole lot of sole golf shoes arent just about style these days theyre also about performance for a growing number of golfers even the shoes they wear dont mean a thing if they dont help that swing footwear makers are increasingly focusing on engineering shoes that promise to give golfers more stability and flexibility when swinging their clubs the idea is that those qualities will result in better shots and golfers apparently are buying it in sales of golf footwear at on course shops and off course specialty stores in the u s rose to a record &# million according to tom stine co founder of golf datatech a market research company based in kissimmee fla sales of golf shoes have increased steadily in the past four years he says he attributes that partly to "golfers buying more pairs of shoes perhaps influenced by new styles and new technology in footwear which have been prevalent in footwear over all the brands over the last four or five years " thats a big deal for a once sleepy category in the golf industry for the most part manufacturers and golfers alike long treated shoes as a mere accessory more on a par with apparel than with clubs the new emphasis on performance is part of a continuing evolution of the golf shoe and of the sport itself industry experts say in recent years golf shoes have been incorporating styles colors and technologies typically found in other athletic shoes part of that is because a newer generation of athletic golfers most notably tiger woods has played a role in getting the world to think of golf more as a physical sport not just a leisurely activity for out of shape retirees and part time duffers "the perception of golf has changed " says mike forsey global product director for footwear and equipment at nike golf "before the perception was you can kind of come and drink while playing but now athletes are playing the sport of golf tiger has a pretty rigid workout program so the shoe construction and performance needs have definitely changed theres more sport influence " one of the newest entries in the performance shoe market is from nike inc the company came out with a shoe in february called the sp tw tour which it lists for &# the shoe is designed so that the instep side of the sole flexes independently from the rest of the sole the company says this keeps the rear foot grounded longer during a swing generating more power in the stroke that same month adidas ag began selling a line of golf shoes called powerband the shoes feature a supportive shell that wraps around the perimeter of the sole which is supposed to offer the golfer more leverage and stability when swinging the &# shoe also is designed to eliminate movement of the foot inside the shoe "it locks your foot in place so that throughout the swing the foot and shoe act as a single unit " says dave ortley global director of footwear for adidas golf "by eliminating foot slip inside the shoe we erase a common power leak that golfers face with conventional less technical footwear " a new &# shoe from fortune brands inc s footjoy brand called reelfit eschews laces in favor of a dial on the back of the shoe that is supposed to allow for a more precise fit the shoe introduced last fall wont loosen during play like a laced shoe can footjoy says and of course untied laces arent a problem cleats are also getting more attention with shoemakers focusing on keeping golfers feet solidly planted during a swing arnold ravick a podiatrist with a private practice in washington and a spokesman for the american podiatric medical association says golf "is like track in a way its totally about how you grip the ground if you dont grip the ground as well you dont get as much push with your swing " he adds that the combination of stability and flexibility is important because "when you swing and you twist your torso you want to keep your feet as a stable support base but you need a little bit of flexibility or youd sprain your ankle before in old golf shoes there was less adherence and no flexibility this is a big improvement " a new line of shoes from ecco sko as under the name flexor is one of several that feature removable cleats that lock in place to ensure that the cleats are fully tightened and that they wont come loose the flexor shoes also have multiple points on each cleat to enhance their grip "similar to a claw " says c b tuite general manager golf at ecco usa the shoes cost between &# and &# adidas says its tour line has lugs the small gripping elements attached to the bottom of the shoe spaced amply apart to reduce the chances of debris and grass getting caught in between and affecting traction the tour shoes introduced last year also feature a wrap that hugs the instep outstep and arch of the foot to keep golfers centered as they are swinging new shoes from callaway golf co under the xtt name &# to &# have cleat receptacles that shift to better conform to the surface the golfer is standing on xtt stands for what the company calls its "xtra traction technology " "each of those spikes adjusts similar to an off road vehicle with independent suspension on every tire " says james gorman director of global operations for footwear at callaway golf almost all of the newest models of golf shoes also feature improved waterproofing and comfort cushioning and styles have changed along with design in fact bright colors logos and the occasional use of clear materials in portions of the shoe are often meant to call attention to the shoes performance oriented features new styles and colors have done a lot to boost interest in golf shoes mr stine says but "stability traction and comfort" are the most important features in the end mr smith is a staff
