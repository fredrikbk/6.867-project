pump games fill up with ethanol one obstacle is big oil rules keep a key fuel out of some stations car makers push back president bush domestic auto makers farmers and others tout ethanol as a home grown alternative to imported oil across the midwest plants that make the fuel out of corn are multiplying at a torrid pace yet so far only a tiny fraction of u s service stations let a driver fill up with ethanol there are a number of reasons but one big one is resistance from oil companies although some oil executives voice enthusiasm for alternative fuels oil company policies make it harder for many service stations to stock a fuel called e a blend of ethanol and gasoline these policies are hardly the only barrier to wider use of the ethanol fuel demand is limited by the small number of vehicles that can burn it only about of those on the road in america it can be slightly costlier to burn e even though it costs less per gallon because a car doesnt go as far on a gallon of the ethanol fuel as on gasoline these demand restraints would limit service station owners enthusiasm for spending on the equipment needed to offer e even if the policies of the oil companies were not a factor but those policies add a significant extra obstacle oil companies lose sales every time a driver chooses e and they employ a variety of tactics that help keep the fuel out of stations that bear the company name for instance franchises sometimes are required to purchase all the fuel they sell from the oil company since oil companies generally dont sell e the stations cant either unless the company grants an exception and lets them buy from another supplier contracts sometimes limit advertising of e and restrict the use of credit cards to pay for it some require that any e pump be on a separate island not under the main canopy oil companies say they will allow stations to sell e but they must have certain rules for the protection of customers and protection of their brand they call the restrictions reasonable and in some cases necessary to make sure drivers dont fill up with e if their vehicle cant burn it most of the u s s fuel stations arent owned by oil companies but are either franchised from them or independent less than stock e some experts say that to really take hold and be seen as a viable alternative to gasoline the fuel would have to be available at roughly of stations those pushing for ethanol are targeting two very different types of fuel stations those run by big retailers like kroger co and wal mart stores inc and independent ones owned by small businesses these represent the biggest and smallest of businesses but have one thing in common they arent under the thumb of the oil industry nearly half of the gasoline sold in the u s does have some ethanol in it oil companies routinely use it as an additive typically at ethanol to gasoline because the corn based fuel burns cleaner the blending enables companies to meet government smog reduction rules they also add ethanol because of a federal mandate on the industry as a whole requiring that it use a certain amount of "renewable" fuels in its products among those pressing for wider use of e are domestic auto makers especially ford motor co and general motors corp ethanol is one energy initiative where theyre out in front of japanese car makers while toyota motor corp and honda motor co are known for their gasoline electric hybrids detroit which has been heavily criticized for its sales of gas guzzlers is far ahead in making "flexible fuel" vehicles that can burn either gasoline or ethanol in dwight ill beckers bp on interstate is one of just a few dozen major brand gasoline retailers in the u s that sell e owner phil becker says the governor wanted the states vehicles to use e and targeted his station as a popular stop for state workers he says bp plc let him get the fuel from a non bp supplier and the illinois corn growers association gave him &# for new tanks and pumps that bp required "because ive got e and weve advertised it weve had four or five farmers that traded their trucks to get e vehicles " mr becker says exxon mobil corp s standard contract with exxon stations bars them from buying fuel from anybody but itself and it doesnt sell e a spokeswoman for exxon mobil says it makes exceptions case by case even if one is granted the station must follow rules including one that says e must be dispensed from its own unit not part of an existing multihose dispenser "this minimizes customer confusion around vehicle compatibility issues and maintains product quality integrity " says the spokeswoman prem nair a conocophillips memo to franchisees says the company doesnt allow e sales on the primary island under the covered canopy where gasoline is sold stations must find another spot as a result it isnt quite as simple for a driver to decide on the spur of the moment to fill up with e conocophillips declines to comment a chevron corp agreement with franchisees also appears to discourage selling e under the main canopy it says dealers offering alternative fuels cannot "deceive the public as to the source of the product " a phrase that some gas station interests interpret to mean that e cant be sold under the main canopy chevron says it recommends but doesnt require that e pumps be outside the canopy chevron says it requires chevron and texaco branded stations to keep "e" off their primary signs listing fuel prices to show the fuels price and alert approaching drivers that e is for sale the stations have to erect a separate sign another chevron recommendation makes it much more expensive for a station to offer e at all stations usually have three tanks for the three gasoline grades regular mid grade and premium the easiest way to offer e in addition to these three is to convert the mid grade tank to e such a station can still offer mid grade gasoline because a "blender pump" can mix some regular with some premium and mid grade will come out of the hose but chevrons agreement with station owners recommends they install new pumps and tanks at their own expense if they want to stock e doing so can cost more than &# per station according to a fuel station trade group in washington state called automotive united trades organization chevron says it requires special tanks only if theyre needed for safety oil companies also require stations to stock all three grades meaning stations may not simply replace a low selling mid grade with e at bp guidelines for stations that carry the company name bar any mention of e on signs on gasoline dispensers perimeter signs or light poles the stations also cant let buyers use pay at the pump credit card machines selling e is "not impossible its just that they really kind of hassle you to not put it in " says ron lamberty who owns two stations in south dakota one a bp station mr lamberty doesnt sell e even though he is director of market development for the american coalition for ethanol he says he is looking into adding the fuel to his bp station in sioux falls mr lamberty mocks bps "beyond petroleum" slogan "its beyond petroleum but not so far beyond petroleum that it would contain anything but petroleum " he says bp says its guidelines are in place so customers realize the mostly ethanol fuel isnt a bp product the company also bars stations from selling it under another brand name such as ve the brand of a maker in brookings s d called verasun energy corp a bp spokesman scott dean says "when youve got of your customers unable to use the product you want to be very very sure it is very clearly advertised " he says bp bought million gallons of ethanol last year to blend into u s gasoline in small amounts "bp is one of the largest if not the largest purveyor of biofuels in the u s and the world " mr dean says e also faces barriers having nothing to do with big oil like the limited number of cars that can burn it domestic auto makers have vowed to double production of flex fuel vehicles to about two million a year by and to make half of their new vehicles sold in america e capable by while the fuel usually costs less it can be costlier to drivers because they get about fewer miles per gallon from ethanol than from gasoline at a pro ethanol group called the iowa renewable fuels association executive director monte shaw estimates that e has to be at least to cents a gallon cheaper to compete with gasoline on price iowa statewide average prices on a recent day were &# a gallon for regular gasoline and &# for e according to a department of energy web site because e is less energy intensive the site said it would cost the average owner of a big chevy tahoe suv about &# a year to fuel it with e and &# to fuel it with regular gasoline the price of ethanol has risen in the past year partly because of demand from oil companies that want it for an additive this usage creates something of a conflict for big ethanol producers like archer daniels midland co their main ethanol customers are the oil companies customers for e are far smaller and more fragmented adm whose yearly output of billion gallons is more than of the domestic ethanol market says it is happy to sell e if someone wants it but that is a "very small" part of its business "near term we have focused more attention on the" additive side says an adm executive edward harjehausen even the main ethanol lobbying group in washington the renewable fuels association has focused mostly on developing the market for the fuel as an additive "if you have a pump that sells e but you dont have customers pulling up to that pump why do you want to bother " says bob deneen its chief lobbyist a few smaller producers do actively promote e such as verasun which seeks to establish a branded e but even the smaller producers sell the bulk of their output for blending as a gasoline additive because ethanol is more corrosive than gasoline theres some concern it could leak out of a standard dispensing system and spark a fire no e dispensing system nozzles hoses pumps has been certified by underwriters laboratories the organization that tests the safety of products in october ul suspended certification of parts that had been certified for use in e systems though there hadnt been any reports of problems ul said it decided it needed to do its own safety research results arent expected until late this year among those trying to overcome obstacles to e are the domestic auto makers they have built flex fuel vehicles for years because doing so gives them "credits" in their efforts to meet federal fuel economy standards without the credits ford and gm wouldnt have met mileage goals for light trucks in and and would have owed fines the mileage goals pose a bigger challenge to detroit because of its heavy reliance on large thirsty vehicles foreign makers generally havent resorted to building flex fuel cars to meet the mileage goals for detroit the credits applied even if the flex fuel cars they built never actually burned ethanol for a long time the auto makers said little about ethanol and many owners of flex fuel cars didnt know they had them but when gasoline prices surged in and gm and ford saw their flex fuel cars as a way to counter their image as gas guzzler makers both began promotional campaigns such as one in which gm gave buyers in chicago and minneapolis &# gift cards good for e gm began to work with state officials to find grants to pay for installing pumping equipment it has helped add e to stations ford helped pay for installing pumps so someone could drive from chicago to kansas city while filling up only with e among ethanol backers recruits are two grocery chains kroger installed e at about stations in ohio and texas privately held meijer inc did the same in michigan and indiana wal mart could provide a significant boost it said last year it was considering selling e at its company owned stations but hasnt made a decision the u s tax code acts as a stimulus service station owners can get a credit of up to &# for their outlays to convert equipment to sell e some states have done their bit to spur the market new york enacted a bill last year that barred oil companies from requiring stations to buy all of their fuel from the companies in the albany area station owner christian king has begun selling e at one of his three mobil outlets and plans to do so at a second he says mobils restrictions still mean he cant put the price of e on the main sign or let drivers charge it on their mobil credit cards adding e "is a personal thing " mr king says "im trying to do anything i can to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and if this thing kicks off im in a position to benefit "
