stock market quarterly review after a scare overseas rally survives foreign stocks quickly recover has fever broken foreign stock markets went for a wild ride in the first quarter spooked by fears of a slowing u s economy and the ripple effects that a downturn could have globally but most foreign markets steadied by the end of the quarter leaving investors with some hope that the four year overseas rally remains intact the pullback began the last week of february amid signs that loans to the least creditworthy u s borrowers known as subprime loans were deteriorating investors worried that delinquencies in this corner of the property market could spread to the broader housing sector damping u s consumer appetites for foreign goods and commodities global markets suffered their biggest one day selloff feb with blue chip indexes falling between and after a nearly drop in shanghais main stock index further unsettled nerves "it was a pretty turbulent period " said shigeki makino a senior portfolio manager at putnam investments in boston "concerns about risk came back to the fore and people reined in their riskier bets pretty quickly " the dow jones stoxx index which measures the performance of major european companies advanced in the quarter tokyos nikkei stock average of companies was ahead while morgan stanleys emerging markets index edged up all did better than the dow jones industrial averages decline but these return figures belied the price swings to start the year and the sudden flight from riskier markets in late february latin america best exemplified the roller coaster nature of the quarter these stocks lost during the first week of the year bounced back until feb slid during the next days then bounced back another in the three weeks that followed the regions erratic performance reflects widespread investor confusion world economic expansion looks robust global interest rates are low on a historic basis and corporate profits are generally healthy moreover the late february selloff looked tame compared with one that hit foreign markets in may and june last year which caused emerging markets to plunge in two months before they regained their footing this time foreign stocks needed barely a week to stem their losses on the other hand stock prices in some emerging markets like china india and especially vietnam are starting to look expensive despite signs of accelerating expansion in europe and japan investors fret that a slowing u s economy would undermine stock markets globally this has investors hoping they can squeeze out one more year of positive returns before the aging rally runs out of steam "people had been expecting a correction it just came a bit earlier than they expected " says michael hartnett an emerging markets strategist with merrill lynch &amp co "now nerves are frayed and we look unlikely to return to the previous level of risk taking " here is a look at markets around the world europe major european markets chalked up modest gains with londons ftse index up the paris cac index higher and frankfurts dax index ahead they were buoyed by europes steady economic expansion stock prices that often look attractive relative to their u s peers and continued corporate restructuring and cost cutting through the relocation of jobs to eastern europe corporate profits regularly have beaten analyst expectations more than of european companies either met or exceeded earnings estimates when reporting results during the first quarter an improvement from the previous quarter according to citigroup inc but stock performance varied widely by industry reflecting in part the effects of a strengthening euro the currency which appreciated against the dollar on top of last years gain makes european goods more expensive abroad europes retail sector which includes many companies that sell primarily within europe was among the top performers up for the quarter the oil and gas sector was the worst performer falling japan during the week that most markets fell tokyos nikkei stock average of companies fell a more severe decline than in the u s or europe as foreign investors pulled out in droves japanese stock funds world wide added &# million in new cash during the quarter but that was down from &# billion in new flows a year ago according to emergingportfolio com fund research that is potentially worrying if the trend continues given the prominent role foreign investors have played in japans stock market in recent years emerging markets the morgan stanley capital international emerging market index tumbled between feb and march finishing up a hair for the quarter bonds and currencies for developing countries held up better this quarter than during the big selloff last spring helping stocks bounce back says geoffrey dennis at citigroup investment research strong commodity prices again lifted several developing world economies including peru where metal and mining companies helped power the lima index about higher brazil another commodity rich nation rose in the far east malaysia was among the big winners rising in vietnam a gain in the first quarter after a surge in has raised the specter of a stock market bubble indian stocks meanwhile slumped amid rising concerns that market values are too high the trade deficit is too large and the fast expanding economy might overheat the dow jones china broad market index which includes most of the shares that trade on the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges surged as it bounced back from the big one day decline george hoguet an investment strategist at state street global advisors says emerging market corporate profits overall are poised to rise in adding that stocks still look less expensive than those in the u s that should be enough he thinks for these stocks to enjoy their fifth straight year of gains something that hasnt happened since msci began tracking emerging markets in the s "the global environment is deteriorating " he says "but the local fundamentals are still strong "
