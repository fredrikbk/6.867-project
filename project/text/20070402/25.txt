golf a special report editors note my son is years old and a gifted athlete whether hes shooting baskets catching a football or throwing a javelin but ask him which sport he likes the best and he doesnt hesitate its golf every swing he says is its own game a chance to experience the rush that comes with a great shot how often would he like to play every day so how often did he play last year about a dozen times the game is simply too expensive he says and takes too long that gets at the heart of john paul newports fascinating thesis which he lays out in his cover story this issue golf john paul says has hurt itself in recent years by focusing too much on trying to get new players instead of trying to get the people who love the game to play more often if golf spent more time doing things to make life easier for its fervent followers such as keeping the cost down and speeding up play it would reap the benefits its a bold challenge to the sport and one it may not accept or have the nerve to act on but if it does i can offer this assurance at least one year old will be playing a lot more golf
