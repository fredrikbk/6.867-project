let all your thinks be thanks conventional wisdom has it that thanksgiving is the best of all american holidays as a contrarian id like to put that wisdom to the test thanksgiving does have the absence of the heavy hand of dreary gift giving that has put the groans in christmas the moans in hanukkah and no one has written treacly thanksgiving songs comparable to "white christmas" and "chestnuts roasting on an open fire " which i suspect have helped make christmas one of the prime seasons for suicide let us not speak of "rudolph the red nosed reindeer " of whose travail we shall all have heard more than our fill as we ride up elevators and pass along the aisles of department stores for some time in america we have of course been living under kindergarchy or rule by children if children do not precisely rule us then certainly all efforts in families where the smallish creatures still roam are directed to relieving their boredom if not hope against hope actually pleasing them let us be thankful that thanksgiving has not yet fallen to the kindergarchy as has just about every other holiday on the calendar with the possible exceptions of yom kippur and ramadan thanksgiving is not about children it remains resolutely an adult holiday about grown up food and drink and football the weather which provides the backdrop to thanksgiving is also much in its favor in most parts of the country cool sometimes cold it doesnt usually blow the holiday away with tornados hurricanes or great snow storms warm jackets sweaters corduroy trousers are the order of the day comfort clothes the sartorial equivalent of comfort food comfort food is what thanksgiving provides and to the highest possible power large browned turkeys rich heavy stuffings sweet potatoes cranberries but enough of this gastronomic porno everyone has in mind his or her own memories of splendid thanksgiving dinners my own are those my late mother in law used to give at her house on a small lake in michigan she was a dab cook everything fresh handsomely set out perfectly prepared without the least bit of pretension she invited her extended family roughly of us most of whom drove up from chicago the dominant figure at these dinners was a large ebullient red faced man named john lull the second husband of my wifes aunt phoebe john was at what mencken once called "the country club stage of culture" a man who lived for golf and food and drink had an eye for women at first sight he was your homme moyen sensuel except there was nothing very moyen about his sensuality which was pretty damn extraordinary diet cholesterol calories these were words that i never heard pass his lips thanksgiving dinners at my mother in laws always ended with a choice of three pies pumpkin mincemeat and apple john would chose a large slice of the apple requesting a slice of cheese placed atop it whereupon with a goofy smile he would announce with a regularity as if it were part of a liturgy "pie without cheese is like a kiss without a squeeze " pro football on television from detroit on thanksgiving is a remnant of the old patriarchy the patriarchy as we know is now all but dead and those of us who retain fond if dimming memories of it have alas nothing left to fight for but the double standard detroit regularly used to play green bay in these thanksgiving games and my memory of them is of famous quarterbacks bobby lane tobin rote bart starr eluding oncoming bruisers to complete impossible passes that won games in their final seconds an aging couch potato au gratin to be sure i still watch these thanksgiving games not having a horse in the race i am a chicago bears fan i view them with a fine detachment noting changes in the game since i long ago began wasting my time watching it among them the advent of foot inch quarterbacks the plus pound linemen the human equivalents of suvs thanksgiving also has inclusiveness going for it the holiday really is for all americans though i suppose a sourpuss leftist might with boring trenchancy be able to interject it isnt such a fine day for native americans while secular in tone thanksgiving is also slightly religious in spirit i am having thanksgiving this year at the home of my son and daughter in law and because of the slight religious nature of the holiday have asked them not to invite richard dawkins sam harris christopher hitchens or any of the rest of the atheist gang all of whom seem likely if on the premises to put a dampening spirit onto the proceedings i wish the poet w h auden were still alive so that he might be at the same table where i eat my thanksgiving dinner auden i think nicely captured the spirit of thanksgiving when he wrote that in prayer it is best to get the begging part over with quickly and get on to the gratitude part he also wrote "let all your thinks be thanks " to be living in a prosperous and boundlessly interesting country at a time of high technological achievement and of widening tolerance much to be thankful for here "wystan " id like to tell the poet "you got it right kid now how about a drumstick " mr epstein is the author most recently of "in a cardboard belt essays personal literary and savage" houghton mifflin
