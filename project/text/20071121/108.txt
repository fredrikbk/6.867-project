politics &amp economics for petraeus a balancing act commander in iraq sees gains but deep troop cuts may have price baghdad u s and iraqi forces have made significant progress against al qaeda in iraq in recent months contributing to a sharp improvement in the countrys security the top u s commander in iraq said gen david petraeus in an interview yesterday cautioned that it was too soon to conclude that al qaeda in iraq which has focused its attacks on shiite muslim targets has been defeated but he said the group had been weakened by a u s and iraqi campaign to kill or detain its leaders and cut off its supplies of weapons and ammunition another factor he said has been unexpected "robust" measures by syria to reduce the number of foreign militants crossing into iraq to carry out suicide attacks gen petraeus estimated that the number of foreign fighters coming into iraq through syria has fallen by at least one third "al qaeda has been dealt substantial blows " gen petraeus said "it certainly still remains dangerous but it is a threat that has been diminished " gen petraeus who is serving his third tour in iraq said the situation could change if al qaeda in iraq were to begin a new wave of attacks or if the shiite militia led by cleric moqtada al sadr were to resume its guerrilla war against u s forces the security improvements have sparked speculation that the bush administration may order a significant troop withdrawal next year in advance of the presidential and congressional elections the white house drawing on initial recommendations by gen petraeus already has announced plans to bring the troops who were part of this years "surge" out of iraq by next july the question now is whether the u s will go beyond those plans and if so how quickly gen petraeuss comments come at a moment of cautious optimism for u s commanders in iraq they believe the surge has contributed to a decline in violence across the country u s commanders said this week that major attacks have dropped since june while u s military and iraqi civilian deaths also have fallen sharply in recent months the overall level of violence in iraq is roughly what it was in january shortly before al qaeda in iraq destroyed a shiite shrine according to the u s military that attack sparked a wave of reprisal killings that left tens of thousands dead gen petraeus said the major combatants in iraqs sectarian strife are no longer fighting with the same intensity mr sadrs mahdi army iraqs largest shiite militia is generally honoring a cease fire many sunni arabs including nationalist insurgents who once fought u s troops have begun to work with the u s against extremist groups like al qaeda in iraq they have helped push the militants out of formerly restive parts of the country like anbar province anthony cordesman an analyst at the center for strategic and international studies in washington agreed with gen petraeus that the u s has scored a major success against al qaeda in iraq but he warned that this is "only part of the problem " he said sectarian violence and political disarray remain challenges "the risk is that the u s will win a military victory and almost by default the iraqi government will create a political defeat because they dont do enough to move towards political accommodation " mr cordesman said he cited the need for iraqs shiite led government to assist sunni areas and incorporate sunnis into iraqs security services gen petraeus said he hasnt begun to work on recommendations to the white house for the pace and scale of any additional troop reductions still he offered some insight into his thinking on troop withdrawals a sensitive political issue in iraq and the u s the commander said any future drawdown would be designed to ensure the u s maintained its recent security gains and could prevent insurgents from returning to areas vacated by u s forces the u s would seek to pull out of areas only that are free of violence or protected by capable iraqi security forces or tribal allies he said u s forces would likely remain albeit in smaller numbers than today in restive parts of the country or in areas that lack strong iraqi military or police units "we want to maintain the gains that have been made and in fact to build on them " he said gen petraeus offered another note of caution on iran saying it continues to represent a major source of instability senior u s officials have long alleged that iran has funneled advanced weaponry into iraq including sophisticated roadside bombs capable of punching through u s armored vehicles these are known as explosively formed penetrators or efps iran has denied its government has knowingly funneled weapons into iraq or trained shiite militants there this month senior iranian officials told their iraqi counterparts that tehran would take steps to reduce the amount of iranian armaments flowing into iraq the number of attacks involving efps has since fallen sharply and iraqi officials recently praised iran for honoring its promise yesterday iraq said that it would hold a new round of low level security talks with iran and the u s gen petraeus said the u s hasnt found any large scale caches of efps since the iranian iraqi accord was announced several weeks ago but he said it was too soon to tell how much credit if any iran deserved for the recent falloff in efp attacks iran made "unequivocal pledges to stop the funding training arming and directing of militia extremists in iraq " he said "it will be hugely significant if thats the case "having said that there is very much a wait and see attitude by everyone involved to see if iran will live up to those commitments " gen petraeus said he said he was disappointed that iraqs central government hasnt passed legislation giving more power to iraqs provinces and allowing tens of thousands of sunni arabs formerly in saddam husseins baath party to return to their state jobs still he expressed cautious optimism the country had seen a change for the better "you dont go from bad to good you go from bad to less bad " he said "progress accumulates over time and you try to build on momentum as it is established "
