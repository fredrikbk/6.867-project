mortgage mess curtails wagoners honeymoon the meltdown in the mortgage market and slumping car sales have combined to sour general motors corp chief executive rick wagoners brief honeymoon with wall street the auto giants stock has fallen since it reached a three year high of &# a share a month ago on the strength of cost cuts tied to its new labor contract with the united auto workers as auto sales have continued to falter trouble has erupted on other fronts including a big bet on subprime mortgage lending made on mr wagoners watch mr wagoner years old had earned high marks from many analysts and investors for reaching the new labor deal which will allow gm to hand off billions of dollars in retiree health care obligations to a union run trust and reduce employees in its ailing north american operations but gms current problems if they linger could test that goodwill bill smith president of sam advisors in new york says gm "bar none has the best product portfolio on the planet" and there is little gm could have done to predict the meltdown in the subprime market still mr smith whose firm owns gm shares is increasingly pessimistic about mr wagoners ability to deliver better returns for shareholders after being a big supporter over the past two years mr wagoner he insists "fumbled the ball" when it came to sustaining momentum in the share price gm declined to make mr wagoner available for comment on the companys new troubles but gm spokesman tony cervone says that over the long term the new contract has greatly improved the companys outlook "theres no question our competitive position in the automotive market is as good as its been in decades " he says he also maintains that the auto maker is poised to take advantage of the increased u s demand it is expecting and that its strength in emerging markets continues to gain momentum the most recent driver of doubts on wall street has been uncertainty over gms mortgage exposure the troubles involve residential capital llc a mortgage unit of financial services firm gmac financial services llc rescap a once hugely profitable mortgage operation partly owned by gm through its stake in gmac reported a huge quarterly loss investors are now searching for the bottom at rescap trading the units debt securities at levels usually associated with a company that could soon seek bankruptcy court protection gmac and rescap have indicated no such plan but to exacerbate gms woes now some analysts are raising red flags about rising delinquencies on gmacs auto loans meanwhile gm rattled investors by writing off nearly &# billion in tax credits carried as assets on its balance sheet effectively conceding it has no likelihood of earning enough profit from its core u s and german markets in the near term to make immediate use of them delphi corp gms former parts making unit proposed a revised plan for exiting from bankruptcy that slashed the cash it would pay to gm by &# billion at the same time gms core mature market auto operations in north america and western europe continue to bleed cash and sales in the u s are falling faster than gm expected but costs for raw materials are higher than projected the convergence of bad news and blown projections has pushed gm shares below &# making gms market capitalization and share price lower than they were when mr wagoner initiated his latest restructuring program in april since the oct high gms market cap has fallen by more than &# billion to about &# billion or less than a th of the value of its chief rival toyota motor corp for mr wagoner the recent plunge comes years after the company slipped into crisis mode under his watch and months after he successfully defeated an effort by then shareholder kirk kerkorian to broker an alliance between gm and renault nissan the automotive alliance led by carlos ghosn soon after seeing off mr ghosn mr wagoner said good riddance to mr kerkorian and his representative on gms board former chrysler corp and international business machines corp executive jerome york mr york resigned from gms board in october via an open letter that expressed skepticism about the durability of mr wagoners turnaround mr wagoner and his allies countered that gms turnaround was robust and gathering momentum gm north america was narrowing its losses operations in china were profitable new models were in the pipeline some investors say gms long term outlook remains encouraging "the silver lining is that on the automotive side of things the business model is probably a lot better " bnp paribas automotive trading specialist brad rubin says "if they hadnt done the restructuring gm would have without doubt had to file chapter " instead mr rubin says "gm weathered that storm " "i think there is a lot of concern around rescap " valueworks chief investment officer charles lemonides says noting there are short positions in about million gm shares or nearly of the shares outstanding still mr lemonides whose firm owns gm shares insists "sure there is a lot of risk but it doesnt exist to gm shareholders and even if there were a risk to us general motors corp is still a buy at &# " resolving the uncertainty at rescap will be critical for gm gmac insists its exposure to subprime mortgages is the equivalent of about &# billion measured against a net worth of about &# billion gmacs lead investor cerberus capital management llp is primarily managing the company as rescap scrambles to recover from a &# billion loss in the third quarter last week gmac said it will bring in a new chief financial officer gmac executives say rescap is working to reduce its payroll and its lending operations gm has four executives including mr wagoner sitting on gmacs board and analysts forecast deep gmac related losses at gm if the situation isnt fixed to understand how much gm has to lose in relation to gmac and rescap it is instructive to know how much gm had originally planned to gain from its interest in the company even as buyers increasingly abandoned high profit trucks and suvs in leading to a bottoming out of gms u s operations the auto maker was banking more and more of its near term earnings prospects on the origination and selling of subprime loans at gmac which was fully owned by gm at the time as its credit ratings sank because of its close ties to gm gmac increasingly relied on the subprime market as executives scrambled to offset higher borrowing costs by making higher margin loans as a result gmacs mortgage operations represented of gms total earnings in and in the first quarter seeing gmac as a strategic asset mr wagoner decided to sell a controlling stake in the lending company in order to boost credit ratings by delinking gmac from gm at a board meeting early in directors debated the idea of selling rescap entirely while hanging on to gmacs auto lending unit which is considered core to gms auto business people familiar with the strategy say gm decided to sell of all of gmac rather than splitting off the mortgage unit to maximize the cash proceeds of the deal cerberus agreed to pay more than &# billion for the gmac stake including control of rescap in april even as its chief executive stephen a feinberg privately expressed doubts about the health of the mortgage industry according to a person familiar with the executives thinking since the cerberus deal closed last november gmac has encountered a series of unexpected setbacks because of rescaps exposure to subprime loans gm was forced to inject &# billion of equity into gmac during the first quarter to reconcile what cerberus originally agreed to pay and the lower value of gmac when the sale closed gms stake in gmac has led to about &# million in losses through the first nine months of the year and those losses could mount gmacs auto lending business may be forced to tighten lending standards to cope with an uptick in delinquencies which could in turn make it more difficult or more costly for gms auto marketing operations to sell cars a pressing issue for gm is whether the rescap debacle will force gm to pony up more cash for the unit at a time when its auto operations are still burning cash "weve not made nor do we plan to make any injections into rescap " frederick henderson gms chief financial officer said during a conference call earlier this month he says gm will continue to work with cereberus and gmac management to resolve the problems "liquidity has improved at rescap " mr henderson said "but in terms of the outlook for profitability i cant really give you a good solid prognostication " corrections &amp amplifications general motors corp sold of gmac financial services following a board meeting in early in some editions a marketplace article on nov
