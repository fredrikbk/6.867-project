business where ecological and economical meet michael dell and mark hurd arent big on save the planet rhetoric but the bosses of dell inc and hewlett packard co respectively are excited about their newest computers energy savings their message of focusing on lower costs and proven technology shows what big business can realistically achieve with environmental initiatives instead of championing radical responses to high energy prices their companies rely on constant tinkering with existing technology knowing that prosaic efficiency gains add up both executives talk about energy efficiency as if it were just another selling point for their customers which it is they speak in terms of return on investment and payback periods "whether you care about green as in the environment or green as in cash in your wallet weve got something for you " mr dell said during a visit to the wall street journal last week some new products could pay for themselves in energy savings within a year he said "customers love that its not a frou frou discussion to them " public sentiment for so called eco or green solutions to americas energy challenges has prompted makers of everything from gasoline to shampoo to portray themselves as environmentally conscious their campaigns might sound good in public relations pitch meetings but when slogans arent backed up with action they seem forced even artificial this "greenwashing " with its brochures full of waving wheat stalks and third world landscapes often seems merely an attempt to disarm social critics by contrast when major computer companies talk about energy savings its all about dollars mr dell cites his companys newest personal computers which consume &# a year in electricity versus as much as &# a year for older models mr hurd talks about ways h p has increased the computing power in its data centers while trimming power consumption costs or more taken in isolation most of the energy saving techniques used by dell h p and others are hardly heroic the manufacturers are putting more energy efficient fan parts in computers they are making better use of computers idle time and they are lining up arrays of servers at customer sites so the exhausts flow in the same direction instead of having one machines hot air output become another ones intake such pokey process improvements are how lots of industrial progress happens in the computer industry many of them were overdue companies spent most of their s boom times improving computing muscle and speed without paying much heed to power issues major computer customers began banging the table in demanding that manufacturers focus more on power consumption says charles odonnell a power and cooling expert at the division of emerson that helps corporate data centers manage resources "its among their top three concerns now " he said "it used to be seventh or eighth " progress in other industries may be harder customers spending cycles are far longer in sectors such as aviation so even if jet engine makers can offer gains in fuel efficiency with their newest models airlines may balk at unloading planes a mere five years into a year life cycle to make room for something better still &# a barrel oil commands attention retail gasoline prices are up in the past year according to the federal energy information administration diesel prices have climbed and aviation fuel has soared for anyone making products with motors the impact of those price surges on customers is too big to ignore one of the best overall listening posts is linear technology corp which makes power management devices for thousands of industrial customers don paulus head of linears power business unit said manufacturers of everything from marine engines to tractors have expressed interest in energy savings "most of them have never had any silicon in their products before " he said general electric co which bet big a few years ago on environmentalism as a profitable business center has plenty to smile about its erie pa locomotive unit is rolling out models for &# million to &# million apiece that could offer fuel savings of or as much as &# a year per locomotive ge says its erie plants inventory is sold out and the facility has a backlog of to locomotives ironically as energy efficiency programs become a bigger chunk of companies profits its likely well hear less rhetoric about them energy efficiency could become a major competitive battleground full of trade secrets when the likes of messrs hurd and dell start waving off questions so that the competition wont catch on thats when well know "green" initiatives are really paying off
