and the fair land any one whose labors take him into the far reaches of the country as ours lately have done is bound to mark how the years have made the land grow fruitful this is indeed a big country a rich country in a way no array of figures can measure and so in a way past belief of those who have not seen it even those who journey through its northeastern complex into the southern lands across the central plains and to its western slopes can only glimpse a measure of the bounty of america and a traveler cannot but be struck on his journey by the thought that this country one day can be even greater america though many know it not is one of the great underdeveloped countries of the world what it reaches for exceeds by far what it has grasped so the visitor returns thankful for much of what he has seen and in spite of everything an optimist about what his country might be yet the visitor if he is to make an honest report must also note the air of unease that hangs everywhere for the traveler as travelers have been always is as much questioned as questioning and for all the abundance he sees he finds the questions put to him ask where men may repair for succor from the troubles that beset them his countrymen cannot forget the savage face of war too often they have been asked to fight in strange and distant places for no clear purpose they could see and for no accomplishment they can measure their spirits are not quieted by the thought that the good and pleasant bounty that surrounds them can be destroyed in an instant by a single bomb yet they find no escape for their survival and comfort now depend on unpredictable strangers in far off corners of the globe how can they turn from melancholy when at home they see young arrayed against old black against white neighbor against neighbor so that they stand in peril of social discord or not despair when they see that the cities and countryside are in need of repair yet find themselves threatened by scarcities of the resources that sustain their way of life or when in the face of these challenges they turn for leadership to men in high places only to find those men as frail as any others so sometimes the traveler is asked whence will come their succor what is to preserve their abundance or even their civility how can they pass on to their children a nation as strong and free as the one they inherited from their forefathers how is their country to endure these cruel storms that beset it from without and from within of course the stranger cannot quiet their spirits for it is true that everywhere men turn their eyes today much of the world has a truly wild and savage hue no man if he be truthful can say that the specter of war is banished nor can he say that when men or communities are put upon their own resources they are sure of solace nor be sure that men of diverse kinds and diverse views can live peaceably together in a time of troubles but we can all remind ourselves that the richness of this country was not born in the resources of the earth though they be plentiful but in the men that took its measure for that reminder is everywhere in the cities towns farms roads factories homes hospitals schools that spread everywhere over that wilderness we can remind ourselves that for all our social discord we yet remain the longest enduring society of free men governing themselves without benefit of kings or dictators being so we are the marvel and the mystery of the world for that enduring liberty is no less a blessing than the abundance of the earth and we might remind ourselves also that if those men setting out from delftshaven had been daunted by the troubles they saw around them then we could not this autumn be thankful for a fair land this editorial has appeared annually since
