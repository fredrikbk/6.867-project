rising use of impact fees rankles new home buyers when jonette banzon and her husband muhammed ahmad sought to build a home in elk grove calif outside sacramento in the city made a surprising demand to get a building permit for the approximately &# home the couple needed to pay &# for road improvements around the rural property while the city reduced the fee calculated using historical data on the costs of building sidewalks drainage systems and other street projects by about the couple still sued "i didnt expect the fee would be half the price of the house " said ms banzon elk grove settled with them last year by capping the fee at &# an amount similar to fees paid by home builders in the citys suburban areas while few rocket into six figures impact fees such as that faced by ms banzon and mr ahmad are popping up in a rapidly expanding number of cash strapped u s municipalities scrounging for new revenue sources while federal funding for local infrastructure has become more difficult to obtain the one time fees imposed on builders and often folded into home prices and passed on to buyers are used by cities to fund construction of infrastructure such as roads sidewalks parks and even fire stations for rapidly growing neighborhoods a kansas state university survey found that of the u s cities responding imposed impact fees on new construction last year up from in the fees also are increasing in size in cities that have used them for years a survey this year of u s municipalities by duncan associates an austin texas consulting firm that tracks impact fees found that the total charged in impact fees rose by an average of from to as those governments used them to pay for additional projects such as firehouses and libraries with the residential real estate boom now over in many states the extra cost of those fees stands to draw more scrutiny from price sensitive buyers of new homes that could translate into more lawsuits in cases like ms banzons "it would not shock me to start seeing some increased legal friction in this area " says david barron a harvard law school professor specializing in local government and property law property rights advocates decry impact fees and other so called exactions requirements to donate land or make concessions to gain a government permit as a means for local governments to avoid unpopular tax increases for all residents by singling out new arrivals to pay for city projects proponents say that impact fees are the fairest way to make growth pay for itself "if these folks are going to create an impact on city services they ought to pay for it thats as logical as it gets " says mac burdette town administrator of mount pleasant a south carolina town imposing fees of &# on new homes to finance new roads parks and sewer lines mount pleasant began charging the fees in and has increased them since impact fees add roughly &# on average to the cost of new homes in cities that impose them according to duncan they range from &# on average per new home in california to &# in florida two states that fund school construction partly through impact fees to &# in missouri according to duncan legally most impact fees are defensible federal court decisions dictate that public projects funded by an impact fee must have some relation to the private project paying the fee and the fee must be proportional to the private projects burden on public resources even so lawsuits challenging allegedly onerous fees arent rare in july ms banzon now a year old accountant and recent law school graduate and her husband a year old accountant bought a vacant lot in a rural pocket of elk grove they envisioned a five bedroom mediterranean style house double the size of their previous home acting as their own general contractor they hired subcontractors an architect and an engineer as ms banzon navigated elk groves planning and public works departments she learned of the six figure fee for road improvements tree relocation and a dozen other items ms banzon wrote to the city council and the mayor she appealed the fee as too large for her project and the city reduced it to &# ms banzon then enlisted attorney meriem hubbard of the pacific legal foundation a sacramento based law firm specializing in property rights cases and sued the city in december the sides settled last year with elk grove reducing the impact fee to no more than &# soon after the settlement elk grove discontinued the impact fee for all rural construction "it was a lot of hard work " says ms banzon "but in the end i felt vindicated " weary from the legal battle however ms banzon and mr ahmad still havent built their square foot home jim estep interim city manager in elk grove said the city revamped its impact fees last year due partly to ms banzons lawsuit the city realized that its previous system for calculating impact fees failed to take into account that rural lots have street frontages sometimes four times the length of urban street frontages and thus fees for rural lots shouldnt be determined with the same formula "we had to recognize that or nobody could ever afford to develop their property " mr estep says pacific legal foundation is representing plaintiffs in several cases involving impact fees and exactions a contractors association in north port fla sued the city in october to repeal an impact fee that funds repairs of existing roads arguing that maintenance of existing roads isnt a need created by new development officials counter that much of the deterioration of the rapidly growing citys roads is caused by construction vehicles the case is pending still other cases involve concessions of rights or privileges carlsbad calif residents craig and robin griswold sued the city last year after it imposed a &# impact fee for future sidewalk and gutter construction as a condition for granting a permit to add a second level to their house on a rural lot but the city offers homeowners seeking to expand or substantially renovate their rural homes an option to postpone the payment they can forego the up front fee and obtain a building permit by agreeing to waive their right to vote on future street improvement projects in their neighborhood more specifically they must forfeit both their vote on the future formation of any improvement district in their neighborhood and their vote on any assessment against their house up to the amount of their original fee for those improvements city officials say the waiver allows applicants the flexibility of deferring the cost of road improvements until their neighborhood votes to undertake them the waiver also transfers the payment obligation to any new owner of the house if it is sold the citys aim is to preclude residents who get the benefit of a building permit from later holding out when the neighborhood opts to pay for installation of curbs gutters street lights and the like on its streets says city attorney ron ball mr griswold a year old defense lawyer pleaded his case with city officials but got no relief "trying to deal with them was one of the most frustrating things ive dealt with in my life " he says the griswolds eventually acquiesced signed away their vote on the assessment district matter and built their addition they then sued to challenge the agreements validity the lawsuit labels the carlsbad ordinance a "poll tax" that violates the th amendment by forcing residents to pay exorbitant fees or forego their votes on certain matters a judge dismissed the case in september reasoning that the griswolds hadnt yet been denied their vote because no assessment district had been proposed the griswolds are appealing
