does your holiday feel like a fellini make it a home movie if you have put off turning those video tapes or reels of film in the closet into the finished film youve long promised your kith and kin it may be because you suspected youd be getting into something that was less a simple project and more a full time hobby you were right editing software makes movie making easy in the same way that a word processing program makes it easy to write a novel but crafting a film is one of the most gratifying things you can do on a computer so it will be time well spent thus just in time for the holidays heres a how to based on a recent home project of my own there is lots of good news here home software packages have become powerful and easy to use many video products like camcorders come with a free editing program the major brands adobes premiere elements pinnacle studio ulead videostudio let you try their products free for a month purchase prices usually are well under &# apple owners might want to check out the new imovie which has an innovative method of helping decide what clips to include in a project i downloaded a free trial version of adobe premiere pro an &# product intended for professionals it was hard to learn but fun hard at least if you enjoy a deep end dive into a complex but powerful piece of software if not even the simplest programs can now produce striking results depending on who in the industry you talk to the practice of digitizing "legacy" images like vhs tapes mm and super mm film reels is either dying out with everyone who intended to do so having already done it or else poised to take off with aging boomers finally finding the time a film transfer service bureau find them online can digitize your old reels of film with video tapes you can do the job yourself with a small "capture" device which connects first to your vcr and then to your computer i used the &# pyro a v link from ads tech with excellent results less expensive models also work well camcorder owners of course can just connect their camera right to their computer and get to work before you make your first splice carefully look at every clip you have a tedious but crucial part of movie making rely on your emotional reaction the first time you see a clip and keep mental notes on what youre viewing because youll become inured to them after the endless viewings required as a part of editing look for anecdotes scenes and hidden stories carving a turkey may not be a scene from "casablanca " but it has a beginning middle and end which deft cutting can reveal learning the power you have to make people laugh or cry simply by arranging shots in the right sequence is the great joy and creative core of your project dont be afraid to rearrange sequences to get there and dont feel obliged to include all the material the best cutting room floors are usually the most littered when moving from clip to clip stick to simple jump cuts and dissolves rather than the dozens of tacky special effect transitions built into editing packages today one of hardest parts of a home movie project involves something you may never have heard of color correction no piece of film or video including those taken by pros ever looks perfect straight out of the camera color correction involves nudging it to get it just right most programs include color correction features the problem is you need a trained eye to use them properly because color correction done well can dramatically improve the look of your movie it might be worth getting professional help for a once in a lifetime project i used my local craigslist to hire a local videographer to come to my house and spend a few hours working with the project you can also look for video collectives online as well as color correction services though you may need to ship them a usb drive containing your projects files in a related vein dont watch your movie only on your computer monitor view it on the television set on which you intend to actually show it the differences may be substantial enough to send you back to the computer for adjustments also know that sound can be changed as magically as pictures can remove annoying hisses and buzzes some video packages have sound editors built in if yours doesnt search for a "sound editor" or "noise reduction" product on sites such as download com again you can test many free of charge as you work take pride in the fact that youre doing the same thing professional filmmakers do at least those in the documentary business and just like hollywood moviemakers with a release date you must at some point resist the urge to continue to fiddle and pronounce your movie "done " getting there will have involved many evenings glued to your monitor but you probably would have spent your time that way anyway at least now you will have something to show for it it may even end up on youtube email me at lee gomes wsj com
