business world web war iii google is worried about what youll see on your tiny cell phone screen someday it might not be google the much awaited android software package was the search giants way of trying to establish in the mobile wireless world the enviable position it enjoys in the fixed internet world maybe instead of looking ahead to wireless it should be looking over its shoulder and worrying more about what youll see on your giant hdtv get ready for a free for all around the idea of convergence of loosely tv and the internet players angling for advantage are too many to count from microsoft to babelgum but we wouldnt overlook the telephone companies verizon and at&amp t who just happen to be googles nemeses in the wireless world war too verizons ivan seidenberg is finally getting a few nods for his expensive approach laying fiber right into millions of homes this would enable if households need it megabit speeds for dense interactive media at&amp t has taken a cheaper approach rolling fiber into neighborhoods but relying on the existing copper for "last mile " your existing phone line is capable of carrying more and more data thanks to new compression technologies when theyre done the telcos will have not just the preferred platform for delivering high def on demand and interactive services theyll have several advantages over their would be rivals whether google or microsoft or the cable companies one is their history as phone companies in the form of systems for billing and tracking individual customers in their usage a second is their choice of technology unlike cable or satellite true internet tv means delivering individualized tv streams to each user on demand rather than broadcasting the entire spectrum of channels to the users set top box why is this important in the normal course of service they will be able to track which stream the user is watching and when and of course users will no longer be bound by program schedules not only will the telcos be better able to implement the necessary network "intelligence" to help you sort out the digital cornucopia information about what you watch is also information about what advertising youre likely to respond to what products and services you might be interested in buying thats googles business model of course the telcos have one more advantage control of the countrys two biggest wireless networks putting them in a powerful position to integrate video music news and messaging not just on your tv and computer but on your cell phone too we offer no forecasts let the games begin but the telcos are not insensate to their opportunity at&amp t has taken charge of an industry technical forum seeking to romance hollywood with ways of effortlessly flowing its output into a telecom network in whatever format and massage it automatically into a format usable by a viewer no matter what device hes using giant tv or tiny cell phone screen at&amp t also just invested in a disney backed company that aims to address hollywoods piracy concerns and is rumored ready to make a bid for echostar the satellite tv broadcaster verizon for its part has begun rolling out v cast mobile tv the first broadcast quality live tv on a cell phone with fox cbs comedy central and five other channels skeptics say the telcos have no history dealing with media then again no aspirant to a central role in the multimedia future has all the necessary skills and experience and despite the media euphoria over google and its stock price it has neither the business experience nor the lobbying clout nor the logical arguments to rewrite a world in which the legatees of the old ma bell have such a strong position so pull up a seat one thing not needed is a disingenuous new initiative from fcc chief kevin martin he says cable which has effectively been deregulated at the federal level since has become too big too powerful and cable rates too inflated so regulation is now needed pick up a newspaper mr chairman cable stocks are taking a shellacking on signs of competitive headway by verizon and at&amp t comcast reported a net decline in basic cable subscribers last quarter disney is the company reporting surging profits thanks to espn and the disney channel some monopolist the cable industry must be if disney a single program supplier in a world of countless competing program suppliers has cable over a barrel year after year for higher fees as for cable rates look at all the programming and services being added constantly to the menu calling this "inflation" is like saying its inflation when an apple an orange and a motorbike cost more than an apple we repeat comcast and other cable operators have been losing basic subscribers as customers voluntarily upgrade in pursuit of more and more services undoubtedly mr martins initiative will drag on long after hes collecting a paycheck as "of counsel" at some washington lobbying shop until the courts eventually shoot it down the real menace which certainly must suit google is injecting back into the debate an idea that delivery networks must be regulated to protect content providers as with the open access and net neutrality canards mr martin is offering a reclothed attempt to relegate network operators to the role of "dumb pipe " just as operators are spending billions to benefit their customers and shareholders by creating a "smart pipe " how many times do we need to see this movie see related letter "letters to the editor maybe we need something besides the internet" wsj nov
