commercial mortgages face test wall street may be in pain from subprime bonds but it is also increasingly feeling the loss of revenue in the commercial mortgage bond area unlike subprime mortgage related securities which have caused losses at scores of wall street firms and commercial banks due to plummeting market values commercial mortgage bonds have yet to see a sharp increase in defaults or delinquencies furthermore the commercial mortgage market is still fairly healthy and lending standards though they have loosened are still far tighter than they are for the residential market but financial institutions have plenty to worry about nonetheless tighter lending standards reduced risk appetite from bond investors and concerns about how a slowing of the overall economy could affect property markets all have caused a slowdown in issuance of commercial mortgage bonds the pullback in this &# billion sector translates into fewer fees for the many firms that are commercial mortgage lenders and bond underwriters "i think thats a real issue i think most of the real estate finance departments on wall street are probably doing as little as of the volume they were doing in say june " said lisa pendergast managing director of real estate finance strategy and research for rbs greenwich capital in greenwich conn through august she noted issuance of commercial mortgage bonds was running at about &# billion a month on average from september through december the monthly average is likely to come in at &# billion and that lower issuance "is likely to continue through the first quarter of at least " ms pendergast said some wall street firms have had to pare back staff in the commercial mortgage bond area credit suisse group notably announced in october that it is laying off employees mainly in its commercial mortgage backed securities division wall street executives have been increasingly vocal about the fact that they are watching the commercial mortgage sector with caution speaking at a conference sponsored by merrill lynch &amp co last week blackrock inc chairman and chief executive larry fink said that the drying up of the commercial real estate market where it is harder and more expensive now to get a loan than it had been before the summer is a concern "i dont know when its over but its not over yet " mr fink said of recent market turmoil while reduced issuance of commercial mortgage bonds will hurt firms bottom lines market watchers also worry about defaults rising especially for commercial mortgage bonds issued in and the first half of those bonds are backed by loans made when lending standards were at their loosest some loans were even extended for more than the value of an entire property for instance said derrick wulf portfolio manager at dwight asset management in burlington vt other loans were underwritten based on future projected revenue rather than on existing revenue at a given property he added morgan stanleys incoming chief financial officer colm kelleher speaking at the merrill lynch conference said that with regard to commercial mortgage bonds "the trend is clearly not looking good " however he noted that the firm is hedging its exposure to the sector in fact financial institutions probably have learned a lesson or two from the troubles they have experienced related to subprime mortgage securities mr wulf said one of those lessons involves the need to hedge their exposure to credit risk carefully many firms are doing just that via the cmbx the derivative index created to track the performance of the mortgage bond market he said that is likely one reason the cost of buying protection on commercial mortgage securitizations via the cmbx has risen so sharply in recent weeks he added still it would be a mistake to look at all the negative bets or buying of protection being placed through the index now and assume that translates into a prediction of huge fundamental problems in the still reasonably healthy commercial real estate sector while "the general consensus is delinquencies are expected to rise " mr wulf said "its not going to look anything like what we saw in subprime " kaja whitehouse and jed horowitz contributed to this article
