ads made for women by women new company to harness power of female executives to narrow creative gap female creative executives have long been scarce on madison avenue it is a problem that over the years has caught the attention of big name marketers like procter &amp gamble whose ads more often target women than men a new company womenkind is hoping to address that shortcoming by harnessing the power of female ad and marketing executives including stay at home moms jerry judge former chief executive of the lowe agency is one of four people leading the effort which plans to pool the know how of about female creative types from copy writers to art directors many of whom will be women who have left the work force most will be freelancers tapped on a project basis rather than hired as full time employees of the agency womenkind will provide the usual range of advertising marketing and consulting services but with an emphasis on reaching women the company which has also developed an online focus group of women that can be used for continuing research has already raised several million dollars from investors below are excerpts from an interview with mr judge who talks about how womenkind will function and why creative departments at ad agencies have traditionally been so male heavy the wall street journal what are some of the mistakes marketers make when they advertise to women mr judge most ads portray women as either sex objects or mom like i dont think women appreciate that another overused technique is relying too much on emotional ads its a bit patronizing that most ads that are intended to appeal to them tend to be too sappy there are great notable exceptions such as the dove campaign which uses real looking women wsj why is there a lack of women in the creative departments of ad agencies mr judge its mostly the hectic work schedule first there are a lot of social aspects of the job and you have to travel a lot also there is a still a bit of a boys club mentality a lot of the men want to talk about sports and chicks and get drunk wsj why has the business not moved beyond being a boys club mr judge its partly because advertising wears the clothes of modernity but is actually very conservative i have this saying companies repeat what made them successful long after it starts to damage them that is true of modern advertising there was the sexual revolution and i think advertising looked away from the growing importance of women in commerce it was a strange denial how can you have about of your creative department be men and about of the purchasing power in the hands of women the creative departments never got around to focusing on hiring women wsj there are already several ad agencies and branding firms that tout themselves as experts on reaching women what makes yours different mr judge some agencies set up little divisions that focus on women but many are just small divisions we are soup to nuts we will also offer marketers a creative spa a service where a team of women executives can look at the creative value of a marketers ads and see how they appeal to women we have also commissioned a piece of research called womentuition which looks at the differences between the way women look at advertising and marketing versus how men look at it one of the experiments we are doing is putting ads from the web tv and even direct mail in front of women and asking them if they can figure out if it was created by a man or woman wsj why does a man at the age of suddenly decide to get involved in starting a female focused ad firm mr judge my mother basically brought up my family my dad was in the movies he was a stunt man and couldnt work much past the age of so my mom who left school at had to support us i could see first hand the hard time she had she tragically died at i think partly from the stress of being a working mother people wouldnt know it but women are very important to me wsj you want the company to be owned by women why mr judge because it gives a free pass to those corporations who are committed to giving of business to companies that are owned by women wsj clients are demanding how will your new firm get around the fact that your creative executives wont be able to work long hours or travel much mr judge all the women creatives will register and make changes if necessary their work availability on our internal web site they will spell out what type of work they do and what kind of schedule they can commit to plus we have a contingency plan for each team the issue is women want to work but business doesnt allow them to work the way they can we can be much more flexible we resolve who can do what at the beginning of each task wsj how will the women be paid and will everyone get health insurance mr judge creative executives in our network are going to be paid on a project basis they will likely be paid monthly the creative executives are in effect freelancers and are not going to receive health benefits
