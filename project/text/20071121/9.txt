are e prescriptions the right medicine the comments by sen kerry and mr gingrich "e prescriptions " editorial page nov concerning "e prescribing" are in large part on the mark eliminating poor handwriting will create a safer and more efficient medication use process however their premise that change is in the hands of prescribers who require some sort of financial incentive is undercut by the fact that by law a significant percentage of prescription orders controlled substances may not be transmitted electronically the united states drug enforcement administration dea has not adopted a standard permitting adoption of this medium to be fair dea must balance competing objectives of the security of a class of medications highly prone to diversion from legal channels and abuse with providing necessary medication to patients in a timely safe and efficient way the technology needed to satisfy these concerns is as the authors point out readily available from the prescribing practitioners perspective deciding to adopt e prescribing for only a portion of the prescriptions issued is a half measure that may actually result in decreased efficiency within a practice environment before moving on to more elaborate forms of incentivizing in an already complex reimbursement environment the authors should consider the more conservative step of urging dea to overcome its regulatory inertia karl g williams r ph associate professor of pharmacy administration wegmans school of pharmacy st john fisher college rochester n y as a physician in a large integrated health organization i use only e prescriptions and emr most of the physicians in my cohort were trained similarly however as noted this technology assisted medicine is not available in most u s practices the evidence for using e prescribing to mitigate harm is powerful but the cost of starting such a program can be prohibitive to compel physicians to bear the financial burden of e prescribing is unfair especially given that medicare and insurance companies benefit financially from its use i and of my colleagues agree with messrs kerry and gingrich that e prescribing is the right medicine i hope that medicare does not reject the claim jeffrey benabio m d san diego calif as a two year user of an emr to which we incorporated e prescriptions in the last several months i can say i would not want to practice any other way that said there are several reasons that implementation is difficult the systems are very expensive and with all businesses a return of investment has to be considered also the systems available are not specific for different specialties where i have the largest disagreement with mr kerry and mr gingrich is when they write of requiring doctors to use e prescription in order to deal with medicare although it is a noble idea i doubt if the federal government could or would make it financially desirable for a small practioner to do so after all why would a business spend good money to accept payments that do not cover the costs of practice they write of negotiating with medicare but we all know there is no negotiating all this would do in the near future is limit patient access richard c huddleston m d smyrna tenn e prescriptions have never been shown to reduce errors in primary care i used i scribe for two years but the program "corrected" my metoprolol to metformin repeatedly introducing error also the program necessarily generalized labeling "incompatible" inappropriately it can never know a patient like the physician and each patient is different making codes inoperable and central command ludicrous howard long m d pleasanton calif
