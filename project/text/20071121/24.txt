business bookshelf big board big trouble king of the club by charles gasparino collins pages &# perhaps the most amazing thing about the richard grasso pay flap is that despite a barrage of news coverage and a festival of finger wagging punditry the media have never moved beyond a simplistic storyline we have been given first and foremost the bad mr grasso himself the longtime chief executive of the big board a supposedly money grubbing tyrant who engineered his own &# million payout and was later sued for it by the state of new york and then there is the good eliot spitzer then new yorks crusading attorney general a man motivated purely by his desire to clean up wall street and finally the dumb the new york stock exchange board duped into being over generous to mr grasso and unable to count above without taking off its shoes you dont need an mba to work out that the real story of mr grassos demise he was forced to resign as chief executive of the nyse in september was far more complex and ugly the more sophisticated tale is what charles gasparino tells in his excellent "king of the club " the former wall street journal reporter describes in page turning detail a wall street world of ruthless financial titans joined by a hard charging italian kid from queens n y whose passion revitalizes the nyse and brings temporary protection to its beleaguered floor trading system yet his own ruthless pursuit of success and his not at all minimalist ego make him enemies a compensation scandal gives them the perfect excuse to engineer his execution the class busting aspect of mr grassos career is one of mr gasparinos most compelling themes growing up in a blue collar enclave mr grasso had planned to follow his mothers most cherished wish and become a new york city cop but he failed the eye exam and instead took an entry level job at the new york stock exchange his ascent there was meteoric but mama grasso never warmed to the choice years later when he told her that he had been made vice president of one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world she replied "stupido if youd passed the eye test you would have made sergeant by now " mr grasso rose and rose and by was effectively running the exchange on behalf of the lackluster william donaldson whom he would soon replace "king of the club" ably shows why the "little guy" as mr grasso was known by the floor traders would be revered for the next decade or so as the most spectacular leader that the big board had ever had aggressive upstarts like nasdaq were ferociously competing with the nyse washington regulators were breathing down its neck and big securities players were trying hard to replace the exchanges floor traders with modern computers mr grasso kept the nyse safe from these threats and in the week after transformed it into a symbol of patriotism getting trade up and running within a week mr grasso managed such success through a mix of savvy marketing political maneuvering and hour days listings soared as he hounded companies to jump from nasdaq to the big board he even enlisted the mother of christos cotsakos the chief executive of e trade to help persuade her son to move his company away from nasdaq he ushered in foreign listings he allowed tv cameras on the trading floor beaming the nyse into homes and allowing average investors to witness the iconic ringing of the morning bell an event that mr grasso turned into a kind of celebrity theater he cut deals with regulators to ward off greater oversight the nyses soaring profile meanwhile made it possible for mr grasso to protect his beloved floor traders this was a high stakes game and mr grassos biggest fault may have been underestimating his opponents as the corporate scandals that began in enron adelphia worldcom threw a harsh light on overpaid executives mr grasso worried that he would never be given access to the tens of millions of dollars that he had deferred into retirement accounts he wanted the money paid out immediately as a condition of contract renewal he was counseled by many to sit tight and let the corporate scandals blow over instead he charged ahead mr gasparino deftly recounts the complicated history of mr grassos compensation showing exactly how he was awarded so much money in the first place the details are complex but nothing suggests conspiracy contrary to a myth of the standard storyline plenty of the compensation committee members knew the ins and outs of mr grassos pay and stuck by their decision to award it to him the cluelessness of others largely had to do with a mix of board dysfunction and board member incompetence many board members would nonetheless seize on the outrage over mr grassos pay to pursue their own agendas there was hank paulson who had for years led the charge to ditch the floor trader system that mr grasso so tenaciously defended the goldman sachs chief executive now treasury secretary would take the lead in submarining mr grasso charging him with unseemly greed and pushing for his resignation soon after mr paulsons no at goldman john thain would become the big boards new ceo and take the exchange public merging it with goldmans electronic trading system and greatly reducing the role of floor traders goldman got tens of millions from the deal there was also michael labranche the head of a top specialist firm who nursed a grievance against mr grasso for his having launched an investigation into mr labranches traders he would rally the floor against mr grasso during the scandal there was william donaldson whose departure from the big board had been partly engineered by mr grasso and who as head of the securities and exchange commission took a certain pleasure in ratcheting up the pressure on mr grasso to divulge his pay and so it went with many other wall street players with whom mr grasso had rocky relations and who could forget mr spitzer who ultimately sued the former nyse chairman for taking "unreasonable" pay as the head of a not for profit mr gasparino does a public service here demonstrating that the attorney general was a headline hungry politically motivated enforcer willing to stoop to any low tactic to get mr grassos scalp at one point spitzer aides spread malicious personal gossip to reporters including an allegation that mr grasso was having an affair with his secretary mr grasso is still fighting the spitzer suit and he may even have a decent shot at winning but no collection of courtroom documents will ever tell the story behind his ouster in all its nasty detail as well as mr gasparino does in "king of the club " ms strassel a member of the journals editorial board writes the potomac watch column which appears on fridays
