xm sirius radio merger may live the proposed merger between xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc looked dead on arrival back in february with federal regulators appearing unlikely to give their approval of the &# billion merger nine months later wall street is picking up a different signal that the deal might somehow pass muster in the past few months investors have shown increasing confidence of the deals winning approval from the federal communications commission and the justice department xm and sirius shares once trading off their levels from when the merger was announced and enthusiasm briefly reigned have now recovered most of those losses trading about off their levels from the announcement a final reckoning is expected imminently when lawyers at the justice department finalize a recommendation to their bosses people familiar with the situation say an official recommendation from the department could come soon after thanksgiving the fcc recommendation will follow later several events across the political and economic playing field have shifted investor perception of the deal chief among the changes is the satellite radio companies pledge to adopt tiered pricing in which users pay different monthly fees depending on how many channels they purchase the proposal was aimed squarely at fcc chief kevin martin who has long made tiered pricing a personal crusade with cable tv operators bringing such a pricing plan to radio could prove an effective cudgel for similar plans in cable "in a five dimensional chess game for kevin martin it was a very important move " says rbc capital markets analyst david bank "he can go back and say we want a la carte pricing and satellite radio is doing it " at the same time the satellite radio companies are gaining traction on their core argument that they face more competition than just each other in a recent request for information from the companies the fcc asked specifically about how much satellite programming was available on "terrestrial broadcast radio cable television internet stream or download podcast or digital hd radio " indicating fcc officials were also thinking in terms of a broader media landscape in that respect the sirius xm deal resembles the whole foods market inc and wild oats markets inc merger which the federal trade commission tried and failed to block earlier this year in that case a district court judge rejected the governments arguments that natural food purveyors whole foods and wild oats competed in a market distinct from the wider grocery business another factor is how some of the biggest customers of satellite radio equipment car manufacturers are rallying around the deal ford motor co honda motor co hyundai motor co kia motors corp and toyota motor corp have all filed fcc statements backing the transaction yet even those factors cant convince the market that the deal is a fait accompli rbc capitals mr bank says the stock market is assigning the deal a chance of getting through based on trading prices for the shares of sirius stock offered for each share of xm that is up from closer to in the spring pessimism about the deals chances was natural at first xm and sirius are the nations only satellite radio broadcasters and the fcc in creating the radio spectrum necessary for the business specifically contemplated keeping two competitors apart early in the process fcc chairman martin splashed cold water on the deal by saying "the hurdle here would be high " and one cant forget the role of politics in the final decision the very powerful national association of broadcasters has voiced repeated opposition to the merger broadcasters from every state are calling congressmen to speak out against a single satellite radio service which presumably would be able to compete better against regular radio a large number of lawmakers from both parties have publicly opposed the deal as well including sen herb kohl d wis chairman of the senate antitrust subcommittee but congress wont decide the main players are the justice departments top antitrust official assistant attorney general thomas barnett along with mr martin and the other fcc commissioners the justice departments antitrust unit under mr barnett has come under criticism for rarely challenging deals mr martin meanwhile has a track record of supporting big mergers such as the at&amp t inc purchase of bellsouth corp the upshot is that observers especially on wall street have slowly latched onto the possibility that the xm sirius combination may actually get done when the merger was first announced only a few analysts including blair levin at stifel nicolaus expressed the belief that the deal could go through now mr levin says "a lot of people moved closer to me and even surpassed me " today the more bullish analysts take the tone of sg cowens thomas watts who assigned the deal a likelihood of success he wrote recently that denying the deal would be based on the "ludicrous" assumption that the satellite radio services compete only with each other
