mr cekus disorderly house the recent column by agim ceku "kosovo wants independence " nov presents the critic with what military planners would call a target rich environment virtually every assertion about kosovos prospects as an independent state screams out for rebuttal for the sake of brevity let us focus on just one mr cekus suggestion that kosovo under his u n supervised administration has "put our structures in place and our house in order " this months report by the european commission tells a very different story "due to a lack of clear political will to fight corruption and to insufficient legislative and implementing measures corruption is still widespread " the report said "civil servants are still vulnerable to political interference corrupt practices and nepotism" and "kosovos public administration remains weak and inefficient " the report added furthermore "the composition of the government anti corruption council does not sufficiently guarantee its impartiality " and "little progress can be reported in the area of organized crime and combating of trafficking in human beings " war crime trials are being "hampered by the unwillingness of the local population to testify" and "there is still no specific legislation on witness protection in place " according to the report "civil society organizations remain weak" and "awareness of womens rights in society is low " if this is the "house" mr ceku claims "is in order" in advance of what he hopes will be conferral of independence one shudders to think what disorder would look like to be sure mr ceku makes use of the usual dodge that kosovos progress is limited by the absence of "clarity on our future status " namely independence but taiwan by contrast has gone without such clarity for over half a century and is nothing like the disaster over which mr ceku presides instead of falling for his fairy tales about kosovos fitness for sovereignty the international community needs to open its eyes to the reality of this corrupt criminal and nonviable entity granting independence to kosovo which would mean handing de jure power to those responsible for this state of affairs can only turn a disaster into a catastrophe james george jatras director american council for kosovo washington
