real estate finance maguire responds to critics reit parries a hedge fund charging conflicts by ceo proxy fight is a possibility maguire properties inc a los angeles based real estate investment trust is fighting back against criticisms lobbed by a hedge fund that has taken a sizable position in the company in the first jabs of what could become a rare proxy fight in the reit world in a recent interview chief executive robert maguire iii for the first time responded publicly to criticisms levied against him by jmb capital partners master fund lp which has taken a stake in the company and is urging maguire to explore "strategic alternatives " including selling itself he said misconceptions about his possible conflicts of interest alleged by jmb and others "need to be put to rest because its gone on too long " the response comes at a tense time for maguire properties a reit that owns million square feet of office buildings primarily in southern california the company explored selling itself late last fall but scrapped those plans and decided to continue as a public reit early this year it then made a &# billion bet on a number of properties sold by the blackstone group lp including properties in orange county that had a number of residential mortgage lenders as tenants before the subprime market cratered during the summers market turmoil investors sold off maguire total returns are down for the year despite a recent jump due to rumors that the company again might be for sale in comparison the snl u s reit equity index is down this year on nov jmb capital sent mr maguire a letter announcing its stake in the company and raising concerns over properties mr maguire owns and his reluctance to cut the companys dividend jmb has threatened to propose an alternative slate of directors if maguire ignores its demands an unusual possibility for jmb because maguire unlike many reits doesnt have a staggered board in one of the main charges in the letter jmb argues maguire should have exercised an option to purchase a building owned by mr maguire in santa monica called ocean ave some of which it leased to the reit "we do not understand why one of the largest office reits in los angeles leases space from the ceo of the company as opposed to utilizing space it already owns " the letter states mr maguire says the building is convenient for business on the west side of los angeles the rent for the square feet the reit uses for executive offices is heavily subsidized and below market rate paying about &# net per square foot he says the square foot building was one of several being developed when the company went public in the underwriters suggested holding the properties out of the reit portfolio because they feared the public market would undervalue them at a time of weak leasing but the reit had the option to buy the properties at a later date using specified formulas that compensated mr maguire in march the maguire board voted to waive the options though the company would continue to receive fees from some of the buildings for managing and leasing them at the time green street advisors a newport beach calif real estate research and trading firm criticized the decision saying that price appreciations suggest those buildings were "in the money " even though mr maguires costs were difficult to calculate but wally weisman maguires vice chairman said in a recent interview that the buildings didnt fit the reit portfolio and that the cost of exercising the options was significantly above any reasonable valuation of the buildings thus the board would have faced criticism for buying them from the companys ceo at very low capitalization rates the estimated yield in the first year "we were damned if we did and we were damned if we didnt " mr weisman said for ocean the reit would have had to pay the lesser of the buildings market value or mr maguires costs plus compounded annually based on that mr maguire says his costs were &# million while the building is worth perhaps &# million to &# million now or about &# per square foot "the reit would not buy buildings at those astronomical numbers " he says the jmb letter also criticized the reit for not cutting its &# annual dividend which it must pay out of reserves because it isnt covered by current cash flow the letter accused mr maguire a large holder of having "pledged the dividend payments from your stock as collateral for a personal loan " not true says mr maguire the refusal to cut the dividend is a board decision based on philosophy not his personal debt he says he has a revolving line of credit tied to about of his million shares and operating units with the company but it has no relationship to the companys dividend level mr maguire estimates that on an annualized basis the dividend will be covered by the fourth quarter of if leasing trends hold "people signed up and major institutional investors signed up to get their dividend and to be sure that dividend is protected were not about to cut the dividend we dont need to " he said
