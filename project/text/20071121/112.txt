politics &amp economics paulson shifts on mortgages treasury secretary seeks broad moves by lenders not business as usual washington u s treasury secretary henry paulson concerned that millions of homeowners arent being helped quickly enough is pressing the mortgage service industry to help broad swaths of borrowers qualify for better loans instead of dealing with mortgage problems on a case by case basis in an interview mr paulson said the number of potential home loan defaults "will be significantly bigger" in than in he said he is "aggressively encouraging" the mortgage service industry which collects loan payments from borrowers to develop criteria that would enable large groups of borrowers who might default on their payments to qualify for loans with better terms thats a shift from his previous view that the problems didnt warrant a group approach mr paulson said his outlook has evolved as he has learned more about the problem "were never going to be able to process the number of workouts and modifications that are going to be necessary doing it just sort of one off " mr paulson said "ive talked to enough people now to know theres no way thats going to work " the momentum for a new approach received a boost yesterday when four major mortgage loan servicers including countrywide financial corp and california gov arnold schwarzenegger agreed to endorse a plan for temporarily freezing interest rates to help borrowers in good standing from facing foreclosure when their loans reset to higher interest rates the bush administration has been looking for ways to stem the fallout from rising defaults on mortgages to subprime borrowers or those with poor credit which have roiled financial markets and bled into the broader housing sector amid wrangling between congress and the white house over how best to do that mr paulson said the administrations approach is "the right thing to be proposing" and will help to keep homeowners in their homes while he stopped short of endorsing a proposal by sheila bair chairwoman of the federal deposit insurance corp to have mortgage companies freeze the interest rate on the two million mortgages due to reset to higher rates between now and the end of he said thats "one idea " mr paulson said he supports finding some way to develop "standard criteria thats going to allow for modification and workouts " defaults and foreclosures are increasing as borrowers many of whom got loans that allowed them to make no down payment or to initially pay interest only begin having trouble making their mortgage payments as higher rates kick in many homeowners believed they could refinance but that has become harder as housing prices slide and lenders tighten standards mr paulson faulted congress for failing to pass several bills that could potentially provide relief for borrowers and took aim at a republican senator who is holding up a piece of legislation that would allow the federal housing administration to play a greater role in the cleanup while the bush administration and democrats in congress backed the bill oklahoma republican sen tom coburn objected saying it will result in additional risky loans for which taxpayers will be liable mr paulson said he understands mr coburns concerns but notes "this is not business as usual this is an extraordinary situation " he also called the senates failure to pass legislation overhauling mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac "very frustrating " saying that the two government sponsored entities need to be playing a bigger role in the housing market "if we ever need them its during times like today and theyre most valuable when there is distress in the mortgage market " he said "id like to see them playing an even bigger role " fannie and freddie however have recently posted losses that could hamper their ability to buy mortgages since they are required to keep a hefty capital cushion mr paulson declined to say whether he would back efforts to lift those minimum capital requirements saying such a decision was best left to the office of federal housing enterprise oversight which regulates fannie and freddie "it would be particularly inappropriate for me to get between the regulator and fannie and freddie given whats going on " he said mr paulson wants congress to temporarily allow fannie and freddie to purchase mortgages larger than their current limit of &# a move some believe would improve the availability of the larger "jumbo" mortgages but the bush administration doesnt want to expand their role unless such a move is accompanied by tighter oversight of the two entities the house has passed a bill but similar legislation has gone nowhere in the senate
