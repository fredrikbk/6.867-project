its no laughing matter "look at your comics pages like a stock portfolio " advised ms grimley an assistant managing editor at the seattle post intelligencer "its no secret that newspapers arent as robust as they once were and that trickles down to the comics pages " observed brendan burford comics editor at king features a new york based syndication service whose holdings include the venerable "mary worth " "rex morgan m d " "the family circus" and "hi and lois " as well as newer entries like "tinas groove " a clever look at the life loves and annoying clientele of a young single waitress janet grimley had some hard won investment wisdom to share with colleagues at a gathering earlier this fall of the american association of sunday and feature editors in savannah ga "look at your comics pages like a stock portfolio " advised ms grimley an assistant managing editor at the seattle post intelligencer "diversify you need to have some risky comics " for instance the slightly subversive observational strip "f minus " and "some safe purchases like the old favorites " such "safe purchases" would include blue chips like "blondie " "beetle bailey " "dennis the menace" and "hagar the horrible " in fact this isnt exactly a bull market for the comics pages in palmier times when cities could comfortably support two or even three dailies reps from the syndicate services would typically offer their wares to the largest newspaper no sale no problem surely the rag across the street would sign on the dotted line "and if certain strips changed hands in a competitive market it would make a difference in your readership " noted john smyntek syndicate editor at the detroit free press but in a one paper town and these days most towns are one paper towns "theres no compelling reason for an editor to buy a new strip immediately " said lisa klem wilson general manager of united media syndication with budget constraints an editor may feel no compelling reason to buy at all "its no secret that newspapers arent as robust as they once were and that trickles down to the comics pages " observed brendan burford comics editor at king features a new york based syndication service whose holdings include the venerable "mary worth " "rex morgan m d " "the family circus" and "hi and lois " as well as newer entries like "tinas groove " a clever look at the life loves and annoying clientele of a young single waitress john matthews vice president of universal press syndicate put it more strongly "its tough out there i just got an email from a newspaper editor saying he felt sorry for guys like me but not to bother coming to see him because he wasnt buying any new comics " said mr matthews whose kansas city mo based company represents some strips among them the long running "doonesbury " "cathy" and the innovative wordless "lio " "theres no new money and no expanding space " generally a strip has to end or be dropped by a paper in order for a new one to join the lineup but much to the chagrin of young artists and writers eager to make their mark a fair amount of the comic page real estate is taken up by what they view as old tired artists and writers in some instances long departed ones charles schulz for example died in but his progeny charlie brown lucy linus and snoopy continue to cavort through the funny pages their antics billed as "classic peanuts " detractors might say stale peanuts bill unger who devised "herman " retired some years ago his single panel strip filled with an assortment of beetle browed prognathous figures is in reruns in papers around the country while lynn johnston the creator of the domestic comedy "for better or for worse " is easing up on her own obligations her strip will continue as well "i was going to end the story line and my syndicate thought we could run it from the beginning because it hadnt been seen in many markets but i wanted to add some fresh stuff because i hadnt died " said ms johnston she ultimately came up with a compromise lots of flashbacks using old illustrations and occasional infusions of new material reruns are a touchy subject to many in the business why are newspapers running them " demanded amy lago comics editor at the washington post writers group which represents the strips "pickles " which centers on an elderly couple and "red and rover " the saga of a young boy and his dog almost equally controversial is the issue of legacy strips such is industry parlance for cartoons whose creators have shuffled off this mortal coil and left their pencils in the hands of family members or former assistants this group includes "blondie " "dennis the menace " "the wizard of id " "the lockhorns " "b c " "frank and ernest" and "shoe " "when your strip gets into syndication its less about art than about business " said alan gardner editor of the newsblog dailycartoonist com "once you do a cartoon for your whole career if you have a son or daughter you feel theres no reason you cant pass it on to the next generation its like the family bakery " the result said ms lago "is were not getting the kind of change on the comic pages that we used to get new cartoonists cant get a foothold " for their part long established cartoonists suggest a little perspective is in order "my father always points out in defense of his strip that when he started it he was competing for space with little orphan annie dick tracy and pogo " said brian walker a cartoonist and comics historian who was referring to "beetle bailey" creator mort walker other cartoonists see it purely as a marketplace issue "my feeling is if you can do what im doing and it knocks me out of the paper do it do it " challenged lynn johnston "ill applaud you but as long as the editors and readers want my strip ill keep working " the dearth of new entries on the comics pages is as much about mindset as money "you might hear protests if your editorial page goes from left leaning to right leaning or right leaning to left leaning " noted universal press syndicates mr matthews "but it would be nothing compared to the squeals youd hear if you take out someones favorite comics " "you change your lineup and you know youre going to upset somebody " agreed geoff brown associate managing editor for features at the chicago tribune which runs two facing pages of comics monday through saturday and six pages on sunday "no one likes to upset readers trust me but i think we have an editorial imperative to adapt to the times we freshen the paper in every way in every section but a lot of readers think we shouldnt apply the same standards to the comics pages as we do elsewhere i dont see it that way " mr smyntek at the detroit free press who so far this year has fielded emails of complaint and commentary about the comics pages characterizes his job as "an interesting little dance " hes trying to assemble the pages with comfort food strips like "the family circus" and "hagar the horrible" and edgier fare like perhaps the inner city inflected "candorville " pages that will attract younger hipper readers without alienating older ones "if you like pearls before swine you want to see what kind of absurdity hes come up with today " said mr smyntek of the five year old stephan pastis strip centering on a quartet of anthropomorphic animals "you want to see what kind of bad jokes garfield has " he added of jim daviss long running feline cartoon "many editors like to think pulitzer prizes sell newspapers but comics sell them too and probably more than pulitzer prizes " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal see related letter "letters to the editor comics enter golden age" wsj dec
