me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q i recently purchased a lexus gs with rear wheel drive and inch high performance tires snow is on the way and im getting mixed reports on the need for snow tires thoughts b schultz madison wis a i think you should get a set of snow tires or winter tires as manufacturers call them for cold weather driving and keep the performance tires for the warmer months todays snow tires arent like ones of past decades which relied on an aggressive biting tread to get through snow and slush modern versions are defined more by the compound or mix of materials that make up the tread softer compounds with silica other abrasives and a range of often proprietary ingredients mixed into the rubber increase grip on wet snowy and icy roads winter tire compounds also resist hardening that can decrease traction as temperatures fall i plan to mount winter tires on our subaru wagon soon even though the car has all wheel drive and came with all season tires many tire retailers offer packages that include the snow tires mounted on their own set of wheels making the switch easier q my year old father recently had both knees replaced he drives a honda civic which he loves but its too low and difficult for him to get in and out of could you recommend a substitute that has the civics features but is more accommodating deborah kovar santa rosa calif a i know a knee replacement recipient who drives a ford five hundred now called the taurus likes its easy ingress and egress and finds it comfortable on long trips other large comfortable and economical four doors include the chevrolet impala buick lucerne and to a lesser extent the dodge charger and chrysler i think the last two sacrifice visibility for styling q i recently drove a rented nissan xterra and was surprised by its power and comfort is it a practical choice for an old mostly city driver who occasionally needs to haul a piece of furniture george carlyle costa mesa calif a im not surprised you like the xterra which i think is one of the more fun to drive suvs on the market yes its a truck with the crude suspension and sometimes rough ride that go with it but its six cylinder engine generates enough power its handling is surprisingly sharp and the interior though unadorned is comfortable
