is family leave act too soft or too tough workers employers face off over how to handle fmla cameras hidden in buttons theres a domestic squabble brewing over the family and medical leave act considered by its advocates to be an important protection for those trying to balance family and work the act allows workers to take as many as weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a sick child spouse or parent or to recuperate from their own serious medical condition without fear of losing their job many say it helps avoid costly nursing home or other institutional stays and lowers turnover costs by helping to retain workers as many as million workers took fmla leave in according to the department of labor the latest data available yet employers and workers are increasingly accusing each other of abusing the law which dates from companies say more workers are using it to take time off for vague and chronic maladies and doing so intermittently rather than in blocks of time which makes scheduling and staffing difficult many of them have begun to clamp down on employees hiring outsiders to screen applications for leave and at times to videotape workers to make sure they arent moonlighting or vacationing workers for their part say companies are making it more difficult to qualify for leave and requiring second or third opinions from health care providers some are fired or punished with worse assignments when they return to their jobs they charge the labor department which oversees the program acknowledges the growing friction but wont say if it is planning to issue proposed rule changes anytime soon the tensions became visible when the department issued a request late last year for comments on the law and received more than responses from workers companies law firms and unions far more than expected the department issued a report based on the survey in june "we havent made any final decisions" about revising the act says victoria a lipnic the departments assistant secretary of labor for employment standards "there are certainly parts of the regulations that from a good government standpoint need to be cleaned up " many workers arent eligible for fmla benefits because they work for small companies or on a part time basis the law applies only to companies with or more employees many flight attendants and pilots who tend to have irregular work schedules may not meet a minimum requirement for hours worked congress is currently considering legislation to expand the act to cover airline employees and to provide as many as six months of unpaid leave to workers caring for family members injured during military service in its report the labor department acknowledged the growing importance of the law for baby boomers who increasingly need to take off from work to care for an elderly parent the agency cited this as an example of the laws effectiveness but in many cases these workers are using intermittent leave to chauffeur a parent to a doctors visit or to care for a parent after a surgery which could contribute to tensions over workers requesting leave on a less predictable basis most workers who take time off under fmla though use it to tend to their own health issues and thats where most of the complaints originate christian kappelmann a commercial insurance agent for brown &amp brown inc which is based in daytona beach fla requested fmla leave to have surgery to repair a herniated disc and a fractured vertebra following a car accident in mr kappelmann years old of coral springs fla says he was required to get several forms signed by doctors and to brown &amp brown by a certain date which he contends he did but the company he says soon fired him and stated in a letter that he wasnt medically able to perform his job prior to his firing he says a manager asked "if youre not going to be here who is going to do this work " mr kappelmann who still hasnt had surgery cashed in his retirement account and is using that to support his wife and two children he recently filed a lawsuit for back pay and benefits which is pending in federal court in the southern district of florida mark hanley a lawyer for brown &amp brown declined to comment on any specifics of the case "it is my belief that the company did not violate any provisions of the fmla " he said the company filed a formal answer to mr kappelmanns lawsuit last month denying the allegations of fmla related discrimination mr kappelmann believes the law is too confusing for workers and companies and that even though it is supposed to protect workers from losing their jobs it is often up to the worker to file suit against an uncooperative or bullying employer which many may not have the energy or resources to do the most common complaint among workers seeking legal help is that they were fired or demoted for taking leave says loring spolter an employment lawyer in fort lauderdale fla who is representing mr kappelmann from an employers perspective a bigger problem involves intermittent leave often taken by people who have chronic conditions such as asthma diabetes back pain and severe migraines of the estimated million to million workers who took fmla leave in the labor department estimates that one fourth did so intermittently "this explosion in the use of unscheduled leave is really what employers complain about " said labors ms lipnic such unscheduled leaves are especially problematic in companies with time sensitive operations such as delivery transportation health care manufacturing and public safety when workers dont show up to man counters or drive buses often their employers have to pay someone overtime at the pennsylvania turnpike commission fmla requests around holidays and weekends are known as "get out of jail free" cards according to one comment sent to the labor department because there is no recourse that "we have as an employer to enforce these types of abuses misuses of leave " "the intermittent leave is the worst " says marilyn zeiner vice president of human resources at compiq corp an irvine calif company that reviews medical bills for insurers if someone has asthma they might be fine in the morning but need to take two hours off in the afternoon accounting for that is a paperwork and scheduling "nightmare " ms zeiner also says she was nervous about asking employees about their medical conditions fearing that she would violate federal privacy regulations she eventually hired compsych corp a benefits provider in chicago to handle fmla requests compsych says that its fmla business has doubled in the past two years and that it cuts fmla use at companies by to by verifying that workers have filed the correct paperwork and have a serious medical condition compsych also cuts usage by helping workers find child care nursing home care or legal services so that they dont have to take off as much time from work matrix investigations &amp consulting inc based in cincinnati takes a surveillance approach for &# a day it will send an investigator equipped with tiny cameras hidden in buttons or hats to videotape workers on fmla leave at times following them when they leave home according to brian sweeney a matrix vice president in one case the company found a worker taking fmla leave in the spring to start a landscaping business and another during the winter for a snowplow business many companies and business groups want new provisions to limit intermittent leave including advance notification but workers say the allowance for intermittent leave is critical "as a two time survivor of breast cancer i have taken fmla leave both on a continuous and an intermittent basis continuous leave to recover from my surgeries therapeutic and reconstructive and intermittent for doctors appointments radiation therapy and chemotherapy treatments " wrote one woman to the labor department one railroad employee wrote that he uses intermittent leave to care for his wife who suffers from multiple sclerosis which can flare up unexpectedly leaving her unable to care for herself one woman says her daughter has had a major asthma attack causing bronchial infection swelling and bacteria in her throat "no one is capable of predicting an asthma attack or the severity of the attack i just would like the assurance of knowing that if or when the situation should arise i have the time off required to handle her needs without the threat of being terminated " she wrote
