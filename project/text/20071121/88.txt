mortgage giant fuels worries with steep loss setback at freddie mac is worse than expected its shares plummet the hoped for saviors of the u s housing market could use some first aid themselves the wider than expected &# billion loss posted yesterday by freddie mac for the third quarter makes clear that the mortgage giant and its rival fannie mae government chartered companies that buy and guarantee mortgages have less power to prop up the housing market than some politicians hoped freddie mac said it recently has been forced to sell mortgages to ease its financial woes and it is rushing to raise capital through a sale of preferred stock likely to be launched next week in washington where politicians are wrangling over the two companies treasury secretary henry paulson said he wants to see fannie and freddie provide more support to the mortgage market in recent years the two have stepped up the guarantees they provide to holders of mortgage backed securities but their weakening finances make it unlikely they can buy as many loans as their most fervent congressional backers wish yesterday freddies shares plunged &# or to &# in p m trading on the new york stock

were worse than the &# billion loss recorded days ago by fannie mae despite their setbacks both companies say they will continue to buy and guarantee mortgages but their losses leave them with little scope to increase their purchases of mortgages at least in the short term freddie which bought back &# billion of its common stock in the first nine months of the year was laying plans late yesterday to shore up its capital with a sale of preferred shares that a person close to the matter said was likely to raise around &# billion though fannie and freddie lack the capital to aggressively buy mortgages from lenders they should be able to keep increasing their business of providing guarantees on mortgage backed securities held by others said james lockhart director of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight or ofheo which regulates both companies scores of small mortgage lenders have collapsed this year and now even some of the mortgage companies that were long viewed as stable are wobbling as investors flee from mortgage risks amid a surge in defaults and falling home prices the u s mortgage market "is a more fragile system than i think people still understand " said jim vogel an analyst at ftn financial capital markets memphis tenn yesterday mortgage related jitters battered countrywide financial corp s stock and bond prices forcing the nations largest mortgage lender to issue a statement denying market rumors that it was near bankruptcy some countrywide debt fell to a level that suggests "people are anticipating a default " said jim cusser a portfolio manager at waddell &amp reed in overland park kan but a countrywide spokeswoman said the bankruptcy rumors were "absolutely false " countrywide added in a statement that it has "ample liquidity "

mortgage risk interest rates on home loans are likely to rise at least slightly and lenders will have to continue tightening their lending standards rationing credit to people with decent credit records and an ability to make sizable down payments democrats led by sen charles schumer of new york drafted legislation this fall that would permit freddie and fannie to expand their holdings of mortgages as a way to prop up the market sen schumer said yesterday that he still plans to push for more growth at the companies "the whole reason fannie and freddie exist is to help in times like these " he said but freddie macs capital position would now make any expansion effort a political long shot freddies loss and expectations for similar results in the current quarter put the company in jeopardy of falling below minimum capital levels required by ofheo treasury secretary paulson said in an interview that congress needs to pass long stalled legislation aimed at tightening regulation of the two companies both of them have been embroiled in accounting scandals in recent years rep paul kanjorski d pa who chairs the house subcommittee overseeing fannie and freddie said the increased capital requirements ofheo imposed on fannie and freddie in the wake of the scandals are necessary "by relying on the regulators judgment i hope to avert repeating the mistakes of the savings and loan crisis " mr kanjorski said to preserve capital freddie said it is "seriously considering" a cut in its fourth quarter dividend to cents per common share such a dividend cut would save the company about &# million a year said frederick cannon an analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods standard &amp poors reaffirmed its triple a rating of freddies senior debt ratings citing the longstanding assumption that the u s government would stand behind fannie and freddie in a crisis but s&amp p changed the outlook to negative from stable on its double a minus rating of the risk freddie poses to the government coffers as well as on its preferred stock and subordinated debt fannie and freddie currently own or guarantee a combined &# trillion of u s home mortgage loans or more than of the total outstanding thats up from about &# trillion owned or guaranteed by the companies a year ago among u s mortgage securities offered to investors the portion guaranteed by fannie and freddie has rebounded to around in october from about in at the height of the housing boom when wall street firms were issuing large amounts of mortgage securities with no backing from fannie or freddie according to trade publication inside mortgage finance the companies earn fees for guaranteeing payments on mortgage backed securities held by others but must reimburse holders of those securities when borrowers default falling home prices worsen the losses they face in disposing of homes acquired through foreclosures freddies loss for the latest quarter reflects a provision for credit losses of &# billion in addition the company marked down assets by &# billion to match current depressed market levels in the year earlier third quarter freddie posted a loss of &# million "we will work through this " freddies chairman and chief executive richard syron said in a conference call with analysts the results were released less than two weeks after freddie extended mr syrons contract through raised his base salary to &# million from &# million and awarded him a &# million "extension bonus " his total compensation last year was &# million mr syron said in a statement that he remains optimistic about freddies longer term prospects adding that the recent shift toward more conservative lending practices will benefit the company the losses have left the company with core capital of &# billion as of sept only &# million above the minimum amount regulators require it to hold ofheo has imposed minimum capital levels for fannie and freddie that are more than required by law ofheo has said it will begin considering in february whether to remove this extra capital requirement if the companies return to timely reporting of their annual results which have been delayed for the past several years but mr lockhart ofheos director said the companies also must show that they have improved their risk controls he suggested that there will be no rush to remove the extra capital requirement "this is just the wrong time to be decreasing capital " mr lockhart said because it had little margin over its capital requirement freddie said it was limited in its ability to take advantage of opportunities to buy mortgages and sold about &# billion of them in september and another &# billion in october freddie estimated that its losses related to defaults on single family homes will grow to &# billion in and &# billion in from an estimated &# million for all of that forecast assumed that home prices at the depth of the downturn would be down from their peak some economists have predicted declines of as much as around with small changes in some parts of the country but much bigger drops in california florida nevada and arizona fannie and freddie are struggling partly because it is hard to assess the value of many of the loans they hold or guarantee loans guaranteed by fannie or freddie are put into "pools" of mortgages that provide the backing for mortgage securities when borrowers fall behind on payments on some of those loans the companies have to buy those loans and reimburse the holders of the securities fannie and freddie then must recognize a loss on any drop in the market value of the loan below the amount they paid for it in the latest quarter the estimated current market value of such loans bought by freddie was on average less than the unpaid balance it wont know the exact size of the losses on such loans until later that depends partly on whether the borrower can catch up with payments if given easier terms it also depends on the amount lost by freddie on homes that are acquired through foreclosure and then sold
