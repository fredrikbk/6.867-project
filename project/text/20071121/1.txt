a globalization winner joins in trade backlash exports boost iowa but workers still fret campaigns take note waterloo iowa at a john deere plant here bright green tractors bound for brazil russia and china roll off assembly lines global demand for tractors is good and thats been good for waterloo yet over the last couple of years workers and voters in this blue collar manufacturing outpost and throughout iowa have grown decidedly downbeat about globalization trade has become such a hot subject that democratic presidential candidates seeking support in iowas influential jan caucuses are turning into trade skeptics and the issue is splitting traditionally free trade republicans iowas ambivalence is all the more remarkable because the state is on the whole a big winner from global trade "iowa as much as any other state is on the plus side of the ledger " says james leach a year republican congressman from iowa who now runs harvard universitys institute of politics "it would be highly ironic if pro protectionist candidates prevailed in the iowa caucuses " trade wasnt always such a high priority in the iowa caucus richard gephardt the most outspoken democrat on the issue attracted so few votes he subsequently pulled out of the race as the presidential election approaches anti trade sentiment is percolating across america it is particularly strong in places like ohio where foreign competition has decimated jobs the latest wall street journal nbc news poll conducted earlier this month found that of voters nationwide agreed with the statement that "foreign trade has been bad for the u s economy " iowas anxiety stems from a mix of factors many of which are also at play in other midwestern swing states by many measures the global economy has been good for the state boosted by the ethanol and biofuels craze and surging demand for crops and farm equipment world wide iowas exports are up over the past four years versus nationally the states unemployment rate hovers around below the national average but the past couple of decades have seen a steady decline in once prized factory jobs from a high of in to today just this year iowa lost about jobs when appliance maker maytag now owned by whirlpool corp shuttered its plant in its home town of newton the jobs moved to ohio but foreign competition was a key reason maytag was acquired by whirlpool wages havent kept pace with inflation and employers here as elsewhere have been paring health and retirement benefits many iowans blame their difficulties on global trade a los angeles times bloomberg poll of iowa democrats conducted in september found that by to they favored a candidate who believes trade pacts hurt the u s economy over one who believes they benefit the economy republicans were evenly split at the balance said they didnt know or hadnt a preference the moods of even the most fortunate workers are clouded by unease at morgs diner in downtown waterloo pop deere &amp co worker tim mcbride years old knows he is one of trades winners thanks to record commodity prices and large overseas demand for crops deere has been adding workers a week mr mcbride expects to earn about &# this year as a member of a team that improves productivity and quality at the companys drive train plant but a year long layoff in when a strong dollar was crimping u s exports seared him more than two decades later mr mcbride worries that foreign competition could again put him out of a job tucking into a butter drenched pancake he laments the ease with which a global economy enables companies to shift jobs to lower cost countries "if the people in the united states worked for a dollar an hour we still couldnt compete " says mr mcbride most economists argue that changing technology is more to blame for the divergence of economic fortunes nonetheless worker concerns are roiling the political landscape "everywhere you go youve got this widespread feeling especially in the labor community that all of the wage problems of the middle class are due to trade " says austan goolsbee a university of chicago economist advising democratic candidate sen barack obama adds gene sperling an aide to former president bill clinton now advising democratic candidate sen hillary clinton "even those of us who are supportive of the open market policies of the s have to take seriously that the large inflow of workers from china and india digesting american jobs is placing downward pressure on wages that doesnt mean the answer is closing up shop in globalization but it cant just mean business as usual either " as a result democratic candidates here are responding by making promises that could influence the policies of the next president on a recent tuesday the crowd at des moines area community college bursts into loud and sustained applause when mr obama vows to make sure "that globalization is not just working for multinational companies " in cedar rapids workers nod as former sen john edwards tells them that "the negative effects from globalization are rippling through the economy " in perhaps the most telling development democratic front runner mrs clinton says the north american free trade agreement which her husband pushed through congress has "serious shortcomings " waterloo sits on the cedar river in central iowa a blue collar manufacturing outpost set amid the states great sea of farmland train tracks cut across downtown and outlying neighborhoods with small homes and neatly trimmed yards local radio broadcasts high school volleyball the town is synonymous with deere the citys largest employer which has been making tractors in waterloo since here the sweet taste of todays prosperity is mixed with sour memories and realities for generations deere was the place everyone wanted to work "you got out of high school and you went to work at deere " says waterloo mayor timothy hurley himself a year deere veteran "grandpa was a deere worker and your father was a deere worker and so thats what you wanted to be " that sense of security began to fray in the s when a general economic downturn combined with a crop price slump hurt deeres bottom line the company began slashing its waterloo work force which once employed more than workers and is now down to one day in the company posted layoff notices for "hundreds of people " a union official recalls sheets with the names were tacked onto bulletin boards near the factory gates while the farm economy eventually improved deeres employment never rebounded to its previous levels and workers began to see threats from overseas tractors made in waterloo are no longer fully american made and are instead outfitted with parts from mexico and italy deere recently completed the acquisition of chinas ningbo benye tractor &amp automobile manufacture co which makes low horsepower tractors and deere has pressured the united auto workers which represents deeres hourly workers to cut wage and benefit costs in the uaw agreed to a two tiered compensation structure under which new hires would be paid at a lower rate and get less generous benefits today workers start at &# an hour about &# an hour less than the previous entry level wage shawn luck was hired by deere under that contract in and expects to make &# to &# this year far less than mr mcbride earns both are active in the union and mr luck has come to terms with the differing pay scales but he says others chafe "there are some tensions here and there " he says "im not going to lie " while he acknowledges that "things are going good" for deere mr luck is upset about the impact that the global economy is having on wages "its a growing issue " says mr luck who has two young children and worries hes not getting ahead fast enough his response going to night school for a college degree "id have some value to somebody " he reasons democratic presidential candidates figure itll take more than preaching the virtues of higher education to placate trade wary voters on the stump the top contenders say they support globalization but are pledging to oppose trade deals that dont benefit american workers they are promising to lift wages through tax policies that let middle class workers keep more of what they earn and by negotiating free trade agreements with labor and environmental standards such deals would in theory boost wages here by increasing wages overseas and removing some of the competitive advantages of doing business in other countries where environmental standards are less stringent "my sense is that the families of iowa have now concluded that the modest benefit to them from cheaper goods that flow through wal mart have been overwhelmed by stagnating wages " says leo hindery the former cable tv chief who is now the top economic policy adviser to mr edwards "iowa like a lot of states looks back at nafta and says nafta did not work as promised " mr edwards criticizes nafta which eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers between the u s canada and mexico as bad for workers saying it needs to be "revised" to include labor and environmental standards thats spurred other candidates to follow suit most notably mrs clinton mr obama meanwhile has said he would seek to make nafta more favorable to the u s mrs clinton and mr obama have also backed legislation to punish china for manipulating its currency which critics say is kept artificially low to give the country a leg up in global trade tough talk on trade may play well in iowa but its upsetting some members of the democratic establishment who say the candidates are threatening to unravel one of former president clintons enduring legacies shifting the democratic party away from protectionist proclivities "its unfortunate that the democrats are willing to describe trade as part of the problem " says robert reich president clintons labor secretary he worries the current crop of democratic contenders will undo mr clintons progress and potentially enact policies that hurt economic growth "its pandering to a misconception in the public the truth is that trade is good for the u s but that some people are burdened by it far more than others weve got to make them all winners but you dont make them winners by attacking trade " he says republicans meanwhile have made the political calculation that most americans want to see a continuation of open borders because it means cheaper goods and a stronger u s economy most are addressing the angst by nibbling around the edges promising stronger job protection and wages but steering clear of bashing china or promoting expanded government programs to help the middle class but the issue is creating rifts among republicans sen john mccain the arizona republican has talked openly of the downsides of trade throwing his support behind expanding a government program to help displaced workers make up lost wages former arkansas gov mike huckabee whose popularity in iowa is rising speaks openly of worker concerns and embraces language used by critics of globalization "theres no free trade without fair trade " he says on the other end is former massachusetts gov mitt romney who last month traveled to south carolina a state hard hit by trade related layoffs to argue for an aggressive expansion of free trade deals mr romney calls for better enforcement of existing trade agreements and improved worker retraining programs he also excoriates the democrats for their approach during a speech at the greenwood chamber of commerce mr romney presented a slide presentation where photos of his democratic rivals were topped with the headline "democrats strategy of defeat and retreat stop the world we want to get off " mr romney is currently leading polls of republican voters in iowa "trade is a valid issue to discuss " says david malpass an economic adviser to former new york mayor rudy giuliani another republican candidate "the mayor wants to discuss it in optimistic growth oriented terms rather than taking the attitude that americans cant compete with the chinese which is at the core of the democrats position " whether thats a winning strategy remains to be seen says republican pollster tony fabrizio "not every republican belongs to a country club most of them are average middle class working families and so the economic pressure of job loss of outsourcing those are all things theyre sensitive to " for at least two deere workers in iowa democrats are winning the argument mr mcbride likes what he hears from mr edwards "when you get in a room and talk with him you get the feeling he really cares about what happens to the middle class of america " he says mr luck leans toward mrs clinton saying her health care plan would allow unions and management to negotiate more worker friendly contracts both plan to put out yard signs and knock on doors for the democratic nominee
