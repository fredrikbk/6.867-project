of stock in the market shrank by hundreds of billions of dollars in the past four years with the supply of stock down and demand strong the market rallied now as the economy slows and credit markets buckle high profile companies are cutting back on buybacks and some wish they held on to the cash they gave back to shareholders "in an environment like this stock buybacks take second place " said james dimon chief executive of j p morgan chase &amp co in a conference call last month yesterday shares of freddie mac fell on word that the mortgage company may halve its dividend and seek a capital infusion amid a record loss freddie might not be in this position if it hadnt bought back at least &# billion of common stock earlier this year and replaced it with preferred shares fannie mae the largest u s home funding company has tapped the markets more recently raising &# billion in less than two months by selling preferred stock fannie shares fell yesterday and are at their lowest level since may in recent weeks countrywide financial corp which spent &# billion in the past year to repurchase its shares was forced to sell a chunk of its stock to raise money office depot inc which bought back million shares for an average price of &# a share said on its earnings call yesterday that it would like to buy its shares at the current price of &# but cant office depot fell yesterday home depot inc said it will delay the rest of its massive stock buyback plan while investors in citigroup inc have turned nervous about the health of the banks balance sheet and capital levels prompting management to say it isnt in the position to repurchase shares the reversal of the trend exposes a flaw in the buyback strategy many companies bought high and are selling low from the third quarter of to the second quarter of this year more than &# trillion of shares in nonfinancial companies has disappeared from the stock market through buybacks mergers or buyouts according to the federal reserve the number hit a peak during the second quarter of this year when nonfinancial companies retired a seasonally adjusted net &# billion of shares some of the money to buy the shares came from the credit markets where companies raised &# billion in the quarter now some investors worry that dividends and buybacks will go from a positive for the market to a negative as a slowing economy and deteriorating balance sheets put pressure on a host of companies investors usually embrace buybacks even if those shares are richly valued because they typically signal that companies are generating a lot of cash compelled by investor demands however many companies borrowed money through various forms of "recapitalization" to buy back stock the added debt has become a burden to an increasing number of companies share buybacks and leveraged buyouts have "accounted for downgrades of about a dozen investment grade companies " says nick riccio a corporate debt ratings analyst at standard &amp poors home depot for example was downgraded in july by s&amp p to a triple b plus rating from a plus the rating agency specifically cited home depots plans to finance a &# billion share buyback through the proceeds of an asset sale and &# billion in debt as the main reason for the downgrade last week home depot which already spent &# billion on buybacks in the first three fiscal quarters of the year said it believes "it is prudent to take a cautious stance with regard to the completion" of the buyback program of course share buybacks and dividends continue to remain popular forms of improving shareholder returns among s&amp p companies according to howard silverblatt senior index analyst at s&amp p this year of the s&amp p s dividend paying financial companies increased their dividends in the s&amp p overall more than half the companies either increased or initiated dividend payments only one company mortgage insurer mgic investment corp has reduced its dividend says mr silverblatt also s&amp p companies are on track to spend more than half a trillion dollars buying back shares this year up from &# billion last year "companies still have the enormous ability to finance their share repurchases " he says bulls argue that the moves by the large companies obscure continued buybacks from some smaller companies this week for example nacco industries inc a cleveland based truck housewares and mining holding company with a market value of &# million announced a plan to buy back as much as &# million of class a stock for all the hand wringing a number of large companies continue to announce buybacks including alcoa inc yesterday target corp announced a &# billion share repurchase authorization things are different in the financial sector banks already are scaling back stock buybacks to conserve capital for other uses like making loans to clients and setting aside money for bad loans further the nations largest financial institutions may need to use their balance sheets to fund loans for private equity deals because anticipated buyers for those loans have dried up leaving the banks on the hook the capital issue is especially pressing at citigroup which recently saw a key measure of a banks capital cushion known as tier one fall below its target of for the first time in years the bank has said that it doesnt expect to repurchase shares until it restores its capital ratio in the middle of next year while some have questioned whether citigroup will have to consider cutting its dividend the bank says it doesnt intend to do so people familiar with the matter say there are other steps it can take to shore up its capital position robin sidel contributed to this article see related article "tuesdays markets dow ends up despite growing signs
