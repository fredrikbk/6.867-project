no headline available i was talking with an old friend a longtime democrat and she asked if i knew what religion a certain presidential candidate was i replied that i didnt know and hoped id never find out we started to laugh and she nodded i didnt mean it and yet i meant it for we have come to an odd pass regarding candidates and their faith its not as if faith is unimportant its always important but we are asking our political figures mere flawed poor politicians to talk about their faith to a degree and in a manner that has become odd we push them against the wall and do a kind of theological frisk on them forty years ago a firm jawed silver haired michigan governor made a serious bid for the presidency he was well funded well credentialed and was done in by one of those campaign gaffes in which a throwaway line becomes a death knell he had changed his position on vietnam and in explaining his previous support said hed been "brainwashed" on the issue americans dont like their presidents to be people whod allow their brains to be sent to the dry cleaners republicans in particular were not amused so he was over his name was george romney he was mitts father and no one back in those narrow minded benighted days seems to have cared that much that he was a mormon now its an issue now we debate the candidates faith this is change is it progress it doesnt feel like it in we were as now a religious country but when we walked to the polls we thought we were about to hire a president not a bible study teacher no one cared really that richard nixon was a quaker they may have been confused by it but they werent upset his vice president spiro agnew was not greek orthodox but episcopalian nobody much noticed nelson rockefeller of new york was not an episcopalian but a baptist do you know what lyndon johnsons religion was he was a member of the disciples of christ but in what appeared to be the same way he was a member of the american legion youre in politics you join things hubert humphrey was born lutheran attended methodist churches and was rumored to be a congregationalist this didnt quite reach the level of mystery because nobody quite cared it is true that everyone knew jimmy carter was an evangelical christian but that was famous because they were a new and rising force in american politics in and after watergate his immersion in faith seemed refreshing he was a southern baptist who left the southern baptist convention in after many arguments including over whether mormons were christians he said yes no one knows what religion jerry ford was and just to add some mystery im not going to go to ask com about it as i did with the others ford didnt publicly share his heart on these matters he was of a generation that knew some things are actually we should brace ourselves here private ronald reagan was presbyterian but his faith was both ardent and lightly held he prayed a lot and when he did he knew who was listening but he was so unused to the normal ways of christian service that mike deaver once told me he once happily dipped the bread in the wine as communion was passed america cared that jack kennedy was catholic for a while wed never had a catholic president and only one catholic major party presidential nominee before him democrat al smith in but smith was rather too exotic in a number of ways with his new york accent and his ward heeler air he was a great man but a city boy in a small town nation kennedy urbane sophisticated taught by harold laski at the london school of economics made the most of his problem giving a great speech that put his foes on the defensive but it is an odd thing that as a nation we seemed more liberal on these issues then than today i think of jfk hearing that martin luther king jr s father said he wouldnt vote for kennedy because he was catholic kennedy is reported to have said "imagine martin luther kings father being a bigot " then being jack kennedy he detached and said philosophically "but then we all have our fathers " bill clinton was a southern baptist no one gave much thought to what bush one was including perhaps bush one until he was older but hed been raised among "the frozen chosen " which is how some denominations used to refer teasingly to episcopalians his son george w bush became president a few years after an intense christian conversion that was by all accounts transforming in the way of many recent converts in the great whoosh of feeling they often experience his presidency came to take much of its shape from a certain emotionalism certainly there were around him a number of transported spirits and pious connivers im afraid they rather took the fun out of things they ran it into the ground there are some people who believe faith doesnt belong in politics but it does and it is there inextricably the antislavery movement the temperance movement the civil rights movement the antiabortion movement all were political movements animated in large part by religious feeling its not that it doesnt matter you bring your whole self into the polling booth including your faith and your sense of right and wrong good and bad just as presidents bring their whole selves into the oval office i cant imagine how a president could do his job without faith but faith is also personal you can be touched by a candidates faith or interested in his apparent lack of it its never wholly unimportant but you should never see a politician as a leader of faith and we should not ask a man whose made his rise in the grubby world of politics to act as if he is an exemplar of his faith or an explainer or defender of it we have the emphasis wrong and the result is a mitt romney being harassed on radio shows about the particulars of his faith and hillary clinton a new class yuppie professional lawyer and board member announcing again and again how important her methodist faith is and how much she loves wearing her diamond cross for all i know for all you know it is completely true but there is also about it a weary unspoken sense of i know youre retards but im a retard too we should lighten up on demanding access to their hearts it is impossible for us to know their hearts its barely possible to know your own when we force political figures to tell us what faith resides in their hearts theyll be tempted to act to pretend do politicians tend to give in to temptation most people do are politicians better than most people quick a show of hands i dont think so either
