writer and graphic designer says he knows target date funds arent designed to be used this way but hes way behind on his retirement savings and hes trying to play catch up "i needed to roll the dice a little bit " mr nunn says but customization can have pitfalls including possible confusion "all this terminology conservative moderate aggressive none of this means anything to people who are not familiar with investing " says zvi bodie a professor at boston university school of management and "if you are familiar with investing then you know how mushy those terms are " target date funds have
