the mossberg solution no excuses a wire free way to upload photos wi fi device transfers digital shots to pcs and sites automatically no matter how perfectly shot or emotionally meaningful your digital photos may be if they arent uploaded to your computer or to a web site no one else will ever see them as they languish in your camera this problem has plagued the digital photo industry for years though the cameras themselves have improved most users know how to upload photos but dont want to hassle with usb cords and slow upload speeds when transferring images onto a computer or photo sharing site camera docks and memory card readers built into pcs have attempted to alleviate these transferring problems but these so called shortcuts still require a certain amount of dedication to the process in the past couple of years a handful of companies have gone a step farther by introducing wi fi enabled digital cameras notably nikon inc and eastman kodak co but this capability works only in certain cameras and even then requires users to walk through a number of steps to send the photos through a service created by the company instead of sending them to a computer or web site this week i tested a refreshingly simple gadget that solves this problem and does what most technology products dont it works in existing devices and requires next to no effort the &# eye fi card by eye fi inc www eye fi is a two gigabyte securedigital memory card with a built in wireless chip it slips into any camera with an sd card slot and whenever the camera is turned on looks for a familiar wi fi network and uploads your photos to your mac or pc and one of photo sharing sites after a quick one time setup the user does nothing more than turning on the digital camera i thought this thing was too good to be true and set out to find its flaws but after using it with two digital cameras one brand new and the other over three years old three different computers each with different operating systems and five photo sharing sites im convinced that the eye fi is a terrific little tool it works quickly and is a no brainer to get going the only people who wont like it are those who enjoy razzing their lazy friends for forgetting to share digital photos the eye fis flaws are minor enough to dismiss for one thing it doesnt work on wi fi networks that use log in pages like those in starbucks instead its meant to work on home networks or other "open" networks secondly theres no way to know when eye fi finishes transferring photos unless you check your computer finally your digital camera must stay on for the duration of the wireless transfer which slightly taxes battery power and slower networks and or transferring numerous higher resolution photos will require a bit more juice likewise eye fi looks for wi fi networks whenever the camera is on though the company says this only uses a minimal amount of the cameras battery power the eye fi card comes in a small colorful box that reminded me of a pop up book pull one side and a quick start guide appears on the right while the left swings out a piece holding the eye fi card reader and sd card this reader is only needed for the initial setup on each computer which only took a few minutes per system i tried my eye fi first on a windows xp machine plugging the card reader and card into a usb port the software setup walks users through clear quick steps like testing the computers firewall to be sure it can work through it and asking which folder should be designated to receive wirelessly transferred images here i also typed in my account information for sharing images on kodak gallery later i added shutterfly snapfish picasa and flickr other online destinations included blogs like vox and typepad along with social networking giant facebook the last step instructed me to insert the eye fi sd card into my camera to snap the first test photo of myself making sure it was working properly transferred photos are all reflected in the eye fi manager a web based password protected site that tells which images were uploaded to photo sharing sites and the computer users can opt to only upload from the eye fi to one or the other or both but only one photo sharing site and one mac or pc can be selected at a time account information for any of the sharing sites can be saved within eye fi making it a cinch to switch where you want to send photos around the office within my registered wi fi network i took photos that showed up seconds later on my computer screen at home i entered my password protected networks information one time and watched as captured photos transferred wirelessly from my camera to either my mac or windows vista laptop on average it took about seconds to upload each image to a web site and about seconds more after that for a photo to transfer onto my hard drive i got home from a friends cocktail party and set my camera on a table with its power on ten minutes later i turned on my computer to check the transfer and photos from the party were uploaded to my kodak gallery account and my imacs hard drive images upload in jpeg formats using their original full resolutions some sharing sites change the formats for photos but this varies between sites and isnt related to eye fi eye fi wont do absolutely everything for you so for certain photo sharing sites youll still need to log on to send out emails for sharing albums with friends but double clicking on any of the images in the eye fi manager takes you directly to wherever that image lives whether on picasa flickr or your own hard drive i swapped the eye fi sd card from one camera an older konica minolta dimage x that still works well to a new kodak easyshare v which ironically has built in photo emailing capability that isnt nearly as easy to use as eye fi the eye fi didnt miss a beat and operated the same way in both cameras the eye fi card is as simple as it sounds and works with most cameras that use sd cards for a complete list of compatible cameras see http support eye fi compatibility if someone you know is constantly taking pictures that are never seen again by anyone else and they use a wi fi network eye fi will serve as a carefree solution that takes the aggravation out of transferring photos to share with others edited by walter s mossberg email
