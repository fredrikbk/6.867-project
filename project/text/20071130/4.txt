american brain drain one myth dogging the immigration debate is that employers are fibbing or grossly exaggerating when they claim that hiring foreign professionals is unavoidable because u s born ph d s are hard to come by but a new report on doctorates from u s universities shows theyre telling the truth and then some foreign born students holding temporary visas received of all research doctorates awarded by u s universities in according to an annual survey by the national opinion research center at the university of chicago that number has climbed from in but more to the point of business competitiveness foreign students comprised of science and engineering doctorates last year "china was the country of origin for the largest number of non u s doctorates in " says the report followed by india korea taiwan and canada "the percentage of doctorates earned by u s citizens ranged from lows of in engineering and in physical sciences to highs of in education and in humanities " given this reality is it any wonder that of ph d s working in u s science and engineering occupations are foreign born immigration opponents still claim that the likes of intel and oracle merely want to hire chinese engineers on the cheap in fact u s law already prohibits companies from paying these foreign nationals less than natives and all other things being equal the american job applicant has an advantage because employers are required to pay an additional &# &# in taxes and fees on every h b visa holder they hire a mere h b visas for foreign professionals are allocated each year and this year as in the previous four the quota was exhausted almost as soon as the applications became available in april this effectively means that more than half of all foreign nationals who earned advanced degrees in math and science in have been shut out of the u s job market economic protectionists oppose lifting the visa cap to meet demand but it makes little sense for our universities to be educating these talented foreign students only to send them packing after graduation current policies have mit and stanford educating the next generation of innovators and then deporting them to create wealth elsewhere closing the door to foreign professionals puts u s companies at a competitive disadvantage and pushes jobs out of the country worse it does so at a time when other nations are rolling out the welcome mat earlier this year microsoft which is the third largest sponsor of h b visas announced plans to open a new software development center near vancouver the decision to locate the facility in canada was based in part on the fact that it doesnt have access to enough foreign workers state side "we currently do of our development work in the u s and wed like to continue doing that " says jack krumholtz the companys director of government affairs "but if we cant hire the developers we need were going to have to look to other options to get the work done " meanwhile the european union recently introduced its own new temporary work visa thats designed to reduce red tape and waiting periods for foreign professionals if the u s spurns this human capital it will find a home somewhere else and that will be americas loss see related letters "letters to the editor growing keeping the ph d s needed for a world beating economy" wsj dec
