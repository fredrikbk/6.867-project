racing canoe tom marshall fell again into the freezing regatta lake "its get on wobble around get off " said the year old who at pounds is more accustomed to playing rugby with friends on this winter day mr marshall and nine others were vying for a chance to spend nearly five years of their lives training at no pay to represent their country in the olympics the prize maybe a medal in the obscure sport of flatwater canoeing its all part of a highly pragmatic and uniquely british effort to maintain national pride when london plays host to the summer games in britain has a goal fourth place in the overall national medal count britains olympic organizers calculate that they need to gold medals just to come in fourth and thats a tall order for a nation that won just nine in athens in it placed th that year "we tried to take the real world into consideration " says matthew crawcour at britains national sports agency uk sport explaining the modest aspirations "the u s china and russia theyre relative untouchables " the british arent trying for big ticket draws like swimming or track and field instead sports officials have analyzed past competitions to identify areas where the competition appears weak hence the interest in sports such as team handball womens sprint kayak and flatwater canoeing facing a dearth of ready made competitors britain launched several training programs modeled on the idea behind the soviet and east german state systems for elite athletes decades ago that young people with the right physical and mental attributes but no experience can be turned into champions for an added boost uk sport is also retraining champions retired in one sport to do something else where age matters less in "project swap shop " gymnasts are becoming divers for example they have the same strong abs uk sport put out a call on tv in newspapers and online in february for tall men foot and up and women foot and up for a program called sporting giants about people applied for team handball volleyball and rowing chelsea warr head of recruiting at uk sport tested the most promising over the summer those who had played a team sport before interested handball recruiters because they were presumed to have the "game intelligence" to pick up the new sport quickly those with long arms but no experience were channeled into rowing huw goodwin answered a newspaper ad from uk sport calling for athletes to play for great britain he didnt know the rules for team handball and had never seen the game played now less than a year later the year old mr goodwin has left behind a job treating eating disorder patients to train full time as a member of the olympic team in return for living expenses and a bed to sleep in mr marshalls father heard about the sporting giants program on the bbc and emailed his son mr marshall who is feet inches tall was thinking about joining the royal marines or taking six months off to travel the world his background in athletics consisted of playing rugby for a local club in bristol in front of a crowd of maybe friends and parents mr marshall filled out an online application and was invited in for tests over the summer coaches put him on the ergometer a rowing machine that tests endurance by bringing arm and leg muscles to exhaustion he scored well above average he also made high marks on the bench pull which tests upper body strength not quite tall enough for rowing he was invited to try canoeing "i didnt even know the sport existed " he says on his first day here in october mr marshall sat among others and watched a motivational video of clips from races around the world accompanied by a chest thumping soundtrack coaches started the men in wide hulled canoes mr marshall promptly capsized after a week of practice men were sent home mr marshall though got the hang of paddling and progressed to lighter racing canoes "its like water skiing with a toothbrush out there " he says mr marshall takes the train from his home in bristol every friday evening to bunk four to a dorm room at the national water sports center here the team is often joined by children because the facility bills itself as a family friendly spot for sailing and boating during the week he works for his fathers software company and follows a training plan to run for half an hour outdoors in the morning and lift weights in the afternoon jotting down every detail to show his coaches mr marshall says he doesnt mind falling into the cold water currently about degrees fahrenheit he doesnt care that few people have ever heard of his sport "its just walking out those doors at the opening ceremony shaking like a leaf with all my mates " he says "im already getting that spine tingling feeling " athletes who make it through the preliminary physical tests must prove they have what it takes mentally natalie dunman uk head of talent identification for canoeing and kayaking says they evaluate recruits for traits like "coachability " trainers observe how easily recruits can shed their natural habits to pick up unfamiliar technique like twisting a canoe paddle at the end of the stroke to steer trainers also put athletes in unfamiliar situations to see how they deal with pressure mr marshall and the canoeing hopefuls were assigned to research their new sport and give oral presentations for example and for four days in august six aspiring female kayakers were taken camping outside dusseldorf germany to see how they managed that on regatta lake one afternoon recently brendan purcell the head coach for womens sprint kayaking looked on with a stopwatch while three women lined up their kayaks to race at the whistle year old victoria towers plunged her double bladed paddle into the water and accelerated across the lake "bury the paddle and thats too long in the back vicky " shouted mr purcell from the pier gesturing to show how the paddle should come out of the water at the hip ms towers nodded and swung her kayak back around to try again ms towers was competing in a university swim meet in april when ms dunman spotted her and persuaded her to try kayaking ms towers put off her studies in physical therapy indefinitely and moved here to train full time in september britain didnt win any medals in flatwater canoeing and just one bronze in kayaking in but coaches say theyll be happy with three or four of any color in even if they are barely balancing their boats right now athletes who make it through the next five years of training are expected to bring back medals says ms warr of uk sport "its not just an eight week summer camp "
