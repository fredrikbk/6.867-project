politics &amp economics on the ballot in russia putinism a big win for party will help president maintain influence moscow the only major uncertainty in sundays parliamentary election in russia is how big a landslide vladimir putins united russia party will win but the real intrigue will lie in the weeks after the vote when mr putin will reveal whom he will support to succeed him as president and likely how he intends to retain influence analysts say if united russia gets anything less than of the vote it will be a disappointment for mr putin who enjoys an official personal rating above his supporters would interpret a result near or above as an indisputable mandate to entrench "putinism " "a simple majority would signify a small victory " said sergei markov a political consultant and united russia member "a figure of would be a great victory " mr putin argues that success for united russia would give him "the moral right" to play a yet to be defined role after his term ends next spring ensuring that his policies which have been shoehorned into the simple catchphrase "putins plan " continue seeking to encourage heavy turnout and mobilize support mr putin and his supporters have stepped up nationalist rhetoric in recent weeks denouncing rivals as western stooges in a television address yesterday mr putin railed against opponents"demagogy " urging voters not to assume that russias revival will continue "automatically " voters were reminded of one of his key themes the danger of returning to the oligarch dominated s in a news item that followed courtesy of state controlled channel one that said tycoon boris berezovsky had been convicted in absentia of a fraud he allegedly committed in the s opposition parties alleged the contest isnt a fair fight anna solodukha of the small union of rightist forces or sps said her party has been a victim of a dirty tricks campaign she said authorities confiscated million sps campaign pamphlets that candidates dropped out after being threatened or offered inducements and that bogus campaign material has been distributed in the partys name "judging by the scale of the campaign against us it is sanctioned by the presidential administration " ms solodukha said the kremlin denies involvement "this is just an attempt to cover up the disorder in their party " said dmitry peskov a kremlin spokesman garry kasparov leader of the "other russia" opposition movement said he too was officially harassed thursday he was released after a five day jail stint for leading an unsanctioned march "i hope people around the world can see what happens to opposition activists in russia " he said election monitoring groups alleged voters are also being harried one group golos reported receiving hundreds of complaints on a telephone hotline from people who said they were being bullied by their bosses into voting for united russia or risk being fired or losing bonuses concerns have been heightened by news that pro kremlin youth activists will conduct exit polls outside booths sunday while russian media reported thursday that the central election commission group tasked with counting the votes will be led by members of mr putins united russia the presidential race kicked off wednesday so far the most prominent politician to announce plans to participate is gennady zyuganov the communist leader the clear favorite in the march poll will be the candidate mr putin endorses but he has kept his preferences secret the nomination deadline is dec but he could show his hand earlier possibly at a congress of the united russia party over the next few weeks "we will know who the candidates are very soon after the parliamentary election " said alexei makarkin analyst at the center for political technologies a moscow based political consultancy "but im not sure about putin he could draw out the intrigue until the very end " given the rigid policy discipline among mr putins allies the identity of the candidate wont reveal much about his presidential priorities which have already been predetermined in "putins plan " analysts said mr putins choice will be watched closely however for what it says about how he will continue to wield influence after his term ends a candidate perceived as weak such as prime minister viktor zubkov who has little political support on his own would likely be a sign mr putin would try to keep a tight grip on power from behind the scenes some analysts suggested such a candidate might even step down early opening the way for mr putin to run again as the constitution bars a third term only if it is consecutive a more prominent nominee like former defense minister sergei ivanov would be an indication that mr putin was handing over more of the reins analysts said "polls indicate that of the people are ready to vote for whichever candidate putin backs " said mr makarkin he added that the field would be crowded with one or possibly two decoy candidates but that it would be evident whom mr putin really favored mr putins successor will have to fight to emerge from his shadow "the next president will face a very hard job " said the kremlins mr peskov "he will have to perform because he will definitely be compared every day" with mr putin one option would be for mr putin to assume an informal "father of the nation" role though how that would work in practice remains a mystery other scenarios that have been floated include him becoming prime minister or becoming head of the united russia party which would control any future government through its commanding majority in parliament and by formally nominating his candidate for president
