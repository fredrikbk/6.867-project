funds known to hold the paper around the country many pension funds have assured their beneficiaries that they dont have investments in debt backed by low quality subprime mortgage loans some funds like floridas might hold money market investments that could be indirectly caught up in the crisis because of the opaque nature of some of these securities some government funds may not even realize that they own it "florida is unlikely to be the only state doing this " says win thin an analyst at brown brothers harriman in new york "when you find one it usually means youre going to find more "
