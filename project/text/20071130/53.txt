maguire shelved plan to thwart possible proxy fight real estate developer robert maguire iii who is fighting hedge funds for control of his company discussed with an independent board committee a plan to set up a defense against a possible proxy fight by instituting a board elected on a staggered basis according to a draft letter reviewed by the wall street journal however the plan was shelved this week mr maguire said the plan also would have allowed the board to consider bids for maguire properties inc including one from mr maguire according to the draft letter if a majority of the independent directors chose to sell to a third party the plan would have required mr maguire to support the sale the letter said the special board committee was considering changing the board structure in response to hedge funds that have taken at least an position in the company one of the funds jmb capital partners master fund lp has publicly pressed for a sale and notified mr maguire that if he did meet its demands the fund would put a slate of directors up for election at the shareholders meeting the draft letter was to mr maguire the chief executive from the companys vice chairman walter weisman who is chairman of the special committee the plan was apparently viable as recently as sunday and was tentatively scheduled for board consideration dec according to an email seen by the journal by tuesday when all aspects of the deal couldnt be worked out the special committee decided not to move forward it decided the company would not go to a staggered board also known as a classified board "a classified board is not presently in contemplation " mr weisman said maguire properties a los angeles based publicly traded real estate investment trust is more vulnerable to a proxy battle than other reits because its board is non staggered meaning all directors are elected each year according to corporate law in maryland where maguire is incorporated a board can vote to switch from a non staggered board to a staggered board with a simple board vote without the approval of shareholders says john haggerty a partner who specializes in reits for the law firm of goodwin procter llp converting to a staggered board would have given maguire properties greater protection against the likelihood that the entire board including mr maguire could be voted out the plan described in the draft letter called for the staggered board to take effect until the shareholders meeting unless shareholders voted to make it permanent the letter says that time would have allowed the independent directors to focus on "alternatives for delivering stockholder value in an environment which is not subject to pressure induced by the threat of an unsolicited change in control of the board " the letter says mr maguire declined to comment on the portion of the plan that would have required him to support the independent directors choice of a bidder even if that meant passing over a possible bid he made he said it was premature to discuss issues relating to a possible sale mr maguire said he concurred with the independent committee on the staggered board issue "the idea of a staggered board would create a lot of confusion and anger a lot of people " he said "im pretty confident i can demonstrate value without going to this if i cant then i ought to be out of here anyway " messrs maguire and weisman also declined to comment on why the special committee was formed or whether it will continue to meet maguire properties put itself on the block in but decided to remain public the company hasnt talked publicly about exploring such options again
