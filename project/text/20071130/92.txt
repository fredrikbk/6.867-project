the evening wrap pumped up politics online edition elections this weekend in russia and venezuela are expected to add elements to the complex mix of authoritarianism and energy wealth that defines these two emerging powers venezuelans will take to the polls sunday to cast their ballot on broad constitutional changes that would give president hugo chavez unprecedented powers the measures would help establish the legal framework to make venezuela into a socialist regime along cuban lines and eliminate term limits so that mr chavez could seek re election indefinitely the feisty leader who openly taunts the bush administration already controls the congress the courts the electoral commission and most state and city governments he has nationalized the telephone company and main power company and increased government control over the oil industry he remains popular with many impoverished venezuelans whom he has spent billions on through programs subsidizing food education and health but a poll from independent polling company datanalisis which accurately predicted the results of past elections gave the "no" vote on the referendum a lead of two to five percentage points depending on voter turnout still datanalisis director luis vicente leon told the wall street journal that a recent get out the vote push by mr chavezs political machinery could prove decisive meanwhile in russia the outcome is more certain the slate of united russia candidates being touted by president vladimir putin himself should make a relatively clean sweep of parliamentary elections on sunday analysts say mr putin seeks a ballot victory so crushing that it will cement his role as russias most popular politician even after his presidential term ends next spring he has said he intends to remain influential in the nations political scene though its unclear in what role like mr chavez who has played on nationalistic impulses in the run up to venezuelas vote in part by focusing on tensions with neighboring colombia mr putin has stirred jingoism in russia by lashing out at the west and today suspending russias participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty the kremlin has also been squeezing political opponents opposition leader garry kasparov was jailed for five days earlier this week for leading an unsanctioned march and anna solodukha of the small opposition union of rightist forces said authorities have confiscated campaign literature and induced candidates to drop out there are common denominators between messrs putin and chavez said thomas carothers vice president for studies of international politics and governance at the carnegie endowment for international peace they come down to elements of popularity self confidence money and of course oil venezuela is the u s s fourth largest oil supplier while mr putins popularity has been bolstered by russias booming oil fueled economy but the two also differ in certain respects mr chavez enjoys playing the caudillo the traditional latin american leader whose popularity stems from efforts to redistribute wealth in contrast mr putin has avoided leftist rhetoric and instead built popular support by tamping down the chaos that accompanied the demise of the soviet union "theyve built this kind of crony capitalist establishment around the kremlin but its a far cry from what chavez is doing " mr carothers said still he said russia and venezuela below to a category of countries along with china and iran that reject the wholesale adoption of western style democracy as a precondition for economic growth and playing a larger role on the international scene "they represent two variants of the same increasing push back that we see around the world " mr carothers said stocks end mixed
