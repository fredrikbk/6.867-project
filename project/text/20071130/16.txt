checkpoints save lives but make many miserable as i read your front page article "in west bank checkpoints splinter palestinian economy" nov i felt a growing empathy for the miserable palestinians and a mounting anger at the israelis for foisting this situation on these hapless souls i was awakened from my stupor when i reached the paragraph that i believe appeared to lay the blame for the intifada and the subsequent unraveling of the palestinian economy on ariel sharons ascent to the temple mount by the palestinians own admission the intifada had been planned long in advance they grabbed mr sharons theatrics as their way of justifying to the world their insidious plot while the checkpoints are ruinous to the palestinian economy they also significantly obstruct murderous intentions israeli mothers thank these checkpoints for at least a measure of comfort that they arent going to find their children dead in a pool of blood mercilessly butchered by terrorists if the arabs of palestine would focus on state building rather than state destroying israel and ultimately theirs they might find themselves economically prosperous robert m cooper m d baltimore one sentence in the article says all that needs to be said "israeli defense officials say the travel restrictions are vital for securing their citizens against terrorism " martin shandling los angeles sadiq nazal who is the peaceful one of the nazal brothers would be better off blaming his brother and his brothers ilk for the misery in which he finds himself he may not sell his trees but israel does not suffer suicide bombers jerome b spier tucson ariz the article missed an essential point war is hell of course the palestinian people are suffering as a result of their decision to walk away from negotiations in and launch a suicidal war against a country that possesses one of the best trained armies in the world and a citizenry that continues to succeed against all odds the japanese german and italian people suffered much more as a result of their countries aggression in world war ii than the palestinians have suffered as a result of attacking israel since the world always saves the palestinians from the full consequences of their terrible decisions they continue to make the same decisions josh baker bangkok thailand
