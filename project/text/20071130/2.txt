abbott stent gets panel backing despite clot worries abbott laboratories move to expand its reach got a boost as a food and drug administration panel backed the companys drug coated heart stent despite concerns about the long term risk of causing blood clots the panel of outside medical experts yesterday overwhelmingly said they believed abbotts stent called xience was effective at propping open previously blocked cardiac arteries and said the scaffold like device appeared to be safe for at least one year after being implanted while most panel members said there simply wasnt enough data to address long term safety issues the panel voted in favor of approving xience for sale drug coated stents have come under fire for a tendency to cause life threatening blood clots years after they are implanted in clogged arteries it isnt clear whether the rare problem is caused by the metal stent itself the drug that prevents the vessel from renarrowing or the polymer that releases the drug sales of the two coated stents on the market boston scientific corp s taxus and johnson &amp johnsons cypher have sunk on the safety concerns abbott is looking to xience to bolster its diversification strategy and show that its late stage pipeline products are making it swiftly to market the abbott park ill health care company won xience when it bought part of guidant corp last year for &# billion and needs the stent to succeed to vindicate that purchase and though its blockbuster anti inflammatory medicine humira is fueling the sales bump the company saw last quarter it is looking to new products for future growth the fda panels recommendation puts abbott on track to launch xience early next year the main clinical study submitted to the fda in support of approval compared xience to boston scientifics taxus and involved patients who were initially followed for one year of concern was the paucity of longer term data extending to two years and more the panel recommended that the fda require a post market study which abbott has already agreed to conduct the fda normally follows its panels advice but isnt required to do so the company expects to complete two year data next year but gave the fda a slice yesterday it presented data from patients who have had the xience stent for two years compared with patients with the taxus stent abbott rationalized that even the complete two year data it will get in the spring wont answer the late clotting question which a spokeswoman says is so rare that it would be necessary to follow up to patients for as long as five years john somberg a professor at rush university medical center in chicago who was the sole panel member to vote against the device said he wanted to wait for the full two year data "this is the smallest data set for safety and efficacy for any drug eluting stent " mr somberg said "it may actually be a better drug eluting stent but at the end of the day we need the data " some doctors say xience is easier to use than its competitors because it is thinner and more flexible that can make it easier to fit into crooked calcified arteries "i think deliverability is really important " says william oneill executive dean of clinical affairs at the miller school of medicine in miami who is a consultant for medtronic inc abbott boston scientific and johnson &amp johnson "you dont want to hassle with stents that struggle to fit "
