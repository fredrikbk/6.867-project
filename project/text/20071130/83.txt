ritz carlton web films play down its ritzy image marina del rey calif on the top floor of the ritz carlton here five well dressed but mildly disheveled young men straggle into a suite after a late night bachelor party the chatter is high end scotch women and poker "i cant drink anymore " one of the men says "my wife is gonna kill me " the friends raise crystal tumblers filled with year old lagavulin scotch and toast the groom making the requisite insults and in jokes it could be a scene from "entourage " but this is no television show its a short film or a very long commercial depending on your view it is also ritz carltons riskiest ad campaign yet and part of a larger effort to loosen the stiff image of the deluxe hotel chain as it seeks to broaden its appeal among young professionals and families now with backing from american express co which is featured in passing ritz carlton has commissioned three short films and hired an award winning young director with experience in filmmaking and commercials each film features actors in their s and s in situations that upend the brands formality while highlighting its attention to service the films are planned to run from around four to minutes each and will begin airing on the ritz carlton web site and on its hotel televisions early next year the chain plans to attract consumers to its web site to view the films with online trailers posted on general interest sites as yahoo msn and youtube it is also planning film screenings in new york los angeles and london and is working on promotional events with w and gourmet magazines the films are meant to send the message that "theres no stereotypical ritz carlton guest " said chris graves the executive creative director for saatchi &amp saatchis team one advertising which also developed the hotel chains print ad campaign in the ritz campaign mr graves imagines people viewing the films might think "hey i had no idea you could experience that kind of thing at a ritz " the campaign underscores one of ritz carltons key challenges it is an icon of conservative "old money" at a time when the country is flush with newly rich young men and women seeking luxury experiences a little more exciting than those of their parents "there are younger gen xers and millennials who dont feel comfortable checking into mahogany paneling oriental rugs and hunting scenes in their tennis shoes and jeans " says bjorn hanson a principal with pricewaterhousecoopers ritz carlton launched the first salvo in its attempt to loosen up two years ago with print ads that took the consumer out of the hotel room and onto beachfronts and city sidewalks the ads were meant to show readers the types of experiences they could expect to have with ritz last year ritz carlton dropped strict rules governing employee behavior among them an admonition to never say "hello" to a guest but always to use a more formal greeting like "good morning" in favor of common sense principles that allow employees to respond more naturally to a guest and as ritz carlton which is owned by marriott international inc launches new hotels it is dropping its standard mahogany motif in favor of designs that reflect the locale in one of the new films called "the delay " a year old front desk clerk named ian empathizes with a professional woman about the same age named sylvie who is saddened by a break up with her boyfriend and a travel delay that has made her miss a concert with friends according to the shooting script the scene plays out as follows "she stands there kind of spacing out tired no one says anything " "we see that ian intuitively feels sylvies pain wants to comfort her but he must remain professional " later ian convinces sylvie to return to the lobby and leads her into a private jam session involving heartthrob singer songwriter duncan sheik in the hotel lounge while the director shyam madiraju says the films will not linger on the ritz carlton logo or the american express credit cards used by the protagonists instead identifying the setting through dialogue "welcome to the ritz carlton " a clerk says to a woman checking in and glimpses of the hotels storied name "the films are about ritz values not ritz itself " says mr madiraju in the script for another ritz carlton film shot in black and white a woman ditches her boyfriend after he wagers her in a swimming contest against another man "they look around no angela only our waiter who stands by with two perfectly folded towels " the men wind up in the hotel bar drinking expensive spirits after the woman disappears with one of the mens car and the other ones briefcase the resulting image is that of a much looser ritz carlton "at the end of the day we knew it was time to do something a little different " says bruce j himelstein ritz carltons senior vice president for sales and marketing "this brand doesnt leave you a lot of wiggle room but we decided to push the envelope a bit " mr himelstein says ritz carltons creative team realizes there is a risk of alienating the hotels older traditional customer base but mr himelstein says he believes the brand image can be stretched without breaking he looks to well established brands like louis vuitton which underwent a massive refreshment after hiring designer marc jacobs "i look at brands like that that have stepped out of the box a little bit and brought a new customer without offending the existing customer " mr himelstein says noting that ritz carlton is going in the right direction ten years ago he says market research showed the chains average customer was a white man in his mid to late s more recent research shows the average ritz guest is about years old and as likely to be a woman as a man he says it is indicative of the struggle ritz carlton faces to break old perceptions that to create its ideal future it had to hire actors and do a bit of redecorating for the bachelor party short a pale green flower print tasseled couch was removed from the suite and hidden in a back hallway to make room for sleek cream colored rented couches for a more masculine less grandmotherly look it is also indicative of how crowded and competitive the luxury market has become ritz carlton once dominated the niche along with four seasons now everybody from independent hotel developer barry sternlicht to blackstone owned hilton is getting into the high end luxury market new research from pricewaterhousecoopers found luxury hotel brands were launched between and october "the largest number of luxury brand introductions in a three year period since " according to the report even as the u s economy seems close to stalling and the credit crunch is having at least a slight impact on hotel construction pricewaterhousecooperss mr hanson says there is still a growing demand for luxury offerings as affluent baby boomers and the generations following them continue to spend on travel as more luxury brands fill the market hotels will have to work harder to cater to travelers expectations while distinguishing themselves from the crowd ritz carlton officials says they know the brand needs to move forward as the world changes at least some things remain nonnegotiable however the first draft of the swimming pool script called for the two men to walk soaking wet into the ritz carlton bar realizing the woman they both wanted had run off the dripping wet men order drinks with an american express card ritz carlton officials balked the scene was changed "youre not going to see two guys dripping wet walking into one of our bars " says mr himelstein "we would have offered them robes "
