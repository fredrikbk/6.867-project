why citadel pounced on wounded e trade hedge fund gambles that crisis will abate mr caplans last stand on monday nov kenneth griffin was boarding a plane to new york when he received an urgent call from joe russell a lieutenant at mr griffins big hedge fund citadel investment group shares of online broker e trade financial corp were plunging in value and citadel a holder of e trade shares and debt was losing money rapidly "we need to focus on this fast " said mr russell citadels head of credit investments relaying word that an analyst report suggesting possible bankruptcy had sent shares of e trade reeling "lets go " mr griffin shot back as he authorized a plan to begin buying up millions of shares of e trade the next morning mr griffin and his team reached out to e trade hoping to inject money directly into the company mr griffin was sensing that he could profit from a recovery at e trade and the overall financial markets which have been in turmoil since the summer late wednesday night a deal was reached to invest &# billion into e trade which is best known as a discount brokerage firm but also runs a federal savings and loan that units ventures into mortgage securities have taken a devastating toll sinking e trades stock to below its price at the start of the year the stock closed yesterday in nasdaq stock market trading at &# a share down cents citadels big gamble comes at a key moment in the global financial crisis after largely treating mortgage portfolios and banks for months as if they were so much toxic waste hedge funds and private investors are starting to make some big investments hoping to pick off opportunities abu dhabis investment arm agreed to pump &# billion into citigroup inc earlier this week while hedge funds have been fighting over the carcass of failed british bank northern rock if theyve timed an investment plunge right there are fortunes to be made and the new money could help set a realistic floor value for the hundreds of billions in mortgage related securities that have been peddled around the globe but bottom fishing has its risks since bank of america corp made its &# billion investment in countrywide financial corp three months ago the value of the u s s biggest mortgage lender has tumbled the stake is now estimated to be worth around &# billion though it pays a dividend citadels mr griffin years old is confident the worst scenarios are already priced into the securities of a number of financial companies that view extends to a &# billion portfolio of e trades mortgages and other securities which citadel now has agreed to buy from e trade for &# million citadel also is injecting &# billion into e trade in exchange for year e trade notes that pay it interest and shares boosting its stake to almost of e trades stock outstanding "the market is pricing assets like things are going to get really bad " mr griffin said in an interview "but the more likely outcome is for the economy to slow for two or three quarters and then strengthen " the investment in e trade is the highest profile move in citadels history representing about of the hedge funds overall investment portfolio it is a humiliating comedown for e trade and its now deposed chief executive mitch caplan who failed sufficiently to anticipate the impact of mortgage failures at first blush e trade would seem an unlikely victim of the credit crunch a firm that rose to fame during the internet bubble running super bowl ads featuring a dancing chimpanzee but behind the scenes the online broker was moving deeply into the world of mortgage banking in it bought a bank co founded by mr caplan an eternally optimistic manager who got his start as a real estate and banking lawyer in a interview with american banker mr caplan spoke of mortgages as the "bedrock asset" of america when he landed at e trade in the firm embarked on a simple strategy of using bank deposits to make and purchase mortgage loans along the way it also bought securities backed by mortgages and even acquired a firm later sold that made loans to buy boats and recreational vehicles the strategy produced years of record revenue growth and in catapulted mr caplan into the ceo spot when his predecessor got ensnared in a pay scandal by early concerns were creeping into the mortgage market but mr caplan reasoned that e trade would be fine according to people familiar with the firms thinking more than of its borrowers were judged as "strong" borrowers based on their credit histories while these loans were on e trades books it had outsourced collecting payments on the mortgages this added to the firms false sense of security data on loan default rates often arrived late as the data had to be processed by the outsourcing companies this delay would prove crucial when a credit crisis struck in the summer over the summer e trades mortgage portfolio continued to deteriorate and on july the company adjusted its earnings outlook downward by late october e trade had hired advisory firm blackrock inc to assess the damage to its mortgage portfolio according to a person familiar with the matter and on nov e trades mr caplan made a key call to j p morgan chase &amp co banker james b lee also a bank vice chairman "we need you to take a hard look at our options " mr caplan said according to people familiar with the matter by this time mr caplan had already retained longtime banker jane wheeler at evercore partners to work on a rescue plan about a week later on nov mr lee and a team of bankers flew to e trades arlington va offices to lay out the options two potential bidding groups were at the top of list one was citadel and the other was the duo of brokerage firm td ameritrade holding corp and private equity fund j c flowers &amp co also that day e trades top executives huddled to assess their rapidly deteriorating mortgage portfolio "we honestly cant predict with any certainty where this is going anymore and we just shouldnt even try to peg the bottom anymore " a weary mr caplan said to the executives the firm then issued another profit warning and dismissed a top trading executive and members of his team the following monday would prove to be a turning point a securities analyst at citigroup prashant bhatia wrote in a scathing report that given e trades troubles "customers may withdraw assets and ask questions later " mr bhatia estimated there was a chance e trade would be forced to file for bankruptcy protection mr caplan was furious and said publicly that a bankruptcy filing was not an option some investors werent keen to take the risk however and that day they wiped &# billion in market value from e trade shares more than half the companys stock market value the shares traded lower than they had since mid customers would go on to remove some &# billion to &# billion of bank deposits in the ensuing weeks the next morning citadels mr russell went to e trades new york headquarters three blocks away from a new york office of chicago based citadel to begin negotiations and examine e trades books mr griffin showed up three days later leading a group of some citadel analysts and advisers in late night meetings with e trades team a parade of other potential bidders visited e trades "data room" to go over its books and the banks management team held meetings with the interested parties charles schwab corp fidelity investments morgan stanley deutsche bank ag and private equity firms tpg and blackstone group all made inquiries only a handful made serious proposals of those nearly all were focused on e trades brokerage arm acquiring e trades bank would have required a buyer to mark its troubled debt security portfolio to current market prices making it unattractive to most strategic buyers separating the brokerage arm from the bank presented a problem for e trade however most of its brokerage customers also hold regular bank accounts with the company if the brokerage arm was sold off and the brokerage customers took their deposits with them the e trade bank could have collapsed that risk would have made it difficult to secure support for a deal from regulators at the office of thrift supervision according to people familiar with the matter in addition breaking off the bank would have cost e trade precious time the situation left citadel and the separate bidding group of td ameritrade and j c flowers as the leading contenders j christopher flowers a former goldman sachs partner who runs j c flowers balked after scrutinizing e trades financial data he was worried about how much money he would have to commit to what bankers around the deal had begun referring to as "the hole " e trades flagging bank his withdrawal left td ameritrade without a partner early in the talks mr griffin had proposed paying about &# million for e trades &# billion asset backed pool and he was prepared to boost the bid as the negotiations heated up according to someone close to the talks but as the mortgage market deteriorated the citadel team became more concerned and stuck firm with its original offer sensing growing problems for e trade citadel also decided to put more money into the company by buying year e trade notes mr griffin felt more than ordinary pressure his wife also a hedge fund manager is due with their first child early next month three times during the negotiations mr griffin flew to new york for all day talks at citadels offices or e trades headquarters three blocks away and flew back home at night for citadel the terms of the overall deal are attractive because in addition to the million e trade shares that citadel receives e trade will continue to pay interest on the &# billion in debt the hedge fund is taking on in meetings at the new york law offices of davis polk &amp wardwell citadel executives laid out their vision for e trade as they saw it the e trade bank was an ideal platform for future acquisitions in addition e trade still claims a big market share in online stock brokerage an area that citadel executives were convinced will grow as baby boomers retire and younger investors move inexorably to the internet by the middle of november the crisis was starting to wear on mr caplan the e trade executive who lives on a sleepy tree lined road in bethesda md took up temporary residence in new york on nov and was working round the clock "i just really want this company to survive " mr caplan confided to j p morgans mr lee early last week mr lee people familiar with the matter say encouraged him to stay the course telling mr caplan "you are doing the right thing " last saturday citadels mr griffin made his pitch to e trades board by teleconference "i believe in your company and the model you have " he said according to a person who listened on the call the citadel proposal according to people familiar with e trades thinking was attractive because it allowed the company to unload its riskiest position the &# billion in asset backed securities "most of the offers were from bottom feeders and no one but citadel seemed to have a solution to our situation " said one person close to the negotiations in the past year citadel has profited by swooping in and buying a range of investments from troubled hedge funds sowood capital and amaranth llc cementing its role as a go to player on wall street for firms in crisis still the hedge fund has underestimated the extent of the housing markets problems in the past year according to people close to the firm and the e trade deal has risk if the housing market continues to tumble and the economy sinks into a recession citadel can still be hurt by declines in the mortgages and other assets for mr caplan the end came on tuesday when e trades board sat down in person to weigh the citadel offer at davis polks offices "this company is my life " he told several people that day including the firms member board lawyers and bankers "i will do what you want me to but i think sweeping changes need to be made " jarrett lilien mr caplans longtime lieutenant and until this week president and chief operating officer of e trade was installed as temporary ceo while the firm looks for a replacement he will be a candidate for the top job donald layton a former vice chairman of j p morgan who once ran sales and trading at the giant financial services firm will serve as chairman mr caplan will stay on the board despite the deal e trade shares fell more than yesterday investors evidently were concerned that e trade still will have to deal with &# billion of mortgages on its books including &# billion of home equity loans and that it is adding &# billion in debt the notes to be issued to citadel and to a small extent to blackrock the deal also increases the number of e trade shares outstanding by diluting future earnings per share citadel is convinced it has a winner reasoning that e trade can handle the debt and that its capital infusion will permit e trade to take market shares in the banking and online brokerage businesses
