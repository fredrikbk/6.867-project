weekend journal review theater they sing they dance they debate goodspeed opera house route east haddam conn &# &# extended through dec meet me in st louis paper mill playhouse brookside dr millburn n j &# &# closes dec east haddam conn now that the broadway stagehands strike has been settled how do you plan to spend your hard earned entertainment dollar just because broadway is open again doesnt mean you have to go to "jersey boys" or even "mamma mia " if its musical comedy that you crave let me tell you about two fine shows that are well within driving distance of manhattan goodspeed musicals revival of "" was the first time id seen peter stones rousing salute to the founding fathers onstage since the original road show version came to st louis years ago that production was a spectacular piece of work whose quick change set designed by the legendary jo mielziner is still clear in my minds eye i wondered how goodspeed could squeeze the whole show onto the tiny stage of its year old theater without breaking something but no sooner did the red white and blue curtain go up on michael schweikardts handsome looking version of the chamber of the continental congress than i knew i was in good hands goodspeeds "" is a masterpiece of compression a production that more than makes up in stylishness for what it lacks in costly gimmickry " " of course tells the story of the writing of the declaration of independence that isnt exactly your stock musical comedy plot and for all the shows not infrequent moments of cartoonishness its gratifying to see how seriously mr stone who wrote the book and sherman edwards who wrote the songs took their task in between the one liners "" paints a clear eyed picture of the hard nosed give and take of political compromise while the book is the heart of the matter the last scene is entirely spoken the best songs "cool cool considerate men" in particular are no less central to the shows effect rob ruggiero the director has done an exceptional job of pointing up the drama in a musical whose outcome is well known to anyone who stayed awake during the first week of american history thanks to his smart staging the large mostly male cast ends up looming larger than the sum of its somewhat inconsistent parts peter a carey and ronn carroll are memorably characterful as john adams and ben franklin and i was just as impressed by some of the small part players most notably john newton and trip plymale if youve never been to goodspeed prepare yourself for a delightful piece of time traveling the company performs in a well preserved seat auditorium that first opened its doors when rutherford b hayes was in the white house the facilities have been modernized but the atmosphere is still that of a th century opera house i cant imagine a more appropriate place in which to watch a musical about the making of america distance from times square miles leave now and beat the rush millburn n j its not my custom to review holiday fare but the stage version of "meet me in st louis " like the movie on which it was based is a christmas show only in the loosest of senses that being the case i hit the road for paper mill playhouse whose production of this not quite seasonal chestnut is thoroughly engaging like " " paper mills "meet me in st louis" profits from being performed on a good looking set rob bissingers rendering of kensington ave the best known imaginary address in hollywood is a life size candy colored dollhouse whose walls swing open to reveal a turn of the century living room denis joness staging of the musical numbers is equally eye catching ive never seen better choreography in a regional musical comedy production and the cast tears into his steps with the right mix of precision and high spirits i wish mark s hoebee the director had dialed down the cuteness a notch or two but it never gets out of hand and several of the performers especially jb adams and roni caggiano are as good as you could possibly hope for "meet me in st louis" works better on screen than on stage in part because none of the additional songs that hugh martin and ralph blane wrote for the broadway version are half so good as "the boy next door " "the trolley song" or the exquisitely melancholy "have yourself a merry little christmas " theyre serviceable though and hugh wheelers book is skillfully adapted from the screenplay i still get a smile on my face whenever i think of the miraculous miniature version of "meet me in st louis" mounted by new yorks irish repertory theatre on its thumbnail size stage last winter but this production if not nearly so imaginative is completely satisfying in its more conventional way one reason why i went to paper mill was to see brynn omalley in the role played in the film by the year old judy garland i was knocked out by her sharp witted acting in the centerstage production of "arsenic and old lace" that i saw in baltimore two months ago so i was sorry to find a slip in sundays program saying that shed fallen ill the good news is that erin henry ms omalleys understudy who was rushed into costume at the last minute gave a solid well sung performance i admire her pluck distance from times square miles you wont even break a sweat mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout
