weekend journal the drivers seat honda fcx clarity honda sees a hydrogen future as a rule i dont write reviews of cars i have driven only miles but rules are made to be broken particularly in the case of hondas hydrogen fuel cell fcx clarity like any alternative fuel vehicle it comes with more caveats than cupholders but the bottom line is that this is a true zero emission vehicle yet it looks operates and drives like anything else on the road there is simply no more realistic a peek into the possibly green future of the automobile not the theoretical chevrolet volt from general motors nor the electric tesla billionaire toy and not even the holy green grail of the plug in prius the chief factor separating the fcx clarity from the rest of these publicity seekers is that ostensibly the average consumer will be able to buy one soon honda says it will begin leasing the sedan in the los angeles area next summer though the company has yet to say how many will be available or how it plans to decide who gets one initially production is expected to be extremely limited so far honda has leased only three of its first generation fcx fuel cell cars to consumers one limiting factor is there are only five public hydrogen filling stations in the l a area since the &# per month lease doesnt begin to reflect the true cost of the new model the hydrogen fuel cell stack is extremely expensive honda will lose a lot of money on each car it builds if this makes the fcx clarity seem more like another public relations stunt or simply something less of a "real" car consider that honda developed an entirely new vehicle architecture and even engineered it to be built on a conventional assembly line that means that save for its ultra expensive power plant the fcx clarity could be produced right alongside the civic the heart of the car is its "v flow" fuel cell stack honda says this improves upon past designs in part because of a vertical layout that helps boost efficiency and power output the setup also allowed the unit to be shrunk in size and weight so that it fits within the center tunnel between the seats the fuel cell produces electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen gas and the oxygen found in ambient air emitting water and air as its only byproducts a horsepower electric motor drives the front wheels of the car drawing electricity from the fuel cell as well as a supplemental lithium ion battery pack this motor also serves as the generator for the cars regenerative braking system which recharges the battery pack under deceleration the battery and a single hydrogen tank are stored under and behind the rear seats honda says the fcx clarity can reach a top speed of mph and drivers can expect to get miles from a full tank the company says fuel economy is estimated at the equivalent of miles per gallon of gasoline based on the energy content of hydrogen vs gas outside of the power train the rest of the package is fairly conventional the car even starts with the turn of a regular key some of the gauges however are a bit different what looks like a tachometer actually shows power output in kilowatts rather than engine revolutions per minute and there are two fuel meters one for the hydrogen tank and another for the battery but this is minor stuff in a car that looks and feels like it could be the new accord except the fcx clarity isnt so ugly while similar in size to hondas best selling sedan the fuel cell cars compact electric motor allowed the front end and hood to be smaller which in turn gave hondas stylists the ability to craft a sleek profile save for its maroon color the only one available its a great looking car that draws on other hondas for styling inspiration from the civic to the discontinued insight hybrid this is about what youd expect from a company whose civic hybrid resembles every other civic sedan and as a consequence a company thats getting its butt kicked in the green pr battle not only by toyota but gm too devoid of the latter makers too obvious "green" logos youd never guess what the fcx clarity is if you didnt know already you can even make a case that toyotas prius is a more adventurous car its certainly weirder looking the understatement of the fcx claritys design extended to the driving experience during my brief honda organized test a run through that proved less exciting than my anticipation of it the car accelerates adequately though its performance is equivalent to a four cylinder model not a v without the shift points of a conventional transmission the power delivery is seamless but the whine of the electric motor at peak power output can be annoying even if youre not someone whos fallen in love with the roar of an internal combustion engine at wide open throttle the regenerative braking system is similar to what youd find in many hybrids except that without the engine braking effect of a piston motor the last few feet of deceleration require a more forceful stab on the brake pedal if youve ever driven a car without power brakes thats what it feels like the fcx clarity seems to ride and handle well which isnt surprising given that it has a conventional suspension and the curb weight is a somewhat reasonable pounds about pounds more than a similarly equipped accord the biggest objection i have to the fcx clarity is that its only a four seater its high center tunnel precludes a bench seat in the back of course there are more substantial arguments that can be made against the fcx clarity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in general the most damning is that since it takes energy to create hydrogen a zero emissions car is only as green as the source of that energy im not going to wade into the argument over the viability of producing hydrogen through renewable means but it clearly isnt being done today besides my more immediate concern is with the devil i know the auto industry whose track record with green cars is dismal driving the fcx clarity through downtown santa monica calif it was hard to miss the "electric vehicle recharging station" signs a reminder of the last path car makers led us down in pursuit of zero emissions that is before they started canceling their electric car programs and crushing the vehicles honda would like us to believe that it didnt kill its own electric car as much as reinvent it as todays fcx clarity which is somewhat ironic as questions about the infrastructure to support these hydrogen fueled cars seem like deja vu from the electric vehicle era at the end of the last decade while this certainly foments suspicion it also fosters hope that someday soon one of the car makers is going to figure out this alternative fuel thing at least honda still seems to be trying
