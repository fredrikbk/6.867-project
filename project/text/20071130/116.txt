weekend journal tastings a global spin on holiday cheer on our gift list great bubbly from all over the world one of the most popular holiday presents weve recommended over the years is something we call the world wide sampler its a mixed case of affordable wines from throughout the world everywhere except california to make the point that lovely well made and fairly priced wine is being produced pretty much all over the globe these days this year we have a twist on the idea that would make an even more festive gift the world wide sparkler sampler sales of sparkling wine are robust imports of sparkling wine increased between and according to u s government reports acnielsen says sales of all bubblies rose by volume last year of course around this time of year all eyes turn to bubbly to celebrate the holidays and ring in the new year but most people still think of sparkling wine only as a beverage to celebrate big events like weddings or national holidays with good sparkling wines flooding the market theres no reason to wait until the last six weeks of the year to enjoy a bottle of bubbly not only does sparkling wine help the worries of everyday life fade away no matter when its opened but many bubblies also pair well with all kinds of food from sushi to just about anything with a cream sauce thats where the world wide sparkler sampler comes in its a case of good sparkling wine from all over the world except california and the champagne region of france california produces fine sparkling wine and only champagne is champagne but weve avoided those two areas because its not a surprise to anyone that california and champagne produce good bubbly but greece israel austria we think that might be more unexpected so we have spent the past couple of months trying sparkling wines from all over the world some are fairly widely available and some are rare but we can say this with confidence there has never been a broader selection of well made well thought out sparkling wines on store shelves with the competition in the sparkling wine market intense wineries clearly understand that they need to produce clean balanced and charming bubblies at a good price and they are so here is a possible case of sparkling wines from around the world that will amaze and excite any friend because some of these can be hard to find and because bubbly is special you might think about a six bottle case instead of the prices we list are very general designed to give you a broad idea of how much these wines might cost where we have a specific favorite that isnt rare weve listed that wine but dont worry too much about individual names because it will be hard enough to find a selection without focusing too narrowly getting a nice group of these will probably require a visit to at least a couple of good wine stores and some help finding them sometimes they are displayed with other sparklers sometimes with still wines from the same region and sometimes just lost in a corner somewhere but hey isnt the wine lover in your life worth it mionetto brut &# or any prosecco from italy prosecco is the lightly sparkling mellow bubbly from the veneto region of italy its better as a welcome home aperitif than a match with food another reliable name in prosecco is zardetto &# cristalino brut &# or any cava from spain look closely and youll likely see quite a bit of cava on shelves good old freixenet cordon negro in the black bottle &# continues to be reliable so if thats the one you see thats fine but it would be more fun to get something new and different gruet brut from new mexico &# or any bubbly from a state other than california gruet makes about cases of very good sparkling wine the brut was our best value in a tasting of american bubblies under &# last year and is just one example of the fine bubblies being made all over the u s any one of them would be an eye opener about the exciting things happening to the wine industry in every state for our recent column about american bubblies drop us a note at wine wsj com a sekt from germany sekt is germanys name for sparkling wine many of us have long been familiar with henkell trocken &# a nutty full wine thats good with food but some excellent smaller production sekt is beginning to show up on shelves as well we tasted a bubbly made from the scheurebe grape gysler "bundle of scheu" &# and it was excellent soft fruity and gentle with the acidity of a ripe lemon and some honeysuckle at the end even better would be a sekt from austria more and more fine wines are arriving from austria every day and among them are some bubblies we dont see them often but we did taste a brut from the well known producer brundlmayer &# and it was very good clean and balanced with some richness a bit of honey and real complexity graham beck brut &# or any sparkling wine from south africa wines from south africa havent made quite the splash we expected a few years ago but theyre out there and the graham beck seems to be fairly widely available its soft and lacks the intensity of some other bubblies but its pleasant and highly drinkable a sparkling vouvray from france vouvray is made from the chenin blanc grape which means the sparkling version has a natural fruitiness thats quite fetching with some apples and honey these will generally cost between &# and &# lucien albrecht &# or any cremant dalsace from france these are often full wines with tartness and some weight theyre especially good with food like the vouvray this is a good example of the fine sparklers made in france that arent champagne yarden blanc de blancs &# or any bubbly from israel weve been impressed with yardens sparklers for years and this one is especially good with brioche minerals great acidity and plenty of class it would open anyones mind to whats possible in israel and even more broadly help put to rest any misconceptions about the quality of todays kosher wines sparkling shiraz from australia yes this is sparkling wine thats deep red wed guess that many people avoid red sparklers because that used to mean gross sweet stuff that tasted like cough syrup but good sparkling shiraz is different with a firm blackberry core and a lovely finish there are quite a few of them out there but its impossible to know which youll see theyll cost anywhere between &# and &# with an average around &# our most recent favorite for instance was majella which costs around &# two rose versions of any of these pink bubbly is a big trend and you should be able to find a rose version of several of the wines above we very much enjoyed the rose cristalino &# it was impressively austere for a rose and we thought it would be great with roast chicken but our favorite was the rose lucien albrecht cremant from alsace &# which was so delicate and beautiful that it reminded us of a pink rose in fact it was our single favorite wine of the entire world wide tasting other this is the most important category because you are likely to see something unexpected in our own tasting we also tried bubblies from new zealand hungary and portugal we tried a sparkler from argentina that was made from chardonnay and semillon we tried a semi sweet white sparkling muscat from moldova and a semi sweet sparkling red muscat from ukraine one of the best wines of our tastings in fact was a sparkler from greece made from moschofilero grapes it was spiropoulos "ode panos" &# and it was quite floral and mouth watering with a good underpinning of minerals it made us think of herbed grilled fish one last thing with your gift include a note that says something like "these are everyday bubblies for the special occasions that happen every day drink up " melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us
