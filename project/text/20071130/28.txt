course correction in counterinsurgency class soldiers think like taliban stalled in afghanistan u s now schools troops in politics propaganda kabul afghanistan a natural born insurgent sgt first class jacob stockdill was brimming with malicious suggestions when a group of american soldiers and afghan security men sat down last month to plot their own defeat "i can put a guy out on a ridge with an ak and have him take a couple of shots " sgt stockdill proposed to fellow students at the armys new afghanistan counterinsurgency academy "the americans will shoot back with their big guns and disrupt the whole valley being an insurgent would be so easy " capt chris rowe finished his thought "all you have to do is not screw up and even if you do you just blame it on the americans " six years into the afghan war the army has decided its troops on the ground still dont understand well enough how to battle the taliban insurgency so since the spring groups of people have been attending intensive five day sessions in plywood classrooms in the corner of a u s base here where they learn to think like a taliban and counterpunch like a politician the academys principal message the war that began to oust a regime has evolved into a popularity contest where insurgents and counterinsurgents vie for public support and the right to rule the implicit critique many u s and allied soldiers still arrive in the country well trained to kill but not to persuade in april the army gave a year old rhodes scholar capt dan helmer six weeks to get the school up and running capt helmer tells his students who rank as high as colonel that the important battles here are political and just military he exhorts them to go to great lengths to understand local politics culture and history to make sure actions they take on the battlefield help convince afghans that the kabul government will serve and protect them "were trying to win an argument that supporting the government is worth risking your life for " he says its an argument he says that the u s led coalition isnt yet winning "today we control no more and no less of afghanistan than the soviets did " during their year occupation that began in lt col john nagl co author of the armys counterinsurgency doctrine says he was struck during a visit to troops in afghanistan earlier this year by their "uneven understanding of counterinsurgency principles" at work in the afghan campaign col nagl commands a battalion at fort riley kan dedicated to training american troops to become mentors to iraqi and afghan forces when he returned from his trip he urged commanders to set up the counterinsurgency school and to put capt helmer in charge capt helmer a west point graduate from mantua n j originally deployed to afghanistan as a mentor for the afghan national police at oxford he was author of a study on israels fight against hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon where an army with overwhelming conventional superiority found itself mired against insurgents who had the vital support of the locals fast talking with deep set eyes a sunburned neck and a moustache that he grew out of respect for afghanistans hairiness is next to manliness culture he says he thought from the start that army training didnt prepare troops well for the intricacies of fighting the afghan insurgency army officials say theyve made great strides this year providing troops with afghanistan specific training before they reach the combat zone including counterinsurgency seminars for officers and scenario exercises for foot soldiers but the army acknowledges that some troops fall through the cracks "there isnt enough time between being told that theyre going and getting them through the training " says lou gelling deputy commander of the armys battle command training program "thats the reality of it " the counterinsurgency training sometimes seems targeted more toward iraq according to capt helmer and col nagl of the men under col nagls command almost all are iraq veterans and just one has served in afghanistan even capt helmers orders to afghanistan included the mistaken but telling instruction to take a course in arabic a language spoken in iraq but not in afghanistan in iraq the u s has set up separate counterinsurgency academies for iraqi and coalition students in afghanistan capt helmer insisted on putting troops from the nation coalition into the classroom with their counterparts from the afghan army police and spy service one of the schools central tenets is that foreign forces cannot win the war afghan security forces and government officials must take the lead in any activity whether its an attack on taliban redoubts or reconstruction of a mosque in order to increase popular support for president hamid karzais government "afghans have more experience in irregular warfare than anyone in the world full stop " says capt helmer many members of afghanistans security forces fought either for or against mujahedeen insurgents during the soviet occupation or fought as rebels against the taliban government that ruled from until the u s led invasion in capt helmer and his instructors many of them pulled out of combat to teach for a few days tell students that for the insurgents to succeed they must discredit the government while selling the afghan public on a cause islamic purity tribal rivalries a simple distaste for foreign occupation or revenge for past affronts to family and honor students took the roles of insurgents in an academy session late last month capt khawja mohammed a year old training officer for the afghan riot police suggested they stage a public hanging of someone suspected of collaborating with the coalition "we can intimidate people " he offered lt col sayed najeeb of the afghan intelligence service proposed a series of attacks on coalition or government checkpoints "that will tell the people that the government cant take care of itself " col najeeb a year old with a thick black beard black shirt and black pinstriped suit he spoke in dari one of afghanistans main languages through an interpreter as insurgents he said "we can tell the people that the infidels have come to destroy their religion but if we dont demonstrate enough force people wont join us " sgt first class james litchford from hattiesburg miss said he would plan a frontal assault on a major u s base the attackers should grab the americans "by the belt " he said that is get so close to the base so fast that the defenders wouldnt dare use air strikes or artillery for fear of hitting their own men then the insurgents would swarm through the base defenses he said "all youve got to do is overrun it " he said "you dont have to hold it " the news media would do the rest he said boosting the insurgents standing in afghanistan and damaging morale back in the u s "weve got to bleed them out and make the coalition lose its will to fight " said sgt stockdill a beefy year old from rural valley pa warming to the challenge academy instructors teach that counterinsurgents must "clear hold and build" to insulate the public from insurgent tactics while demonstrating that the government has something better to offer in the "clear" stage afghan and coalition troops physically force insurgents from villages and towns separating them from the civilian populace the military then fills the void with quick impact aid such as emergency clinics food distribution or free blankets and farm implements in the next phase the government and its allies must maintain a constant presence to hold the villages to reassure the public that the insurgents wont come back to punish those who collaborate with the authorities they also should sweeten the pot by providing more substantial projects to demonstrate kabuls competence such as rebuilding a mosque or repairing irrigation ditches "you lose credibility with the people if you dont hold " marine first lt jack isaac a year old instructor from dallas pa warned his class instructors told students how in the chalekor valley in zabur province an american led force cleared five villages in may and inflicted terrible casualties on taliban fighters who tried to overrun a joint u s afghan base the allied forces provided medical services and other goodwill projects but ultimately they didnt have enough troops to maintain a presence in the valley when they pulled out the taliban returned the "build" phase requires long term economic development so that "the enemy is no longer welcome and support for the government is strong " according to the academys student handbook that means bigger projects such as paved roads linking isolated villages to market towns results ultimately will be apparent not in the number of dead taliban instructors say but in indicators such as school attendance election turnouts business growth and increasing tips about impending attacks but as the academy students discovered putting the theory into practice can feel like building a sand castle as the tide is coming in theres only so much aid money to go around there are only so many soldiers to clear and hold there are local blood feuds to resolve there are local power structures to decipher there are civilians to charm and there are insurgents trying to disrupt the whole venture one common complaint in afghanistan is that the coalition makes big promises but fails to deliver "afghans dont understand how if the worlds only superpower is involved in a fight it cant get them a goddamn road after promising to do so in " says capt helmer smaller missteps can undo months of counterinsurgency efforts lt isaac and a fellow instructor arrived at the academy last month in a u s military convoy the drivers worried about suicide bombers and ambushes sped through kabul honking and bullying civilian vehicles away "we just made a thousand new enemies " lt isaac told his colleague another example as a goodwill gesture in september coalition soldiers in khost province handed out soccer balls decorated with the flags of the world one of them the saudi flag bears a verse from the koran rumors spread widely that the coalition was in essence encouraging afghan children to put their holy book on the ground and kick it more damaging are any deaths of afghan civilians at the hands of coalition forces sgt litchford told his classmates one day "the military cant win this war but it sure as hell can lose it " capt ray gilmore a year old from north conway n h told his students about a fight earlier this year in the zerkoh valley in which locals and western media reported that u s air strikes killed dozens of civilians the u s military says special forces troops came under taliban attack and killed fighters but that further investigation found no evidence of civilian deaths still the afghan government permanently banned coalition troops from entering the area capt gilmore says capt helmer says counterinsurgents face a paradox "the more you protect the force the less safe you are " when coalition troops hole up in big bases surrounded by barbed wire and sand barriers they risk turning the locals toward the insurgents small vulnerable outposts set among the villages such as ones the army has erected along the pech river valley near pakistan bring troops and people closer together when the insurgents attack the troops they are attacking the people too but such exposed positions also increase the near term risk of allied casualties col najeeb the afghan intelligence officer complained to american classmates that coalition troops sometimes are so nervous about being hit that they mistrust all afghans including the security forces he told of being sent to scout out a village before a coalition sweep as he left the village on a motorcycle nato troops opened fire on him even though he waved id proving he is a government agent he never got close enough to warn the coalition soldiers of the ambush that awaited them in the village he said his classmate capt nick talbot a year old from washington d c countered with a story about a car bomb in september in nangarhar province near pakistan u s troops arrived to find a man in a police uniform unconscious on the ground when they did a routine body search for any unseen injuries they discovered he was wearing a vest filled with explosives the man woke up but was unable to detonate the bomb before the soldiers killed him "it can make you very hesitant to work very closely" with afghan security forces capt talbot confessed to col najeeb sgt richard palmer a fire department paramedic from myrtle beach s c asked for his classmates advice in handling cultural differences sgt palmer works as a police mentor in kapisa province near kabul not long ago he and three afghan police officers were standing guard while other forces entered a building during the search sgt palmer was dumbfounded to see the afghan officers remove their shoes and socks and begin their prayers he wanted to be culturally sensitive but didnt want any insurgents climbing over the compound wall in the end he stood guard by himself "i didnt know how to approach that " he told his classmates capt khawja the riot police trainer responded "when were on a mission we have to do our duty we can pray at another time god will never punish me for that " marine lt col christopher nash a year old instructor from hillsboro ore agreed but had a broader take "think about what the insurgents are trying to tell the populace that the coalition is the infidel " he told the students if the public saw coalition troops patrolling side by side with afghan troops carrying their prayer mats it might send "a powerful message " he said "it may be an inconvenience in the security area but in the hearts and minds area its a big win "
