is jaw jaw really better than war war this is in response to shelby steeles op ed "obama is right on iran " nov mr steeles explanation and comparison of a war of survival which grants moral authority and a war of discipline which does not is clear and persuasive his ultimate point however is less clear and not persuasive it is unclear to me how tehrans hypothetical exploitation or any amount of snubbing of a u s diplomatic inititative would create the degree of sympathy at home and abroad necessary to give the u s broad based support to go to war with iran george j bude chesterfield mo shelby steele in saying barack obama is right on meeting with iran gets it exactly wrong meeting with irans ahmadinejad will not give us "the license to fight to win " nor will it give our "allies around the world every reason to respect us " ask israel about its success in trying to gain moral authority or anything else for that matter any gains certainly didnt come from looking vulnerable only their losses did jeff green sioux falls s d mr steele advocates the u s talk to irans leaders using "smart and daring brinkmanship of moral authority " by recognizing were dealing with a war of discipline the thinking goes we enable our leaders to either reach some accord with iran or being spurned are justified to fight iran for our survival how is this different from neville chamberlains wishful thinking making distinctions between different kinds of wars doesnt alter the fact that we either treat with our enemies or defeat them we live in a nuclear age if iran develops a weapon and uses it against us while were dithering around implementing smart and daring moral brinkmanship the end result is disastrously the same don rose rutherford n j the only reason iran is portrayed as an "enemy" of the u s is that the iranians as well as most iraqis of course want the u s to withdraw entirely from iraq and to stop helping israel to oppress the palestinians shelby steele apparently is unaware that britain was not ready for war with germany when neville chamberlain met with adolf hitler in munich in the earl of halifax was the uncle of a friend of mine so i have a special interest in this matter james canning seattle wash mr steeles framework is backwards the nazis were no immediate threat to the u s as impressive as the nazi war machine was in they had no ability to project power across the atlantic they had a very small surface navy and not a single aircraft carrier their missiles could hit england but not the u s the u s could easily have built up its army and navy for defending our coasts and sat out world war ii terrorists on did far more damage to the continental u s than the nazis thus pre emptive wars against nations with nuclear ambitions that actively support terrorism may in fact be more vital to our survival than fighting the nazis one atom bomb in a u s city could cause more u s casualties than all u s wars combined marc weiss new york delay in the pursuit of a "war of discipline " as mr steele refers may lead to a "war of survival " world war ii was the result of such a delay churchill was in effect advocating a "war of discipline" in an effort to avoid a "war of survival" which ultimately resulted in about million war related casualties the real question is how todays media would have commented on a preemptive strike by the allies in nazi germany in my guess is that churchill and roosevelt would have been the subjects of vitriolic commentary comparable to that received by blair and bush members of the media such as mr steele may guide the public to elect an obama like dove in an effort to promote some nebulous notion he calls "moral authority" and i suspect ahmadinejad will eagerly welcome lengthy negotiations with western leaders as he continues pursuit of advanced weaponry james butler naples fla
