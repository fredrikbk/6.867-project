old fashioned christmas at thanksgiving the kids asked what i wanted for my birthday a new rolodex i told them after years its dog eared they started looking through it one name had the notation "dead" under it so why they asked are you keeping his phone number another listing for a woman had "new husband bobby" penciled in the card still had room for two more cross outs and two subsequent husbands sure it has cards for people i havent contacted in years but you never know the handyman is under "h" because how can i be expected to remember his name doctor and dentist are under "d " i dont see how a pda can match the rolodex for convenience the next day my son reported that hed been to four stores asking for a rolodex only to be met with blank looks so i was delighted to read "clinging to the rolodex " weekend journal nov that i am not the only remaining dinosaur and that rolodexes are still being made keep looking i told him im worth it patricia tolzmann cincinnati
