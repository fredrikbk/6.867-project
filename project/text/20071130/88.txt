sk telecom and private equity firm providence equity partners to invest &# billion in the company and to install the telecommunications companys former chairman tim donahue as chief executive officer according to people familiar with the matter mr donahue and the investment group proposed the deal in a nov letter to sprints board these people said the board didnt grant mr donahue or the investors a meeting before declining the offer these people said such a unilateral rejection might upset some investors who have seen sprints stock price drop since early june there was speculation this year that sprint might be the target of a full fledged private equity buyout but such a deal never materialized and it would be harder to pull off now with credit so tight the rejection comes as the board searches for a new ceo to succeed gary forsee who departed last month under the boards pressure the new ceo will have to deal with strategic challenges including slow subscriber growth and increasing competition from major wireless competitors and how to follow through with a major wireless broadband initiative mr donahue who was ceo of nextel communications inc and negotiated its sale to sprint in for &# billion became chairman of the combined company after the merger closed in he stepped down late last year he was prepared to return as ceo and planned to bring in a full slate of top executives to handle marketing and operations the people familiar with the matter said but there is significant resistance from some sprint directors to bringing mr donahue back while he remains very popular with nextel employees sprint has performed poorly since the merger and some longtime sprint directors and investors blame mr donahue and the nextel management team they say sprint bought a wireless carrier with a creaky network that needed major upgrades and a user base susceptible to being lured by competitors some directors are backing alternative candidates such as embarq corp ceo dan hesse a sprint spokeswoman declined comment providence equity and sk telecom didnt respond to inquiries sprints board is split into sprint and nextel camps a cultural divide that still permeates the company two years after the merger nextel views sprint as overly bureaucratic while sprint feels nextels network is at the core of the companys problems that is part of the reason the board is interested in hiring an outsider who wont be viewed as biased to either side the donahue led group said in a bid letter to the board that it was prepared to invest &# billion or "potentially substantially more" in the form of securities convertible into equity after some period of time at a stock price higher than sprints share price today as well as a noncash dividend of to these people said sprint has a market capitalization of about &# billion the consortium also said it was prepared to sign a definitive agreement with sprint within days sprint shares rose nine cents to &# in after hours trading after rising as of p m in new york stock exchange composite trading the consortium said it could bring sprint "a deep wireless management team a strategic relationship with a leading global wireless operator significant strategic capital and the public market sponsorship of an accomplished private equity investor " one benefit highlighted by the group was the fact that sk telecom is deploying its own version of the wimax high speed wireless technology that sprint is also building the company has experience with the issues sprint is likely to confront with that technology sk telecom is considered a leader in cellphone innovation globally the bid letter touted new applications such as the companys mobile facebook service sk telecom also is part owner of helio a cellular start up operator in the u s that buys wholesale access to sprints cellular network sprints board is hoping to wrap up its ceo search before the end of the year some influential members of the board including legacy sprint director irvine hockaday who heads the search committee want to hire an executive willing to live in kansas where they hope to consolidate the companys operations people familiar with the search say since the merger sprint has maintained offices in overland park kan while keeping nextels reston va operations as its official headquarters mr hesse is a leading candidate for the ceo job partly because he is based in kansas already the board of embarq a local phone company that was spun out of sprint last year requested that mr hesse not be recruited people familiar with the situation say sprint also has discussed the position with former sprint president ronald lemay and a top executive at procter &amp gamble co people familiar with the search process say comcast corp chief operating officer steve burke was approached for the job but turned it down the people say paul saleh sprints interim ceo and chief financial officer has been campaigning hard for the job with top sprint shareholders mr saleh a legacy nextel executive has told employees in internal company memos that moving sprint to kansas is "off the table " mr donahues return to the company would be dramatic he was widely given credit for turning nextel a small and struggling start up into a fast growing wireless carrier before it merged with sprint many nextel employees were disappointed at his exit last year some investors could get behind mr donahues proposal if it seems the company isnt going to land a solid ceo candidate but activist investor ralph whitworth who before mr forsee quit had threatened a proxy fight for board seats unless sprint directors immediately dealt with the companys leadership issue praised the sprint board for rebuffing the consortiums bid to install mr donahue "i dont think the ceo job ought to be up for auction " said mr whitworth in an interview yesterday mr whitworths relational investors llc now owns roughly of sprints shares outstanding "its bad business to link minority investments with ceo selection decisions " he continued "if i had been a board member it the proposal would have been dead on arrival the board did the right thing " the new sprint ceo will face huge challenges the companys two major competitors at&amp t inc and verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc are adding subscribers quickly and leaving sprint behind sprint is struggling with customer service problems that have led to a high rate of subscriber defections to other carriers the company is also facing demands from mr whitworth and other investors to restructure its plans to deploy a &# billion wireless broadband network using wimax technology
