review &amp outlook editorial the trial bar on trial the barons of the tort bar must have thought would be a very good year some of their biggest cases katrina enron were set to pay out and a democratic congress meant no more worries about legal reform talk about reversal of fortune as the year ends we are witnessing nothing short of the dismantling of what are alleged to be major tort criminal enterprises bill lerach the king of class actions stands disgraced as an admitted felon his former partners at milberg weiss face trial for being part of the same kickback scheme as lerach federal prosecutors continue to pursue a criminal probe into asbestos and silicosis litigation fraud and now comes the indictment of mississippi tort legend richard "dickie" scruggs who is trying to soak insurance companies the way he once did big tobacco on wednesday mr scruggs and four cohorts were indicted for trying to bribe a state judge in exchange for favorable rulings the indictment reads like something out of a bad john grisham novel complete with piles of cash delivered secretly and wiretapped conversations featuring phrases like "bodies buried " the accused claim to be innocent but our reading of the indictment is that they are going to need very good defense counsel the alleged conspiracy flows from litigation after hurricane katrina the scruggs law firm established a tort consortium called the scruggs katrina group to shake down the insurance industry for not paying enough in claims even though most homeowner policies excluded flood damage not atypically a dispute emerged between mr scruggs and one of the groups attorneys john griffin jones over how to divide the &# million in attorneys loot from a mass settlement with state farm insurance co according to the indictment after jones v scruggs moved to court mr scruggs attempted to buy off presiding circuit court judge henry lackey judge lackey reported the bribery overture and assisted with an fbi investigation presumably the judge wore a wire since the u s attorneys case so far seems based largely on evidence gathered from secret conversations in march of this year the complaint says two meetings took place at mr scruggss offices in oxford mississippi to discuss "how to influence the outcome" of the jones suit the alleged conspirators include his son zachary a partner in the scruggs firm and another partner sidney backstrom as well as an outside attorney timothy balducci and former state auditor steven patterson who resigned his office in amid malfeasance allegations later that month mr balducci acting as the intermediary first approached judge lackey in may mr backstrom emailed mr balducci an order they wanted the judge to sign which is not specified in the indictment other than that it was favorable to mr scruggs in a conversation with judge lackey listed in the indictment mr balducci describes their relationship "he and i can talk very private sic about these kinds of matters and i have the fullest confidence that if the court you know is inclined to rule in favor everything will be good the only person in the world outside of me and you that has discussed this is me and dick scruggs " the ellipses in the quotes are from the indictment itself mr balducci continued "we uh like i say it aint but three people in the world that know anything about this and two of them are sitting here and the other one the other one uh being scruggs he and i um how shall i say for over the last five or six years there there are bodies buried that that you know that he and i know where where are and and my my trust in his mine in him and his in mine in me i am sure are the same " the indictment says that in september judge lackey working undercover agreed to a &# bribe from mr balducci to be delivered in installments after discussing the matter with messrs patterson and backstrom mr balducci allegedly delivered &# in cash to the judges chambers mr balducci told mr patterson "all is done all is handled and all is well " the government claims he later made two more &# payments with plans for a third after talking to mr scruggs if convicted the scruggs five could each face up to years in prison keep in mind that these arent street toughs but officers of the court men who are supposed to uphold the law and who daily claim to be agents of justice against fraudulent business if guilty they are the pin striped version of crooked cops traitors to the public by the way in addition to this indictment mr scruggs is also facing criminal contempt charges for flagrantly violating a judges order in a different state farm matter he says hes innocent of that charge too
