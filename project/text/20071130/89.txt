morgan stanley ousted zoe cruz its co president and heir apparent yesterday after the firm suffered more than &# billion in mortgage related paper losses the departure of ms cruz one of the highest ranking women on wall street was a surprise while ms cruz years old had oversight of the part of the business that had suffered losses it appeared she had survived the bloodletting brought upon by the credit crisis apparently ms cruz suffered not only from the mortgage losses but from criticism of her leadership style which many colleagues said could be difficult and from lingering wounds from a bruising battle for control of the firm during that struggle she played a polarizing role remaining loyal to philip purcell an unpopular chief executive who later was ousted john mack who succeeded mr purcell stood by ms cruz but the trading losses gave him a reason to question her leadership ms cruz becomes the latest top executive ensnared in a mortgage debacle that has cost top executives at merrill lynch &amp co citigroup inc bears stearns cos and ubs ag their jobs in a release ms cruz wrote "it has been a real privilege for me to spend the past years at this great firm while working alongside of and learning from some of the smartest and most talented people in the business " ms cruz who retired effective immediately and her co president bob scully a former banker who will join a new office of the chairman will be succeeded by two new co presidents investment banking boss walid chammah and wealth management chief james gorman morgan stanley said on nov it suffered paper losses of &# billion on mortgage related securities in the first two months of the fourth quarter and had another &# billion in exposure since then the market values of its remaining exposures have declined according to a person familiar with the firm suggesting additional write downs are likely mr mack informed the board of the shake up at a regularly scheduled meeting in a release he praised ms cruzs " years of distinguished service " but said messrs chammah and gorman are "the right team with the right skills to lead morgan stanley now " analyst richard bove of punk ziegel &amp co said the "thursday night massacre" points to "the likelihood that the firm will announce larger than expected losses" in a few weeks in a report tuesday analyst brad hintz of sanford bernstein &amp co concluded that a decision by the firm after mr mack returned in mid to ramp up its trading risk had backfired mr hintz said he expected the firm to write down a total of &# billion or &# billion more than it had announced in the fourth quarter ending this month "virtually everything they made since they started ramping up proprietary trading has been wiped out by this mistake " mr hintz said some bankers and traders at morgan stanley have long resented ms cruzs rise within the firm her ascent after mr mack was installed as ceo was remarkable given the polarizing role she played in when mr purcell was pressured to resign by investors and morgan stanley alumni mr purcell ousted several popular executives in march questioning their loyalty after the alumni called for his head he installed ms cruz as co president as his team fought to stem departures of star bankers and traders unhappy with mr purcells leadership she was so unpopular with a number of high profile morgan exiles that they refused to return after mr mack became ceo if she remained co president they included vikram pandit now a candidate to lead citigroup inc and star banker joseph perella mr mack a longtime supporter of ms cruz in his early days at morgan stanley said he didnt want to put the firm through more trauma while he praised her for recent positive results he was unsure she was the right person to continue leading the firm people familiar with the matter said partly because some people found her hard to get along with in choosing messrs chammah and gorman mr mack is meshing the firms old culture with new mr chammah who works out of london is a longtime relationship banker and close mack associate who has been repeatedly promoted since mid mr gorman a highly regarded executive at merrill lynch joined morgan stanley after mr macks arrival and oversaw the firms brokerage division which had been badly lagging its peers over time people familiar with the matter said mr mack became comfortable with mr gorman in the two years or so since mr gorman took over the retail brokerage productivity or revenue per broker has exceeded other firms on the street by some measures in addition the unit went from a profit margin before mr gorman arrived to last quarter news of ms cruzs departure was announced after the markets closed morgan stanley shares like that of many of its rivals have taken a beating as it has written down the value of its mortgage portfolio in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday its shares were down &# or to &# and have fallen this year morgan stanleys exposure to subprime mortgages was less than that of merrill lynch or citigroup both leaders in underwriting collateralized debt obligations for the third quarter ended in august morgan reported a &# billion fall in fixed income revenue that was linked to losses in mortgage backed securities as well as &# million in quantitative stock trading losses by the end of october losses leapt because an initially bearish bet on mortgage markets left the firm holding a large exposure to collateralized debt obligations losses tied to subprime mortgages in september and october along with downgrades of cdo vehicles in october and a dive in the abx index which tracks the values of subprime bonds forced morgan to write down these cdo holdings to &# billion at the end of october from &# billion at the end of august the hit came as continuing subprime losses ate through cdos subjecting what were thought to be the safest securities within these vehicles to losses morgan was thought to have held these securities as a hedge against its bearish bets on subprime holdings and to finance them morgan had a large exposure to a vehicle called carina which mainly held derivatives tied to subprime bonds morgan also ousted or demoted two other executives with some responsibility for the mortgage losses tony tufariello global head of structured products is leaving the firm and neal shear who led the fixed income currencies and commodities division will become chairman of the commodities business bernsteins mr hintz cited those moves as a sign the losses stemmed from a failure of execution of a trading strategy rather than a failure of risk management "they were going to short and the execution failed " he said "mack is mack you can be his best friend and hes going to tell you your future belongs elsewhere " ms cruz grew up in a small town near thessaloniki greece graduated from harvard business school and worked as a currency trader at a boston bank before joining morgan stanley in
