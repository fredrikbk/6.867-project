politics &amp economics in venezuela big choice for voters chavez pushes hard for greater powers new path for nation caracas venezuela venezuelans will vote sunday on sweeping constitutional changes that would give an enormous boost to president hugo chavezs unprecedented powers while setting up the legal framework to make venezuela the u s s fourth largest oil supplier into a socialist regime along cuban lines the proposed changes would eliminate the central banks independence sharply limit the role and definition of private property and emasculate the powers of governors and mayors allowing mr chavez to literally redraw the political map of venezuela under the new charter mr chavez could unilaterally set and dispose of the nations foreign currency reserves he would be able to appoint or dismiss vice presidents who would rule over the countrys states which he intends to group into six to eight regions perhaps most important for mr chavez the changes would allow for his unlimited re election "he becomes a king " said rafael simon jimenez a former political ally of the president and a past vice president of the countrys congress "what chavez wants to do is rule the country until the day he dies " polls indicate the vote will be close turning the referendum into a political challenge for mr chavez who has dominated venezuelan politics since his election in in the past decade mr chavez has twice won re election pushed through a constitution in which these changes would scrap and has beaten back a recall referendum all by landslide margins already mr chavez controls the congress the courts the electoral commission and most state and city governments he has nationalized the telephone company and main power company and increased government control over the oil industry mr chavez remains popular with many poor venezuelans on whom he has spent billions on programs subsidizing food education and health they may like some of the proposed changes like cutting the workday from eight to six hours and providing pensions for street peddlers and other informal workers but many of the same supporters are cool toward mr chavezs plan for turning the country into a socialist regime "this business which is mine may not end up being mine " said luis pena who runs a mom and pop store in a caracas barrio and has previously supported mr chavez "we dont want more socialism " mr chavez years old has turned the constitutional referendum into a plebiscite on his rule "whoever says hes for chavez and votes no is a traitor " he told thousands of followers at one recent rally he has told supporters he would consider stepping down if the constitutional changes lose at home and abroad mr chavez has had a number of setbacks in recent weeks on the international front spains king juan carlos in an unprecedented display of royal ire publicly told the voluble mr chavez to "shut up" at a conference of latin american heads of state where mr chavez persisted in calling a former spanish prime minister a "fascist " days later colombian president alvaro uribe abruptly ended mr chavezs high profile role in negotiating the release of hostages held by colombias communist guerrillas after the venezuelan spoke directly with the head of colombias military despite an agreement not to do so in retaliation mr chavez said he would freeze relations with spain until the king apologized after doing the same with colombia mr chavez on wednesday said he wouldnt "have anything to do with mr uribe or with the colombian government " in bogota colombian foreign minister fernando araujo was cautious saying colombia hadnt received any official word on the state of relations on the home front mr chavez has been bedeviled by the rise of a nationwide student protest movement that has organized marches of tens of thousands of students a showing that has invigorated a dispirited opposition even as shoppers flock to stores overflowing with imported merchandise venezuelans are facing shortages of basic foodstuffs such as milk mainly caused by the imposition of price controls which have nevertheless failed to tame inflation of a year many venezuelans are frustrated as well with mr chavezs failure to deal with the countrys high level of violent crime earlier this month mr chavez was sideswiped by the defection of a prominent comrade in arms his former defense minister retired gen raul baduel in news conferences mr baduel considered a hero by chavistas for restoring mr chavez to power after a short lived coup in has repeatedly called the proposed reforms a "coup detat" and urged the president to withdraw them "i have a moral duty to defend the constitution now as i did before " said mr baduel in an interview in a poll datanalisis an independent polling company that has accurately predicted the results of past elections gave the "no" vote a lead of two to five percentage points depending on voter turnout datanalisis director luis vicente leon said mr chavezs campaigning his insistent focus on the souring of relations with neighboring colombia which mr chavez has used to stir nationalist passions and his attempt to make the vote a referendum on himself appears to have struck a chord with venezuelans reversing what had been a trend to vote against the changes the ability of the governments political machine to get voters to the polls may give it an edge in sundays vote mr leon said that edge however would be eroded if voter turnout is high the catholic church evangelical christian pastors many unions and professional associations and most law school deans and university rectors have condemned the proposed constitutional changes they said the referendum is illegal because the only way to make such deep changes is through a constitutional convention but mr chavez has put the full weight of the governments political machinery behind the campaign to approve the reforms the country is plastered with posters urging venezuelans to vote "yes" on the referendum mr chavez who is normally on the air giving speeches and news conferences for about hours a week has become even more omnipresent than usual on the nations airwaves many venezuelans fear they will lose government jobs loans and contracts if they vote against mr chavez as has happened before "i will stay until my skeleton is dry until my blood stops flowing " said mr chavez talking of his plans to govern forever if the constitutional reforms permitting his re election are approved
