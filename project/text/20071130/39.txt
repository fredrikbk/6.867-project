freds folly on fox news this sunday fred thompson laid out the most creative tax proposal yet in the race for president it should have been an important moment the point at which gop aspirants finally dug into a core issue and went a few rounds over marginal rates and corporate levies instead nothing the thompson plan inspired little fanfare less press and didnt even merit time during this weeks gop debate the black hole says everything about the mess that is the thompson campaign and just as much about todays intellectually bereft republican primary campaign the standard rap on the former tennessee senator is that hes lazy this is meant to explain why despite movie star status southern conservative credentials and beltway experience his campaign has been as fizzy as day old cherry coke the reality is more complex and more concerning for mr thompsons presidential prospects the watergate attorney has made himself into this elections don quixote the impractical idealist tilting at "the system " even as he announced his run on the jay leno show in september mr thompson quipped he "wasnt in the room when they made the rules" that resulted in todays sped up big money hour news byte primary he has refused to play nice declaring late and declining to join rivals in the media hoopla and nonstop campaign it has proven a case study in the folly of trying to single handedly buck modern politics it might have helped if mr thompson who stated his intention to trust in "the people" to give him a hearing had offered those people something more than personality at the start of his tardy campaign it has instead only been very recently that he has admirably tried to craft himself into the ideas candidate hes proposed revitalizing americas armed forces by increasing the core defense budget building up a million member ground force and instituting sweeping missile defense he went where no other gop candidate has yet gone with a detailed plan to shore up social security by changing the benefits formula and offering voluntary "add on" accounts for younger workers he would re energize school vouchers his border security blueprint certainly matches mitt romneys or rudy giulianis in its ahem creativity and thoroughness this weeks tax proposal was decidedly fresh going beyond the run of the mill candidate promise to extend the bush tax cuts and calling for the end of the death tax and the amt a cut in the corporate tax rate and even a voluntary flat tax according to a campaign source in upcoming weeks mr thompson will unveil plans to reduce federal spending by limiting nondefense growth to inflation earmark reform and a one year freeze on the hiring of non essential civilian workers and contractors theres plenty here to get conservative voters and bloggers and pundits engaged in some healthy even lively debate that is if theyd heard any of this most havent and for that mr thompson has mostly himself to blame while it isnt clear who set the "rules" for this manic election theyre set voters may only pay attention at the end but having an infrastructure to make sure those voters hear you in the final months is the work of years by sitting back mr thompson allowed his rivals to scoop up the well connected policy wonks committed state activists and aggressive fund raisers that oil a campaign his own refusal to "do" the media and public event circus has muzzled his message as the failure of his tax plan announcement shows think back to when gov george w bush who knew something about campaigns unveiled his own tax outline his people had a dozen brainy conservative economists at the ready to blitz the media outside business groups stood by with glowing press releases average families were found to serve as real life examples of how the tax cut would help the campaign staff fanned out and joined local activists to manage the grass roots the candidate himself devoted endless time to flogging his idea in public appearances and to every press person and editorial board around none of this happened in the wake of mr thompsons fox announcement the campaign simply didnt have the stuff to pull it off worse its own leader refused to do what is expected a look at mr thompsons schedule revealed not a single public appearance for three days after the release right up to wednesdays highly uninformative cnn debate speaking of dull debates thats mr thompsons other problem to the extent he is now trying to float ideas and he could use even more the rest of the field wants nothing of it the gop went into this race thinking itself the likely loser and that fear has defined the primary the candidates arent vying to lead a wayward party out of malaise or energize voters with new ideas theyre instead trying to be the answer to a question who can beat her thats made the race about biography in particular on issues like national security and immigration where republicans hope a hillary clinton will be weak mr giulianis campaign is about his past as a new york tough guy who can face down terrorists mr romneys his past as an mba who can manage our border mr mccains his past as a vietnam vet who recognized the problems in iraq theres no future in this present and mr thompsons lackluster delivery of his own agenda has allowed the front runners to continue avoiding the big debates mr thompsons inertia has meant his campaign is no longer in control of its destiny his best shot now is that mr huckabee and mr romney go nuclear leaving him with a ticket out of iowa and some hope he still ranks second behind mr giuliani in national polls but putting himself in a position to build off any lucky outcomes will involve trying to play the game he so detests if he believes his ideas are as important for the country as he says they are he will
