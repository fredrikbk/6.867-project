life in north koreas gulag seoul korea i was born a prisoner on nov and until two years ago north koreas political prison camp no was the only place i had ever called home the camp established in is located in kaechon about miles north of pyongyang when it first opened the government rushed to fill it with prisoners many were charged and detained regardless of when or what kind of "crime" was committed countless others were imprisoned simply because they were relatives of those charged under north koreas "three generation rule " up to three generations of the criminals family must be imprisoned as traitors i was a slave under club and fist it was a world where love happiness joy or resistance found no meaning this was the situation i found myself in until i escaped to china and then south korea there i was told why i was imprisoned by my distant relatives who had escaped to the south during the korean war in the midst of that conflict two of my fathers brothers fled to freedom because of this "traitorous" crime my grandparents father and uncle back in the north were found guilty of treason and crimes against the state and were arrested my father and uncle were separated from each other and my grandparents and were stripped of all identification and property i am still not sure why my mother was incarcerated while serving their sentences in kaechon my parents were allowed to marry sometimes inmates are given permission to marry if they work very hard and find favor in the eyes of the state security agents this was how both my brother and i were born as political prisoners although we were a family by fiat there was nothing familial about us we showed no affection for one another nor was that even possible when i was years old my mother and brother were arrested while trying to escape although i had no idea they were planning to run away i was detained in another part of prison the state security agents there demanded that i reveal what my family was conspiring to do i was tortured severely for seven months to this day i still carry the scars on my back and shudder at the memory of that time on nov my mother and brother were found guilty of treason and sentenced to public execution i was taken outside and forced to witness their deaths upon returning back to kaechon i finished what passes for a middle school in the prison and began working in one of many factories on the prison grounds making garments it was here that i met another inmate who had once lived outside of the prison camp he told me stories of the outside world and i increasingly longed to become part of it we plotted our escape and on jan we attempted to run away i was successful but he fell on the prisons barbed wire i glanced back once he appeared to be dead as i sit here writing this op ed comfortably in seoul i cant help but wonder at the vastly different lives south koreans and inmates of political prison camp no live in south korea although there is disappointment and sadness there is also so much joy happiness and comfort in kaechon i did not even know such emotions existed the only emotion i ever knew was fear fear of beatings fear of starvation fear of torture and fear of death even though i did not escape kaechon expressly to inform the world about such conditions i feel that i cannot keep silent today tens of thousands are suffering silently in government sponsored political prison camps in north korea inmates are given only enough food to be kept on the verge of starvation and they often fight with one another in hopes of getting one more meal many people have resorted to eating grass tree bark clay rodents and insects torture is open and rampant and beatings occur every hour of every day women often undergo forced abortions and children have no childhood these political prisoners live with no dignity as human beings they are treated and taught that they are merely beasts without intelligence emotions or dreams if a prisoner attempts to escape he is severely punished and will most likely be publicly executed humans should never be treated this way it is time for us to stand up for those being persecuted in north korean gulags they do not deserve to die in silence we must protest these violent acts against humanity we must become their voice mr shin was born and lived in a north korean gulag until he is the author of the korean language book "i was a political prisoner at birth in north korea" database center for north korean human rights see related letter "letters to the editor north koreans sad story provokes new perspective" wsj december
