environmental peril posed by law of the sea treaty the introduction of thomas bowdens article "deep six the law of the sea" op ed nov seems to contradict the title in which he states the "treaty awaits a ratification vote in the u s senate " did he intend to say it awaits a "fail ratification vote" which certainly would be much better than a disastrous "ratification vote " whereby a two thirds majority could foolishly grant approval his denunciation of "the treatys explicitly socialist approach" to sea bed mining is right on target but his focus on the proposed treatys unfairness to entrepreneurial pioneers of undersea mining and related benefits of ownership versus leasing overlooks a more important concern after all economic mining in the deep open oceans may only become practical in the far distant future if ever however the u s should decree unilaterally if necessary a mile offshore exclusive economic zone like that "conferred" not necessarily only by the treaty enforceable by the u s navy and coast guard no united nations license needed there a greater danger to the u s lies in the imputed powers of the treaty to override our sovereign control of u s land and the air above it part xii section article "pollution from land based sources" includes "rivers estuaries pipelines and outfall structures " its paragraph would require that our "laws regulations shall include those designed to minimize to the fullest extent possible the release of noxious substances into the marine environment " but who decides how extensive need be "the fullest extent possible" a u n tribunal packed with third world u s loathers responding to a lawyer hired by hugo chavez then consider our air pollutants now including co thanks to the supreme court article same part and section requires "states shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from or through the atmosphere " who decides how much prevention is needed can we risk acceptance of a u n tribunal that can override our epa pollution requirements or cafe auto mileage standards without opportunity for appeal to u s courts as prescribed by the u s constitution that deceptive treaty is not just about the sea it involves the whole world land air and water through the artifice of pollution control it is a first step toward enforceable socialist world government and indeed it deserves to be dumped to the bottom of the sea no permit required m robert paglee moorestown n j
