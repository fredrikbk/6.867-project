politics &amp economics philippine revolt quickly peters out the rogue philippine soldiers who briefly seized a luxury manila hotel yesterday hoped to spark another of the countrys sporadic "people power" uprisings but this time almost no one answered the call the philippines has a long history of popular uprisings huge street protests forced president ferdinand marcos to step down in and a second popular revolt cut short joseph estradas presidency in but since then intermittent coup attempts and efforts to provoke further upheavals have foundered they have been punctured in part by ordinary filipinos apparent diminishing interest in demonstrations that seem to change little coupled with a strengthening economy yesterdays failed minirebellion which lasted a few hours before loyal troops and police suppressed it illustrated the depth of this "people power fatigue " as political analysts in manila describe it there were no serious casualties in the affair which played out inside the peninsula manila a five star hotel in the citys financial district the incident began when a group of soldiers who went on trial yesterday for seizing a different hotel and shopping complex in in protest against president gloria macapagal arroyo stormed out of court they were escorted by military guards assigned to prevent them from escaping met up with armed sympathizers and then seized the peninsula invading through the lobby lounge in all they numbered about and were joined by a few opposition politicians and a pair of roman catholic priests they accused ms arroyos government of corruption and urged filipinos to join them in their protest what they got were a few curious onlookers and several dozen press and television reporters who crammed the corridors of the peninsula where the rebels set up an improvised command center next to the philippine stock exchange in the makati business district when philippine military personnel eventually stormed the building ramming an armored personnel carrier through the hotels main entrance and firing tear gas along its corridors the rebels quickly announced their surrender they said they couldnt risk the lives of all the reporters who had earlier entered the building to cover the standoff "for the safety of everyone were going out we cannot live with our conscience if some of you get hurt in the crossfire " rebellion leader antonio trillanes told reporters mr trillanes led the failed mutiny in he was elected a senator in the philippine congress this year while awaiting trial for that rebellion he was flanked by other military officers including brig gen danilo lim who said that dissent against ms arroyos government without action "is consent" to her rule by early evening the rebel troops were in custody in many ways it was another anticlimax for foes of ms arroyos she has been a divisive figure in philippine politics after succeeding mr estrada as president nearly seven years ago although backed by most of the military and much of the roman catholic churchs hierarchy she is unpopular among many poorer people who in voted in mr estrada a former movie star but as fatigue with mass actions grows ms arroyo has been able to survive a series of coup attempts while also earning the respect of the countrys business community by enacting a series of fiscal overhauls those changes including a dramatic expansion of a sales tax stabilized the philippines finances and revived the countrys economy now growing at its fastest rate in years television pictures of thursdays standoff could damage the philippines international image as a place to do business at least temporarily but political analysts said the latest attempt to unseat ms arroyo is unlikely to weaken her considering how little harm it appears to have done her "she might as well have scripted it herself " said alex magno a political analyst and president of the manila based foundation for economic freedom a private think tank
