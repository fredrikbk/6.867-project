weekend journal review television the road home sometimes a drama of the most predictable kind the sort found say on television screens during the holiday season breaks through formulaic constraints to become something better and bigger something indeed close to irresistible that can happen when the actors wield charms that vanquish all consciousness of formula and predictability and it hardly needs saying when a well polished script comes wrapped around a killer theme both conditions are clearly at work in "pictures of hollis woods " a hallmark hall of fame film sunday p m est on cbs about a young girl who has made her way through a series of foster homes in search of a family that description alone might be enough to put countless viewers off and it gets worse one of the two principal characters the foster mother josie is its quickly established well on her way to an advanced case of that newest terror now enshrined in the hearts of television and film writers alzheimers disease alzheimers and a foundling yearning for a home whos ready to sit still for that almost anybody the answer is who tunes in long enough to savor the performance of jodelle ferland as hollis the girl in search of family who was named after the community in queens n y where the story goes shed been found an infant abandoned on a sidewalk the script is based on a book by patricia reilly giff the year old actress knows her character to the bone knows above all the weight and intensity of holliss longing to find a place where she fits a family in which she may even be cherished and her ability to make us feel the force of that longing enriches the film immeasurably its a testament to her skill that even when the script goes blubbery with the occasional false note has hollis standing on a mountaintop to shout her feelings to the winds etc ms ferland carries it off most impressive of all perhaps is the seeming effortlessness of this portrayal the faint glimmer of possibility in her eyes for instance as she looks around at her bedroom as shes about to join a new family its a look that soon gives way to wariness that speaks for expectations born of hard experience that nothing good or happy can last the most haunting proof of this lesson comes from a summer spent in the vacation house of temporary foster parents the regans played with affecting conviction by julie ann emery and james tupper and their son steven ridge canipe it is to be holliss paradise lost for reasons central to the plot an experience that hardens her resistance against all hope nonetheless she soon begins to feel at home with the affectionate josie a sterling portrayal by sissy spacek an artist whose memory losses and confusion soon render her incapable of caring not only for the foster child but for herself none of that matters to hollis though the two now live with the cat in a chaotic household whose head cant remember necessities like buying food or why she would need money to purchase any who throws the dinner dishes out with the garbage and is clearly in danger of burning the house down because remembering to turn off the oven is beyond her hollis can no longer stay here the sympathetic social worker alfre woodard sternly informs the girl who now faces the grimmest of prospects there the story does not of course end in a hallmark hall of fame film nobody the audience most certainly included is going to have to go away crushed by a tragic outcome this production is no exception its also two hours of highly potent drama director tony bill writer ann peacock that will keep a rapt audience guessing as to how it will all turn out thats entertainment "fall from grace " a showtime documentary airing tuesday p m est is anything but entertainment and isnt meant to be the film concerns pastor fred phelps and his westboro baptist church a fringe group now notorious for its practice of picketing funerals of slain members of the u s military with placards celebrating the deaths as gods just punishment for americas sinfulness the church has just been socked with an &# million judgment resulting from a lawsuit filed by a grieving parent the pickets signs mostly variations on "god hates fags" make clear the particular transgression stoking the protests organized by pastor phelps and his followers who appear to consist mainly of members of his own family theres his furiously combative son promising a hellish fate for all opposed to his father indeed for all of america theres a daughter who races up and down at the funerals waving the signs shouting about "the fags" with a hatred whose depths feel as familiar as they are unfathomable weve seen this before and see it now in circles very different from the sorts pastor phelps and company travel in namely the conspiracy theorists and armies of paranoid followers driven by bottomless hatred of the government which they charge masterminded the attacks it is impossible not to recognize in the phelps groups rants the same pathological drive impossible not to hear in the phelps familys unshakable certitude about the plot against gods word the voice of rosie odonnell assuring a tv audience that there was no way a building could have come down as the government claimed in short theres a good film to be made about the armies of these believers of which the plot fanatics are by far the most interesting but the one on pastor phelps isnt that work the producers evidently decided that it was enough aside from a feeble counter commentary or two to train their cameras on the subject and let him and his family do most of the talking the resulting film has its curious moments none of them like most conversations of the fanatically obsessed instructive all of them sure to end any need to hear more from the subject
