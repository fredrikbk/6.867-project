saviors of the citi the recent announcement that citibank received a cash infusion of &# billion from abu dhabis sovereign wealth fund was greeted with a mixture of relief and bewilderment by the financial markets the relief was that there was actually someone out there with lots of money who was willing to help float citi yes the u s government could orchestrate a bailout but no one in washington has expressed any indication that theyd be willing to do so the republicans are concerned about the "moral hazard" of saving a bank from its own excesses and the democrats are loath to be saviors to wall street when millions of americans are in jeopardy of losing their homes the bewilderment around the deal stemmed from the fact it came from the middle east this isnt the first major investment made by a sovereign wealth fund and it isnt the first major investment made by a sovereign wealth fund from the middle east but unlike previous deals it was not a case of a foreign fund buying up an obscure asset and it was the first inkling that the implosion on wall street caused by the meltdown of mortgage backed securities will have some rather unexpected consequences the past decade has seen the rise of china and increased economic activity throughout the non western world which has accelerated the shift of industrial manufacturing away from the u s and western europe the next decade may well see an equally dramatic shift in global finance away from the u s it is popular to view that shift as a pending catastrophe for america like many popular views its myopic and its wrong much has been made lately of sovereign wealth funds and for good reason these funds have burgeoned to as much as &# trillion today from as little as &# billion in the s and there are estimates they will grow over the next five years up to &# trillion or even &# trillion some of the funds reside in the more familiar confines of the western world with norways oil rich investment arm topping the list at nearly &# billion but most are not and many are in areas of the world that are not exactly warm and fuzzy about the u s or even the eurozone namely china and the city states of the persian gulf which combined control trillions of dollars in either wealth funds or foreign reserves for the past few years as the dollar has weakened oil has skyrocketed and chinese exports have ballooned those funds have begun to look for places to invest including the u s they have until now been stymied by two things politics and wall street the political obstacles flared in when the state owned chinese oil company cnooc attempted to purchase the u s energy company unocal that led to congressional outrage and the chinese backed down then in dubai ports world tried to purchase the operations of several u s ports which led to an even more heated outburst in congress about the perils of an arab nation potentially controlling vital u s security interests these two high profile episodes led to a rewriting of the rules for how foreign purchases of u s assets get assessed by the u s government the cfius process which refers to the inter agency committee on foreign investment that vets purchases for a variety of national security concerns the vetting process can now go on longer and be more invasive than in the past the net result is that many foreign funds that are otherwise inclined to purchase assets in the u s might be less likely to do so in order to avoid the hassle the other impediment until recently has been wall street until the subprime implosion this summer credit was cheap and easy to obtain which made deals expensive private equity groups loaded with bank infused financing and hedge funds graced with prime brokerage desks had ample rope paid premium prices and crowded the market the sovereign wealth funds flush with cash but not as tightly linked to global banks stayed largely on the sidelines but now the landscape has changed deals that relied on easy credit are becoming a thing of the past and in a world where credit is tight cash is often king this changed landscape puts the sovereign wealth funds in a plumb position they have cash they dont need the credit markets they are looking for long term return and they are global for them the u s is one market and an attractive market in the past three months alone dubai international capital purchased a minority stake in sony another investment arm of abu dhabi took an stake in the semiconductor company advanced micro devices and a stake in the private equity group carlyle citic securities a chinese state bank took a stake in credit troubled bear stearns dubais stock exchange purchased a major share of both the nasdaq and the london stock exchange the chinese government took a stake in the blackstone group and last but certainly not least another arm of the dubai government bought the new york fashion emporium barneys this is only a sampling of the deals done and in all likelihood a small subset of the deals to come the discomfort that this activity causes in the u s remains an impediment the more that americans trumpet national security sovereignty and economic nationalism the less open we will be to foreign capital twenty years ago when the u s was the primary source of global capital that didnt matter we didnt need the cash the rest of the world did that has changed and the downside of being immersed in the global economy and being a debtor to boot is that we cant afford the luxury of rejecting foreign buyers the saving grace right now is that the international financial system is actually working like a system shrinking liquidity in one part of the global economy the u s is offset by pools of liquidity elsewhere the oil producing regions of the middle east and china primarily unfortunately just because we dont have the luxury of picking our creditors doesnt mean that we wont act like we do whats striking about this recent flurry of activity is how at odds it is with current investor sentiment in the u s sovereign wealth funds clearly believe that at current prices many u s companies offer superior long term values yet some of the deals these funds are pursuing wouldnt be touched by u s investors in the current climate of concern and panic it could be of course that these funds are simply miscalculating it could also be that they see more clearly the potential long term worth the weak dollar is clearly a factor and has enhanced the buying power of many foreign buyers of course the dollar has weakened in part because the u s is both a huge debtor and a large consumer of global goods and that weakness is yet one more reason why our assets are so attractive at current prices simplistically the system would say money goes out as we borrow and spend and then comes back in the form of investments into our economy by the people were borrowing and buying from but then theres culture and politics and national identity and that makes it not so simple finally lets address the elephant in the living room many in the u s simply arent comfortable with increased dependency on either the middle east or china whatever the merits of those concerns the interdependence of the global economy is a fact as it stands the sovereign wealth funds that are so eagerly investing in both the u s and throughout the world are controlled by groups that embrace the global capital system rather than others who might reject it in life in business and in international affairs you dont usually have the luxury of selecting the perfect allies for much of the th century the u s could maintain the illusion that we would only work with states and groups that we liked and who we thought liked us that may have been true then it isnt true now we had better get used to it mr karabell is executive vice president and chief economist of fred alger management
