com a northbrook ill retailer that carries optical gear ranging from binoculars to telescopes says sales of microscope kits have grown in the past year the company anticipates selling more than such kits in calling them a "heavy holiday item " we purchased five kits and reviewed them with jessamyn ramsey a biology teacher at the jupiter high school environmental research and field studies academy in jupiter fla ms ramsey emphasized that a good beginners kit should include an easy to use microscope with a magnification range of to x plus and several prepared slides of plant and animal life "anything less than five slides and kids will get bored " she said unfortunately our findings werent all that encouraging with one big exception most of the kits were of marginal quality with poorly constructed microscopes or a limited number of prepared slides and accessories from tweezers to dyes the national geographic lab quality microscope proved faulty almost right out of the box a part holding a screw broke off a light bulb failed to light moreover ms ramsey found it took considerable effort to focus on an object because the microscopes minimum magnification x was too high you need to take in the big picture before you can concentrate on the little one she explained another example of disappointing construction the meade student hobbyist piece microscope kit it arrived with a mirror that had come unglued from the microscope but at least the kit included a nice array of prepared slides "ooh paramecium " ms ramsey said and accessories including brine shrimp eggs to make your own slides in the case of the konus konuscience zoom kit the problems were magnified literally not only did the microscope have a none too practical minimum magnification of x it also lacked much in the way of prepared slides "only two " said our disappointed biology teacher the same issues with magnification and slides arose with the thames &amp konus micro trek kit ms ramsey also faulted that microscopes construction noting that the clips to hold the slides in place were particularly hard to use all of which made our one exception the discovery macro microscope &# available exclusively

included the good the page experiment manual that comes with the kit is one of the most detailed we found with many color pictures to guide a young user the bad what good is the manual if the microscope doesnt measure up again magnification levels to x were an issue and construction quality was questionable "cheap plastic " our biology teacher said a spokesman for the manufacturer said "the strength of microtrek definitely lies in the guided observations and the completeness of the kit experience rather than in the microscope itself " the shopping kit is currently out of stock at
