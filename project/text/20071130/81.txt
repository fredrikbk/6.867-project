putins jackals the campaign for russias parliamentary elections this sunday is nasty and tense garry kasparov the former chess champion and leader of the other russia coalition found himself jailed for five days earlier this week after peacefully marching in moscow other opposition parties were denied access to media and harassed the kremlin pulled out all the stops to make sure the united russia party and its top candidate president vladimir putin win resoundingly none of that is particularly surprising but the russian leaders speech last week at the "forum of supporters of vladimir putin " was it could mark a turning point in post soviet affairs mr putin used the well choreographed united russia rally the high point of his campaign to make his most pointed attack yet on democrats and democracy in his nov address mr putin was clearly referring to russias politically weak but still visible liberal movement when he mentioned those "who are unfortunately still within the country who skulk around kto shakalit u foreign embassies foreign diplomatic offices counting on the support of foreign foundations and governments and not on the support of their own people " shakal means jackal in russian and shakalit was used here as a metaphorical verb to describe the nature of the politicians and human rights activists contacts with western governmental and nongovernmental organizations in russia mr putin further specified who he means "those who in the s held high posts " he warned that "you can find their names among the candidates and sponsors of some parties " according to president putin they are "those who in the most difficult moment during the terrorist intervention into russia from chechnya treacherously called for negotiations in fact for collusion with terrorists with those who killed our children and women speculating in the most unscrupulous and cynical way on the victims in short these are all those who towards the end of the past century led russia to mass poverty and ubiquitous bribe taking " the idea that a number of liberal politicians like boris nemtsov anatoly chubais or yegor gaidar who held by no means all and rarely the most important government posts in the s are solely responsible for the deep socioeconomic crisis of that decade has been a common theme in russian public discourse ever since the start of reforms launched after the soviet unions collapse there is little novelty in this accusation however mr putin added a new wrinkle by accusing them of working for foreign powers and betraying russia and especially with his regret that these politicians are "still within the country " to be sure these ideas arent all that original either but until now they were the preserve of the extreme right as well as the increasingly nationalist communist movement politicians like the rabble rouser vladimir zhirinovsky or gennady zyuganov the head of the russian communist party as to who might be the gray eminence behind the allegedly criminal liberals mr putin didnt specify yet his past speeches particularly his attack on the u s at an international security conference in munich in february suggest that he has the amerikantsy foremost in mind for many russians today americans are to blame for almost everything that is bad in and outside the former soviet union in western democracies politicians also say bizarre things especially when campaigning for office russia is not a western democracy the institution that dominates russian society today is the kremlins "vertical of power" a combination of formal and informal controls and curbs which is rather different from the checks and balances in democratic states this vertical of power has president putin at the top it extends not only to the federal government and united russia party but also to other parties regional and local governments big business civil society and mass media one reasonably suspects that it also exerts influence on the court system the police and academia in this election mr putin is not campaigning against real competitors on a level playing ground while the formal rules of the voting on dec itself may be observed scrupulously neither the electoral process as a whole nor public politics in general is fair under president putin russia has gone back to a byzantine form of state society relations where the so called national leader is beyond criticism a semidivine figure who determines where the country goes and whose utterances decide whats permissible and whats not the national leaders choice of words therefore cant be dismissed as mere electoral hyperbole soon to be forgotten instead mr putin has opened a pandoras box by suggesting implicitly that his liberal opponents are traitors foreign agents and enemies of the russian people who should leave the country he has legitimized the paranoid conspiratorial and manichean theories spread by russias ultranationalists on the internet in newspapers and in books during the past years russias fanatically anti western political activists and journalists one suspects will now start to elaborate on how exactly the apparent will of their national leader is to be implemented the "for putin" movement an offshoot of the united russia campaign has already adopted his use of the word shakalit by naming a new video on the liberal opposition "shakaly" jackals which conveniently and dangerously dehumanizes mr putins opponents the legions of nationalists in russias parties editorial boards and universities can now invoking the presidents wishes call for cleansing russia of the wests "agents of influence " as the liberals are called in the extremist press today while mr putin and his entourage might not yet plan to deport en masse russian opposition figures this is what public opinion may at one point ask them to do mr umland who teaches at the national taras shevchenko university in kiev ukraine is editor of the book series "soviet and post soviet politics and society " published by ibidem verlag at stuttgart &amp hannover see related letter "letters to the editor america the source of russias problems" wsj dec
