business day sign up for the e mail here vladimir putin today signed into law suspension of russias participation in a arms treaty an election eve flourish illustrating both the nationalism thats his biggest selling point and the hints of soviet style menace employed at home and abroad at president putins bidding both houses of russias parliament this month had passed the law that lets moscow delay nato countries inspections of russian military sites under the conventional forces in europe treaty nominally in protest of u s missile defense plans and theres little worry the move signals covert russian rearmament rather than the brazen resurgence of russian election season patriotism ahead of sundays parliamentary election and with mr putins post presidential aims invested in leadership of united russia he warned supporters a vote against the party could return the country to the "humiliation dependency and disintegration" that followed the soviet breakup that has been mr putins theme for years a quasi reaganesque appeal to national pride mixed with increasingly demagogic warnings about domestic and foreign threats to russian sovereignty and his domination of russian political life hasnt dimmed the rhetoric for good reason there is growing concern that russians take united russias victory so much for granted that fewer voters will turn out possibly depriving the party of a mandate that would broaden mr putins power as the financial times points out if the party wins more than of the vote it will be able to change at will the constitution whose limit on presidential terms is the reason mr putin is switching from the executive to the legislative branch mr putin has said a landslide victory would give him the "moral right" to keep influencing russias fate but "pollsters and political analysts said the kremlin might have overplayed its hand with most citizens believing the election outcome a foregone conclusion " the ft says and that helps explain the recent ratcheting up of antidemocratic tactics and disregard for how it looks outside russia opposition party members independent monitors and political analysts tell the washington post that authorities have seized or destroyed millions of pieces of opposition campaign literature while those parties have been unable to get billboard and other advertising space giving a surface impression in moscow and other cities that united russia is the only choice the guardian reports that "local administration officials have called in thousands of staff on their day off in an attempt to engineer a massive and inflated victory " while voters are being pressured to pick united russia or "risk losing their jobs their accommodation or bonuses " public sector workers students and others tell the paper that "doctors teachers university deans students and even workers at psychiatric clinics have been warned they have to vote" and that "failure to do so will entail serious consequences " a teacher at tver near moscow expresses her shame to the economist at having told her year old pupils to join a putin rally "i would not have lost my life or even my job if i had not followed the order but i felt i could not refuse it perhaps because i am not a free person " sundays outcome if not the margin of victory is assured and the "real intrigue " as the wall street journal puts it will come in the following weeks when mr putin reveals his pick for a presidential successor after he steps down in the spring and exactly "how he intends to retain influence " chavezs bid for more power the other big vote to watch sunday will be in venezuela where president hugo chavez is trying to use a referendum to vastly accelerate the centralization of power he began after his election the proposed constitutional changes "would eliminate the central banks independence sharply limit the role and definition of private property and emasculate the powers of governors and mayors allowing mr chavez to literally redraw the political map of venezuela " the wall street journal explains "under the new charter mr chavez could unilaterally set and dispose of the nations foreign currency reserves he would be able to appoint or dismiss vice presidents who would rule over the countrys states which he intends to group into six to eight regions perhaps most important for mr chavez the changes would allow for his unlimited re election " but he may be going too far at a time when inflation is rising and the price controls he imposed three years ago have led to shortages of milk eggs and flour the economist notes and yesterday the streets of caracas were filled with tens of thousands of people protesting the changes signaling "that venezuelans may be balking at placing so much authority in the hands of one man " the new york times says a bush administration plan for subprime the treasury department and a coalition of mortgage related companies that includes citigroup wells fargo and countrywide are "close to agreeing on a plan that would temporarily freeze interest rates on certain troubled subprime home loans " people familiar with the negotiations tell the wall street journal the details are still being worked out but would generally "extend the lower introductory rate on home loans for certain borrowers who will have trouble making payments once their mortgages increase " the journal says "an accord could reassure investors and strapped homeowners both of whom are anxious as interest rates on more than two million adjustable mortgages are scheduled to jump over the next two years " and it could also help the bush administration which has been criticized for inaction amid the recent housing and market turmoil treasury secretary henry paulson tells businessweek progress on his efforts to orchestrate a private sector response has been glacial but that a comprehensive program is near "well before the end of the year we will have a template and the infrastructure in place to make it easier to handle the wave of reset mortgage loans that is coming at us " he says on the other side of the atlantic his german counterpart peer steinbrueck played down the impact of the turmoil on europe in an interview with the financial times and blamed the whole problem on bankers and financiers who think theyre so smart "the snooty attitude that we have sometimes seen under the motto of we are cleverer than the others ended in disaster " finance minister steinbrueck says one high profile financier was fired over the toll her firm has taken yesterday zoe cruz co president and heir apparent at morgan stanley was ousted in the wake of morgans more than &# billion in mortgage related paper losses ms cruz has been "one of the highest ranking women on wall street " as the journal notes and while she had overseen the division that suffered the losses her departure was a surprise medicare overspending on equipment medicare is paying as much as &# per patient for oxygen equipment that helps people with respiratory diseases to breathe compared with buying it for a price as little as &# available from pharmacies and other retailers the new york times reports "rather than buy oxygen equipment outright medicare rents it for months before patients take ownership and pays for a variety of services that critics say are often unnecessary " the times says adding that the health care programs high expense of oxygen equipment "is hardly an anomaly medicare spends billions of dollars each year on products and services that are available at far lower prices from retail pharmacies and online stores " according to times analysis of federal data bringing alaskan gas to lower conocophillips today plans to submit a proposal to the alaska government for construction of a &# billion natural gas pipeline to the lower states in what the wall street journal calls "a sign that a delayed project to bring new supplies to growing markets could move forward " "conocophillipss decision appears to signal a thawing on the part of oil producers who hadnt shown any willingness to work with the new state administration amid concerns over taxes and other terms " the journal says "the oil companies had negotiated a tentative deal last year with the previous governor but it ran into political trouble and was quickly killed " also of note washington post president pervez musharraf announced he intended to lift emergency rule and restore the constitution by dec saying he had fulfilled his promise to bring democracy to pakistan and calling on political parties to participate in january elections but mr musharraf who was sworn in as the civilian president one day after stepping down as chief of pakistans army didnt say he would reinstate the senior judges he fired this month a key demand of several major political parties as well as the countrys legal advocates and journalists new york times food banks around the u s are reporting critical shortages that have forced them to ration supplies distribute staples usually reserved for disaster relief and in some instances close experts attributed the shortages to an unusual combination of factors including rising demand a sharp drop in federal supplies of excess farm products and tighter inventory controls that are leaving supermarkets and other retailers with less food to donate
