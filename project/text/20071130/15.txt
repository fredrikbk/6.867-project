business insight great customer service starts at the top wachovia ceo says online edition when ken thompson took the top job at wachovia corp in about of its customers were walking out the door each year though about the same number of new customers were coming in the year old executive saw customer service as something that required his immediate attention today the diversified financial services company based in charlotte n c is ranked no for the sixth year in a row in the american customer satisfaction index a survey conducted by the university of michigans ross school of business mr thompson who joined the company in talked recently with the wall street journal online about the companys transformation to becoming a provider of consistent top notch customer service wsj com how do you define customer service and how important is it for your business mr thompson customer service is giving the customer what he or she wants as often as you possibly can and whenever you make a mistake it is fixing that mistake very very promptly its the most important strategy we have at wachovia for growing our top line we are a big retail and small business bank and we think customer service and customer loyalty drives revenue for us wsj com why was the company doing poorly with regard to customer service when you took the helm mr thompson when i became ceo we had gone through an acquisition that was not working out the way we wanted we had also gone through a major change in our retail bank with the future bank initiative which attempted to allow customers to use many different channels to deal with us such as atms the phone kiosks online banking the combination of those two things resulted in some significant customer loss for us because basically we shocked our customers we put our customers through too much change too rapidly and our infrastructure did not do a good job of walking our customers through that change wsj com how did you set about making improvements mr thompson the first thing we did was to dramatically increase our spending on staffing we needed to be staffed appropriately so we could very quickly service customers through whatever channel they wanted to deal with us so we spent &# million right at the very beginning to get staffing right next we reorganized our retail and small business bank which had been run differently in different places we put it all under one person ben jenkins who is vice chairman of our company and head of our general bank ben quickly systematized the way we run things so customers in naples fla would get the same kind of service as they would in new york or dallas the third thing we did is we changed our incentive practices in our retail bank to make customer service equally as important as new sales which caused a very balanced approach in our branches a customer who wants help with balancing an account would be helped in the same way a customer would for getting help investing in a mutual fund in other words we make services just as important as sales lastly i and several other senior managers started meeting with employees in the front and back offices to preach the importance of customer service on a weekly basis our basic message was that nothing is more important at wachovia than great customer service it was really a leap of faith on our part that if we did all that strong earnings would follow and they did wsj com what were some of the specific programs and tactics you used mr thompson we hired the gallop organization to survey our customers and today we do surveys a quarter this means that customers are interviewed every quarter and they rank us on a scale of to we initiated this back in and were still doing it only we now survey up to about customers a quarter in early we initiated a program where we look at the surveys that come back to us with us bad grades our senior managers call those customers to ask them further questions and look for ways we can improve service that helps us with those particular customers but it also gives us an opportunity to look at things that may be a systemic issue so we can change them in such a way that will impact many customers wsj com what were some of the things you tried that didnt work mr thompson the future bank initiative had some wonderful ideas come out of it but what didnt work was trying to implement it in a short period of time all at once what we learned was that when you make major changes you have to do it in a methodical way and at the pace that customers will accept it rather than try and make customers accept something on your time schedule wsj com are there any lessons you can draw for companies facing a similar challenge now mr thompson take the conditions of the financial market today many financial companies are cutting costs and the lesson we learned back in was you cant cut costs enough to offset the loss of revenue if you are having customer service issues dont cut the expenses so that it hurts your customers the second thing and we used to do this is we focused on sales so much that service got lost in the equation we were compensating people for sales and not for service and we changed that what we found was when you give great service sales will follow the last thing i would say is if you want a great service culture and loyal customers its got to start at the ceo level if its not important to the ceo it wont be important to others in the company write to sarah e needleman at sarah needleman wsj com
