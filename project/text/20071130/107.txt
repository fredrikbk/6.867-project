weekend journal review film diving bell and the butterfly is vivid inspiring amalric astonishes subversive delights lift pathos free savages the diving bell and the butterfly" is unsparing and inspiring in equal measure the camera immediately puts us in the position of its hero a man regaining consciousness after a catastrophic stroke that has left him lucid but almost completely paralyzed we see what he sees foggily at first and hear the tumbling thoughts he cant communicate to those around him when a doctor says "dont be afraid " we recoil from the ghastly irony no fate could be more frightening the diagnosis is a mercifully rare condition called locked in syndrome no premise for popular entertainment could be more improbable yet julian schnabels magnificent french language film like its true life subject transcends realitys prison with surreal buoyancy the source material is a slender but celebrated memoir of the same name by jean dominique bauby who is played in radiant good health as well as the deep freeze of immobility by mathieu amalric in either mode its an astonishing performance before he was struck down at the age of in jean do as his friends and associates called him ruled the fashion roost as the dynamic and witty editor in chief of french elle after his stroke he was taken to the berck maritime hospital in the pas de calais where rehabilitation specialists soon discovered that he could signal by blinking his left eye over fourteen months that followed jean do managed incredibly to formulate and polish his manuscript in a mental notebook then dictate it by blinking in response to letters on a chart he died in two days after the book was published a blinking left eye inevitably recalls "my left foot " the fine jim sheridan film with daniel day lewis as the severely disabled writer and painter christy brown or possibly javier bardems quadriplegic longing for death in "the sea inside " or more distantly the horrors of total disability in dalton trumbos "johnny got his gun " but "the diving bell and the butterfly" soars above and beyond the genre just as the delicate dazzler of baubys title flies on the wings of his memory and imagination the diving bell is emblematic of his encasement the movie has done what those whove cherished the book might have thought impossible intensified its singular beauty by roving as free and fearlessly as baubys mind did the images are sumptuous when they arent claustrophobic vistas of the beach at calais where the patient strapped in a wheelchair is surrounded by his wife and children fantasies of flight of skiing on virgin snow of beautiful women of the hospitals storied past of convivial company and food good frenchman that he is bauby still nurses an oyster fetish of parisian streets and canopies of trees accompanied by a lyrical theme from "the blows " the soundtrack as a whole is terrific such visual fugues may come as no surprise mr schnabel had already established himself as a painter of note before he revealed himself as a gifted filmmaker the previous proofs of those gifts being "basquiat" and "before night falls" and his cinematographer janusz kaminski is a distinctive artist in his own right whats remarkable is the grace and authority with which the film depicts baubys three lives his subjective point of view peering out at his surroundings through his one good eye an objective account of devoted care givers ministering to him of friends and loved ones visiting him and at the films core the unquenchable flow of dreams desires language sardonic humor and crystalline intelligence that constitute the core of the man "the diving bell and the butterfly " adapted brilliantly by ronald harwood is far from a one man show its fully populated and impeccably acted by a cast that includes max von sydow as baubys father locked in his bourgeois apartment by advanced age and weakened legs emmanuelle seigner as celine his devoted though terrified wife who must serve as go between during a phone call from his mistress marie josee croze as henriette his lovely speech therapist and anne consigny as claude the amanuensis who shares with baubys children the dedication of his book although this claude is outrageously glamorous henriette has a glorious response when her patient lets her know he wants to die its one of many moments that leave you gasping the savages i cant begin to count the ways in which "the savages" pleased me but the very best of them is the way tamara jenkinss comedy stays tough while sneakily turning tender the savages sans quotes are a family to which the term dysfunctional does insufficient injustice they function but very sadly and in the fathers flagrant case very badly lenny savage a nasty old reprobate played with pitiless brio by philip bosco is careering into dementia after coming apart in a grisly arizona retirement community at several crucial seams lennys plight requires immediate action by his daughter wendy laura linney and or his son jon philip seymour hoffman but theyre trapped in parallel companies of the theater of the absurd she as a would be playwright in manhattan wasting herself on a married man he as a lovelorn professor in buffalo writing a book about brecht and droning on to blank faced students about principles of drama "looks like the unabomber lives here " she says of her brothers bleak house the main dramatic principle of "the savages" couldnt be simpler use a parents decline and the desperate issues it entails to force the children to take stock of their lives those issues are familiar and wrenching what does lenny need assisted care or a nursing home where to find a decent facility how to pay for it but the contemporary problems of a serviceable plot arent what make this movie such a pathos free surprise or such a subversive delight at every step of the way ms jenkins puts her people through changes as fascinating in their free form fashion as the lava light that holds lenny in befuddled thrall "what does it do " he demands to know what the wonderful cast does is define ensemble acting ms linney has never been lovelier or more affecting mr hoffman has never been more likable than when the usually laconic jon seized by a brief spasm of joy joins lotte lenya in a kurt weill bertolt brecht song on his car radio one budding internet wit has suggested that "philip bosco may deserve an osco " id say make it oscos all around dvd tip at the end of my review of ms jenkinss debut feature "slums of beverly hills " i said she was "on the brink of a great career " since then she has made only one short but its no great stretch to believe that she is finally over the brink the subject of this semiautobiographical comedy is the abromowitz family nomads living on the cracked stucco margins of the zip code in as in "the savages " the family is borderline dysfunctional but "slums" is really about the pain of an adolescent daughters hopeless love for a heedless dad natasha lyonne is the daughter vivian while alan arkin plays her father murray an aging almost aged failure to find the remnants of murray abromowitz in the wreckage of lenny savage is no stretch at all
