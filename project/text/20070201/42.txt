home &amp family cranky consumer stopping the barrage of catalogs in the mail we ask retailers to take us off list an overflowing bin special to the wsj lugging our recyclables to the curb is no fun especially when our barrel overflows with unwanted holiday catalogs the catalogs that routinely stuff our mailbox barely merit a glance they land in our trash within moments after they arrive as the holiday catalog blitz winded down we decided to end the ridiculous cycle of receiving and recycling six weeks ago we contacted five major catalog merchants to request they stop our catalogs we think were finally home free but its hard to tell it has required patience last summer we wrote to the mail preference service sponsored by the direct marketing association dma in new york which assists consumers with stemming junk mail although the bulk of it eventually stopped we continued to receive catalogs through the holiday season from retailers we had ordered from in the past the service doesnt restrict companies from contacting existing customers a dma representative says and retailers generally continue mailing catalogs to consumers who have ordered during the previous to months and may sometimes extend the period to include holiday mailings direct marketing remains an important strategy for retailers despite the growth of online sales retailers spent &# billion on catalog marketing during an increase of from &# billion in according to dma "many people thought that shopping online would mean the death of catalogs " says john a greco jr dma president and chief executive "instead weve seen just the opposite " the industry mailed billion catalogs in according to the most recent available figures from dma to stop retailers from sending us catalogs we browsed their web sites and called their toll free numbers we learned that calling is the best and often the only way to make the request web site options for stopping the mailings are tough to find if they exist at all a quick review of other retailers web sites largely confirmed the findings in our test at best we found directions on the l l bean web site for stopping catalogs via email and phone we should have called retailers while having a recent catalog on hand the mailing label contains a customer number that phone representatives use to quickly access your address records in hindsight we should have created a master list of our customer numbers to make calling more efficient we then had to wait about six weeks while catalogs that were perhaps at the printer or awaiting delivery made their way to our home one day after thinking we had finally received our last catalog we opened our mailbox and discovered five no retailer stuffed our mailbox with more catalogs than victorias secret the company says it mails million catalogs to consumers annually we found a link buried online that allowed us to "reduce mailings" but not eliminate them a recording that answered our call to the toll free line said "due to the overwhelming response to our latest catalog were experiencing delays in answering your call" and suggested we visit the web site the automated menu offered a prompt for catalog requests and address changes but none for stopping our catalogs we pressed "zero" to reach a live person the catalogs finally stopped a few weeks later we received three victorias secret titles on just one day during the waiting period for a total of six following our request the company didnt respond to requests for comment on the issue of why we received six catalogs we poked around the l l bean web site for information about stopping our catalogs and found directions to call write or email when we called a representative asked if we wanted to stop some or all of the companys catalogs we had been receiving the companys seasonal clothing catalogs and specialty titles such as l l bean traveler and l l bean home the phone representative explained that it would "take awhile" for our catalogs to stop completely five l l bean catalogs arrived during the six week period including two on one day l l bean says that a lapse of many weeks between the request and cessation of catalogs is normal because of the printing and mailing processes it was easy to order catalogs through the customer service page of eddie bauers web site but we couldnt figure out how to stop ours from arriving when a recording on the toll free line said to hold or leave a message we chose to hold a representative answered a few minutes later and asked for our identification number but we didnt know it because we threw out our most recent eddie bauer catalog the representative finally dug up our name in the database we received two catalogs after the call including one this past week there was a "catalog request" link on the pottery barn web site but we couldnt find a "catalog cancellation" link when we called a conscientious representative seemed to study our database entry as she spoke to us and assured us that "now you will be removed " only one more pottery barn catalog arrived days after our call the customer service link at the lands end web site brought us to a site map but we couldnt find a way to stop our catalogs when we searched for the term "catalog " the site directed us to a link for ordering one a representative at the toll free number asked for our customer number when we called which we didnt have and our reason for requesting the stop "we dont need them " we explained "we shop online " our recent calls to manufacturers and our request to the direct marketing association six months ago seem to have significantly reduced the huge pile of unread mail that arrived in our mailbox daily at least for now but well be more careful when we order from online retailers who also sell through catalogs were waiting for the day when our favorite retailers ask during online checkout whether we want to receive catalogs an option to click "no" would spare us innumerable headaches and treks down the driveway to our recycling bin in the meantime well be on the phone quickly with our customer number in hand whenever catalogs land in our mailbox well be
