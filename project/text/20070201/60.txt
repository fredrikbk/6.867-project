its only a football game students of national football league strategy insist that no matter who plays in the super bowl the game will draw a huge and enthusiastic audience well see the league has aimed to turn super bowl sunday into an unofficial national holiday so big that millions of fans will gather around television sets drink and eat themselves into happiness regardless of which teams play or even the outcome the nfl web site boasts of success last year million viewers tuned in the second largest super bowl audience ever what those numbers really convey is expectation the league has so hyped the super bowl that millions tune in expecting an event and it rarely happens how could it great games mostly happen by chance but there is another element the odds for a great game improve with the right match up teams to which fans have an emotional connection that happened in when the lowly new york jets dared to challenge the mighty baltimore colts and won or when the young patriots upset the st louis rams champions from fans brought passion to those games their passion drives super bowl mania we came close to tapping into that passion this year just two weeks before the big game true believers envisioned a battle between the patriots no longer upstarts but now the gold standard for success with three super bowl wins in the past five years and the new orleans saints what a game that would have been here are the saints everybodys feel good story the team from a city devastated by hurricane katrina a team that nearly moved to a different city but returned to become the symbol of new orleanss rebirth whose enthusiastic rookie coach brought them from a year ago to the door of the super bowl and who would they have faced only the most successful team of the decade with their taciturn unsmiling coach the sphinx in the hooded gray sweatshirt the reigning genius with the brilliant quarterback who seemed unbeatable in big games the patriots are todays version of the old yankees the team america loves to hate and the saints are cinderella the dirty faced kid clutching a ticket to the ball unfortunately both villain and hero lost on that fateful sunday leaving us with the chicago bears versus the indianapolis colts when the bears crushed the saints underdogs nationwide wept with the interception that ended the pats last minute drive toward sure victory millions of new englanders turned off their televisions and canceled their super bowl parties most of us will watch but outside of illinois and indiana where true fans of the bears and colts reside who will really care this is a game between two teams of relatively equal ability separated by miles in the middle of the country a three hour interstate bus trip its a scenario better suited for the high school basketball championship of the midwest where everybody knows somebody on one of the teams instead both teams are flying to miami for the professional football championship of america greeted mostly by people wealthy enough for the big weekend but with little abiding interest in the games outcome without a rooting interest viewers will be forced to concentrate on the game and pro football is very complicated anybody watching basketball can tell when a player is double teamed two opponents guard the one with the ball and in baseball when the defense "brings the infield in" we can see the infielders move closer to home plate in hopes of snagging a short ground ball to throw out the runner trying to score but how many of us know what "cover two" means or "eight in the box" not enough and the rest of us need somebody to root for this requires a close examination of the teams in terms we the people understand heres a little help both teams are led by unusually calm and apparently rational coaches both african american no black coach has ever before led his team to the super bowl and this year there are two no rooting advantage there the colts quarterback is peyton manning of the manning quarterback dynasty father archie played nfl seasons and peytons brother eli now starts for the new york giants peyton is talented charming successful in commercials and on the field but burdened by failing in crucial games the bears rex grossman has had limited playing experience and always seems about to be replaced but keeps winning advantage colts except for underdog fans then its advantage bears several other bears players however are active contributors to the nfls lengthy rap sheet four have been arrested star defensive tackle tank johnson needed permission from a judge to leave the state after his second arrest this time for firearms possession the colts have been arrest free advantage colts except for those who think everybody deserves a second chance then its advantage bears the colts franchise was awarded to baltimore in then in owner carroll rosenbloom and los angeles rams owner robert irsay traded teams a deal that kept both teams in place but earned both owners substantial tax breaks eventually irsay got wanderlust late one march night in moving vans packed up the colts franchise and trucked it to indianapolis to play in the enclosed hoosier dome the bears were on the scene when the nfl was christened in the teams patriarch and for most of its history its owner and coach was the legendary george halas the halas family still owns the team which over the years has taken on the personality of chicago powerful and resilient with a strong defense built to succeed playing outside in cold winters the franchise rooting advantage clearly goes to the bears because of the teams history the halas connection and because they play outside football is an all weather sport rain mud and snow are part of the game but these points are not driven by passion essentially this is a super bowl with neither good guys nor bad guys one with no natural drama this is frequently the case and because the nfl has raised expectations so high were bound to be disappointed thats the real message of the super bowl hype notwithstanding its only a football game mr rozin writes about sports for the journal
