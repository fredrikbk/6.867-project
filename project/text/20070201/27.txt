defense reservations native americans on trial often go without counsel quirk of federal law leaves a justice gap in tribal court system sells ariz as joseph juans may trial at the tohono oodham nation tribal court began prosecutor lisa stronawski fired off questions asking potential jurors about their views on drug laws at the defense table there was no lawyer representing mr juan the year old tribe member who faced charges of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver for sale and conspiracy couldnt afford a lawyer and didnt have one for most of the trial his voice normally a low mumble went unheard the right of defendants to legal counsel is guaranteed by the constitution but due to a little known quirk in federal law native americans arent assured this protection thats because under u s law indian tribes are considered sovereign nations and are not subject to all privileges afforded by the bill of rights the countrys tribes are largely responsible for funding government services such as schools police and hospitals as well as courts the tribes have jurisdiction over crimes committed on reservations by the nations million american indian and alaska natives many of these tribal courts like their federal and state counterparts have their own prosecutors tribe appointed judges and jail facilities court proceedings can be judge or jury trials there are such courts in the u s each governed by the laws of an individual tribe or village according to the u s justice department more than native americans convicted in tribal courts are locked up in tribal facilities or local jails off tribal lands mostly absent from this parallel justice system are public defenders a luxury that many poor tribes say they cannot afford the defense gap means that accused criminals often end up representing themselves as a result many plead guilty and risk exposing themselves to additional charges at the federal and state levels in some instances they may be subject to double jeopardy two trials sentences and punishments for the same crime "the constitution acts as a floor beneath you that no state can go below for native americans that floor doesnt exist " says zig popko an arizona state university law professor and a former federal public defender the indian civil rights act passed in gave individual tribe members some protections such as the right to a speedy trial and the right to a trial by jury but it did not provide the right to counsel for defendants too poor to hire attorneys each year the federal government spends nearly &# million to subsidize tribal justice systems the money goes to equipping and training police officers constructing jails and providing grants to courts prosecutors and victims programs of the total less than &# million is made available to tribal public defender offices many tribes never see "a single penny for indigent defense " from the government says nick fontana director of the defense advocate office for the pascua yaqui nation in arizona in the decade that the office has existed he says the tribe has borne all operational costs over the years various congressional bills have sought to address the problem of tribal defense funding last year arizona sen john mccain then chair of the indian affairs committee held a hearing to argue for more government assistance the issue has yet to gain traction some tribes such as the pascua yaqui nation outside tucson and the tohono oodham nation have programs to help provide attorneys for the indigent but stretched resources mean many defendants still go without mr fontana says problems usually arise when a group of people face arrest "we represent them first come first serve " he says "its brutal we have to tell people all the time that we cant represent them because we are representing someone else connected to the case all i can do is hand them a list of advocates and attorneys who can practice in court here and tell them you will have to pay for it yourself good luck " such limitations left joseph juan to defend himself mr juan was one of four people accused of hauling marijuana across the san miguel border between arizona and mexico in arrested by border patrol officers he was charged with conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute the pounds found in the truck he was driving mr juan didnt act quickly enough to secure an attorney although his tribe does have a defense advocate office a co defendant sought counsel first soaking up scant available resources the courthouse in sells the tribal capital is about miles southwest of tucson in a remote area of the state the main route there highway is a narrow two lane road marked with memorial crosses erected for members killed along the miles that stretch from the beginning of the tohono oodham boundary to sells it is an area where high winds blow constantly creating dust storms that can lower the visibility to just beyond the hood of a car at his trial here mr juan faced ms stronawski a tribal court prosecutor and a university of pennsylvania law school graduate she had five witnesses including three federal border patrol agents a tribal police officer and an arizona state police lab examiner her supervisor also an attorney joined her in the proceedings mr juan was alone "as i recall he didnt have any family" present says ms stronawski "im sitting there with my ivy league law degree halfway through an advanced law degree and my boss who has been a prosecutor years is sitting next to me how can that possibly be fair " mr juan wasnt available for comment despite being asked repeatedly by the judge whether he had problems with any of the evidence in the case mr juan only raised two objections during his trial one was to dispute the time of day an incriminating picture provided by the prosecution had been taken according to tapes of the proceedings mr juan spoke just over two minutes in his defense including an second opening statement he was convicted and sentenced to two years in a tribal jail ms stronawski now a defense attorney with the pinal county ariz public defender acknowledges there were gaps in her case against mr juan that she might have exploited as a defense counsel "in the end i felt he had as fair a trial as could be i dont feel like i railroaded him " she says "but going into a courtroom against a defendant without counsel is a hollow case " tribal court judges say they try to compensate for the paucity of public defenders by interacting more with defendants "ill ask them certain questions that would elicit something that would help their defense that they wouldnt think of " says potawatomi tribal court judge phil lujan who also serves as circuit judge for several other tribes normally says judge lujan it would be the defense attorneys job but " of them do not have attorneys " a jurisdictional quagmire is partly to blame the federal government has responsibility for prosecuting major crimes committed by native americans on tribal land such as murder rape robbery and arson but federal prosecutors regularly decline the cases instead they are left to tribal courts where defense offices are limited and judges are restricted in the length of sentences they can hand down cheryl stein a washington d c defense lawyer who is helping mr fontana with research in several of his cases listened to the taped transcripts of mr juans trial she says the judge asking mr juan whether he objected to certain evidence or jury instructions is akin to a "doctor asking a patient whether he objects to the interpretation of the x ray he has absolutely no basis on which to make an intelligent answer " indian casino operations have enriched some tribes letting them provide all the services of an independent government including criminal defense counsel a few even pay out tens of thousands of dollars annually to each member but most tribes are not so well off consider for example the tohono oodham nation in arizona where mr juan was arrested with million acres of tribal land and members the area is larger than connecticut and second only to the navajo nation in land mass although the tribe runs three casinos that fund many of the services provided by the tribal government more than of the members live below poverty level according to the u s census the tribes quasisovereign status allows defendants to be tried again in state or federal court for the same crime without the double jeopardy protections provided by the constitution defendants who enter guilty pleas in tribal court dont always realize that they are opening themselves up to federal or state charges for the same crime billy joe lara a member of the turtle mountain band of chippewa faced this situation when he was arrested for public drunkenness in by bureau of indian affairs officers at the spirit lake nation reservation in north dakota while being detained he punched one of the federal officers without an attorney he pleaded guilty the following day in tribal court to that and two other charges he was sentenced to more than days in a tribal jail two months later mr lara was indicted on a federal charge of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer in that case under federal jurisdiction he was granted the right to defense counsel but his attorney alexander reichert says that the prior guilty plea entered without any counsel put his client at a disadvantage "he just walked in and laid it out in the guilty plea " mr reichert said "he admitted all the details necessary to bring a federal case against him " mr lara who had already spent three months in a tribal jail for the first conviction went to trial and was also convicted in federal court he was sentenced to another months in federal prison for his punch mr reichert fought the case to the supreme court arguing that his client was charged twice for the same crime mr lara lost his challenge in when the high court sided with the government in its to ruling which said the case didnt constitute double jeopardy the opinion written by justice stephen breyer essentially stated that tribal nations are separate sovereign governments thus when a defendant commits a crime that violates the laws of two sovereigns in this case the tribe and the federal government both can bring charges in the meantime mr fontana says he routinely asks area lawyers to assume cases his office cannot take "i beg defense lawyers " he says "but some of them have caller id and theyre avoiding taking my calls now " parallel justice key events in the development of indian tribal courts  u s supreme court rules a non indian court has no jurisdiction in a case in which one tribe member killed another on tribal land  congress passes major crimes act which expands federal jurisdiction into tribal land for seven crimes including murder  supreme court rules that individual rights protections limiting federal and state governments in the u s dont apply to tribal governments  indian reorganization act passes encourages tribes to enact their own laws create their own justice systems  indian civil rights act passes provides individual rights protections for tribal members many of which mirror those in the bill of rights  supreme court rules that indian tribes dont have authority over non indians who commit crimes on tribal land  supreme court rules that individual tribes dont have criminal authority over members of other tribes  supreme court rules that trying a defendant in tribal court and federal court for the same crime is permitted
