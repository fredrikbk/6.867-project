a chat with the president the following are excerpts from president george w bushs meeting yesterday with the journals editorial board on the new iraq strategy wsj was there a moment in the war when you said we have to make a major change in the way were doing things in iraq gwb yes there was wsj when was that gwb september october wsj why gwb violence it looked like it was uncontrollable a young democracy is not going to survive if its capital city is in sectarian violence i thought for example after the samarra bombing that we were going to be fine i thought the shias had looked into the abyss of a civil war and pulled back we thought they had and they didnt on congressional opposition wsj theres a lot of discussion in congress about putting caps on troop levels or defunding or saying you cant deploy as commander in chief troops in baghdad do you think congress has the constitutional authority gwb i think they have the authority to defund use their funding power wsj you do gwb oh yeah they can say we wont fund that is a constitutional authority of congress i find it interesting however that on the one hand the senate listens to the testimony of david petraeus who said send me over with some additional reinforcements and this is the best chance to succeed and they vote for him to nothing in other words they listened to his testimony appreciated what he had to say and then they forgot the part about how he said i need the help theres a contradiction there wsj can they put caps on total deployments in iraq gwb they can through the purse in others i dont know if theyre going to and i dont want to predict but they have the right to try to use the power of the purse to determine policy wsj but can they put conditions on those funds can they say were only gonna give you the money if you dont send troops to anbar province gwb they put conditions on funds all the time some of those are called earmarks wsj would you veto gwb well i have put forth a plan that will succeed and it needs to be given a chance so ill wait and see what they try to do but i have said to the american people ive analyzed every plan and i think this one has the best chance of success if you think failure is a disaster then you have an obligation to come up with a plan for success and this is the one that i think will work on iran gwb my theory all along has been to isolate the iranian regime to determine whether or not there are people in their country who will worry about financial isolation isolation from trade opportunities one of the interesting things that we do know about iran is that there is a large diaspora that is communicating inside tehran for example there are rational people in that country who believe that isolation is not in their interests and there is enough commerce that if it can be affected through international cooperation it may cause people to say wait a minute wed better take a look to see whos running this deal and i can only tell you that im encouraged by the fact that others are beginning to question whether ahmadinejad is capable of leading the country i happen to believe and the focus of this administration is really to continue to rally the pressure on their nuclear weapons program i have said that i believe that they should have a civilian nuclear power plant so long as the materials are provided by and collected by a consortium im also concerned about iranian influence into iraq and have made it clear to the iranians that if we catch them moving weapons theyll be dealt with there is a temptation for people to take my comments and say really what he wants to do is escalate the conflict the answer to that is that we can solve this peacefully and were going to need other partners to help us solve it peacefully anyway thats where we are wsj do you believe the deadline on the iranian nuclear issue is during your term gwb you know i cant were watching very carefully is the best way for me to describe it and ill be pushing hard to solve this diplomatically on social security wsj can i ask about social security you mentioned it in your speech you also talked about low taxes being important to the strength of the economy would you accept an increase in the social security tax income cap from present levels in order to get a reform deal gwb i want people to bring their best idea to the table and im bringing my best idea which is you dont have to raise taxes to solve social security more from the interview with president bush on immigration wsj how concerned are you about the issue of immigration dividing the republican party gwb getting hammered is what happens when you take tough principled positions i dont want our party to be viewed as anti anybody if you get labeled as anti people you cant win elections i believe the philosophy of our party is the most hopeful philosophy it says to any person from any country you have a chance to succeed it relies upon individuals it empowers individuals to be able to realize their potential as opposed to saying the government is going to do it for you i know that sounds trite but thats how i view the difference of philosophy i hope i can get a bill through the congress so that the issue is dealt with in a rational way before the election process wsj do you think that will be easier with a democratic congress gwb i think its going to be hard either way i think its going to be a hard bill to get through and ill tell you why the ultimate question is what happens to million people who are here my view is that you cant kick them out nor should you grant them automatic citizenship and so theres got to be rational middle way wsj what is it about this issue that causes so many conservatives to abandon their free market principles raiding businesses becoming protectionists etc gwb i think raiding a business is more about enforcing the law and conservatives tend to want to enforce the law this is an emotional issue its interesting there have been periods in our history where nativism has had a strong appeal sometimes nativism isolationism and protectionism all run hand in hand weve got to be careful about that in the united states the s was a period of high tariff high tax no immigration and the lesson of the s ought to be a reminder of what is possible for future presidents im going to work hard on this i feel strongly about the issue i gave a speech from the oval office on the issue and i hope we can get something done but its going to be hard this is an issue where you can distort words and label things amnesty thats all youve got to say hes for amnesty whether its amnesty or not so its a tough debate for us all well see how it goes on vladimir putin wsj do you feel that you misjudged putin gwb vladimir putin has kept his word on everything hes said to me and my relationship with him is such that im able to express our disappointment when for example he deals harshly with the baltics vladimir putin is a person whos going to have to make a choice as will his successors whether or not his interests lie with the west or not and my objective is to convince him that his interests do lay west but in order to do so hes got to understand the values that make western societies move
