as fed holds steady bernanke gains praise fourth quarter snapshot adds to chairmans luster inflation is still concern as he finishes his first year as federal reserve chairman ben bernanke has dispelled early doubts about his ability to steer the worlds largest economy but his biggest challenge bringing the economy in for a soft landing lies ahead hours after the government reported the economy grew at a healthy annual rate in the fourth quarter the fed yesterday left the target for short term interest rates at for the fifth consecutive meeting in a post meeting statement more upbeat about both growth and inflation than decembers statement the central bank said its predominant concern is inflation stock and bond markets rallied the dow jones industrial average gained points to end the day at "recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth" in contrast to decembers "mixed" showing the fed said it added that it sees "some tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market " a distinctly more optimistic view than the previous months reference to "substantial cooling " reaffirming its longstanding forecast it said economic growth is likely to "moderate " a decision on whether to raise rates again the bank said depends on "incoming data " the commerce department yesterday reported the feds preferred inflation gauge prices for personal consumption excluding food and energy was up at an annual rate in the fourth quarter only a bit above the level with which many fed officials are comfortable "inflation pressures seem likely to moderate " the fed statement said while warning that the nations low unemployment rate "has the potential to sustain inflation pressures " one year ago today mr bernanke took over from alan greenspan who rose to almost superstar status during his years as fed chief so far mr bernanke is getting high marks for his leadership yesterdays snapshot of fourth quarter growth added to his luster "hes had good luck and good skill " said peter hooper chief economist at deutsche bank securities "given that a bursting housing bubble that predated ben is in the works hes been engineering things relatively well theyve been consistent and right in their forecast " the fourth quarters growth much better than in the third and in the second came as consumer purchasing offset a sharp drop in housing consumer spending rose at an annualized rate of contributing percentage points to fourth quarter growth residential investment meanwhile plummeted an annualized as home builders cut back on construction shaving percentage point from fourth quarter growth fourth quarter growth might have been even stronger than official figures suggest an anomalous drop in recorded light truck prices boosted the government estimate of inflation adjusted third quarter auto output some of it unwound in the fourth quarter contributing to an auto output drop that shaved the growth rate by percentage point for all of the economy grew at a rate of up from in and well above its year average of but mr bernankes reputation depends less on what has happened than on what will happen in the next couple of years whether growth slows below in the first half of this year and unemployment moves up a bit as the fed expects helping to bring inflation down to or lower in short the definition of a "soft landing " with unemployment yet to rise there is a risk inflation could pick up prompting the fed to raise rates sharply increasing the chance of recession in his first months on the job mr bernanke encountered doubts about his inflation fighting credentials and his attempts to communicate with the markets avoiding mr greenspans carefully chosen adjectives and instead specifying a forecast that would guide his interest rate decisions in april mr bernanke indicated in congressional testimony that he would consider halting increases for a while to monitor the impact of previous rate increases even as inflation was edging higher that and an unscripted comment a few days later that he had been misinterpreted eroded investor confidence one measure of the damage the inflation forecast implicit in the trading of inflation indexed bonds rose to in early may from where it was on mr bernankes first day on the job alarmed by his perceived loss of credibility mr bernanke pushed the federal funds rate to in june then paused in august even then the decision to pause was contentious inflation was running higher than fed officials were comfortable with but mr bernanke felt that if inflation didnt recede as he expected he could resume raising rates later if he kept raising rates he reasoned he risked transforming a nascent downturn in the housing market into a full fledged collapse that could drag the entire economy into recession five months later the decision looks wise the economy has cooled a bit though not as much as mr bernanke expected housing has contracted but not collapsed inflation has edged down though it is still too high for the feds comfort the inflation forecast reflected in inflation indexed bond prices is down to bruce kasman head of u s economic research at j p morgan chase has argued that the fed should raise rates further to quell inflation yet even he says mr bernanke made the right decision in pausing in august given the competing risks "the most important thing for the fed is to make sure the extremes on both growth and inflation arent manifested " he says but less benign outcomes will put mr bernankes decisions in a less flattering light he says "if were sitting here with to inflation in a years time that will have been a bad policy " other analysts argue the housing markets recent stability is a temporary respite because of warm weather and lower mortgage rates housing will worsen soon they say and the spillover could yet hit consumer spending and raise the risk of recession such a result would be seen as evidence that mr bernanke raised rates too far some of mr bernankes accomplishments are less visible he has made fed discussions more freewheeling and collegial colleagues say but he has fallen short of his goal of innovating fed communications he has wanted to set a public numeric inflation target make more frequent and more detailed forecasts and issue more descriptive less formulaic post meeting statements but sensitive to colleagues less enthusiastic about such changes he has subjected debate to an internal review that review is expected to wrap up this fall
