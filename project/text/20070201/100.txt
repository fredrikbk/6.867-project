president clinton senator hillary clinton is waging two presidential campaigns at once she is running for the democratic presidential nomination while keeping a sharp eye on the general election campaign against the republican presidential nominee whoever that turns out to be mrs clinton wants to run as a centrist not a liberal in the general election but theres a problem she is being tugged to the left in the nomination fight forced to take positions that may jeopardize her chances later against the republican candidate her opponents in the democratic primaries next year dont have this problem they are unabashed liberals who have done nothing to place themselves near the ideological center of american politics mrs clinton however spent her first term as senator from new york downplaying her image as a staunch liberal instead she has sought with some success to fashion a reputation as a centrist on some several key issues particularly national security and while doing so she became the undisputed frontrunner for the democratic nomination she became electable a glance at the breakdown of red and blue states in the presidential race shows how little it would take for her to win the general election if she holds the states won by democrat john kerry she would need to add only one populous red state or two smaller ones and there are numerous republican states that have drifted toward the democrats since ohio colorado iowa montana nevada arizona and virginia just to name a few but mrs clintons ability to pick up one or two of these red states depends on her maintaining credibility as a centrist on key issues that is a difficult task given the pressure from her partys liberal base and from her democratic opponents for the presidential nomination its now very much in doubt whether she can accomplish it shes already becoming more liberal than its safe to be in a presidential election in a nation with an enduring center right majority as surprising as this may sound mrs clinton starts her campaign as the democratic candidate furthest to the right the only two democrats who might have gotten to her right sen evan bayh of indiana and former gov mark warner of virginia dropped out of the race so she faces competition from a phalanx of liberals two of whom sen barack obama of illinois and former democratic vice presidential candidate john edwards are formidable opponents in her six years in the senate mrs clinton has gone a good ways toward achieving the threshold requirement for a female candidate for president making herself believable as a commander in chief she did this by spending long hours at senate armed services committee hearings forging a supportive relationship with donald rumsfeld and voting in to authorize the invasion of iraq she became conversant on defense issues at a breakfast with reporters in late i asked her if there had been good reason to believe as president bush did that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction "the intelligence from bush to clinton to bush was consistent " she said in concluding saddam had chemical and biological weapons and was developing nuclear weapons mrs clinton had done her own "due diligence " she went on by attending classified briefings on capitol hill and at the white house and the pentagon and also by consulting national security officials from the clinton administration whom she trusted all agreed saddam had wmd now an investigation was needed on how everyone had been "so misled " mrs clinton said but she declined to endorse the theory of sen edward kennedy that the existence of wmd was a "fraud" cooked up by mr bush to justify the war in iraq it was a strong answer and i was impressed mrs clinton further burnished her credentials as a serious person on national security affairs by refusing once the war turned unpopular to repudiate her vote as mr edwards had mr obama as a state legislator had opposed the war from the outset she criticized the conduct of the postwar occupation and suggested there might never have been a vote to go to war had it been known saddam had no wmd but this was the standard sort of second guessing by a senator democrat or republican then came january and two events the sudden effort by democrats to compel mr bush to bring the iraq war to an end and the just as sudden acceleration of the presidential race mrs clinton joined the stampede to cast the president and the war in the most pessimistic light she dramatically escalated her criticism first after a trip to iraq she called for a cap on american troops in iraq at the current level of thus no "surge" in the number of troops at a senate hearing a few days later mrs clinton lectured gen david petraeus the new iraq commander on the appropriate counterinsurgency strategy in baghdad she asked the general the armys foremost expert on counterinsurgency no questions then during her first campaign trip to iowa she demanded mr bush "extricate our country" from iraq before he leaves office it was as if all the pressure had gotten to mrs clinton and shed forgotten her need to remain resolute on national security rather than acting like a potential president she acted like a bickering senator she put the reputation shed earned for seriousness on national security at risk that the iraq war was unpopular in and early probably wont help her in when mr bush is stepping down the question now is whether mrs clinton will stand up to the political pressure to move left on other issues in she boldly reached out to pro lifers calling abortion "a sad even tragic choice to many many women " she said both sides in the abortion debate should seek "common ground " will she repeat that when she and the other democrats appear before groups like naral pro choice america and on health care mrs clinton insists shes learned from her painful experience of authoring a failed national plan in that relied heavily on government mandates lobbyists for health care groups say she speaks approvingly now of injecting free market incentives into the system but will she advocate them as part of a centrist health care initiative in the democratic primaries presidential campaigns are unfair to liberals the american electorate prefers presidents to be centrists bill clinton the elder george bush or conservatives ronald reagan the younger george bush voters usually opt for a presidential candidate who is tough minded rather than wavering or vulnerable to fleeting passions on one issue above all national security hillary clinton was well on her way to becoming such a candidate until now mr barnes executive editor of the weekly standard is the author of "rebel in chief" crown forum
