why airline mergers arent taking off us airways failed delta bid suggests industry players see some benefit in flying solo with yesterdays collapse of us airways group inc s hostile takeover bid for delta air lines inc the widely anticipated wave of consolidation in the u s airline industry is likely to remain on hold at least for now the official committee of unsecured creditors for delta yesterday rejected us airways &# billion offer and formally endorsed the atlanta airlines plan to exit bankruptcy this spring as an independent company the publicly traded bonds of delta and northwest airlines corp which is also operating under bankruptcy protection slid as investors and analysts said any major mergers now may not materialize for another year or more the failure of the deal "moves consolidation onto the back burner for a while " said philip baggaley standard &amp poors corp s senior airline analyst he added there is a "reasonable chance there will be consolidation over the next year or two " people familiar with the situation said there is little chance that discussions regarding any other combination with delta including earlier exploratory talks with northwest and ual corp s united airlines that were put on hold would resume as long as delta and northwest remain in bankruptcy court delta management cited a drop in oil prices from last years highs as well as planes continuing to operate nearly full industrywide as factors that could tamp down the attraction for immediate consolidation delta also argued that its lowered cost structure positioned the airline to emerge from chapter protection as a healthy competitive player in the industry those factors have contributed to a recent upswing after years of losses for airlines many others also have shed costs through recent bankruptcy filings the committee determined that backing deltas reorganization plan which has the airline exiting court protection in the spring posed less risk than extending deltas stay in bankruptcy while a merger underwent federal antitrust review according to people familiar with the situation the group worried that delta managements vehement opposition to the deal would have made the process extremely difficult and potentially derailed it altogether these people said that resistance fueled opposition among lawmakers in washington who might have worked to stall or disrupt the regulatory review according to these people in a statement the committee said it "considered a variety of factors including but not limited to valuation of the timing and the risks associated with and the likelihood of a successful consummation of the us airways proposal and the delta plan " delta officials said in a statement that they used bankruptcy "the right way" and "transformed their companys business model " in a statement us airways chief executive doug parker said the committee "is ignoring its fiduciary obligation" to delta creditors he said the decline in delta bonds since it became apparent that major creditors were resisting the offer reduced the implied market valuation of what deltas unsecured creditors can expect to recover by more than &# billion the tempe ariz carriers offer would have expired today us airways had expressed willingness to add a further &# billion in cash to the deal if the creditors committee agreed to demand that delta open its finances to due diligence by us airways among other measures ultimately the creditors committee decided it preferred the opportunity to take a strong hand in the governance of the nations third largest airline which has shed &# billion in annual costs and steer it into potentially more lucrative deals in the future in negotiations with delta management in recent days the creditors committee significantly strengthened its influence over delta once the airline exits bankruptcy the most important agreement gives the committee the authority to appoint of directors who will compose deltas postbankruptcy board according the people familiar with the matter three current directors will be retained each of whom will be selected by the creditors committee those people said the new delta board is then expected to hire a new chief executive who will also serve on the board current chief executive gerald grinstein has said he intends to retire after the company emerges from court protection the committee plans to install people who embrace consolidation as a strategic option and made clear to delta in recent days that this was a condition of gaining its approval for the airlines standalone plan according to knowledgeable people delta also agreed to a creditor committee request that the new charter and bylaws exclude any so called poison pill provisions that would pose insurmountable obstacles to future mergers they said delta and the creditors also reached consensus on a compensation plan in which senior delta management will receive of new companys shares according to people familiar with the situation an additional will be reserved for executives hired in the future these people said melanie trottman contributed to this article
