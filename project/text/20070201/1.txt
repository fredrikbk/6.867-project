a cultural conversation with ennio morricone composer with a harmonica tonight through feb "ennio morricone " six films the composer scored museum of modern art www moma org tomorrow through feb "morricone " twenty six films he scored film forum or www filmforum org saturday "ennio morricone in concert " morricone conducts the rome sinfonietta and the canticum novum singers in excerpts from his film music radio city music hall www radiocity com new york if film music is the invisible art form then ennio morricone is one of its least visible giants to be sure no one familiar with mr morricones work is in the slightest doubt of his immense stature he has scored more than movies since many of which like "the untouchables" and "in the line of fire " were box office smashes the long list of his famous fans ranges from yo yo ma and renee fleming to pat metheny and bruce springsteen mention his name to mark morris the iconoclastic choreographer whose eclectic musical interests are a byword in the world of modern dance and the response is both prompt and fervent "oh god dont you just love him i love him " but mr morricone like most film composers is not nearly so well known in america as is his music the wailing harmonicas and twangy electric guitars with which he accompanied the "spaghetti westerns" of sergio leone remain instantly recognizable four decades after those still controversial films were made yet you will not find his name anywhere on the cover of the dvd version of mr leones "once upon a time in the west " the film for which he wrote one of his most innovative scores the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has yet to give him an oscar though he has been nominated five times all this however is about to change with a vengeance tomorrow mr morricone appears at the united nations where he will direct an invitation only performance of one of his concert works an elegy for the victims of called "voci dal silenzio" voices from the silence on saturday he makes his long overdue north american concert debut at radio city music hall leading a chorus and orchestra in a program of his film music the museum of modern art and new york citys film forum are presenting retrospective series devoted to the films he has scored later this month sony classical will release "we all love ennio morricone " a cd featuring ms fleming messrs ma and springsteen andrea bocelli celine dion herbie hancock quincy jones and metallica the heavy metal group that opens its shows with an excerpt from mr morricones score for "the good the bad and the ugly " and on feb he will finally receive an honorary oscar if that doesnt make him famous nothing will thats a formidably full plate for a year old but mr morricone who arrived in manhattan earlier this week to kick off the festivities with an appearance at the italian cultural institute appears unfazed by the fast mounting frenzy i spent an hour there chatting with him about his life and work and his urbane demeanor suggested a man whose center of artistic gravity is far from hollywood a city where he has never lived just as he has never found it necessary to learn to speak english we conversed through an interpreter mr morricone one quickly senses is a man of the highest seriousness a student of goffredo petrassi one of the first important italian classical composers to embrace neoclassicism and later to experiment with serialism he has turned out a substantial body of concert hall music simultaneous with his prolific film studio career ask him which composers he most admires and he responds with a list of blue chip names drawn exclusively from the world of classical music palestrina monteverdi frescobaldi bach stravinsky though he points out that his music bears no resemblance to theirs "im sure they left me something inside but i metabolized it " nor does he admit to having been influenced by the golden age hollywood composers of the s and s such protestations might carry less weight coming from a different sort of composer but mr morricone has always been his own man right from the start his scores sounded startlingly different from those of any other film composer of the s in part because of their highly individual orchestral palette moreover mr morricone deserves all the credit for their extreme individuality for he orchestrates his own scores instead of relying on a studio specialist to do it for him "when a composer composes music " he says "he needs to do the whole job from start to finish there must be no orchestrator no arranger no whatever thats what hes got to do this is a moral judgment you can tell that bernard herrmann wrote his film scores all by himself you can feel that hes responsible for them you could feel his aesthetic hand on everything he did who does not do the orchestration and all these other things is not really a composer he is a composer and my own judgment of other film composers is influenced by this it is something i learned from petrassi he was a master in teaching but also in life a man who saw music as a moral issue " one of mr morricones coloristic trademarks is the harmonica which he first used in "once upon a time in the west " he takes no credit for the original idea noting that the script called for the instrument to be played on screen by charles bronson but it was his own idea to leave the first minutes of the film completely unscored instead filling the soundtrack with amplified natural sounds the buzzing of a fly the squeak of a rusty windmill the blowing of the hot desert wind it is only when bronson appears in the distance that we finally hear the reedy wheeze of a chromatic harmonica which plays a stark three note motif that mr morricone will later use as the basis for the films most memorable music cue an edgy spiraling near tuneless tune called "man with a harmonica " like any sharp eared composer mr morricone knew a good sound when he heard one "yes yes i liked the harmonica " he says "i like the way that its sound seems to come from out of the players body i use it all the time " it figures no less prominently in his score for brian de palmas "the untouchables " you can hear it at the very beginning of the film in the snarlingly astringent cue called "the strength of the righteous" that plays under the opening credits over the charging beat of a snare drum played with brushes mr morricone weaves together three separate strands of orchestral color an explosive rhythmically off center motif played by piano and strings a long chain of quacking woodwind chords and the lonely cry of a harmonica the effect is joltingly fresh and utterly personal here as in "man with the harmonica " mr morricone steers clear of the conventional use of melody its not that he lacks the gift of tunefulness his sweetly elegiac score for giuseppe tornatores "cinema paradiso" borders on the operatic but he knows that melody is but one of the many ways in which a film composer can in his words "make explicit what the plot alone cannot explain " he is no less conscious of the uses of ambiguity "melody has a strong importance in my music but it is also the one thing i often try to avoid that one line which communicates a precise fact to the audience " thats a modernist talking and mr morricone is no less modern in his stravinsky like devotion to the virtue of craftsmanship for him each new film presents a different set of "problems" to be solved "i feel that its success may depend on me at least in part so the first thing i do when i screen it is to start thinking of the problems and start worrying about them and digging for them the harder the solution the higher the satisfaction " in "the untouchables " for instance he saw his main compositional task as "focusing on the moral truth the moral message of those who know they are going to win and to give good to the world " yet for all his self effacing desire to make films work mr morricone is no less serenely confident that his best scores have a musical validity independent from the films for which they were written "a score can really work well when it is music in itself and can stand by itself " he explains "it gets to the audience and makes contact with them if its autonomous people will like it " mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about the arts at www
