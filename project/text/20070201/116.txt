for the e mail here contradictory views are the staple of multilateral efforts to halt irans enrichment of uranium but its rare to hear them coming out of the same government and all but unheard of from the same head of state until this week in paris french president jacques chirac granted an interview monday with the french weekly le nouvel observateur the new york times and the international herald tribune an interview embargoed until the magazines publication date today on tuesday he brought the reporters back to the elysee to take back much of what he said mr chirac who for years has worked with european allies and washington to demand a halt to a program they suspect is meant for weaponry said it was dangerous for iran to flout constraints of the international atomic energy agency but then "i would say its not so dangerous the fact of having one nuclear bomb maybe a second a little later " he said according to a transcript in nouvel obs "if iran pursues its path and totally masters the electronuclear technology the danger isnt in the bomb it will have and which will bring it nothing where will it send this bomb at israel it wouldnt get meters in the atmosphere before tehran would be razed " whats dangerous he said is the resulting proliferation "why wouldnt saudi arabia do it and why wouldnt it help egypt to do so too thats the danger " but in france and with many french journalists some politicians are used to being able to alter the character of comments already spoken and on tuesday he told the same reporters "i should rather have paid attention to what i was saying and understood that perhaps i was on the record " the times reports adding that mondays talk had been recognized as a tape recorded on the record interview about his comment that tehran would be razed in retaliation for an attack he said "i retract it of course when i said one is going to raze tehran " he added that "it is obvious that this bomb at the moment it was launched obviously would be destroyed immediately we have the means several countries have the means to destroy a bomb " it wasnt clear what he meant since such missile defense technology is rare and of unproven ability mr chirac also retracted his references to saudi arabia and egypt saying it wasnt for him to speak for riyadh and cairo and asked about israel replied "i dont think i spoke about israel yesterday maybe i did so but i dont think so i have no recollection of that " the pair of interviews may add a little nuance to the international debate over iran but they may be of more concern domestically for the french as the times notes the year old mr chirac is in the final months of his second term as president with elections set for next spring he suffered neurological incident in and rumors about flaws in his publicly displayed cognitive abilities have popped up since then during the first interview "he appeared distracted at times grasping for names and dates and relying on advisers to fill in the blanks his hands shook slightly " the times says during the second he was more confident and comfortable with the subjects discussed dell takes back the reins at dell founder and chairman michael dell is returning as chief executive of dell which ousted ceo kevin rollins amid the companys struggle to revive the personal computer makers fortunes mr dell tells the austin american statesman this would be the first of a number of changes in the coming months and quarters including a move to "streamline the organization" and reinvigorate sales though he didnt elaborate mr dell also declined to comment on whether he should share some of the blame for the companys problems the american statesman says but the wall street journal notes the companys reversal largely took place since he ceded day to day control to mr rollins in dell which rose to supremacy in the pc market by selling directly to consumers and businesses over the telephone and internet has
