politics &amp economics capital on energy and ethanol politics there are at least three ways to look at president bushs energy initiative one is knee jerk if mr bush proposed it it must be stupid a second is to pretend youre king how would i solve this problem a third is to ask given the administrations stated conviction that markets know best does the proposal make sense and go far enough partisan critics do the first academics do the second lets try the third mr bush says the u s energy market isnt working well at current prices americans use too much oil and gasoline for our own good he says he is worried about an imprudent dependence on oil the price of which is heavily influenced by regimes not always friendly to the u s and about global warming his solution "diversify our nations energy supply " the economists user guide to policy says the most efficient response to a market price that doesnt fully reflect the costs of consuming a good in this case the risk to national security and to life on earth as we know it is a tax it could be on oil or on gasoline or on carbon a major constituent of fossil fuels no one inside the bush camp will say this publicly at least until they leave gregory mankiw the harvard economist who did a turn as chairman of mr bushs council of economic advisers now is campaigning for a &# a gallon gasoline tax phased in over years a tax would raise the price of oil or gasoline or carbon discourage consumption of gasoline or whatever was taxed and create incentives to produce alternatives the market not the government would pick the best alternative but mr bush is allergic to anything that smells like a tax so he opted for a not very republican alternative he would use the governments muscle to force americans or more precisely the companies that blend motor fuel to consume less gasoline than they otherwise would and more of something else a lot more a law requires blenders to increase their use of alternative fuel most of it ethanol made from american corn to billion gallons a year by from the current six billion gallons mr bush proposes to boost that to billion by if there isnt enough alternative fuel to go around blenders will have to pay a tax like penalty to the government the size of which hasnt been determined ok it isnt the economists first choice but economists dont often run for office the presidents proposal has some logic the government isnt picking winners just guaranteeing lasting demand for alternatives to gasoline broadly defined to stimulate investment and technological progress with all that guaranteed demand more than makers of corn based ethanol could ever meet one might think there was no longer any need for the cent a gallon tax credit for ethanol which will cost taxpayers about &# billion next year and more in later years as ethanol production rises one might also think that since the goal is to "diversify" the u s s energy sources there is little reason to continue a cent a gallon tariff on imports of sugar derived ethanol from brazil but mr bush didnt say anything about repealing the tax credit or about altering it so that the government pays a subsidy only when oil prices are low and ethanol is economically unattractive nor did he say anything about repealing the tariff the reason has little to do with economics and a lot to do with the politics of corn the tax credit was born during the oil price spike of the tariff was added to prevent foreign producers from getting u s subsidies the two measures sustained an embryonic ethanol industry in corn growing states when oil prices were low and there wasnt much government consumer or wall street interest in alternative fuels times have changed but the folks who benefit dont much like the idea of repealing the credit or tariff and they have a lot of friends in the senate including charles grassley of iowa the top republican on the senate finance committee and among presidential candidates for whom ticking off iowas corn farmers would be an exercise in masochism mr bushs serious advisers have a hard time defending the tax credit or the tariff "at some point in the future all these technologies need to stand the test of the free market" says energy secretary samuel bodman or at least a market in which the government puts a floor under demand under current law the tariff expires in and the tax credit in mr bushs advisers figure repealing the measures is politically impossible and hope to persuade congress to resist pressure to extend them yet mr bush the self described admirer of markets who wont ever again face voters in iowa or probably anywhere else wasnt willing to say even that much in his state of the union address postscript on last weeks column on prizes a report by the national research council an affiliate of the national academy of sciences last week urged the government to launch "an ambitious program of innovation inducement prize contests" as "a sound investment in strengthening the infrastructure for u s innovation " mr wessel responds to reader comments at wsj com capitalexchange or email him at capital wsj com
