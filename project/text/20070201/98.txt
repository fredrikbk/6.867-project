politics &amp economics bush farm proposal may snag on congressional roadblocks washington the bush administration proposed to make u s farm programs more market oriented unveiling a package of changes that could give new momentum to the stalled doha round of global trade talks but may face big hurdles on capitol hill the initiative would put total farm spending over the next five years at &# billion down &# billion from what the u s spent in the past five years on basic programs and disaster relief it would boost spending on conservation and put more emphasis on direct income payments to farmers such methods of support are more acceptable than subsidies of specific crops under the world trade organization the body based in geneva that is shepherding the doha round at the same time the administration is proposing to scale back a program that effectively sets a price floor on basic commodities such as rice wheat and soybeans it would also trim a separate set of subsidies designed to encourage production of those commodities those kinds of subsidies are widely thought to distort the marketplace at home and abroad by encouraging american farmers to make business decisions based on the amount of government assistance they get the doha round was launched in with the goal of lowering trade barriers and integrating the developing world more closely into the global economy it stalled last summer because of differences among major trading partners including the u s brazil and the european union over how deeply to cut farm supports the u s has pushed for others to lower agricultural tariffs in hopes of creating new markets abroad for american farmers it has come under major pressure to scale back its own subsidy programs which critics say give u s farm goods an unfair advantage in global markets the unveiling of the administrations new farm package came as wto chief pascal lamy signaled that he intends to formally reconvene negotiations in the doha round u s trade representative susan schwab said "the doha round is not going to write the farm bill " ms schwab who has been shuttling around europe trying to revive the talks said the changes outlined yesterday should send "a signal to our trading partners that we care about farm reforms " oxfam america a trade advocacy group and frequent critic of the bush administration yesterday commended the administration for trying to move u s farm policy "in a new direction " the initiative faces an uncertain future on capitol hill and could become a test of how much sway president bush has over lawmakers in a democratic congress in proposing to scale back farm subsidies the white house is treading on dangerous political ground risking a fight with the powerful farm lobby and its allies in the house and senate even before the bush proposal came out the chairmen of the house and senate agriculture committees signaled their wariness of agreeing to big cuts in farm subsidies without gaining in return significant new market access abroad for american farm products so far that has been an elusive u s goal in the doha round the american farm bureau federation a trade group representing thousands of farmers across the country vowed to keep "an open mind" on the bush initiative but cited concern over the presidents proposals to trim commodity subsidies a federation spokesman said the group would "do our best to make sure that those are not in the final package " the bush proposal would make it harder for farmers to qualify for production subsidies under current law producers with adjusted gross incomes of as much as &# million are eligible to receive subsidy payments the administration is proposing to lower the income cap to &# and set an annual limit on total subsidy payments of &# agriculture secretary mike johanns said the changes would make u s subsidy programs "more equitable" and "better able to withstand challenge" within the wto critics said limiting payments could hurt farmers with much lower actual income soybean growers for example sometimes wait a year or more to sell part of their crop to get the best price for it a practice that can artificially inflate income for a single year "his income may look like its &# when it really isnt " said richard ostlie president of the american soybean association janet adamy in chicago contributed to this article
