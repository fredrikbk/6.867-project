to teach me about fitness yeah right " ms mirabile weighs pounds shes part of a marketing experiment involving an exercise called "nordic walking " unlike exercise routines like spinning pilates and tae bo nordic walking isnt specifically aimed at health club aficionados who pride themselves on being fit and trim types the companies behind nordic walking are giving their outreach efforts a twist theyre targeting couch potatoes and other nonathletic types including the overweight and feeble "were not trying to get marathoners to take up nordic walking " says greg woser the u s head of leki gmbh a germany based maker of walking sticks and other outdoors equipment "our customers are the people on the roadside watching the marathoners " using instructors like ms mirabile nordic walking promoters which include the companies that make the equipment like leki springboost and fittrek inc hope to make the activity more appealing to those for whom regular exercise has always been a challenge "we want people to think if big fat donna can do it so can they " says ms mirabile she co teaches her salt lake city class with elizabeth foote who suffers from type ii diabetes and osteoarthritis in both knees and says she is herself about pounds overweight leki trained ms mirabile and ms foote as class instructors free of charge the women charge groups or individuals a fee to participate in the class and the company sells their students equipment nordic walkers use poles similar to those used by cross country skiers to propel themselves forward on streets or sidewalks even when theres no snow the poles add stability for some old or obese people that use walking canes instead of skis walkers usually wear special sneakers with lower heels that claim to make striding easier the sport has taken off in northern europe where some experts including ones at the international nordic walking association estimate that about seven million scandinavians germans and austrians have taken up the sport estimates of u s nordic walkers currently range from to several hundred thousand but many sports companies are betting the exercise routine will become much more popular here "we believe its just a matter of time before nordic walking takes off " says andy silvestri a former executive at adidas ags reebok who now heads up swiss based springboost last year the company set up a u s unit in boston in part to jump on the trend dr cedric bryant chief science officer for the american council on exercise a san diego based health and fitness organization says "there are certain elements that could make it big in the u s its so low impact and joint friendly and its a relatively simple way of taking what many people are already doing walking and boosting it up a notch to burn extra calories " about european and u s companies now make poles and shoes for the activity in addition to germanys leki finlands excel oyj and norways swix sport as which pioneered the activity in europe two u s firms miami based fittrek and exerstrider products inc of madison wis are rolling out poles and accessories poles retail for between &# and &# depending on weight adjustability and other features meanwhile shoe companies including adidas reebok asics new balance and timberland are making nordic walking sneakers for the european market the sneakers cost about &# a pair "were really happy with our european sales of the shoe " says new balance chief executive jim davis he says the company eventually plans to sell the shoe in the u s once the sport becomes more popular reebok springboost and timberland already have plans to introduce nordic walking shoes in the u s this year as early as this spring marketers are hoping to tap into the giant walking market which represent the single largest sporting goods category in the u s an estimated million americans walk for exercise according to the national sporting goods association a chicago based sports activity tracker in comparison million exercise with equipment and million work out in a gym nordic walkers burn at least more calories than normal walkers versus in an hour because of the use of upper body muscles according to an independent study by the cooper institute in dallas walking with poles for exercise was pioneered by american tom rutlin the ceo of exerstrider in the s nordic walking which is basically the same thing but with slightly different poles and a different name was started by the finnish cross country ski team in the s to stay in shape during the summer months the snow poles metal tips were replaced with removable rubber studs for use on asphalt about years ago a handful of northern european pole manufacturers began promoting the exercise form to the masses in their respective countries the activity didnt catch on right away one deterrent is what some call "the silly factor " many people felt embarrassed swinging their ski poles in the middle of a city on a hot summer day comments from passersby like "expecting snow " or "forgot your skis " didnt help undeterred manufacturers dispatched an army of instructors to lead group walks "you may feel self conscious when youre doing it alone but not in a group " says fitttrek president daniel barrett it wasnt until after the network of nordic walking instructors had grown to more than that the activity started to gain traction in europe "at some point a critical mass was reached and you dont feel silly any more " recalls lekis mr woser last year leki usa trained about instructors and it hopes to add an additional to its roster this year ms mirabile and ms foote were among last years trainees they were flown to florida for a one day training session both women were picked partly because of their weight and other health problems says suzanne nottingham a leki recruiter fittrek and exel together have trained more than instructors who generally arent paid to learn the sport but can later charge fees to lead walks prospective trainers are taught the correct use of the poles the various upper and lower body muscles used during a walk how to adjust poles to increase the level of difficulty and the amount of calories burned during various workouts instructors also must be certified to administer cpr nordic walking is something entirely different than nordictrack a stationary contraption that allows users to simulate skiing indoors the brand once owned by massachusetts based cml group inc fell out of favor as consumers found other home exercise equipment easier to use cml group filed for bankruptcy in and was liquidated the following year during their class presentations ms mirabile and ms foote talk in class about how nordic walking improved their health ms mirabile who is has shed about pounds in about six months and brought her resting pulse rate down to beats per minute which is considered excellent even for top athletes she used to run out of breath on a treadmill after five minutes now she says she nordic walks just over three miles in about an hour the year old ms foote a diabetic says nordic walking has helped bring her fasting blood sugar level down by more than points and that "strangely" when she uses the poles her "arthritic knees dont hurt at all " ms foote has lost about pounds in the last six months since last summer the women instructors have introduced about people many suffering from weight and other various ailments to nordic walking they say they found them through doctors and community events like charity walks "elizabeth and i still cackle " says ms mirabile "were in the fitness industry "
