the daily fix irsay dungy and manning seek indys first pro title the chicago bears won the nfls first championship game the colts have never played in a super bowl since moving to indianapolis from baltimore in on sunday theyll attempt to win their citys first professional championship the colts since the arrival of quarterback peyton manning two playoff wins in indy b p six a p have helped make pro sports relevant in indiana "when the city fathers first broached the subject of bringing professional sports to indianapolis they were met largely with contempt " stan sutton writes in the christian science monitor "the city was surrounded by big time sports venues in chicago cincinnati detroit and st louis indys facilities were nonexistent and except for the indianapolis automobile race a fixture since there was no reason to bring the goodyear blimp to town " but now the colts and occasionally the pacers are helping to overshadow indianas traditional staples of college and high school hoops when city officials lured former colts owner robert irsay from baltimore they left pain that lingers virginian pilot columnist bob molinaro a baltimore native objects to the colts record book including players such as johnny unitas who "never played a down for indianapolis " and adds "im just glad indy isnt claiming to have invented the crab cake " the late mr irsays son jim is working to repair the family name sam farmer writes in the los angeles times "jim who as a kid helped unload the moving vans when the teams equipment arrived in indianapolis said he can understand the resentment some people in baltimore still feel yet said hes surprised its so strong " mr farmer writes mr irsay also speaks candidly about other sensitive matters including a past drug addiction and rumors he used steroids when he was a weightlifter he denies them mr irsay is a colorful character "cut from a different cloth than say al davis and john york " san francisco chronicle ray ratto writes referring to the two bay area nfl owners "neither of them merely to take one example would have consented to being photographed for a feature story wearing only a strategically placed elvis presley guitar " more germane to sundays game mr irsay is willing to spend more than any other owner in the league over the last three years according to figures analyzed by mike mulligan of the chicago sun times the league has a salary cap but teams actual outlay varies depending on signing bonuses and other factors general manager bill polian spends the cash much of it on the teams star studded offensive roster mr polian has built three different teams that have reached the super bowl though none have won it "he is gruff confrontational and abrasive " mike reiss writes in the boston globe "he also knows how to build successful football teams " his coach tony dungy couldnt be more different in personality hes admired around the league for his calm demeanor and perspective about the proper place of football among lifes priorities which has deep roots in his football career "back when he was playing for the university of minnesota you see dungy wasnt just a record setting quarterback but a straight arrow responsible citizen " mr farmer writes in the times "thats why one of the teams assistant coaches mo forte routinely hired him to baby sit his toddler daughter " that image is more poignant because of the tragedy that befell mr dungys family over a year ago when his year old son james committed suicide his words at the funeral in december and his actions since then have inspired orlando sentinel columnist mike bianchi who writes "he took his darkest time and brightened the lives of those around him " several colts players have seen loved ones die in recent years middle linebacker gary bracketts father mother and brother died in a span of months from to "it is kind of hard for you to get emotionally attached to things knowing that your heart has been ripped away time and time again " mr brackett tells ohm youngmisuk of the new york daily news receiver reggie waynes brother rashad was killed in a traffic accident this past september "he misses his brother every day prays to him during games swears he hears his brother answer and has a picture of his brother as the only decoration in his locker in indianapolis " kimberly jones writes in the newark star ledger mr waynes pro bowl counterpart marvin harrison doesnt share such personal details with the press which made the annual media day ritual particularly uncomfortable for him "although harrison wasnt squirming it was clear he could have done without the entire experience " michael wilbon writes in the washington post "he has spent his whole career trying to be completely invisible but had no place to hide tuesday " although messrs wayne and harrison were vital participants in the colts playoff disappointments of the past four seasons the man throwing them the ball is facing most of the heat this week mr mannings failure to win a super bowl is as valid a storyline as any in the absence of news these past two weeks but the fix wont spend further time dwelling on it here "disappointment" is a relative concept quarterback art schlichter the colts first draft pick years ago destroyed his career because of his gambling addiction now he lives with his mom and tells sportslines pete prisco hed like to work with the nfl to counsel players about the dangers of gambling on the field mr mannings trademark is his tendency to assess the defense at the line of scrimmage and change the play "for as long as the forward pass has been etched into playbooks there has been reason for the quarterback to audible or change the play " mike klis writes in the denver post "no other quarterback in the history of the nfl however has used the audible like manning " the bears hope to rattle mr manning which is easier said than done according to washington post football writer mark maske "he has played all games the colts have had in the regular season and playoffs since they drafted him " mr maske writes "that says something about mannings toughness and his quick release and about the prudent approach taken by colts offensive coordinator tom moore it also says plenty about the quality of mannings blockers " those blockers must hold off the pass rush while processing mr mannings ad libbed plays "are the colts linemen smarter than the average bear s probably not " len pasquarelli writes on espn com "but life is no picnic when a linemen has to quickly process information and make adjustments on the fly " life is more of a picnic as an nfl lineman than as an electrical supply salesman as jeff saturday can attest mr saturday has gone "from street free agent to two time pro bowl center " phil richards writes in the indianapolis star "from electrical supplies salesman to the glue that binds the colts offensive line " but is that offensive line overrated football outsiders michael david smith thinks it is after breaking down the afc championship game though he adds that the o line has good stamina be ranked fifth to last in the league in yards allowed per game and your defense wont get much pre super bowl coverage but indys improved d has enabled its playoff run and safety bob sanders who returned from injuries late in the season has gotten much of the credit for his powerful game belied by his listed measurement of " "chicagos defense is typical of the nfl " gregg doyel writes on sportsline "indianapolis defense in terms of stature is more like something from the mid american conference and bob sanders he looks so little on the field that i want to ask him if hes lost and if so maybe i could help find his mother but then the ball is snapped and you understand why this one man this one little bitty man has made such a huge impact " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and
