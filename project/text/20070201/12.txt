bush on the record president bush came to wall street yesterday to tout the continuing good economic news more on that below and afterward he sat down for minutes with a few members of this newspapers editorial board if mr bush is beaten down by the polls and his partys loss of congress he isnt showing it the president talked about a wide range of subjects from warrantless wiretaps to the politics of immigration to diplomacy with north korea and we reprint notable excerpts nearby but mr bushs biggest theme was pushing back against what he feared might be a national lurch away from engagement with the world "im concerned about protectionism isolationism " mr bush said as he sat down and he proceeded to reflect on the oscillations of american policy that in the past produced the anti immigration backlashes of the s and the anti free trade legislation of the s "how do you work with others to see that we dont become isolationist " so in his speech yesterday he hit on the need for new trade promotion authority and in his conversation with us he also stressed his familiar arguments about the stakes of failure in iraq with only two years to go in his term its clear hes also thinking of how he can solidify his antiterror legacy on that score weve been critical of mr bush notably on his decision to abruptly change gears and subject his nsa warrantless wiretap program to judicial review so we asked why he had made that decision after months of insisting that those wiretaps were a presidential prerogative "scrap the program is not accurate " he insisted "the program exists and now weve had a program ratified by the judiciary which is going to make it easier for a future president to have this program in place it had nothing to do with diminution of presidential authority it had everything to do with getting a second branch of government to support that which i have done " well what if a future president finds that the judges on the fisa court that supervises the wiretaps are less cooperative "thats way too hypothetical a question i am pleased with the ruling they made the program is ongoing giving me the tools and others in the government the tools necessary to protect us " mr bush said it sounds to us as if the president believes hes made a tactical concession in order to achieve what he thinks is a larger strategic victory lets hope hes right the president was also notably accommodative in conceding congresss power of the purse to influence war decisions even such things as where troops can be deployed "i think they have the authority to defund use their funding power " he said even to influence "total deployments in iraq " the danger here is that congress will take him up on this concession and start to micromanage the war would he veto such an attempt "well " mr bush replied "i have put forth a plan that will succeed and it needs to be given a chance so ill wait and see what they try to do but i have said to the american people ive analyzed every plan and i think this one has the best chance of success if you think failure is a disaster then you have an obligation to come up with a plan for success and this is the one that i think will work " by contrast mr bush is more tentative or perhaps cagey about how best to deal with irans nuclear weapons programs we asked if he thought the deadline on the iranian nuclear issue would come during his term "were watching very carefully " he replied thus evading a direct reply but also not giving any comfort to the mullahs about the next two years as for american leverage with tehran the president said "there are rational people in that country who believe that isolation is not in their interests " noting recent electoral reversals for president mahmoud ahmadinejad regarding north korea mr bush clearly believes the sanctions on pyongyangs sources of hard currency have been the key to both the six party talks and getting the regimes attention asked why some in his own government that is the state department want to lift those sanctions mr bush replied "whered you get that report " the idea he added "is to use the sanctions to get north korea to give up on its weapons programs " so were not going to lift the sanctions mr bush "theyve got to give up their weapons programs " mr bush also wasnt backing down on his judgments about russian president vladimir putin whom he has gone out of his way to court over the past six years the russian president "has kept his word on everything hes said to me " mr bush said adding that "putin is a person whos going to have to make a choice as will his successors whether his interests lie with the west or not my objective is to convince him that his interests do lay west but in order to do so hes got to understand the values that make western societies move " one of our goals during the session was to see if mr bush really is entertaining thoughts of raising taxes in order to strike a deal on social security reform with democrats "i want people to bring their best ideas to the table and im bringing mine which is you dont have to raise taxes to solve it " he said thats not a categorical rejection of tax increases but then again it wont encourage democrats who want mr bush to sign up for new taxes before they even come to the table as he weaves between comments both on and off the record mr bush betrays little doubt about the direction of his policies regardless of the politics "getting hammered " he said "is what happens when you take tough principled positions " he used those words in the context of immigration reform but it might as well apply to the challenge his entire agenda faces over the next two years judging from our meeting he wont be dodging that challenge see related letter
