politics &amp economics house democrats show strength in passage of spending measure washington house democrats in the strongest showing yet of their new legislative muscle pushed through a &# billion spending resolution to fill the gap left by the collapse of the budget process under republican rule last fall with funding for the government running out feb both parties and the white house are eager to resolve the fiscal crisis but the new majority brought the bill to the floor with remarkable speed and no apologies to republicans for denying them the chance to offer individual amendments "you forfeited any right to squawk about how we cleaned up your mess " said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis "somebody had to make the decisions because you didnt " less than a week before mr bush submits his budget the action set a clear marker for the new congress and spending battles ahead total funding conforms to caps set by the white house but tilts now toward democratic priorities in education health care and law enforcement no pay raise is permitted for lawmakers and a moratorium is imposed on spending earmarks for home state projects a practice that has become a symbol of congressional abuse "this turns the page on a past that was broken and failed " said rep rahm emanuel d ill chairman of the party caucus as many as republicans broke ranks to join in the final vote a showing that surprised many democrats on the floor and should help expedite action in the senate there the spending bill will inevitably be paired with senate debate on mr bushs iraq policy and his decision to add another troops to quell sectarian violence in baghdad here also republican divisions combined with the relative unity among democrats could be decisive last evening senate majority leader harry reid d nev predicted his caucus would overwhelmingly support a bipartisan resolution crafted by sen john warner r va challenging the troop surge the former chairman of the senate armed services committee mr warner won the public backing of the new democratic chairman michigan sen carl levin and changes made last evening could potentially win the backing of sen judd gregg the influential new hampshire republican and white house ally said in an interview that he was "considering" supporting mr warner the mood of frustration over iraq among republicans is striking indiana sen richard lugar the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations committee has argued that the country must begin to prepare for the likelihood that the troop "surge" will fail even sen john mccain r ariz a white house ally on the war has found himself hamstrung when writing a proposed alternative to sen warner that would set out benchmarks that the iraqi government forces must meet asked if there would be any consequence if the government failed mr mccain said he was reluctant to put any in writing "i dont know any good option otherwise i would suggest it " he said mr reids challenge now is to navigate both through the iraq and spending debate in the space of two weeks since fiscal began last oct most of the government has operated under an interim funding resolution the latest extension of which expires feb mr reid is warning that he cant afford to be "mr nice guy" but if he treads too heavily he could lose the republican support he needs to deny all amendments would be "unfortunate " said mississippi sen thad cochran the ranking republican on the senate appropriations committee "i might vote against the bill for that reason " nonetheless the house bill has been negotiated with influential republican senators in hopes of avoiding conflict and mr obey pledged that the biggest bone of contention funding for scheduled military base closings will be addressed as
