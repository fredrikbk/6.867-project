the daily fix derby champion dies at age leaving behind grief and hope kentucky derby champion barbaro was put to death yesterday by his owners he was four years old the thoroughbred won all six of the races he finished but suffered a career ending injury in the preakness last may breaking his right leg in three places over the last eight months his owners and veterinarian spent tens of thousands of dollars and tried every medical remedy to try to save barbaro but a series of setbacks left the people convinced this powerful horse couldnt live on without pain barbaros persistent but ultimately futile struggle to recover was watched and cheered by racing fans and animal lovers "within five months michael matz his trainer received a mountain of e mails " jerry izenberg writes in the newark star ledger "a wounded vet from iraq sent him an american flag a doctor named margaret goodman once the medical chairman of the nevada boxing commission found out what his favorite foods were and sent them along to the new bolton center elementary school kids wrote letters two dollar bettors who would step over a prostrate heart attack victim so as not to get shut out at the betting windows greeted each other in simulcast rooms with waddaya hear and for once they werent asking whodaya like " with hundreds of racehorses dying each year while training or competing and countless squirrels deer and other animals killed by cars each year why should this man made equine casualty matter so much to so many including all the participants submitting messages to the barbaro message board an ever cynical t j simers writes in the los angeles times "dont get me wrong when it comes to horses ive cried too one big lug coming to mind that went off at odds of to the fifth leg in a pick six and all going well only to finish last you want to talk about sad stories " other columnists concede that the outpouring for barbaro wasnt always completely rational but identify plenty of unique attributes in the late champion speaking for casual fans washington post columnist sally jenkins writes "he had both innocence and greatness and its not often you find those ephemeral qualities alive in the same creature whats more anyone who watched barbaro run in the derby felt that they saw traces of a distinct character he was winsome this gave his suffering specificity we felt we knew him " and in an elegy directed at horseracing cognoscenti her post colleague andrew beyer laments "the injury robbed the sport of a horse who might have been one of the best of modern times one who had the potential to accomplish feats without precedent his death cost the thoroughbred world a stallion who might have made a lasting imprint on his species " for a taste of that brief period when a kentucky derby champs potential seemed limitless heres sports illustrateds article about the derby and the related fix a special racehorse has an outsized effect on people both in his triumphs and in his pain two days before barbaro died los angeles daily news columnist kevin modesti watched horses "grant new life" to their owners at the sunshine millions "at gulfstream a filly named shaggy mane whose old owners showed what they thought of her prospects by letting her go for &# at a northern california fairground won a &# race " mr modesti writes "new life and this was just an appetite whetter in a banquet of miracles fifteen minutes later at santa anita a gelding called smokey stover won the biggest race of his career and made a winner again of harry aleo an year old one time dodgers minor league pitcher whose time in the spotlight as a horse owner had seemed to end when the national champion sprinter lost in the fog was killed by cancer new life and more to come " a brief interlude on thoroughbreds age they celebrate their birthdays on jan so barbaro was four in racing terms though he was born less than four years ago in april hence the change to our earlier headline calling him three sorry for the confusion the fix in bad times as well horses can have a profound impact "barbaros story was something nearly everybody understood instinctively " dick jerardi writes in the philadelphia daily news "this was a magnificent animal that needed human help " mr jerardi argues that what really drew people in was the human help from the owners and vet and the compassion behind it if cincinnati enquirer columnist paul daugherty is right then compassion for mute innocent animals makes people better and if that makes people more compassionate towards their more complex more needy fellow man then it will have all made sense "we push beached whales back into the ocean we rub detergent into the oil soaked feathers of seabirds " mr daugherty writes "well lie all night by the side of a dog whose arthritis wont allow it any more trips up the stairs well spend eight months trying everything we know to heal a horse many thought should have been humanely destroyed while still on the track at pimlico these are the times that make us proud to be alive and grateful to be human we do these things and realize how much goodness we possess the nobility in the attempt to save barbaro uplifts us all " there was nobility in that battle and also futility the louisville courier journals jennie rees writes that thoroughbred horses are built for running not recuperating "if you chose to design the worst orthopedic patient in the world it would probably look like a horse " equine surgeon larry bramlage tells ms rees baltimore sun columnist john eisenberg says insiders never gave barbaro much chance even as they rooted for him and his owners fight "while the horse breeders and farm owners werent encouraged about his prospects they were thrilled and proud that his owners roy and gretchen jackson were endeavoring to save him at any cost and quite a cost at that " mr eisenberg writes "they saw it as a positive development for their industrys image and self respect that a horses welfare was being put ahead of all other considerations it doesnt always happen " espn coms pat forde hopes the sport will build on that example and try to make itself safer for its participants even if it may be true that no measures could have prevented the freak accident that ultimately killed barbaro "at arlington park in chicago the summer race meet was devastated by the catastrophic breakdowns of horses in racing and three during morning training hours " mr forde writes "in california there were more than fatalities at horse tracks between and those kind of statistics cannot be tolerated in a sport that is at risk of losing even more of its already splintered audience neither can the death of the star of just one race after america got to know him its time to question everything " barbaros isnt the only sports story to tap into newspaper readers compassion oregonian columnist john canzano wrote last week about sara farfan who works part time as a cleaner in the portland trailblazers locker room she is years old has no medical insurance and her husband needs glasses he cant afford when she found a &# bill near travis outlaws locker she returned it to mr outlaw via her supervisor in an envelope mr outlaw paid a &# finders fee but didnt meet ms farfan so mr canzano introduced her to his readers they responded with emails two hours worth of voicemails and offers of help for ms farfan and her family including a free eye exam and surgery if necessary for her husband "it inspires me that you spent a few minutes of your day over breakfast or on the internet reading and marinating in a journey that took sara most of her lifetime to make and you were so moved by her that you wanted to give even more of yourself " mr canzano writes "i should just be satisfied i think except for some reason i feel passing contentment today what ive learned from sara and from readers such as you is that we have a class of working people who are underpaid under represented and squeezed into an uncomfortable corner of this country where they cant afford medical care transportation or decent living conditions that you have empathy and are organizing to help sara pay for medical insurance or purchase a reliable automobile is amazing but this issue feels much bigger to me " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
