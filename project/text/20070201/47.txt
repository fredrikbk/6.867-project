financing vehicles sell stock to the public to raise money before they actually own or conduct any business then they use the money to buy companies historically they were underwritten by small investment firms and marketed to individual or "retail " investors now seasoned corporate deal makers with operational expertise are backing these so called blind pools in their most recent incarnation specified purpose acquisition companies or spacs investors who buy in are betting that the deal makers will pull off lucrative mergers or other deals yielding a profit for everyone but it is all on faith the deal makers selling the shares are quietly drumming up the type of interest from financiers hedge funds and wall street investment banks usually seen in bigger and more mainstream

months to buy a business once a target approves an acquisition management must win the backing of at least of a spacs shareholders if it fails the spac liquidates and pays the ipo proceeds back to investors minus banking and other fees some underwriters are deferring a small portion of their fees until the spac buys a business if a deal fails the deferred portion of the fees which vary can be returned to investors the "blind pool" monikers come from the uncertainty over what the future business will be in the s and s some of these entities were at the center of fraud schemes prompting the
