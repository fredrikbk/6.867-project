if the shoe fits the senate may or may not begin debate shortly on two nonbinding resolutions critical of president bushs decision to increase the troop level in iraq one of the resolutions would amount to a no confidence vote the other a not much confidence vote but both are essentially a do over for senators who rue their support for the joint resolution authorizing the use of military force in iraq regardless of whether a senate vote takes place republicans may throw a last minute wrench in the works plenty of legislators will be competing in a sound bite competition in the coming days but for hot eyed bombast on the subject the bar may have already been set impossibly high by sen chuck hagel a republican from nebraska and one of the authors of the harsher of the two resolutions washington is a city of many diversions but very little surpasses the pure entertainment value of watching a senator media chatter about his potential attractiveness as a presidential prospect ringing in his ears commandeer the microphone during a committee meeting and then posture in a most forceful and statesmanlike way for the television cameras sen hagel did not disappoint last week as the senate committee on foreign relations prepared to vote on the resolution expressing outright opposition to the increase in troops sen hagel a longstanding critic of the war was in ultra dudgeon about what he apparently regards as an insufficient amount of capitol hill kibitzing on the presidents conduct of the war "i think all senators ought to be on the line" by having to make a "tough vote" on the troop increase sen hagel said in a bit of bullying that instantly became the tv quote of the day he then appeared to call out an unspecified number of his honorable colleagues as cowards "if you wanted a safe job go sell shoes " now this seemed like a low blow against shoe store employees surely sen hagel was not suggesting that selling shoes is physically safer than serving in the senate in the past two months alone according to police reports robbers have struck several shoe stores across the country a payless shoesource store in philadelphia was held up on jan at another payless in palm bay fla near melbourne a man with a knife robbed the store on dec and then demanded a kiss from a female clerk police said reader she kissed him at the boynton beach mall in florida on christmas eve according to police a gang confrontation in a shoe store turned violent leaving one victim dead from a gunshot wound on dec at the shoe biz store in south bend ind a man posing as a customer asked about childrens shoes and then threatened to "get violent" unless he was given money an employee handed over the stores cash the man also stole her cellphone on and on the police blotter goes of course robbery is commonplace on capitol hill but the perps preferred weapon of choice is the earmark as for staying out of harms way selling shoes compared with serving on capitol hill is the equivalent of working the late shift at a package liquor store no sen hagels "if you wanted a safe job" jibe must have been referring to employment security but that assertion is just as puzzling incumbency is not a bad thing term limits and campaign finance restrictions are intrinsically antidemocratic measures but its a bit rich to hear someone who was elected in and who has come up for a job performance review by nebraska voters precisely once in the past decade roaring about the relative career risks of drawing a senate salary or working for payless according to the census bureaus economic statistics between and the number of shoe stores in this country declined to from as for the senate jobs that sen hagel imagines are imperiled by strong stances on the war sure the reshuffling in november probably did include the turning out of a few senators who were being punished for supporting the war or for their views on illegal immigration or for any number of other reasons divining voters motivations is tricky quite possibly the specter of being routed from office in the next election has made some senators more circumspect about the war nowadays then again unlike sen hagel who voted for the resolution supporting the presidents action in iraq in before he began assailing the wars prosecution perhaps many of his colleagues are content to let their votes back then speak for themselves its not clear precisely what the point would be of a resolution opposing the troop increase other than letting legislators flatter themselves with the notion that they have some influence over the presidents war making strategy conducting a periodic opinion poll on capitol hill for thats what nonbinding resolutions are might be useful certainly historians would wish that during the civil war the senate had taken its temperature every few months regarding president lincolns prosecution of the war might have been interesting to compare their vacillations with his single mindedness but then as now senators will find a way to make their views known one of sen hagels neighbors from out west for instance sen mike enzi a wyoming republican voted for the resolution on iraq in and doesnt need to be dared to express his support for the presidents war policy in the senator simply posts it on his web site "president bush is making strategy adjustments in order to improve stability were not talking about just iraq here we are trying to prevent a catastrophic blowup that would not only be traumatic for the middle east but would send reverberations throughout the world " as it happens before sen enzi got started in politics he was a small business owner with stores in wyoming and eventually one over in sen hagels home state what sort of business selling shoes
