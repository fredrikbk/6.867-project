can ethanol get a ticket to ride meanwhile imports are rising even as the u s looks to ethanol as a way to wean itself off foreign petroleum supplies imports of the biofuel are soaring despite a sharp tariff levied on most ethanol shipped from abroad importers are finding they can compete with domestic ethanol on price some foreign suppliers especially brazil also can provide ethanol more easily in some cases because of shipping bottlenecks in some areas of the u s the surge in imports has yet to cause political backlash because u s ethanol supplies havent caught up with demand but tensions could arise this year as production at a slew of new domestic ethanol plants threatens to outstrip demand already corn belt farmers who supply ethanol plants have taken to calling brazil the top foreign supplier of ethanol to the u s the "saudi arabia" of ethanol "why should we be trading dependency on one energy source for dependency on another " asks matt hartwig a spokesman for the renewable fuels association a trade group for the u s ethanol industry the u s ethanol industry benefits from a cent a gallon tax credit as well as a cent a gallon tariff levied on most imports the tariff drives up the price of imported ethanol neither subsidy is likely to change despite bush administration hints that it wouldnt mind seeing the tariff disappear while a certain amount of foreign supplies can avoid the tariff if the ethanol is dehydrated in a caribbean country before it enters the u s the amount of duty free ethanol is capped at of annual u s ethanol consumption the import surge suggests that users are happy to base their purchases less on where it comes from than cost and convenience "it all comes down to economics " says gene edwards executive vice president at texas based valero energy corp a major north america oil refiner that blends ethanol into gasoline "if its brazilian sugar cane that makes the ethanol why should we care " about of the ethanol that valero blended last year was imported according to the company new players are piling into the u s ethanol market including china the netherlands and even pakistan through november total u s imports of ethanol used for fuel last year were million gallons more than four times as much as the million gallons in according to the u s international trade commission brazil which makes its ethanol from sugar cane instead of corn is one of the worlds most efficient producers of the biofuel u s imports of brazilian ethanol rose to million gallons in the first months of from million gallons in all of according to figures from the trade commission jamaica was the second largest exporter to the u s last year followed by china oil companies adopted en masse last year as a clean burning replacement for another key gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether that was being phased out as oil prices soared last year demand got another shove when president bush in his state of the union address called on americans to start using more renewable fuels ranging from ethanol to biodiesel as a way to reduce u s dependence on foreign oil congress then passed a bill requiring the u s oil industry to use billion gallons a year of renewable fuels by most of which is expected to be ethanol president bush has since called for the use of billion gallons of alternative fuels including liquefied natural gas by in order to cut gasoline consumption by u s producers cant yet make enough ethanol to supply domestic needs last year about billion gallons of ethanol were produced in the u s while about billion gallons were consumed according to the renewable fuels association imports made up the difference brazilian imports have been attractive because imported ethanol can be about the same price as the u s product and sometimes cheaper for instance with corn at about &# a bushel the wholesale price of a gallon of ethanol including transportation and production is about &# at current sugar cane prices a gallon of ethanol costs about &# a gallon including transportation from brazil and the tariff shipping convenience is also a factor many of the biggest users of ethanol are on the coasts while many of the ethanol plants are clustered in the midwest for coastal users it is often simpler and more reliable to have ethanol hauled on a ship from brazil than on already strained railroad lines from rural nebraska or iowa moving the budding ethanol industry "beyond its midwest roots out to some of the coast routes is a challenge " says rick tolman chief executive of the national corn growers association with demand outpacing supply the growth of imports shouldnt cost u s producers much business but that could change when the dozens of new u s ethanol plants projected to come on line in the next year are added to the plus existing plants last month at the world economic forum in switzerland secretary of energy samuel bodman said he believed more imports were going to be needed to meet ethanol demand "the idea is that at some point in the future all these technologies need to stand the test of the free market " he said but farm and ethanol interests are likely to block any move to remove the tariff or let it expire in some american companies clearly see benefits in foreign ethanol especially that made from sugar cane last year agriculture giant cargill inc of minneapolis invested in a brazilian sugar cane ethanol plant "we think the best way to ensure a strong growing market domestically is assurance of supply " says bill brady spokesman for cargill "thats why we favor a global marketplace when it comes to ethanol " see related article "as its popularity increases railroads producers strain to get the biofuel to market" wsj feb
