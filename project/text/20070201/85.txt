ode to the colts special to the wall street journal the daily fix asked readers who are fans of the bears and colts to write an ode to their club explaining why they root for them and what characteristics their team seems to have year in and year out even as the cast of characters changes heres rob wynkoop on the indianapolis colts with a little over six minutes left in the first half of sundays afc championship game standing in a silent rca dome i looked at my brother brian and said "thats it now i really mean it there is no way i am renewing my colts season tickets for next year i cant take this playoff agony anymore " i have a sneaking suspicion that thousands of other season ticket holders felt the same way years of playoff disappointment were coming to a boil as below us another colts defeat unfolded at the hands of the new england patriots they just dont match up with us on paper so how do they beat us in every game that matters about an hour later there were a little less than three minutes left in the third quarter the game was tied and we were experiencing one of the greatest nfl conference championship games and then an incredible victory for the colts sealed by a marlin jackson interception with just ticks left on the clock the rca dome was complete pandemonium i have never hugged so many blue and white clad strangers in my life i had just witnessed one of the great moments in sports history of course i also changed my mind about next years season tickets professional football has only been played here in indianapolis for years so its still a bit hard to put your finger on those characteristics that keep you coming back to the dome for more each sunday during the season we dont have a great old nickname like chicagos "monsters of the midway " we dont have a storied team fight song like washingtons "hail to the redskins " heck the indianapolis colts ring of honor includes chris hinton bill brooks and jim harbaugh with the exception of harbaugh most people outside of indianapolis couldnt tell you who these guys were or what position they played were still learning what it means to bleed blue and white but make no mistake about it we have one heckuva football team here in indianapolis and this city has fallen in love with it over the last several years who would have thought that anything could be more important than iu and purdue basketball what indianapolis also has is a new generation of fans that has grown up watching that artistry in motion as described by colts play by play radio announcer bob lamey "manning to harrison down the right side he makes a move he breaks free of the defender hes at the hes at the hes at the touchdown colts " hearing that call and seeing a play like that at least once a week is like a good golf shot its enough to bring you back out regardless of how many strokes you ended up with but its more than that the indianapolis colts are a class organization that starts at the top with colts owner jim irsay hiring a man like tony dungy to replace jim "playoffs who said anything about playoffs " mora not only is tony dungy a great football coach he is also a man of deep conviction and faith you dont have to know him personally to know that something besides football drives this man just watching him on the sidelines or in press conferences you can see clearly that winning football games is not the most important thing in his life he never raises his voice never uses profanity and always respects his players and coaches he himself says it best "ive always coached the way i wanted to be coached " its clear this team has embraced that approach you virtually never hear about off field problems with the indianapolis colts this city and state couldnt be more proud with dungy and offensive coordinator tom moore the colts have built an interchangeable offense that can score from anywhere as long as manning is in the game every week there is a new hero harrison wayne stokely clark addai utecht klecko thats right dan klecko joes son you get the point manning is able to get virtually everyone on the team involved speaking of peyton manning no player better embodies what this team is about and why this city is enamored with the colts hes smart spends countless hours preparing for each game hes tough consecutive starts including a broken jaw against miami in hes good watch last sundays drive with left in the game i wonder how close was bill polian to drafting ryan leaf in the colts have also stuck to a defensive model that at times during the regular season didnt look like it could stop a pop warner running attack but dungy and his team have stuck with the plan through thick and thin as the coach says "we do what we do " indianapolis has embraced this consistency and not just because of the winning on the field in a way it is a great lesson in life do what you do and do it well the colts will do that on sunday and indianapolis will be home to the super bowl xli champions yes we have the greatest spectacle in racing and yes hoosiers love their basketball but football is now king in indy rob wynkoop is a colts season ticket holder and mid level state government bureaucrat living in indianapolis he intends to stay in this job as long as possible because his reserved state parking space is two blocks from the rca dome
