mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q what are the versions of windows vista for business a there are three versions of vista with features aimed at businesses one called vista business is for small businesses it includes some business features like comprehensive backup and more sophisticated networking but omits some consumer features such as media center and dvd maker another called vista enterprise is for deployment by information technology departments at large complex organizations it also lacks key consumer features but includes features useful to network administrators such as a capability called bitlocker for encrypting disk drives the third version windows ultimate has the small business features as well as the consumer features omitted from vista business it also includes bitlocker q since both apple and dell computers now use the same intel processors and since apple machines can now run windows why cant i run the macintosh operating system on a dell or on any other computer normally sold with windows a because apple uses a variety of means to impede that scenario apple is primarily in the hardware business or the business of selling hardware combined with software it doesnt want to merely sell or license its operating system either to users or to other computer makers even though they have expressed an interest in licensing it thus the company has legal policies against running its operating system which is called mac os x on non apple hardware and it builds in technical barriers as well by contrast microsoft is primarily in the software business and is happy to license windows to be used on any compatible computer including apple machines as long as it gets paid either by users or manufacturers hackers have demonstrated macosx running on a non apple computer but their methods cant be easily replicated by an average user and they dont enable all of osxs features so until and unless apple makes it legally and technically easy to do so the mac operating system will for all practical purposes be usable only on apple computers q i have a registered copy of office that was activated for use on my windows xp computer if i buy a new computer with vista and i simply reinstall office from my original disks will i be able to activate it on the new pc a i asked microsoft and a spokeswoman said you should be able to activate it again automatically over the internet and if you cant do so she told me that you can simply select "activate by phone" from the activation wizard and have a brief phone conversation with a company representative who most likely will give you a new activation code you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
