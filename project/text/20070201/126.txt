water fight in france takes a dirty turn neptunes potty humor riles utilities in paris in rap at green ads paris in france the battle between tap and bottled water has taken a particularly dirty turn into the toilet bowl last month bottled water company groupe neptune in a one week campaign plastered billboards across paris and its outskirts with ads urging people to be particularly selective about what they drink "i dont drink the water i use to flush " read many of the posters which displayed a photo of a white toilet bowl marked with a big red "x " next to the discredited commode was a large picture of neptunes cristaline brand of still bottled water "i drink cristaline " the ad concluded neptune which accounts for a quarter of frances bottled water market in volume terms and based near paris has usually kept a low profile in the past the unit of wine company groupe castel enlisted a veteran french soccer trainer guy roux to promote cristaline which is one of the cheaper water brands on the french market but neptune chairman pierre papillaud says he was forced to sharpen his knives after what he calls a low blow by frances tap water managers late last year sedif the public utility that manages water for pariss suburbs launched an ad campaign urging people to drink tap water saying it was safe reliable cheap and more environmentally friendly than bottled water "which brand delivers excellent water to your house all year round " asked one of the ads showing a water coming from a faucet operated with a plastic water bottle cap rather than the usual handle another ad hinted at the energy and material waste generated by the bottled water business "which brand delivers one billion liters of water every day and not a single bottle " the year before eau de paris the utility that supplies tap water for the city of paris ran ads with a similar theme up in arms the year old mr papillaud came up with the toilet idea "i shot a missile because i couldnt stand water utilities comparing their water with mine " he says the paris agency business executed the ads as part of a series in another ad arrows marked "lead " "chlorine " and "nitrates" pointed to water running from a tap with the slogan "i dont economize on the water that i drink for &lt euro&gt a month i drink cristaline " a third said "those who pretend that tap water tastes good mustnt be drinking it often " bottled water companies and water utilities have long slugged it out for consumers confidence in countries where tap water is safe to drink france is a particularly important market because its home to two of the worlds largest water utility companies veolia environnement and suez as well as two of the worlds biggest bottled water purveyors danone and nestle waters a unit of swiss food giant nestle danone is known for brands such as evian and volvic while nestle waters produces perrier and vittel among others the french drink an average of liters of bottled water per person every year just behind italians who lead the world with liters and well ahead of americans who drink liters according to a nestle study thats why the french market is luring all sorts of high end bottled water players including u s brand bling h which goes for euros per swarovski crystal decorated bottle the battle between tap and bottled water in france has escalated in recent months after decades of expansion the bottled water market reached a peak in terms of volume sold during the heat wave that swept france in but has been declining since then water consumed in drinking is only a fraction of that used and paid for daily in households a person in paris for example uses about liters a day according to the utilities but only drinks between half a liter and one liter so while utilities arent trying to steal market share from the bottled water companies highlighting the quality of tap water is a key part of promoting their image as good public service providers "we need to raise the standing of tap water in peoples minds " says anne le strat chairwoman of eau de paris "its more environmentally friendly its cheaper and its one of the most regulated products " in paris tap water costs less than a third of a european cent per liter neptunes cristaline goes for cents a liter while danones evian costs about cents a liter water utility companies acknowledge that tap water may sometimes have a slight taste of chlorine which is added every day to eliminate bacteria and sometimes in higher doses when french authorities are concerned about possible poisoning of water networks by terrorist organizations otherwise they say their water is as pure and tastes as good as most bottled waters thats why neptunes latest potty humor has riled paris water utilities eau de paris has made preparations to file a complaint against neptune with a paris court hiring a lawyer and contacting the prosecutors office mr papillaud says he has no patience for court action using a french expression he calls the situation a "tempete dans un verre deau" that is a tempest in a glass of water
