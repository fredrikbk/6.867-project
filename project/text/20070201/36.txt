such as navy blue forest green and magenta by showing collections that focus on couture like shapes and fine tailoring designers are elevating their offerings at a time when theyre under more pressure to design apparel that sets them apart from inexpensive fast fashion retailers such as h&amp m and zara that have become increasingly adept at creating inexpensive versions of high fashion pieces highly structured shapes for example may be harder for mass retailers to replicate successfully "if people are going to be paying so much for clothes they want something special sophisticated " says valerie steele fashion historian at the fashion institute of technology in new york "this implies a kind of connoisseurship women who are literate about the history of fashion are going to go oh this piece is poiret or balenciaga channeled by this contemporary designer " the move to more defined and shaped clothes is also a classic illustration of the fashion pendulum swinging back after years of flowing bohemian fashion designers moved away from the trend en masse in collections for fall that season fashion dabbled with structure by layering coats jackets and long sweaters over leggings the s style bubble skirt was also reintroduced last fall "for four or five years fashion really relied on color and print and ornamentation the bubble skirt was the first time in a while that just a silhouette influenced everyone " says robert burke head of new york luxury goods consulting firm robert burke associates for spring fashion designers continued adding more structured pieces with many designers introducing geometric trapeze dresses and mod style a line shifts now the structured trend has gained steam "fall is a return to classicism " says donna karan who will be showing a fitted skirtsuit that skims the body and is tapered at the waist marking a sharp contrast to the baggy smocks and flowing oversize blouses she created for spring even diane von furstenberg famous for her trademark wrap dresses says shes showing more structured pieces for fall some in a felt jersey fabric that feels like a stiff doublefaced wool "its straighter much cleaner and the silhouette is a little boxier than it usually is " ms von furstenberg says a retro refinement is reflected too in designers fall color palette of rich colors such as burgundy ms von furstenberg says "beet" will be a significant color in her show sunday afternoon the moment of inspiration "a few months ago i spilled some beet juice and i just thought this is the most beautiful color in the world " she says designer tracy reese says shes planning on showing a series of ensembles done in just deep magenta and black consumers may scratch their heads over why so many designers hit on similar themes at once but industry observers say it isnt that surprising designers often share similar visions in color or patterns in part because many shop for fabrics at the same place the premiere vision fabric show in paris when it comes to trends such as shape mr burke the consultant says similarities can reflect a natural group reaction to a trend in this case a desire to move away from flowing and unstructured looks often too designers get small previews of others collections or pieces in trade publications falls striking shapes are generally good news for retailers as the new looks may inspire shoppers to buy in order to update their wardrobes "we really havent had beautifully tailored garments for quite a while " says michael fink vice president of womens fashion for saks fifth avenue but others warn that silhouettes that are too extreme could be a hard sell last falls bubble shape for example sold well mainly to younger consumers at a lower price point mr burke says it remains to be seen whether american women will embrace the cocoon the shape first appeared just before world war i in the structured rounded dresses of mr poiret balenciaga ushered the shape back in with rounded coats in the s this time around designers are showing more subtle versions than those of the s a modern "cocoon" by designer doo ri chung is done sweater dress style in a soft fabric tommy hilfiger nodding to diors s formal sack style silhouettes will show a cocoon in a chunky cable knit which gives it some of the couture like volume and shape but without the stiffness for some of us cocoons can be forgiving "if you have large hips it camouflages it a bit " says designer carmen marc valvo who will show several cocoon shaped coats and cocktail dresses at his show feb "if youre skinny well everything looks good on you because youre skinny " amy gamber a year old personal shopper and bartender says she is eager to try out the new cocoon silhouette "i would like for us to look more like grown ups again " says ms gamber who lives in austin texas "when youre theres only so much babydoll you can do without looking really silly " when she shows on monday designer nanette lepore will be joining in the egg shape trend she plans to show a tunic in a heavy fabric thats fitted at the bust and flares out into a cocoon shape phillip lim who designs the high end line is offering dresses in the shape of elongated cocoons "theres a strictness in the structure that causes the wearer to walk with a certain pride and elegance " he says designer peter som is showing a tailored collection too but one that is cut to fit much closer to the body in keeping with the more formal mood many of falls new looks tend to be matching outfits signaling a move away from the mixed styles of the "personal dressing" trend "theres not as much of the intentional mismatching where youre putting together all these different items to create a look " says sari sloane vice president for fashion merchandising at boutique chain intermix "this is really about the piece the jacket the dress the blouse "
