dells founder returns as ceo as rollins quits computer firm expects to miss earnings mark stock rises after hours facing a deepening strategic quandary at the personal computer giant he founded more than two decades ago dell inc chairman michael dell took over the role of chief executive at the company replacing kevin rollins his former protege mr dells move to reassert control over the company he transformed from a start up in his college dormitory room into one of the worlds largest pc makers is a sign of the crisis facing dell the round rock texas company known for its business model of selling pcs directly to consumers and business clients over the phone and internet has stalled in the past few years as buying behavior in the pc world has changed drastically mr dells renewed day to day involvement in the business may do little to solve the companys problems at least in the short term in announcing the shake up the company also disclosed it expects its earnings and revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter ending this week to fall short of analysts estimates even so the news which was announced after the close of p m trading on the nasdaq stock market sent dells shares up &# or to &# in after hours business dells reversal has taken place largely since mr dell handed the ceo reins over to mr rollins in mr dell remained chairman of the board a position he will continue to hold in an interview mr dell largely declined to comment on mr rollinss departure mr rollins couldnt be reached "kevin has been a great friend and colleague for many years and made huge contributions for the company during a critical period i felt that it was a critical time for the company and having unified leadership would be the right approach " mr dell said the year old executive added that his role as ceo would be a permanent one and not an interim measure yesterdays management shake up "doesnt change dells problems " said ken smith director of technology research for munder capital management "michael dell or whoever you put in that role i think is going to struggle with the same issues " dells market share has suffered in recent years as customer preferences have changed and competition has intensified much of the recent growth in pc demand has come from consumers buying laptop computers at electronics retailers like circuit city stores inc and best buy co dell which largely focuses on selling desktop computers to businesses has missed out on the boom meanwhile asian rivals like lenovo group ltd of china and acer inc of taiwan have gained ground in the global market and a resurgent hewlett packard co recently surpassed dell to become the worlds largest pc maker in terms of units sold according to some research firms the pc industry remains cutthroat pricing pressure is keen and new products quickly become commodities by helping keep costs low dells direct sales model used to give it a price advantage over competitors such as h p but as h p has restructured and the average selling prices of pcs have plummeted dells aggressive pricing hasnt brought it additional growth the company has since said it is focusing more attention on profits rather than pricing mr dell indicated in yesterdays interview that he didnt plan to change dells strategic model and would stick to selling pcs directly adding that there are opportunities to innovate on the model "dell has always had a strength in its supply chain and i think there is an opportunity to do even better there " he said dell isnt the first pc maker that has struggled after its founder vacated the ceo spot but the track record of the founders who have returned to their old posts has been mixed steve jobs who reassumed the role of ceo at apple inc in the late s following more than a decade as an outsider rejuvenated the cupertino calif company by moving it beyond its computing roots and into the broader market for consumer electronics on the flip side ted waitt the founder of pc maker gateway inc was unable to arrest the companys slide after he returned to the helm there in mr rollinss departure from dell represents a sharp turnabout for the year old executive as recently as late last year mr dell had publicly endorsed him as ceo but under mr rollins dell has faced a growing catalog of problems the computer maker has missed several sales or earnings projections over the past few quarters last year dell also grappled with the recall of several million defective batteries in laptop computers and the company disclosed in august that the securities and exchange commission was looking into its finances while the company has given few details it has said the inquiry is related to "accruals reserves and other balance sheet items " the company delayed reporting its most recent quarterly results attributing the delay to the "complexity" associated with investigations by the sec and the u s attorney for the southern district of new york in recent weeks dell has moved to refresh its executive ranks in december dell said chief financial officer james schneider was resigning and would be replaced with donald carty a dell board member and former chief executive of american airlines parent amr corp dell also said last month that senior vice president john medica would retire in the next few months in the meantime dell has brought in new blood including steve schuckenbrock a former co chief operating officer of electronic data systems corp and executives rick becker and richard conrad from h p mr rollins who first joined dell as a bain &amp co consultant was the architect of the companys rapid growth in the mid s he won mr dells respect by crafting a marketing strategy around individual business units such as health care state and local government education and small businesses these targeted units allowed dell to consistently outshine its competition in the mid to late s they also allowed dell to quickly collapse its accordion like structure when the pc market stalled earlier this decade the company was able to bounce back when a severe downturn forced compaq computer corp and gateway into mergers to survive mr rollins was also known for persuading dell to leave the retail market in arguing that direct sales were more cost effective but mr rollins was also known as a stern and aloof manager early on he was the executive who strictly enforced the dell model of using cost cutting to gain market share and lift profits executives who disagreed with the approach were forced out or left when the pc market slowed down earlier this decade mr rollins drove dell into printers and consumer electronics hoping to show its low cost high velocity model could work in other markets neither move helped reignite dells once rapid growth investors and analysts also say mr rollins made a mistake by not building and selling products with microprocessors from advanced micro devices inc instead sticking solely with intel corp chips the companys loyalty to intel cost it market share in late and the company eventually relented and announced plans in may to begin shipping some products with amd processors executives who clashed with mr rollins felt he was sowing the seeds of dells current problems by forcing out those who championed other approaches they said mr rollins would never be able to adapt to a new business model mr rollins was perceived as lacking the same charisma that mr dell exuded after mr dell first began to distance himself from day to day operations earlier this decade dell went to great lengths to soften mr rollinss image internally a classically trained violinist mr rollins dressed as a cowboy and played "fiddle" music at one company meeting mr dell is known for being a more hands on manager and often walked around dell chatting with employees and popping into product groups according to people familiar with the matter internal dissatisfaction had mounted with mr rollins lately say people familiar with the matter the final straw was the fact dell has been beaten so badly in the marketplace recently by h p "the computer business is the business" for dell "and theyre losing share of the computer business " one knowledgeable individual said this person added that mr dell had no reservations about reassuming the top post in recent weeks mr dell kept his dissatisfaction with mr rollins relatively close to his vest a dell acquaintance who spoke with him last week says he gave no hint of mr rollinss imminent exit now that mr dell has retaken the no spot "the management team will feel more empowered " the acquaintance said mr dell "is more of a motivational leader than kevin " this person added "he will bring a new sense of urgency to the company " in his role as chairman mr dell spearheaded some of the companys newest ventures including its foray into the gaming market with its acquisition of alienware corp last year outside the company he has been involved with the dell family foundation a child health and education charity and with msd capital lp his private equity arm as ceo he is expected to try to fill the post of chief marketing officer dell has sought a marketing chief for nearly three years and seriously wooed three candidates none of those contenders were willing to join dell because the job description "was too nondescript " says another person familiar with the situation dell officials told the prospects "come here well figure it out " but with dell suffering from so many problems mr dell "is going to have to nail things down if he wants to get top people " added another person close to the matter in a further effort to attract new blood dell has hired recruiters spencer stuart to fill the newly created post of head of its global consumer business according to individuals familiar with the situation the search which was approved jointly by mr dell and mr rollins isnt expected to be affected by the ceo switch spencer stuart declined to comment on the assignment chirag vasavada technology analyst for money management firm t rowe price associates inc said that mr dells return as ceo signals to wall street that the company is serious about improving its performance but mr vasavada said that for its stock price to improve the company ultimately needs to increase sales and profits nirav parikh an analyst with los angeles based tcw group inc a dell shareholder added that it was "somewhat obvious that there needed to be some changes at dell " he said mr dell would be closely watched to see if he follows through on his plans for reinvigorating the company "hes been there all along so what he is going to do is more important than just him taking control " gary mcwilliams and don clark contributed to this article
