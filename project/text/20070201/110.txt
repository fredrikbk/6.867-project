taking their best shot vaccine by arthur allen norton pages &# i spent much of my first year of graduate school in doing research at the salk institute for biological studies located on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean in california when i would take an evening break from the lab to watch the sun set into the ocean jonas salk himself would often be standing a few feet away savoring the view we didnt exactly engage in banter salk was not a garrulous man and i was only an awed student but his proximity had a special effect i was one of millions of kids who in grade school had emptied his piggy bank for the march of dimes and received jabs of the salk polio vaccine thereby eluding a disease that had killed or crippled thousands of americans in the generations up to and including my own encouraged in part by salks extraordinary achievement i gravitated toward the study of viruses and vaccines in "vaccine " journalist arthur allen adroitly chronicles the development of the polio vaccine and many others describing the science and serendipity behind each breakthrough and breathing life into the researchers who achieved them he also recounts the changing social status of vaccines the controversies surrounding their early trials the battle for their acceptance and their sometimes undeservedly wobbly reputation in recent years the idea behind a vaccine is simple to stimulate the bodys immune system into building a defense against certain infectious diseases by administering a killed or weakened pathogen or something that mimics it the first great success came in the th century with smallpox in the late th century and early th centuries vaccines helped to prevent diphtheria and yellow fever among other diseases as mr allen shows war played a crucial role for microorganisms the crowding stress wounds and poor nutrition of battlegrounds make fertile breeding grounds during the spanish american war men died of disease for every one killed in battle in world war i the ratio was to keep troops in action governments found it expedient to devote money and intense effort to vaccine development e g the british combating typhoid fever during the boer war and the americans fighting tetanus and meningitis during world war ii it didnt hurt that soldiers had no choice about whether to submit to vaccination as mr allen puts it "they were lined up for their shots and they kept their mouths shut " the militarys successes promoted public trust setting into motion a positive feedback loop "more confidence in medicine meant more confidence in vaccination " mr allen notes and the more vaccines were used "the better they worked " leading to a thriving vaccine market vaccines today are more safe effective and innovative than ever before thanks to gene splicing cell culture and other modern laboratory techniques yet the idea of vaccination has lost its social potency indeed it has fallen under suspicion "in " mr allen observes "despite emerging microbial threats such as west nile virus sars aids and avian flu the public was almost as skeptical of vaccinating its children as it had been a century earlier " how could that be by doing their work so well vaccines induce a feeling of complacency as mr allen explains the great majority of american children no longer come down with the infectious diseases "that shots protect against " paradoxically vaccination is no longer regarded as "an immutable part of life a wholesome and unavoidable rite of passage " it is taken to be an intrusion on personal autonomy something that may not be of acceptably low risk to an individual in short for some vaccination has become optional and even something to be feared with the near disappearance of virulent infectious disease mr allen writes "other diseases of childhood autism juvenile diabetes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder asthma have become more visible " vaccines have even been blamed for them notably the mercury containing vaccine preservative thimerosal has been blamed for autism but as mr allen observes there is no persuasive evidence for this claim he comments wryly that even after thimerosal "was long gone from vaccines people kept discovering that their children were being made autistic by it " little wonder that vaccination rates have dwindled and deadly outbreaks of measles mumps and whooping cough are more common at the same time that vaccination has fallen under a cloud of misplaced suspicion it faces a challenge in the marketplace today the economic value of vaccines to pharmaceutical companies is very low compared with that of therapeutic drugs why so largely because of vaccines low return on investment and high exposure to legal liability the world wide vaccine market estimated at approximately &# billion annually represents only about of the global pharmaceutical market an amount roughly equivalent to the sales of one blockbuster ulcer drug as a result manufacturers have left the business in droves four decades ago there were major companies making vaccines in the u s by only four the government is no help the biggest purchaser of vaccines is the centers for disease control and prevention which demands extortionate discounts from manufacturers meanwhile legislators have not done enough to protect vaccine manufacturers from spurious liability suits and regulators increasingly defensive about charges of inadequately ensuring the safety of the public require excessively large clinical trials the clinical testing of a recently approved vaccine against rotavirus a common sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection in children involved more than children and another plus in post marketing studies in such a climate of adversity the vaccine miracles that mr allen details in his splendid book are ever less likely to recur what is needed is a dose of political courage and a jab of common sense to inform the public ease the regulatory burden and thwart unreasonable rampant litigation bringing about such changes will be i fear about as easy as dragging a child to the doctor for a painful shot dr miller a physician is a fellow at the hoover institution and the author with gregory conko of "the frankenfood myth " see related letter "letters to the editor successful vaccination breeds complacency" wsj feb
