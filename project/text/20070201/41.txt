home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work and family blog is more money worth less time with kids sure money isnt everything but how much influence can a good salary have on parents decisions to work or stay home an email from a reader put the question straight on a first year associate at a big new york law firm with a month old boy the reader said the first months at work have been hard but she noted her firm recently gave raises matching another firm which bumped first year associate salaries by &# to &# she said the money "significantly affected my thinking as to how long i will really stay at this job" and that her first thought was "ok now preschool wont be such a struggle to pay for " in work family decisions money is not optional and many people do not view experiences like preschool as optional either they want these things for their children does salary factor into your work family equation readers say "while i miss my baby girl i have to work to keep a roof over her head not to mention pay for &# k year preschool " "after a few years of this it may be even more difficult to make a different choice because the young associate will be in line for partnership " loving mary poppins its the inherent dilemma of at home child care parents want their child to love their caregiver but not too much we couldnt make it to see the "mary poppins" play on broadway so we rented the movie it reminded us that the affection children have for a caregiver is often fleeting compared with their feelings for mom and dad my daughter once refused to let me take her from our nanny on a friday evening and i was stricken "dont worry " my nanny said "on monday mornings she wants nothing to do with me " comforting comments but are such moments a wake up call that we spend too much time at the office or should we be happy our child and caregiver are close readers say "every time i read your blog it makes me glad that my wife wanted to stay home compared to guilt that my child might bond with a nanny ill take another year driving my toyota " "my daughter would prefer mom any day and thats because even though i work i spend all my not working time with her no guilt no tears no issues " homework for dollars homework might be seen as kids"work" and therefore deserving of compensation yet paying a child to do homework might also send the message that learning is optional if parents want their children to learn that money doesnt grow on trees is paying them for homework the way to go readers say "children need to learn that much of what we do in life is not optional bribery should not be used " "while i see nothing wrong with rewarding a child for doing well in school its important to offer incentives that might last a little longer than money memorable family vacations trips to a movie " bad at staying home last week citigroup inc appointed chief financial officer sallie krawcheck as chairman and chief executive of its global wealth management business a juggle reader pointed us to a june article in cfo magazine where ms krawcheck says she gave up being a stay at home mother because she tried it and found she was "really bad at it " she said she felt no guilt about working to hour weeks "because i stayed home for a while i dont question now whether my family would be better off if i were there " ms krawcheck seems content with her work life choices many experts argue that its not the quantity of time people spend with their children but the quality do you agree readers say "the quality quantity expression is a recent rationalization one cannot schedule which minutes you spend with your children are going to influence them " "there seems to be a conspicuously higher degree of hand wringing because the person who is making the choice in this case is a woman " tv or not tv it was around p m on a sunday when i caved my husband was away for the day and i was enjoying playtime with my daughter but the kitchen floor had started to crunch underfoot and a weeks worth of bills and paperwork lay untouched on my desk so when my daughter asked to watch her beloved curious george i fantasized about all i could do during this uninterrupted time put away laundry start dinner read my novel instead i watched curious george too as soon as i sat down i couldnt get up it was a relief to be still with my daughter snuggled next to me watching the colors flicker on the screen and letting my mind flatline one more minute then ill take out the garbage i thought the episode ended far too soon and i was mad at myself for letting my childs brain turn to mush and not even getting a clean kitchen out of the deal with the demands of children and the office its tempting to size up every moment for its productivity potential but maybe our kids are on to something a little george isnt so bad after all readers say "i think hours of tv per day is probably bad for young brains but the occasional snuggle on the couch watching good stories is great " "we have a month old who hasnt yet seen more than a minute or two of tv he is very social and outgoing and yet has also been known to spend minutes on end watching a ladybug " write thejuggle wsj com
