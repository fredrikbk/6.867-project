googles growth stirs concerns as net and revenue surge efforts to feed expansion could pressure margins google inc is pulling further away from the pack the mountain view calif company said fourth quarter profit nearly tripled largely as a result of improvements in advertising revenue from its core web search business which is far outpacing that of rivals such as yahoo inc and microsoft corp still googles shares fell following the earnings report some analysts raised concerns that rising expenses including to build up new lines of business possibly could hurt future profitability they also said googles results had been expected to be impressive and some investors responded tepidly to the earnings report when it failed to produce any significant surprises strong user traffic to googles web sites and improvements to its search ad systems contributed to a rise in revenue to &# billion from &# billion a year earlier some research firms estimate that googles lead widened in the number of user search queries handled globally in the past year google has made high profile investments in areas such as online video and intensified efforts to broker advertising in print radio and video but the companys fourth quarter results highlighted the continuing importance of its core business of placing small ads alongside web search results that are linked to a users query "what is the key to our success i think its search " said chief executive eric schmidt during a conference call with analysts google said the number of consumer clicks on its ads rose about from a year ago and from the third quarter companies generally only pay google when a consumer clicks on one of their search ads as part of continuing efforts to display ads users are more likely to click on mr schmidt said google was displaying fewer more relevant ads for each search query on average as in the past google incurred significant costs for capital expenses such as building computer data centers to run its services and for payments to partners that carry ads brokered by google sergey brin a google co founder and president of technology said the company paid partners more than &# billion in up from about &# billion in "and this is a figure that we expect is going to increase as we ramp up our video radio and print programs " the company also said the revenue it reported during the quarter was effectively reduced by about &# million related to a promotion for its checkout online payment processing service the service launched last year facilitates payments by consumers to online retailers some analysts cautioned that googles expansion into markets such as internet video and the checkout service could weigh on its profitability "the expense required to enter these markets is quite high pressuring margins " said jordan rohan an analyst at rbc capital markets corp in new york whose firm makes a market in google shares "there will be greater variability in profit margins in than there was in prior years " mr rohan said googles per share profit for the latest quarter fell below his forecasts when certain tax considerations were factored out "the company is plenty profitable " said mr schmidt in an interview "this is an example of where the analysts are over obsessing about something " google reported results after regular trading hours in p m nasdaq stock market composite trading google rose &# to &# in after hours trading google was quoted at &# off rob sanderson internet analyst at american technology research attributed the after hours share decline to a lack of a strong positive surprise for investors google posted net income of &# billion or &# a share up from &# million or &# a share a year earlier excluding certain stock based compensation and other factors google earned &# a share analysts mean consensus forecast was for earnings of &# a share on that basis according to thomson financial some analysts estimated that factoring out additional considerations related to the companys lower than expected tax rate googles per share earnings would have been slightly below &# revenue excluding commissions paid to marketing partners totaled &# billion slightly above analysts estimates of &# billion international operations formed of googles revenue the same as in the previous quarter with google executives highlighting strength in the french and german markets googles staff numbers increased to employees as of dec up from as of sept mr schmidt said google would "eventually do some very significant deals" related to its online video services which include youtube inc the internet video sharing site google purchased in the fall for nearly &# billion people familiar with the matter say google has been in discussions with television and music companies about licensing their video and music for use on its video services and at the same time stave off any copyright lawsuits against google over content uploaded by users without its owners permission the ceo declined to comment on any specific possible deals but said he "wasnt in a great hurry on this issue its more important to get it right " he acknowledged copyright concerns but added "we have answered those by saying were working very hard on fingerprinting technologies " fingerprinting technology might allow google to automatically identify copyrighted audio or video clips in order to remove them or share related ad revenue with content owners though mr schmidt said "its a hard problem " google also acknowledged its strong interest in expanding services for businesses which analysts say could eventually challenge microsofts office applications mr schmidt said it is clear that googles web based spreadsheet and word processing services should become part of the applications it bundles for businesses and other organizations which currently include email instant messaging web page creation and online calendar services he said some businesses might choose to pay for non advertising supported versions of googles web based applications which are generally free otherwise still "on a cost of ownership perspective we will be much much cheaper than any other of the alternatives " he said
