friendly landlord wal mart cuts taxes by paying rent to itself other retailers banks use loophole in rules to lower states levies as the worlds biggest retailer wal mart stores inc pays billions of dollars a year in rent for its stores luckily for wal mart in about states it has been paying most of that rent to itself and then deducting that amount from its state taxes the strategy is complex but the bottom line is simple it has saved wal mart from paying several hundred million dollars in taxes according to court records and a person familiar with the matter and wal mart is far from alone the arrangement takes advantage of a tax loophole that the federal government plugged decades ago but which many states have been slower to catch heres how it works one wal mart subsidiary pays the rent to a real estate investment trust or reit which is entitled to a tax break if it pays its profits out in dividends the reit is owned by another wal mart subsidiary which receives the reits dividends tax free and wal mart gets to deduct the rent from state taxes as a business expense even though the money has stayed within the company partly thanks to sophisticated financial strategies like these states tax collections from companies have been plummeting on average wal mart has paid only about half of the statutory state tax rates for the past decade according to standard &amp poors compustat which collects data from sec filings the so called "captive reit" strategy alone cut wal marts state taxes by about over one four year period now several state regulators are trying to crack down on the strategy used largely by retailers and banks and some other states have changed their laws to try to end the practice yesterday new york gov eliot spitzer included elimination of the loophole as part of his proposed budget a fix he said would bring the state &# million a year north carolina tax authorities are challenging wal mart saying its reit strategy was intended to "distort the companys true net income " according to its filings in the case in superior court in raleigh n c the state calls captive reits a "high priority corporate tax sheltering issue" and in ordered wal mart to pay &# million for back taxes interest and penalties stemming from the reit structure the company paid it and last year sued the state for a refund the structure wal mart is using features some unusual elements because reits must have at least shareholders to gain tax benefits roughly wal mart executives were enlisted to own a combined total of around of the reits shares without any voting rights h lee scott jr now wal marts ceo was listed as the reits "managing trustee" from to a single wal mart real estate official tony fuller represented the company both as tenant and landlord in its lease with itself ernst &amp young llp the accounting firm that sold the strategy to wal mart also is the companys outside auditor in its internal sales training materials the accounting firm explicitly labeled the strategy as a method to reduce taxes a red flag to tax authorities who often demand that tax shelters have other business purposes wal mart attorneys say in court filings that the strategy is perfectly legal and that north carolina is exceeding its authority a spokesman for the bentonville ark company john simley said wal mart "is comfortable with its current structure and is in compliance with federal and state tax laws " he added that the reit structure was adopted to "more effectively and efficiently manage the companys real estate portfolio including the impact on the companys overall state tax planning " regulators in at least a half dozen states are going after companies that have trimmed their taxes through similar arrangements including regions financial corp s amsouth bancorp unit autozone inc of memphis tenn and two units of bank of america corp in a massachusetts case against bank of america unit fleet funding inc authorities call fleets reit arrangement a "sham" in court filings they note that fleet increased the salaries of the roughly employees whom it made reit shareholders to compensate them for personal income taxes stemming from ownership the multistate tax commission an association of state revenue authorities says it has started examining the use of captive reits to avoid taxes alerting states to the issue and proposing legislative fixes to close the loophole states collected more than &# billion last year in corporate income taxes out of &# billion in total state tax receipts according to the nelson a rockefeller institute of government a nonpartisan think tank associated with the state university of new york but the average effective corporate state and local tax rate has dropped from during the s to about during the first half of this decade according to a recent report by the congressional research service this is in part because of the proliferation of state and local tax breaks as well as tax shelters according to several academic and government studies some corporate state tax planners say arrangements like these are merely smart business and that the loopholes exploited by companies should be fixed by state legislatures rather than litigated by state lawyers critics of the shelters complain they let companies use public services provided by local governments such as police and fire protection or new highways without having to shoulder their fair share of the costs meanwhile the portion of state taxes borne by individuals is steadily rising congress created reits in as a way to allow smaller investors to put money in a wide portfolio of commercial real estate spreading their risk congress also gave them a tax benefit reits arent subject to corporate income tax on the profits they pay to shareholders as long as they pay out at least of the profits the shareholders still usually get federally taxed on the dividends which still count as income for them after a boom in reits in the early s big accounting firms including ernst &amp young and kpmg llp figured out that on the state level they could pair the tax break on reit dividends with a separate tax rule that allows companies to receive dividends tax free from their subsidiaries with the reit as a subsidiary itself two rules aimed at avoiding double taxation could be combined to effectively avoid any taxation at all the strategy worked especially well if the reit was owned by a company incorporated and claiming to do all its business in a state such as delaware or nevada that often wouldnt tax the corporate income anyway that created an extra hurdle for other states to challenge the practice if they caught onto it ernst &amp young early on targeted the banking industry as a possible beneficiary of the captive reit strategy like retailers banks have branches in many states and often are liable for lots of state level corporate tax ernst &amp young targeted at least banks some of them its audit clients the sec generally permits that dual role as long as the firms fee isnt contingent on the tax savings according to documents from a internal ernst &amp young sales training meeting reviewed by the wall street journal the accounting firm suggested banks put some of their income producing assets such as a portfolio of mortgages into a reit subsidiary then use the double tax break to "shelter" the income from state taxes the reit would issue a tiny number of non voting shares to bank "officers and directors" to meet the shareholder rule that reit law requires u s banks "pay millions of dollars each year in state and local taxes " read the ernst &amp young presentation to its sales force "the fsi state tax financial product we have developed can significantly reduce or eliminate this heavy tax obligation " one section of the ernst &amp young sales package featured hypothetical questions from clients about the reit shelter and the proposed answers to pass legal muster many corporate tax shelters purport to have additional business purposes behind merely saving taxes ernst &amp young however was blunt about the reason for its proposed strategy "q whats the business purpose "a reduction in state and local taxes "q what if the press gets wind of this and portrays us as a tax cheat "a thats a possibility if you are concerned about possible negative publicity you can counter it by reinvesting the savings in the community " an ernst &amp young spokesman declined to comment on its reit work saying the firm was "prohibited from commenting on client matters " the spokesman said he could not verify the authenticity of the internal sales training documents based on quotes provided by the journal however he said the "limited language communicated in the internal memo does not reflect the quality and nature of the advice we provide to our clients " state authorities have had mixed records so far in pursuing back taxes and penalties in captive reit cases autozone the big auto parts chain won the right to deduct the dividends from its taxes in kentucky but lost a preliminary round in louisiana the hawaii department of taxation won a case involving a reit used by central pacific financial corp a bank holding company amsouth is in litigation with alabama over tax benefits from its reit fleet fundings reit on which the company was advised by kpmg has led massachusetts to seek more than &# million in back taxes interest and penalties bankboston corp is in similar litigation with massachusetts both banks have been acquired by bank of america which declined to comment on the litigation fleets attorneys have said in court papers that its reits were legitimate and the fact that they were partly motivated by tax considerations does not legally undermine their valid business purpose to raise capital they say a kpmg spokeswoman declined to comment on the fleet case but said it had stopped any involvement with "prepackaged tax products" before a agreement it made with the u s justice department over improper tax strategies that also led to the indictment of former kpmg officials its unknown how many disputes have been raised over the strategy used by wal mart and others because such tax disputes are generally not disclosed unless lawsuits are publicly filed or the company reveals them in sec filings wal mart adopted its captive reit structure just as it was unwinding a previous strategy to reduce taxes that states had begun to challenge for the first half of the s the retailer used a so called intangible holdings company structure also used by many other corporations wal mart transferred its trademarks to a subsidiary called wmr inc in delaware which does not tax many forms of corporate income then it paid the subsidiary for the use of the brands that allowed wal mart to deduct those payments from its local income taxes in some states while wmrs income wasnt taxed by delaware several states won challenges to the strategy used by various retailers wal mart settled a dispute over its use of wmr in louisiana the details of the settlement are sealed and lost on the main points of a case in new mexico wal mart merged with wmr in february of and its use as a state tax avoidance vehicle was apparently discontinued according to new mexico court records in the meantime wal mart set up a new vehicle to control its state tax bill captive reits in the summer and fall of delaware corporate records show wal mart created a new hierarchy of subsidiaries a reit called the wal mart real estate business trust a delaware based parent company for the reit called the wal mart property co and wal mart stores east inc parent of the delaware firm wal mart property owned of the reits shares and of the voting shares according to wal mart court filings in north carolina and west virginia the company also set up a similar arrangement for its sams club stores to meet the shareholder threshold required for reits wal mart distributed a minimal amount of nonvoting stock to approximately wal mart employees according to a person familiar with the arrangement the dividend payouts were nominal the structure involved wal marts top executive tier the shareholders were generally executive vice presidents and above david glass then wal marts president and ceo was listed as president of wal mart stores east on the lease agreement and paul carter then a wal mart executive vice president was listed as the president of the reit wal mart began transferring to the reit ownership of the properties the land and buildings for hundreds of its stores in states real estate records show then wal mart stores east signed a year lease agreement with its reit that took effect on jan agreeing to pay a fixed percentage of the stores"gross sales" as rent according to a copy of the arrangement filed in the north carolina case mr fuller the wal mart real estate official is listed as the contact for both the tenant and the landlord the original lease was due to be renewed this week wal mart could deduct from its state taxable income the rent paid by wal mart stores east to the reit the reit paid the majority of its rental earnings to its owner wal mart property co in the form of dividends that companys base in delaware gave it another way to avoid liability for state taxes since some states do require that dividends a reit pays to its corporate owner be taxed as the federal government does the delaware subsidiary then paid the money back to wal mart stores east the same subsidiary that made the payments to the reit to begin with those payments to wal mart stores east werent taxed either because dividends paid to a corporation by a subsidiary normally arent counted as taxable income for the parent company the result of the circuitous transaction wal mart could effectively turn rental payments to itself into state level tax deductions in most of the states where the payments have been made under typical circumstances rent paid to a third party landlord also would reduce taxable income but that would ordinarily be cash out the door like most other tax deductible expenses here the majority of the tax deductible rental payments came straight back to wal mart the national tax savings have been significant over a four year period from to wal mart and sams club paid company controlled reits a total of &# billion that eventually came back to wal mart in states across the country according to a north carolina department of revenue auditors report filed in court by wal mart based on an average state corporate income tax rate of three accounting experts consulted by the wall street journal estimated the reit payments led to a state tax savings for wal mart of roughly &# million over just those four years sec filings show the company paid &# billion in state taxes during that period the loss of federal deductions that bigger state tax payments would have triggered brought the companys effective tax savings overall down to about &# million wal mart declined to comment on the figures it is not clear how much wal mart has paid to its own reits in the most recent five years the yearly rental payments on which the tax savings are based are pegged to the "gross sales" of the stores according to the lease agreement underscoring that the rental payments were cashless wal mart accounting moves an affidavit filed in north carolina by the companys former controller james a walker jr states that the payments were made by simply debiting the account of one subsidiary and then crediting the account of the other "wal mart stores inc served in effect as a bank for" both sides the affidavit stated in after an audit the north carolina department of revenue issued a notice to wal mart challenging the reit structure the state is site of about of the companys roughly u s stores including sams clubs wal mart paid the &# million the state sought and in march sued for a refund the company argues that the state does not have the authority to essentially combine the results of the subsidiary that did business in north carolina with those of the delaware based unit and the reit the delaware based subsidiary the company says did no business in north carolina and therefore was not taxable there the company says in court filings that the reit was qualified under federal law that all the deductions were properly taken and that its north carolina tax returns reflect its "true amount of net income "
