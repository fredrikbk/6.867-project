increased heart risk linked to air pollution study of older women finds danger grows in cities with higher soot levels from autos and power plants breathing common urban air pollution is much more deadly than previously thought according to a major study published in todays new england journal of medicine todays study which followed postmenopausal women for seven years found the added risk of cardiovascular death from living in the most polluted areas including cincinnati and riverside calif was roughly breathing air heavily polluted by soot from automobiles and power plants may raise the risk of death for older women at nearly the same rate as smoking cigarettes the study focused on the most deadly kind of soot known as fine particulate matter which comes from burning fossil fuels like gasoline diesel fuel and coal previous studies had concluded the risk was much lower that research found that soot was responsible for increasing deaths from heart disease and stroke in the most polluted cities by about over the least polluted such as santa fe and honolulu that impact is comparable to the relatively consistent inhalation of second hand smoke that comes from living with a smoker in the new study the approximate increased risk is close to the impact of being an active smoker said c arden pope a professor at brigham young university who played a big role in the two previous major u s soot studies but was not involved in the study published today "its stunning " mr pope said each increase of fine soot levels by micrograms a cubic meter is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death of about for example on average women in nashville tenn where the level was micrograms would have an approximately greater chance of dying from cardiovascular causes than women in honolulu hawaii where the level was five micrograms todays findings may lend more ammunition to those who want the environmental protection agency to lower the legal limit for fine particles in the air said rogene f henderson a pollution expert who heads the agencys outside panel of scientists the current limit was set in at an annual average of micrograms a cubic meter last year ms hendersons panel voted to recommend lowering the limit to to micrograms a cubic meter nevertheless the agencys administrator stephen l johnson announced in october that he wouldnt follow the scientists recommendation to change the standard mr johnson argued at the time that the science wasnt definitive enough to justify a limit below micrograms a cubic meter todays study could shift that balance ms henderson said but it isnt clear when the epa will next revisit the matter the clean air act requires the agency to review and reissue its air quality regulations every five years historically the epa has done so every years an epa spokesman said "its too soon to say" how much weight the agency will give the new findings in reviewing pollution standards but that the study "will be considered as part" of the process the spokesman also noted that the agency did tighten standards for soot levels in a hour period an editorial accompanying the studys publication said that the findings "strongly support" recommendations by ms henderson and other scientists for tightening epa standards the new higher risk estimate may be more accurate than previous studies said mr pope the brigham young professor since researchers now have access to better air quality measurements thanks to stepped up monitoring by states and the epa or it may indicate that soot harms women more than men the findings only included women because the study was part of the &# million womens health initiative that congress launched in only postmenopausal women who didnt already have heart disease were included in the study nobody knows exactly why soot leads to heart disease one possibility is that the tiny particles inflame the lungs which release chemicals into the bloodstream that harm the heart said douglas w dockery a harvard expert who wrote an accompanying editorial the researchers declined to release some additional statistics that werent included in todays new england journal including the actual cardiovascular death risks measured in various cities or at various levels of exposure all of that information eventually will be released said joel d kaufman the university of washington doctor who led the study overall the countrys air has been getting cleaner the total levels of fine particles decreased from to according to the epa roughly of the population still lives in areas above the epas legal limit for the annual average and while soot levels in some historically polluted areas such as southern california and the southeast improved markedly in the past few years other places such as the northeast arent improving the epa says several northeastern states have sued the epa to try to force more stringent regulations saying power plants in the midwest are responsible for their higher levels the epa also regulates several other air pollutants including ozone lead and carbon monoxide but soot and particularly the tiniest particles in soot is "considered to be the worst " said deborah shprentz a consultant who works for the american lung association the world health organization recommends that governments adopt a long term level of micrograms a cubic meter but few if any countries have adopted the whos recommendation says dan greenbaum an expert at the health effects institute in cambridge mass most countries dont even regulate fine particulate matter according to mr greenbaum and others dirty air risk a new study shows that breathing polluted air sharply raises the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease a few highlights older women living in the most polluted cities had about a increased risk of death from heart attack and stroke the danger arose from a type of soot that is generated by burning fossil fuels pittsburgh and riverside calif are among the cities with the highest soot levels
