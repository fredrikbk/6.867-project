weekend journal review television a grim fairy tale abc has been promoting "pushing daisies" p m et wednesdays as a "forensic fairytale " and thats one way of looking at it the series features a modern day prince charming and sleeping beauty who solve crimes with the help of a magical gift and a private detective sidekick only parents be warned "pushing daisies" is more roald dahl than disney and kiddies who go to bed after watching it may well have nightmares about all the dead people theyve seen including a mother and a father who are zapped in the first episode along with a golden retriever the dog at least is later revived for such is the magic possessed by our hero ned lee pace yet like all things that are too good to be true neds power to bring the dead back to life comes at a cost one touch from him is restorative but a second touch kills them again forever plus if he saves any creature that walks or creeps upon the earth he discovers early on another must die in its place this grim premise is partly leavened by enchantment neds adventures unfold for us through the voice of an omniscient narrator with an english accent which provides a comforting link to the way we heard fairytales as children the series is filmed in the story land colors of plastic toys everything is shiny and bright and images seem to have been painted on the screen even neds face like that of his childhood sweetheart charlotte "chuck" charles anna friel exudes a familiar animated light as charming as all that is amid the macabre "pushing daisies" is a show that only a grown up can fully enjoy children wont appreciate its spoofs of contemporary life such as the murderer who uses a bag with a yellow smiley face to suffocate his victim or the woman killed on a cruise ship who is secretly revived by ned and then horrified to see herself a "celebrity of death " immortalized in court tv like coverage as "the lonely tourist " charlotte "chuck" has two aunts who the narrator gently explains are former synchronized swimmers with a love of fine cheese what viewers of all ages will get is the love between ned and his sweetheart sadly they can never touch lest she die instantly the wonder and there are wondrous things that glow out of the dark here comes from seeing each hold his or her own hand pretending that it belongs to the other life" p m wednesdays on nbc is also about second chances in this case for a wrongly convicted cop who has been cleared after years in prison of all the new shows ive watched its also the one im most eager to see again as "life" began last wednesday detective charlie crews damian lewis was back on the force solving crimes and trying to find out who framed him for a triple homicide years earlier hes been paired up with a partner dani reese sarah shah who has demons of her own including a habit of going to bed with strange men she meets in bars and a history of drug abuse the latter makes dani vulnerable to blackmail by higher ups in the department who may have something to hide about the murders that once were blamed on charlie this week charlie discovers more about his old case and also tries to solve a new crime featuring a bride found killed in her honeymoon suite suspects include her combative husband and a jilted suitor but the similarity to dozens of other detecting shows stops there what sets "life" apart what makes it both more creative and compelling than the competition is the character of charlie crews and the performance by damian lewis when we first meet him charlie comes off as quirky like a police version of tvs doctor house hes got an uncanny ability to spot clues and fends off questions with ironic quips those habits do not reflect a fraction of his range however charlie passed the time in prison getting into zen and he likes to spout mellow phrases like "you dont have to understand here to be here " hes also into eating fruit another sign of a man in touch with the nature of the universe so its a surprise and a delight to discover that charlie made enormously wealthy by a settlement after his false conviction has bought himself a giant mansion and has a stream of babes coming in and out of it he also has a fast black bentley which he guns through the streets while eating grapes and intoning "i am not attached to this car i am not attached to this car " also in the bundle of contrasts is charlies emotional package hes standoffish with most people deflecting them with his irony and holding himself apart as a man who has been through the uniquely embittering experience of years behind bars for crimes he didnt commit his tender side is a revelation then as when he bends to comfort a terrified criminal as he lies dying using words a mother might to soothe her fretful child late at night "it was just a bad dream go back to sleep " seeing and sensing so many layers in a tv character is exhilarating this weeks episode concludes with a reminder that "vengeance is a poison meant for others that we end up swallowing ourselves " yet as mr zen strides into a firing range and unleashes a deafening volley of pistol shots the manifestation of his anger is breathtaking and were turned on by revenge nbcs "journeyman" p m mondays has a decent hook each week the otherwise normal san francisco reporter dan vasser kevin mckidd inexplicably finds himself transported back to a period years earlier where he is expected to affect the outcome of a strangers life this device gives us a parallel plot each week there is the question of exactly what dans intervention in the strangers life will accomplish this week while on a plane with his wife katie gretchen egolf he suddenly finds himself airborne in the s delivering a baby whose destiny will be revealed only later there is also the present where dan must deal with the consequences at work and for his marriage of his disappearances although the gimmickry of "journeyman" will be a barrier to some viewers it is fun trying to guess before a clue reveals it precisely exactly when back in time dan has landed todays air travelers for instance will be amused by the reminder of flying in the days before terrorism and no smoking laws while the foul mouthed celebrity chef gordon ramsay was teaching and tormenting american cooks on "hells kitchen " back in the u k he was helping restaurant owners revive their failing eateries on "gordon ramsays kitchen nightmares " but nothing he found in the u k can compare to the horror of the american "kitchen nightmares" now on fox p m wednesdays one presumes that the producers went out of their way for entertainment purposes to find the most vulgar and idiotic owners the most incompetent chefs and the filthiest kitchens they could this week in yet another restaurant on long island whats really frightening is the certain knowledge after seeing this show that mr ramsay has visited only a tiny fraction of establishments where we diners routinely are served germ laden garbage
