politics &amp economics leaders weigh emissions fund developing nations would get assistance upgrading technology washington leaders from the largest developed and developing countries met to try to pave the way for a system to reduce global warming with many pinning hopes on an approach that would help developing nations finance changes needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the two day talks which were organized by president bush and kicked off yesterday are significant because they bring the u s and developing countries such as china brazil and india none of which is required to take cuts under the kyoto protocol into the negotiations the bush administration hopes the talks can provide a foundation for a follow on agreement to the united nations sponsored accord on global warming which expires in the summit aims to set the agenda for talks expected to span the next months james connaughton who heads the white house council on environmental quality said the central theme of the discussion was technology over the long term he said nations are puzzling over "how to get to clean coal fired power generation" and how to develop transportation systems with "near zero emissions " a crucial item on the agenda is a plan to create a multibillion dollar pipeline of investments by industrial nations to help developing countries replace polluting manufacturing and energy facilities with more modern technology that could include nuclear power plants and coal fired generating plants that bury carbon dioxide emissions believed to contribute to global warming the prospect of generating more investments is attractive to china which is expected to soon become the worlds largest co emitter largely because of its dirty coal fired power plants the bush administration believes that using improved technology is the quickest way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while also expanding the market for u s equipment sales in a historic move earlier this month china agreed as part of a revised montreal protocol to a major new reduction of refrigerants that it makes according to u s officials china agreed after hard bargaining to take mandatory cuts because of an enhanced "multilateral fund" that will help it convert refrigeration plants such plants emit a gas that destroys the earths ozone layer and contributes substantially to global warming chinese foreign minister yang jiechi suggested earlier in the week in a speech to the u n that the same approach might be applied to climate change he said existing financings from large industrial nations as part of the kyoto protocol to curb climate change "should be improved so that developing nations can benefit more from them " in their opening remarks at the closed u s state department run meeting yesterday secretary of state condoleezza rice and mr connaughton emphasized the role that modern technology could play in cutting emissions and the need to find ways to finance this as part of a new global agreement mr connaughton said he hoped for an agreement by that would lead to the reduction of of the globes man made carbon emissions by based on emissions several officials at the conference said so called cap and trade emissions reduction programs would be the key to promoting more investments such programs give companies in industrial nations credit against their emissions quotas for investing in carbon dioxide reduction plans in developing countries where emissions can be cut more cheaply "the subject came up repeatedly " said fred krupp president of environmental defense a new york based environmental group he was one of a group of outsiders who testified before the panel of government ministers experts who didnt attend the conference said existing cap and trade systems would have to be expanded veronique bugnion managing director of point carbon as a norwegian company that monitors emissions trading in europe said its existing trading system generates only about &# billion in financing for projects in developing countries "its a leap of faith to think that could pay for a number of nuclear power plants " she said noting that the u s must also develop an emissions trading system to stimulate enough financing for big technology transfers she said most of the participants in the european market are utilities governments and investment banks which have invested so far mainly in ways to curb global warming refrigerants robert stavins a harvard university economist noted that several cap and trade proposals are pending before congress he said their use if linked with the european system could cut the cost of investments needed to reduce global climate change as much as of what they would otherwise be "but the devil is in the details " he said noting that it will take hundreds of billions of dollars and require a "new architecture" to give companies assurance that their investments in developing countries would be safe and productive "i dont believe this architecture can be finalized unless there is activity in the u s that shows we have launched or are about to launch our own cap and trade system " he said david conover counsel to the national commission on energy policy a nonprofit group that helped write one version of the emissions trading plan being considered in the senate said the u s government could develop a separate investment fund to aid purchases by developing nations of u s technology by auctioning off some emissions allowances to industries developing nations are rapidly expanding their co emissions both through industrial activity and the burning down of their forests mr conover said that offering them more financial aid will be critical to luring them into a new global regime once kyoto expires "the issue really gets down to how much time do we have left to combat this " he said referring to the growing evidence of climate change including rising sea levels and more destructive storms
