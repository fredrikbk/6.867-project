weekend journal sports by the numbers does momentum matter as the baseball regular season closes fans of the new york mets are in an unexpected position on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the final national league standings are after wednesday nights games the mets who once led the nl east by seven games were in an eight team dogfight to determine the four nl playoff spots in the al boston red sox fans have been in a similar spot the bosox went from a game lead over the new york yankees to a nail biting duel with them over which team would take the al east title what do these shrinking leads portend for the playoffs surprisingly little first off neither team has suffered a late season collapse both the mets and red sox have played quite well down the stretch through wednesday nights games the red sox had gone since sept but the yankees record has let them gain a little ground and the mets have lost even less ground to the philadelphia phillies in september and while much is often made about late season momentum as a harbinger of playoff success in reality the relationship between the two is small just look at last years playoffs the st louis cardinals limped home with a record from sept through the end of the season including a seven game losing streak between sept and sept it took the cards until the final weekend of the season to clinch the nl central last seasons detroit tigers suffered the fate the red sox have struggled to avoid this season after the tigers led their division since early spring their record from sept on let the minnesota twins overtake them for the al central crown on the last day of the season it was mostly the result of an undue emphasis on the way a team finishes the season that made detroits victory over a new york yankees team that won only two more games in the regular season seem like such an upset heres what it comes down to the playoffs are truly a second season only once since the advent of the wild card has the team with the best regular season mark the yankees won the world series by contrast there have been four wild card world champs the red sox angels and the marlins in and the world series has featured at least one wild card team in seven of the last years including the last five in a row whats behind the success of the wild card teams one possible reason the wild card team enjoys a small edge under the current best of five divisional series playoff format a team that earns at least a split in the opening pair of road games then gets the home field advantage for the next two games when the pressure is really on the result in all best of five series since the beginning of current playoff seeding system in the team with the "home field advantage" has lost of the division series played and of the played from through last season perhaps in an attempt to reverse this trend starting this year major league baseball is allowing the team with the als best record to decide whether or not they want an extra day between the end of the season and the start of their division series this could give the top team an advantage over the wild card winner in setting up its pitching rotation still mets fans can take comfort in the fact that while the teams record may not be as stellar as last year if they get to the playoffs theyll do so with a healthy pitching staff and whatever happens in the al east the red sox know that theres no curse attached to being a wild card team they learned that first hand in
