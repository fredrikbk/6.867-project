digital age means we must care more about space weather a moody middle age star our sun has an explosive temperament power surges that flare from its roiling magnetic fields send outbursts of charged particles radio static and x rays across the million miles to earth with little warning these cosmic tsunamis of energy periodically have disabled commercial satellites overloaded power grid transformers blacked out radio communications and sent space station astronauts scrambling for radiation shelter space weather forecasters are bracing for a new season of intense sunspot activity that could begin by march and peak in and they worry that outages and damage could be even greater this time because the world has become increasingly dependent on wireless and cellular electronic networks we are therefore even more susceptible to these sudden gales of solar wind "we are set up for a nasty surprise " said thomas bogdan director of the federal space environment center in boulder colo the largest of international space weather warning centers "there are going to be impacts on all these services in the next few years " worries about solar storms are as old as the telegraph when th century entrepreneurs first started stringing long distance wires across the u s they discovered that the lines attracted so much electricity during peak solar activity that the system could run without batteries and telegraph operators risked electrocution in a world in which even temporary service outages can pose problems commercial satellite operators are often reluctant to discuss the impact of solar storms on their global networks but technical reports prepared for the u s commerce department after severe solar storms in reveal just how widespread such problems can become a barrage of major solar flares each an interplanetary shotgun blast of charged electrons and protons briefly scrambled computer circuits on more than half of nasas satellites and space probes the charged particles disabled navigation systems inserted spurious commands and disrupted computer memories a few sensors were knocked completely out of commission while others took days to recover the defense department lost control of three surveillance satellites over "high interest areas" for hours while japan permanently lost contact with a &# million earth observation satellite the geomagnetic storms also caused power outages in northern europe and a blackout in sweden they forced u s nuclear power plants to take control room precautions so that the electrical surges wouldnt affect reactor operations forecasters at the boulder facility to be renamed the space weather prediction center next week can offer at best a few hours or minutes warning of solar disturbances to their customers often not enough time to protect vulnerable systems consequences can be as minor as a sudden shower of dropped cellphone calls or as serious as the loss of an expensive satellite said university of colorado physicist daniel baker chairman of a national research council panel evaluating space weathers economic impact with more than satellites in orbit the losses during the most extreme solar storm could run up to &# billion nasa researchers reported this spring in the journal space weather changing travel patterns also add risk to save time and fuel on flights between north america and asia commercial airlines today routinely route planes over the high arctic where the aircraft are especially vulnerable to radio blackouts and radiation bursts in commercial flights took the shortcut over the north pole times the number at the height of the last sunspot season in as the next solar cycle reaches its peak in polar airline traffic is expected to grow to million passengers a year at the height of the solar storms polar flights had almost daily communications blackouts which required that planes be rerouted the federal aviation administration for the first time also warned pilots on polar routes to stay at lower altitudes to avoid slightly higher radiation levels every flight rerouted due to solar radiation or radio blackouts costs airlines up to &# and without sufficient warning airlines must scramble at the last minute to take the necessary precautions passengers may be delayed or miss connections the slightly increased radiation may also pose a health hazard to pregnant women and over the long run to flight crews who regular fly the arctic "an airline passenger going over the pole has to worry " said physicist douglas biesecker chairman of the federal solar cycle forecasting panel until next spring the sun is in a periodic lull even so it can catch forecasters off guard last december cornell university researchers reported the sun unleashed a burst of high frequency radio waves times as powerful as any previously measured strong enough to interfere with global positioning system signals world wide email me at sciencejournal wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com forums
