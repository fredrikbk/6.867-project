commodity forecasting concern this year the prices of illinois corn and soybeans are up and respectively from a year ago kansas wheat is up or more and a growing number of economists and agribusiness executives think the run ups could last as long as a decade raising the cost of all kinds of food in the past such increases have been caused by temporary supply disruptions following a poor harvest farmers would rush to capitalize on higher crop prices by planting more of that crop the next season sending prices back down but the current rally which started a year ago in the corn futures trading pit at the chicago board of trade is different not only have prices remained high but the rally has swept up other commodities such as barley sorghum eggs cheese oats rice peas sunflower and lentils in georgia the nations no poultry producing state slaughterhouses are charging a record wholesale price for three pound chickens up from a year ago whats changed is that powerful new sources of demand are emerging in addition to u s government incentives that encourage businesses to turn corn and soybeans into motor fuel the growing economies of asia and latin america are enabling hundreds of millions of people to spend more on food a growing middle class in these regions is eating more meat and milk which in turn is increasing demand for grain to feed livestock in the u s a beef cow has to eat roughly six pounds of grain to put on a pound of weight and a hog about four pounds the reversal of a long term trend toward lower grain prices could have profound effects on the worlds ability to feed its poor global grain stockpiles are being drawn down to their tightest levels in three decades leaving the world vulnerable to shocks brought on by bad harvests and its far from clear how much more land could be brought into production or to what extent advances in biotechnology might increase crop yields in the future american families which spend of their disposable income on food

half of the worlds hogs now live in china which is importing about of all the soybeans grown in the u s to help fatten its livestock the chinese government caught off guard by a nearly rise in retail pork prices is throwing cash at farmers willing to produce more of the nations most widely consumed meat the prospect for a long boom is riveting economists because the declining real price of grain
