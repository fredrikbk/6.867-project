weekend journal review books the last man of letters edmund wilson literary essays and reviews two volumes s &amp s s &amp s library of america &# each volume since the whole project was his idea it is fitting that edmund wilson now finds himself among the library of americas roster of canonical authors wilson our last great "man of letters " often behaved as though he were personally responsible for lifting the standards of american literary life to european levels in the early s he outlined the idea of reprinting the american classics in a uniform edition along the lines of the french pleiade the idea turned out to be a good one and now wilson finds himself posthumously rewarded with two large volumes containing the first three decades of his literary criticism wilson who was vocal about his distaste for religion did not believe in an afterlife but if he happens right now to be tracking his name on the literary stock exchange he might be pleased about the appearance of these writings until his death in he was a dominant literary figure but the later publication of his private journals starting with "the twenties" and ending with "the sixties " shifted everyones attention to his carefully recorded sexual adventures these amounted to the coldest of appetites working its way through waitresses burlesque dancers and greenwich village waifs a low point or comic highpoint depending on your view is reached when the aging wilson weighs the pros and cons of seducing the wife of his dentist these library of america volumes of his early criticism should restore a great literary reputation they are also a reminder that there was once a time when books really mattered wilson had a taste for good writing he read everything and in elegant conversational essays shared his likes and dislikes with readers of the new republic and the new yorker he is not remembered for any catchphrase like t s eliots "dissociation of sensibility" nor despite his leftist sympathies did he want to be anyones political conscience rather he took each book on its own terms and wrote engagingly about authors that other new york critics would pass over because there was no way of inserting thornton wilder or thomas love peacock into the intellectual agonies of the day in his private life wilson early mastered a perpetual middle age the poet e e cummings a target of his acerbic criticism called him "the man in the iron necktie " but as the early pieces collected in "the shores of light" and reprinted in the first of these volumes show wilson even in his mid s was an impressively mature critic he was quick to spot strong native talents like hemingway and fitzgerald whom he knew at princeton while at the same time bringing to his readers early bulletins about the literary modernism of joyce proust and eliot wilson came of age in an era when there were few living american writers worth reading he loathed the vulgar commercialism of post civil war america but equally abhorred the "genteel tradition" of letters presided over by literary ladies and emaciated brahmins during that period he wrote stephen crane "was a vortex of intensity in a generally stagnant sea " he thought that american vitality and energy were not properly reflected in its literature and called for writers "who successfully use colloquial american for a novel of the highest artistic purpose " fortunately hemingway dos passos and fitzgerald were just beginning their careers and wilson wrote encouraging articles that displayed their own first rate artistry of hemingways "the sun also rises " he writes "the dry sunlight and the green summer landscapes have been invested with a sinister quality which must be new in literature " he also kept tabs on the larger culture producing an essay on woodrow wilson emphasizing the mans messianic priggishness that ranks among the best political journalism written by an american up there with menckens blistering obituary of theodore roosevelt edmund wilson did not live long enough to bother about the "death of the author" announced by french critics like roland barthes this was fortunate because he had a masterly way of connecting an authors work with his biography his superb sketches make even a crabbed reclusive personality like a e houseman seem fascinating an acute literary psychologist wilson writes that dickens is "a conspicuous example of a writer who owes his dramatic scope at least partly to a social maladjustment he seems almost as unstable as dostoyevsky " wilson in fact is famous for just one idea that genius and disease may be inextricably linked in his book "the wound and the bow " he guesses that sophocles classical qualities of balance and logic count as great art "because they master so much savagery and madness " whether writing about greek tragedy or an exotic popinjay like ronald firbank wilson induces in the reader a ravenous appetite to share his favorite books he even makes you want to dig up a copy of emily posts "etiquette " which apparently contains more acute social observation than all but a handful of american novels he almost persuaded me to crack open "finnegans wake " but not quite his summary of joyces vast literary puzzle is so expertly done that i have the happy impression that i may have done so already if wilsons literary enthusiasms are contagious his dislikes are entertaining in the mid s he decided to sample a number of detective novels and wrote a famous piece for the new yorker claiming that the whole genre was a waste of time that he didnt care who killed george ackroyd the article brought in mailbags of protest but wilson stuck to his guns of cummings he writes "one suspects in him an incapacity for putting himself in the place of the person who is going to read him " the stories of john steinbeck "mark precisely the borderline between work that is definitely superior and work that is definitely bad " the now forgotten novelist louis bromfield "by unremitting industry has gradually made his way into the fourth rank where his place is now secure " the most affecting pieces in these two volumes are the memoirs of greenwich village in the s and s of figures like edna st vincent millay and the art critic paul rosenfeld wilson summons up a lost world bounded by macdougal street and irving place with its leisurely drinking and late night literary discussions and bohemians working hard to be free spirits the effect is oddly like that of his literary criticism he makes us nostalgic for a world uncluttered by electronics where the arts of conversation and writing go hand in hand he is among the last great chroniclers of a place he called the republic of letters which has not survived into our digitally enhanced age mr johnston is a writer in new york
