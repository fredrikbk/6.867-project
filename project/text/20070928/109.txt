weekend journal review film kingdom has oil guns sheiks but little depth foxx is hip energetic comedy darjeerling limited misses a turn before "the kingdom" gets going in earnest though earnest is hardly the word for this coldly efficient action thriller the main titles offer a lesson in the history of the middle east and especially saudi arabia where the action is set the lesson brief enough to avoid any risk of education is conveyed mostly by snazzy graphics and cut to the rhythms of a music video essentially its oil sheiks oil alien culture oil shell exxon mobil shaky sheiks and extremist wahabi militants threatening our supplies of oil once the title sequence ends mtv history gives way to hollywood present horror depicted powerfully as only a feature film can do and a fevered response out of formula tv the horror comes almost as quickly as it does in the films spectacular trailer terrorists attack an american compound and kill more than a hundred people including an fbi agent the event seems all too plausible in its evocation of the khobar towers bombing but exactly how does america respond by sending in an a team with csi skills four fbi agents who are given five days to solve the crime actually some of this makes sense within the nonsense context the five day limit has been imposed by the saudis who fearing a perception that theyve lost control would rather not have any americans on the case and the movie which was directed by peter berg makes a stab or clumsy lunge at depicting internecine tensions in washington where the fbis desire to avenge the loss of one of their own is opposed by a weak attorney general and a timid department of state just as quickly however "the kingdom" comes down to a police procedural and one whose procedures prove none too interesting despite the elite quartets fondness for hip chitchat and their extremely earnest efforts to search the crime scene for clues even so jamie foxx makes fleury the groups leader an impressively energetic action hero and you cant blame chris cooper or jennifer garner for the failings of matthew michael carnahans script which gives them little of consequence to do at least until the climax when ms garner makes her mark in a savage sequence that is if nothing else gender neutral as for jason bateman the fourth member of the team he pulls off the dubious stunt of doing very little very badly the films one great distinction is ashraf barhom a fine actor with a worthy well written role as a saudi cop colonel faris al ghazi at first the colonel functions only as the americans minder a dutiful functionary under orders to keep his unwelcome visitors on a short leash but al ghazi defines duty broadly he feels an obligation to the innocent dead as well as to the sheiks and shallow princes he must live with in mr barhoms portrayal the colonel has depth and a sense of tragedy hes the sort of worldly wise survivor who was played in an earlier time by paul henreid or trevor howard when studio films take on political subjects theres inevitable tension between the desire to inform and the obligation to entertain "the kingdom" isnt without political content were reminded in passing that the relationship between the united states and the nation supplying so much of our energy is fraught with problems two thirds of the way through though this elaborate studio film turns wildly and mindlessly explosive with a firefight that starts on a freeway arizona doubling for saudi arabia and carries on and on and on into chaotic urban combat a bizarre coda seeks to put all the killing in some perspective but its dumb enough to make that historical preface seem deep the darjeeling limited at a crucial moment in "the darjeeling limited " much of which plays out on a train trip across india the train takes a wrong turn and gets lost its a funny idea in a loose limbed saga that doesnt lack for them the film directed by wes anderson from a script he wrote with roman coppola and jason schwartzman is full of amusing offbeat notions as well as a few surprises and all sorts of sumptuous visuals the cinematographer was robert yeoman who shot two previous wes anderson films "the royal tenenbaums" and "the life aquatic with steve zissou " yet theres a sense that mr anderson is also temporarily lost or at least stuck en route from precocious success the ineffable "bottle rocket " the inimitable "rushmore" to artistic maturity his latest comedy tracks the physical and spiritual journey of three brothers who havent spoken to one another for a year theyre played by owen wilson adrien brody and mr schwartzman what moves the brothers whether they acknowledge it or not is a yearning to grow up and pull themselves together both as individuals and members of a family having recently lost their father theyre on a mission to find their mother a crypto hippie dropout played with spirit by anjelica huston these are subjects mr anderson has explored before in his stories of extended adolescence and dysfunctional families but his variations on familiar themes arent the problem its the familiar style and tone he deploys in their service mr wilsons francis a control freak who lost control in a near death experience is yet another riff on his dignan the blithe bumbler of "bottle rocket " and the film as a whole operates in mr andersons patented semi precious zone of antic and droll its not as if the filmmaker has gone off the rails hes just not solidly on them feast of love feast of love" is slim pickings even though it was adapted

of the screen version set in an oregon town where everyone knows everyone elses business is a celebration of love in many forms enlivened by the celebrants foibles what passes for the movies reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst a cupid governed "crash" plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by mr freemans character who serves as the towns coffee shop philosopher at one point he
