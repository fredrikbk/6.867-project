weekend journal review theater little old serial killers arsenic and old lace centerstage n calvert st baltimore &# &# closes oct the dining room keen company clurman theatre theatre row w nd st new york &# extended through oct baltimore whats so funny about mass murder nothing unless you happen to be watching a performance of "arsenic and old lace " whose principal characters have piled up two dozen corpses between them with no about to quaff a glass of elderberry wine laced with arsenic strychnine and cyanide as the curtain falls the phenomenal durability of joseph kesselrings only successful play is a matter of record it opened on broadway in ran for performances was filmed by frank capra and has since become gods gift or rather satans to community theaters and amateur actors but it tends not to get done by first class companies nowadays and so centerstages crisp well cast revival is something of a revelation i knew "arsenic and old lace" was funny but i didnt know it was this funny anyone who doesnt shatter a rib laughing at centerstages production is well dead i confess however to being utterly puzzled by the fact that one of the best made american farces of the th century should have featured a pair of gray headed maiden aunts who consider it an act of charity to poison lonely old men who come to their brooklyn abode hoping to rent a room "why what weve been doing is a mercy " says aunt martha tana hicken to mortimer brewster ian kahn her horrified nephew and the audience instantly and inexplicably goes wild nor does anyone hesitate to chortle at the other brewster nephews one of whom thinks hes teddy roosevelt and the other of whom is a serial killer who likes to torture his victims before stashing their remains in the nearest window seat no doubt some twice tenured scholar has written a paper explaining how kesselring and his unacknowledged collaborators producers howard lindsay and russel crouse managed to wring guffaws out of such monstrosities but im damned if i can figure out what makes the rest of us myself included laugh at them all i know is that a production of "arsenic and old lace" whose director enforces the iron rule of farce all the actors must behave as though everything that happens to them on stage is deadly serious cannot fail to make its comic effect unlike frank capra who mistakenly let cary grant mug his way through the film version of "arsenic and old lace " irene lewis has kept her entire cast as straight as a stick and the results are gratifying in the extreme ms hicken and pamela payton wright couldnt be better as the murderous little old ladies john ahlin looks more like william howard taft than teddy roosevelt while john campion who plays mortimers bloodthirsty cousin looks nothing like boris karloff hes supposed to its one of the plays running jokes both men more than make up for their physical deficiencies with deft comic acting though while everybody else is right on the mark especially brynn omalley who plays mortimers fiancee a wisecracking preachers daughter who longs to sneak off and make a little whoopee with her boyfriend tony straigess set the living room of a quaintly decorated two story house in deepest brooklyn is so real that you can all but smell the sachet one macabre touch has been thrown in for good measure hes installed five th century headstones in the orchestra pit im pleased to report by the way that ms lewis has not tampered with kesselrings script that was one of the countless things wrong with the inept tv version of "arsenic and old lace" in which lillian gish and helen hayes played martha and abby it was pointlessly updated to what was then the present day centerstages revival by contrast takes place in just as it should new york of all a r gurneys studies of life among the wasps of northeastern america the best might just be "the dining room " whose off broadway premiere put him on the map "the dining room" is celebrating its th birthday this season and the keen company has marked the occasion with a very fine theatre row revival that makes the strongest possible case for a theatrical craftsman who doesnt get nearly enough respect inspired by thornton wilders "the long christmas dinner " "the dining room" takes place according to mr gurney in "a dining room or rather many dining rooms " the play consists of a series of cunningly dovetailed dramatic vignettes in which the author explores his preferred theme the postwar erosion of upper middle class self confidence with the utmost skill and variety the six actors in the cast play a total of roles so many that the "characters" in "the dining room" come across not so much as individuals as deftly sketched archetypes most of the playlets are comic but the overall effect is intensely elegiac in large part because of mr gurneys mixed feelings about the lost world that spawned him he knows its limitations but he also appreciates its virtues and it is this honest ambiguity that makes "the dining room" so involving the keen company specializes in performing "sincere" plays "we believe that theater is at its most powerful when texts and productions are generous in spirit and provoke identification " as a mission statement that strikes me as a bit po faced but there is nothing stiff or staid about this production directed and designed with discreet skill by jonathan silverstein and dana moran williams &# the women are a bit better than the men i was especially taken with claire lautier but no one lets the side down it is a lovely piece of work and i wholeheartedly commend it to your attention i note with pleasure that lynn nottage the author of "crumbs from the table of joy " "fabulation " and "intimate apparel " has received a macarthur foundation "genius grant" fellowship ms nottage one of our finest playwrights is eminently deserving of the &# prize and the acclaim that goes with it may she continue to prosper
