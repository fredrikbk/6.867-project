at&amp t again is calling overseas ceo takes firm on a new course for purchases seeking deal in india at&amp t inc retreated from its overseas operations in recent years as it went on an acquisition binge in the u s the phone company in its past incarnations left belgium and south africa after enduring headaches from unstable currencies and governments as well as the hassles of being a minority stakeholder in its partnerships now at&amp ts new chief executive officer randall stephenson is reversing course he is setting his sights on acquiring companies abroad and offering telecommunications services across the globe to consumers as well as businesses it marks a new era for what is the worlds largest telecom company by revenue and market capitalization thanks to mergers since at&amp ts u s acquisition phase which was led by former ceo edward whitacre appears to be mostly over for now mr stephenson who started his telecom career loading data tapes for phone company billing systems sees major growth opportunities outside the u s largely in emerging markets where demand for wireless service is exploding multinational corporations need advanced data and voice services and in some cases regulations are becoming more friendly to foreign investors for now the company is focusing on india which analysts expect will have million cellphone subscribers by the end of the decade more than double the current number in july after barely a month as ceo mr stephenson and his chief deal maker traveled to india to lobby regulators to allow at&amp t to bid on third generation wireless spectrum the company also has been looking for a wireless acquisition in india people familiar with the situation say as well as to significantly expand its internet and phone services to businesses "i need multibillion dollar revenue streams to move the needle and i view this as a multibillion dollar revenue opportunity " mr stephenson said in an interview "everything is here for us to do well " many competitors have a head start in india and are trying to jump into other attractive developing markets as well mexico based america movil sa owned by billionaire carlos slim is focusing on latin america indias vsnl ltd is ramping up its overseas efforts with a new global management committee and hopes of being part of a plan to lay new cables between india and europe and elsewhere in asia vodafone plc of the united kingdom late last year bought a stake in indian wireless carrier hutchison essar ltd while at&amp t was consumed with sealing its deal to buy bellsouth corp hutchison "was a smart deal " says mr stephenson "but we had a bunch of other noise in the pipeline " at&amp t also is focusing resources on china vietnam saudi arabia and kuwait to help ship data and phone traffic for u s multinational companies mr stephenson also is seeking partnerships in dubai and plans to bid on wireless spectrum in a coming auction in qatar he and his team of executives made stops in both countries on the way to india as regional phone giant sbc communications inc before the at&amp t acquisition and name change the company saw its international holdings merely as investments that would boost profits for dividends to shareholders and to help finance the takeover of the old at&amp t corp and bellsouth corp but now mr stephenson wants to run companies outside the u s and serve consumers and businesses abroad by obtaining controlling stakes he has more tools like sales operations and infrastructure to tap consumer markets because the former at&amp t corp already offered business services in many of those places across the globe the dicey politics of dealing with foreign governments varying regulatory schemes and fluctuating economies abroad in the past prompted a major exodus from international ventures at&amp t once had a minority stake in a wireless company in india but divested itself of it in to help finance other acquisitions that company idea cellular now has a market capitalization of about &# billion at&amp ts new international strategy already has proved challenging as the companys experience in italy shows as mr stephenson was preparing to take the reins of at&amp t this spring the company tried to buy a stake in the holding company for telecom italia spa u s phone companies in the past ran into problems because they entered foreign markets where countries were just beginning to privatize telecommunications sbc sold its stake in a joint venture with south africas telkom sa other phone companies including verizon communications inc also pulled back from overseas dealings in recent years now at&amp t is plunging into india last november indian regulators loosened rules for foreign investors at&amp t quickly filed an application and struck a deal to form a partnership with local phone company telecom mahindra ahead of bt group plc and verizon which has yet to secure a license at&amp ts salespeople have used the head start to snap up nearly every major india based multinational as a customer at&amp t recently took over two indian data processing and software developers sterling commerce and usinternetworking and is using them to help offer more services to multinationals at&amp t is spending millions to install gear in numerous indian cities to boost the amount of data it can ship to and from the country and to show that it is serious about making a stamp on the indian market the company is about to open a local headquarters in new delhi unveiling a large at&amp t logo on the building it is only the second piece of property to show off the corporate name outside the u s at&amp t says mr stephenson views at&amp ts wireless operation as the heart of the company but pursuing this strategy in india wont be easy at&amp t would be at a disadvantage offering new services against established local providers and because most wireless companies are family controlled buying one would be quite expensive but the profit potential is huge considering indias growing consumer market while indian consumers are accustomed to low prices a market already exists for devices as expensive as the &# iphone the apple inc device that at&amp t rolled out in the u s "you cant look at the market and not get excited " mr stephenson says
