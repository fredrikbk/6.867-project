romney lambastes hillarycare but his own plan has problems in regard to mitt romneys sept editorial page commentary "where hillarycare goes wrong" free market health analysts welcome mitt romneys views thank him for returning to sanity with his national health proposal and join him in his critique of hillary clintons big government health care plan what we cant do is stomach his self serving rewrite of the massachusetts health reform mr romney along with sen ted kennedy blazed the bipartisan path on which hillary walks with her individual mandate mr romney says he didnt increase taxes or spending for his plan but this is certainly wrong health spending has increased in massachusetts and will continue to do so due to his building of a bureaucracy and the expansion of taxpayer funded care he takes credit for lowering premiums by as much as yet this is certainly not a statewide average massachusetts still has the highest per capita health spending in the nation the plans are deemed so unaffordable that of uninsured people will not be forced to comply expected premiums are set as high as of a persons income and thats before co pays and deductibles and what may i ask is a government mandate to purchase something or pay a fine if not a tax the list of mischaracterizations goes on and on the new bureaucracy has not deregulated the market but set new regulations on plan designs mr romney himself signed a new individual mandate after signing the law and so far despite the mandate only people have actually purchased the non subsidized insurance by way of contrast have signed up for the completely free that is taxpayer funded option theres a good reason why mr romney didnt roll out his massachusetts plan to the nation being based on mandates new bureaucracy increased regulation and wishful thinking it looks a lot like hillary clintons thats not healthy for anyone sally c pipes president and ceo pacific research institute san francisco mr romney is correct in stating that hillarys health care plan would raise taxes and be antithetical to the "free market" approach however he and other gop candidates who blather about the "free market" apparently believe that no one notices that they support billions in ethanol and agricultural and oil subsidies the president also laid into hillary with the same arguments in his news conference and hes the one who has never vetoed a spending bill and forgot about the "free market" when promoting ethanol and oil subsidies do "conservatives" believe that no taxes are paid in support of the above subsidies dov menkes fullerton calif so mr romney feels we should permit our states to create their own universal health care plans for their citizens what a terrible idea those of us who have been in the health care business as i have for over years know the beauracratic nightmare that will be created by putting the creation of universal health care plans in the hands of state legislatures to be implemented by state insurance departments mr romney states that "it sen clintons plan ignores significant differences between people and the needs of the different states " nonsense there should be no difference in the level and type of care given to people regardless of the state in which they reside certainly the only differences will be in the cost of care and thats a function of locality its naive of mr romney to suggest that proper health care coverage for all americans could be implemented without the presence of the federal government in some capacity paul s bunkin turnersville n j in may economist and nobel laureate milton friedman explained to hillsdale college president larry arnn "we have a socialist communist system of distributing medical care instead of letting people hire their own physicians and pay them no one pays his or her own medical bills instead theres a third party payment system nobody is happy physicians dont like it patients dont like it why because none of them are responsible for themselves you no longer have a situation in which a patient chooses a physician receives a service gets charged and pays for it there is no direct relation between the patient and the physician the physician is an employee of an insurance company or an employee of the government today a third party pays the bills as a result no one who visits the doctor asks what the charge is going to be somebody else is going to take care of that the end result is third party payment and worst of all third party treatment " sen clinton goes wrong by making physicians employees of the government but mr romney goes wrong by making physicians employees of insurance companies both could do right by making physicians employees of their patients this could be done by making health care payments tax deductible for all citizens especially those who want to be responsible and pay their own non catastrophic health care bills a policy that encourages citizens to pay their own bills for non catastrophic services rather than rely on insurance companies to process claims for many routine services is the true american way sue a blevins president institute for health freedom washington
