cocktails and distributed sledgehammers at about a m during one bash mr la fleur noticed that a piece of drywall had been hung backwards partygoer scott jackson who owned up to the mistake mentioned

party jessica banis a video editor from bourne mass sent invitations modeled after work permits to about friends they said "permit is void if permit holder or friends do not get drunk and disorderly "

guests and hosts say its generally understood that mistakes are bound to happen and when they do theres really no need for an elaborate apology "i just thought this is the cost of free labor " says
