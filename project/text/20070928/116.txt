weekend journal theater broadway forecast lots of drama little dancing producers bet on plays despite musicals draw falls lineup to musicals are the biggest moneymakers on broadway while "straight" plays have a harder time luring the important tourist trade so why is broadway rolling out a dozen new plays this fall but just two song and dance productions it all comes down to the economic realities of broadway and the sometimes altruistic impulses of theater investors since four out of five shows fail producers can limit their potential losses by putting on plays which cost much less than musicals yet many show backers say they take as much satisfaction from theaters creative process as from any profit potential a process they find especially keen with straight plays "i think the language and ideas of straight plays are extraordinarily important " says producer jeffrey richards who likens the often money losing nature of theater investing to being "a patron of the arts " among plays mr richards is helping produce this fall are a revival of harold pinters "the homecoming" and a new show called "august osage county " michael david another veteran broadway producer says show investors may get "spiritual bonuses" by spending disposable income on serious plays "people buy big boats and cars i dont understand that " mr david says his company dodger properties is one of the producers behind a new aaron sorkin play "the farnsworth invention " about the pioneers of television working against all shows are rising costs &# million to &# million for most plays and &# million to &# million for musicals according to producers those figures are up over for plays and for musicals from the season based on figures for that season from the league of american theatres and producers another hurdle most straight plays cant lock in more than a few months time in a theater because of the logjam of shows on thriving broadway and the hit musicals that have taken over theaters for years on end that means plays often cant put on enough performances to earn back their investment let alone make a profit even plays that win raves from critics and seem topical such as last springs war is hell saga "journeys end " can end up flops but all that hasnt stopped producers from scheduling eight plays to open in commercial broadway theaters by christmas plus four plays by nonprofit broadway theaters compared with just two commercial musicals the fewest musical openings for a fall season since by contrast nine of the shows that opened in commercial broadway theaters last fall were musicals musical fans this fall will have to make do with disney theatrical productions latest cartoon to stage show "the little mermaid " and mel brookss much awaited "young frankenstein " despite their lower budgets straight plays often can attract big name talent this falls "cyrano de bergerac" will star kevin kline in the title role while jennifer garner best known for tvs "alias " will make her broadway debut as the shows roxane f murray abraham will star in the new comedy "mauritius " and ian mc shane of hbos "deadwood " will appear in mr pinters "the homecoming "
