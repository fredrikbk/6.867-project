weekend journal books roth says goodbye nathan nathan zuckerman the main character of nine philip roth books and some say the authors alter ego is leaving the building he makes what mr roth promises will be his final appearance in "exit ghost " the novelists latest offering which is in bookstores now mr roth years old recently reflected on his body of work wsj were the zuckerman books conceived as a series philip roth they came one at a time you can never foresee nine books and i didnt foresee the ninth when id written the eighth each book was a separate enterprise the first one was "the ghost writer " and i think that came out in so in i was in my s i have to remind you that when i began i didnt have any idea for anything but one i was just writing "the ghost writer " i couldnt dream that in the year that i would still be with this guy so it was just a new book i didnt know i had a future with it with any character youre looking to find your freedom so that youve got freedom of invention and if the character gives you that great so i think that i did then write the next three zuckerman books in a row because the character gave me the opportunity to be free about a world i knew wsj did the character of zuckerman as a kind of literary alter ego allow you to explore the literary world and literary legacy pr i know the world in which he moves hes a literary adventurer really and i feel pretty sure about the background and the foreground when im dealing with this character this is the ninth book and i think ive written altogether books every third book has been a zuckerman book which would lead you to believe that i feel very secure in writing about his world wsj is it correct to read "exit ghost" as a novel that concerns a writers literary legacy pr it is one of the things that its about clearly zuckermans entanglement with would be lonoff biographer kliman is all about that amys entanglement with lonoff shes the late writers mistress is all about that so yes thats a strong element in this book what happens is impetuosity takes over and leads zuckerman astray though in the beginning he doesnt think hes being led astray he thinks hes being led back a little ways back into a world he once inhabited and hes overwhelmed by the emotional demands of that world hes not the man he was age has changed him aging has changed him one of the subjects is of course aging and what it does hes also discovered that hes not up to the emotional challenges and to put it very simply hes not the man he was wsj zuckerman has been isolated from the world for a time at the beginning of the novel and he comments on the prevalence of cellphones everywhere pr i tried to figure out what he would notice that would make an impact on him after years away and i realized that for anyone whod been away for that length of time the cellphone would be mystifying really wsj have you reread any of the books to keep in mind what youve done in earlier ones pr i havent reread the books i rarely reread my own books i did when i finished the final draft of "exit ghost " i did reread "the ghost writer " i didnt beforehand because i didnt want to be limited by anything in it but i did at the end to make sure i got certain facts and details correct i havent sat down and reread from one to nine through i dont know what that would be like i dont know what kind of universe it makes a friend of mine ross miller also the editor of the library of america editions of roths work a fellow who is doing my biography told me that he recently read the nine books through and there was a kind of uncanny coherence to them but as i said i have a problem rereading books of mine wsj did you reread anything in light of the library of america reissuing your books pr i look at the footnotes the editors come up with im curious about those but no i dont reread them its just strange youre so passionate about a book while youre writing it and it means everything to you and then when its finished and published you just wash your hands of it thomas mann after he wrote "dr faustus" told someone who was speaking to him about music "i dont know anything about it " he said "as soon as im finished a book i shed all my knowledge of the world of the book " and i think that may be a common reaction wsj is this the last zuckerman book you never know pr youre right that you never know i mean it to be the last book for now the ending is constructed in that way i think im finished with this
