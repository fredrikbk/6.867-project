democrats and iran kudos to hillary clinton yes you read that right for her senate vote this week urging the u s to designate irans islamic revolutionary guards corps as a foreign terrorist organization thats more than can be said for her primary competition of barack obama chris dodd bill richardson and john edwards who assailed her on this score at wednesdays democratic presidential candidates debate at dartmouth these are men who seem to fear the netroots more than the mullahs mrs clintons vote was on a symbolic amendment offered by connecticut maverick joe lieberman and republicans jon kyl and norm coleman after marshaling the evidence of irans terrorist activities in iraq the amendment stated that "it is a critical national interest of the united states to prevent iran from turning shia militia into a hezbollah like force that could serve its interests inside iraq " twenty one democrats including joe biden and john kerry apparently found this too shocking to support and voted nay as did republicans chuck hagel and dick lugar we probably shouldnt complain when senators including a majority of democrats show some foreign policy sense still its telling that the democrats only agreed to the amendment after demanding that its language be edited to remove a statement that "it should be the policy of the united states to stop inside iraq the violent activities and destabilizing influence" of iran also left on the cutting room floor under democratic duress was a call "to support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of united states national power in iraq" with respect to iran and its proxies the mullahs are supplying the shaped explosive charges to shiite militias that are killing or maiming americas in iraq but these senators are afraid even to suggest that the u s might use some kind of military force to save the lives of american soldiers and they want to be commander in chief at dartmouth mrs clinton defended her vote by noting that it "gives us the options to be able to impose sanctions on the primary leaders to try to begin to put some teeth into all this talk about dealing with iran " thats right with americans having just had a close encounter of the third kind with mahmoud ahmadinejad its no surprise that her relative hawkishness is only widening her primary lead
