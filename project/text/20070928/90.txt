primeval folklore researchers say an ancient stone tool found on a polynesian atoll probably came from hawaii nearly miles away ben finney reports in science supporting legends that stone age seafarers settled the islands near tahiti well before the first european explorers reached them unwilling to believe primitive islanders capable of such feats the europeans surmised that the islands were formerly mountaintops on continents that were later submerged and the islanders were the survivors in the late s after british explorer captain cook found similarities between tahitian words and speech on islands far to the west he gave more credence to tales of long ago navigators riding seasonal spells of westerly winds on distant ocean voyages over the past century scientists have tried to trace the migratory paths suggested by polynesian oral traditions with mixed success the latest attempt by researchers kenneth d collerson and marshall i weisler involved analyzing with trace elements and isotopes basalt adzes or wood shaping tools discovered on east polynesian atolls about years ago to determine their origin the composition of the basalt from of the adzes could be traced to islands in the area but one adze comprises hawaiite from the kahoolawe island of hawaii mr finney says such chemical sourcing used with other approaches such as dna analysis promises fresh discoveries for instance "a bone of a polynesian chicken excavated in chile has recently provided archaeological support for polynesians having reached south america in pre columbian times " thus the link thor heyerdahl long claimed between those ancient societies probably existed although it was likely the polynesians not the south americans who crossed the waves to establish it in an interview mr finney says heyerdahl famous for his kon tiki raft expedition had a "false paradigm " because he believed pre columbian explorers couldnt have sailed against global trade winds heyerdahl didnt take into account seasonal variations science sept philanthropy chinas newest millionaires revive charitable giving charitable giving is re emerging in china having been reviled for decades as a symbol of elitist wealth reports ian wilhelm in the chronicle of philanthropy the new millionaires emerging from the nations economic growth are developing a taste for philanthropy and the government is making

while foreign charities are officially banned from soliciting charitable donations in mainland china some large u s nonprofits are sniffing out ways to catch the new philanthropists money the university of california for example has established a fund raising arm in hong kong which operates under different laws from the mainland however foreign charities need to tread carefully around chinas different approaches to philanthropy the government is wary of giving too much financial and political independence to nonprofits even if it has gingerly embraced them as a way to fight the nations widespread poverty about of chinese people live on less than &# a day mr wilhelm says there are about nonprofit groups in china although he says estimates run as high as two million nonprofits operate under a degree of government control they have to be sponsored by a government agency to apply for nonprofit status a requirement that often serves as a barrier to official recognition the largest nonprofits are also often run by retired government officials philanthropy can also attract suspicion in china there is little information about nonprofits and a perception that donations are sometimes bribes to government employees or ways for the wealthy to pursue business interests the chronicle of philanthropy sept latin america sao paulos medics take to two wheels to save lives with
