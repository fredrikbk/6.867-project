in the standings none looks more fearsome today than the colorado rockies theyve won straight moved to two games back in the nl west and one game back of the san diego padres in the wild card race and the rockies could move past nl west leading arizona with a weekend sweep in denver they also have the leagues best runs margin theyve outscored opponents by runs and believe it or not its best era since may colorados offensive sparkplugs are well known dave krieger writes in the rocky mountain news "but colorados remarkable run in baseballs second half also has been built much more surprisingly on a largely unknown pitching staff that came together after three fifths of the rotation was lost in late july and early august " mr krieger writes "and in particular the much maligned bullpen " like that bullpen first baseman todd helton has redeemed his reputation during the rockies improbable run to the postseason "a denver baseball hero who was abandoned by many longtime fans dissed as washed up and nearly dumped by the teams brain trust in a trade has come back swinging " mark kiszla writes in the denver post mr kiszla paints the picture of a lifelong rockie who at age is a clubhouse leader beloved by his younger teammates but estranged from management the rockies now have the identical record as the new york mets and philadelphia phillies two teams tied for first in the nl east after the mets lost their fourth straight and th in games last night "the mets have three games left in their season and amid the quiet of the clubhouse last night there remained the faint plaintive wail of hope insisting that all is not lost " mike vaccaro writes in the new york post "you can understand there were probably some lonely voices at mondale headquarters back in the day insisting things would turn around once the west coast returns started coming in " a four way tie between new york philadelphia san diego and colorado or arizona remains possible mlb coms mychael urban breaks down tiebreaker scenarios to help fans stay on top of "this thoroughly enjoyable logjam " at the other end of the nl standings san francisco giants fans have said goodbye to barry bonds "what a scene that was wednesday night " mark purdy writes in the san jose mercury news "after the last out the team played a moving video tribute to bonds on the center field scoreboard owner peter magowan could be seen wiping away tears the paying customers were cheering their barry love and the man himself was already out the door far away and gone the fans were apparently not worthy enough to have him stay and hear their applause they applauded anyway " bonds isnt saying goodbye to baseball new york sun columnist tim marchman says that the slugger remains one of the sports best hitters and will likely maintain that status next year at age "some team will sign bonds for next year and theyll be in for a circus especially if bonds is indicted for tax evasion or perjury after this season as many suspect he will be " mr marchman writes "this team will also be doing about as much for their pennant hopes as any team in baseball " the u s has suffered an ugly semifinal shutout loss for the second straight time in the womens world cup in germany blanked the americans and went on to win the tournament on thursday morning brazil routed the u s to advance to the final against germany a controversial last minute goalie switch may have backfired on u s coach greg ryan but when a soccer team loses by four goals there is more than one cause "almost everything that could have gone wrong did " the new york timess jere longman writes about the "stunning exit " "the united states again struggled to possess the ball against a technically superior team set pieces were unproductive left with no service abby wambach and heather oreilly were all but invisible at forward the defense was porous clumsy and frantic even before boxx was sent off " u s golfers built a to lead in the presidents cup yesterday but golf writers were focusing on that lone half point for the international non u s non europe team u s captain jack nicklaus suggested strongly to phil mickelson that he concede a non gimme putt to vijay singh to halve their match and give canadian mike weir who was playing with mr singh a tie before the ile bizard quebec fans toronto star columnist dave perkins says mr singh should have had to take that inch putt after half jokingly saying "phil who " during a press conference "he and mickelson have had issues in the past most publicly when singh called out mickelson for spiking up the greens at augusta which he clearly did and does " mr perkins writes "there are those deep within golf who say always off the record that particular confrontation included singh holding mickelson up against a locker before cooler heads intervened either way the two nudges at mickelson were what passes in golf for trash talking and if anyone deserved to not have his half point handed away without a fight it was phil " before reading ahead if you havent seen oklahoma state coach mike gundys already famous tirade against a columnist for criticizing one of his players watch it here and read the column that prompted it here and a follow up here washington post columnist sally jenkins says mr gundy is just one of several sports figures to act unprofessionally of late "all across television screens and sports pages athletes and coaches completely lost their rudders in public " ms jenkins writes all these rudderless men have failed to recognize that "the ultimate price of irrational behavior is that its self defeating " sportslines gregg doyel makes that same argument about mr gundy arguing that his rant cast still more unwanted attention on the player he was trying to shield lexington herald leader columnist mark story agrees that "gundys reaction was wildly over the top embarrassing and unprofessional " but then he goes on to examine mr gundys underlying point that college kids shouldnt be the target of vitriolic media criticism mr story surveys his colleagues then shares his own policy "my line is drawn short of all out personal criticism because college players are young and not fully mature adults its not because they arent technically pros though the ncaa is loath to acknowledge it the fact is big time college athletics are semi professional sports " what does your body type have to say about sports success perhaps more than you think writes gina kolata in the new york times "the rules of physics say that distance cycling and distance running are for small people rowing and swimming are for people who are big the physics is so exact that when dr niels h secher tried to predict how fast competitive rowers could go based only on their sizes and the weights of their boats he was accurate to within percent " on the subject of the science of sport los angeles daily news columnist tom hoffarth is bullish on the new fox
