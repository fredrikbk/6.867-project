clogged arteries why even sunny days can ground airplanes flight got stuck on a congested route a legacy of the s on aug a sunny day in fort lauderdale fla delta air lines inc s flight pushed back from the gate on schedule awaiting clearance for its p m takeoff to new yorks john f kennedy international airport the weather was cloudless in new york too but for the next three and a half hours the aircraft with passengers sat on the ground taxiing back and forth between the gate and the runway why thunderstorms over rochester n y miles northwest of kennedy airport and nowhere near flight s flight plan "there was good weather in fort lauderdale good weather in new york and most importantly good weather en route " recalls gary edwards deltas chief dispatcher "but we were still delayed " thats because weather wasnt really the culprit passengers of flight like legions of other hapless travelers this summer were really delayed by the constraints of an antiquated and inefficient system for managing u s airspace a lack of capacity in a seemingly boundless sky translates to massive delays on the ground after this summers travel troubles much attention has been paid to the myriad hitches that contribute to airline delays from old air traffic control technology to the growing number of corporate and regional jets to labor tensions among air traffic controllers and overscheduling by airlines yesterday following two days of congressional hearings on airline delays president bush met with transportation secretary mary e peters and pressed her and legislators to find solutions to the problems yet one fundamental shortcoming in the nations air traffic system has gone little discussed the federal map of routes largely unchanged since the s that airplanes are required to follow just like rush hour freeways on the ground the nations airways particularly on the east coast have become choked with traffic block one with a small thunderstorm and jets sit on the ground waiting for hours because theres no room for them on other routes "the limiting constraint is the airspace as opposed to the concrete " said w douglas parker chief executive of us airways group inc never have such constraints been as apparent as this summer during which fewer than of commercial flights arrived on time according to figures compiled by the department of transportation through july on time arrivals for each of the past three years have hovered at about fixing the problem requires addressing issues that involve a roster of players including airports airlines air traffic controllers and the federal aviation administration "whats hard for everyone to understand is no one really controls the system not even the faa " says russ chew president at jetblue airways corp and until earlier this year chief operating officer at the faa "airlines cant tell one another not to schedule flights the faa cant tell airlines how to schedule flights its like saying theres too much traffic on a california freeway at a m fix it " before it could depart for new york flight had to wait as air traffic controllers rerouted planes flying east toward jfk that were affected by bad weather on their route but by pushing those planes south some as far as atlanta controllers then had to squeeze them through one of the countrys worst airspace bottlenecks around washington d c the airspace there is particularly tight because blocks of nearby sky are used sporadically for military training and often unavailable to commercial flights waiting in fort lauderdale flight wanted to get on a highway in the sky labeled as "j " its entrance ramp was a particular navigational point a radio beacon on the ground in charleston s c but before flight could even get off the ground and head for j all manner of airlines and corporate jets were also converging for their turn to enter the same airway flight found itself grounded waiting to enter the queue delta dispatchers tried to get the flight on other airways those were jampacked too part of the blame lies with airlines which continue to schedule more flights than during the boom of the late s even though they are using fewer aircraft and employees the cutbacks give airlines less flexibility to reschedule flights or replace aircraft in the event of delays or cancellations further airlines have increasingly filled their schedules with multiple trips on small regional jets three regional jets on those airways carry as many people as one large jet airlines also point to the rapid growth of private jet travel as another clogger of airborne arteries a corporate jet with only a couple of people on board uses the same routes effectively taking up as much space on route j as does flight with scores of passengers airlines airports and even administrators say the nations air traffic control system which technologically lags behind systems already rolled out in other parts of the world is too slow to handle even todays volume the stress on the system first became apparent a decade ago when the internet boom and a strong economy fueled the last big air travel bonanza but the urgency to address it disappeared after the technology bubble burst and in the wake of the sept terrorist attacks as air traffic levels recovered in recent years the system has struggled to keep up "this is a very old atc system that cant handle traffic and weather as well as it should " says marion blakey administrator of the faa for the past five years until her term expired earlier this month the nations airways evolved from air traffic routes established in the s when the government was developing airmail service pilots followed established ground routes generally flying low enough to trace actual roads and spot one geographic landmark then another in the air commerce act authorized the government to build a network of other navigational aids beginning with bonfires that were later replaced by illuminated towers and eventually radio beacons and radar even now the concept remains the same todays pilots while flying at much higher altitudes still follow the same routes flying from one radio transmitter to another as they move along aircraft get passed from one air traffic controller to another each controller in turn is responsible for a specific chunk or sector of airspace but with so many planes in the sky controllers dont have as many holes in the conga line to move planes from one airway to another if a particular flight path gets congested add thunderstorms or other disruptions and the problem gets worse airways are so close together especially in the northeast that its hard for jets to deviate from the route without butting into another airway another problem is that airways are extremely wide eight miles across because of the inaccuracies of radar "theres so much demand today you cant reroute on other freeways " says bob reding head of operations at amr corp s american airlines so planes sit and sit for hours consider jfk airport which has grown quickly over the past decade due to greater use by traditional carriers such as delta and american which use it as an international gateway and the rise of jetblue a discount carrier that chose jfk as its primary base when it began flying in in july the latest month for which figures are available jfk reported takeoffs and landings compared with in july delays have grown along with the number of flights as controllers struggle to get them all airborne data compiled by the dots bureau of transportation statistics ranks jfk th out of major airports in terms of on time departures for july with only of flights taking off on schedule dallas fort worth and atlanta ranked lower during the same month in of jfks flights departed on schedule whats more jfk airport leads the country in so called "taxi out" delays according to data the dot recently began reporting for flights that take more than three hours to depart once they have pushed back from airport gates air traffic controllers say jfk should be able to handle about takeoffs and landings an hour on a normal day yet because of the crowded airways leading into and out of the region the airport rarely runs at full capacity this summer for instance during the busy travel times between p m and p m the airport was handling an average of flights an hour according to faa figures "jfk has the physical runway capacity " says mr reding "it should be able to handle more flights " aviation authorities say airlines should be more realistic when making schedules "their hopes and expectations may be boundless " says ms blakey the recent faa administrator but "neither the airport nor the airspace will be able to handle all the traffic that is planned and hoped for " some problems around new york could be alleviated by a plan the faa recently authorized to redesign airspace over the region it aims to make it easier for planes to enter and exit airways by allowing pilots to depart in a greater number of directions upon takeoff the so called "fanning" of departures the faa says will ease the flow of aircraft once they have left the runway but the airways themselves will remain just as congested prompting a growing call for the faa to accelerate plans for a wholesale upgrade of the air traffic control system experts say the solution is a satellite based navigation system that would allow planes to abandon the highway maps and fly freely since a computerized system can check for conflicting flight paths known as nextgen short for next generation air transportation system such a system would allow navigation points to be moved to avoid storms planes could fly closer together since they would broadcast their exact position using satellites for accuracy rather than relying on slower and less accurate radar hits used now but creating that infrastructure will be complex the faa last month awarded the first contract valued at &# billion to itt corp for the initial phase of upgrading equipment to a satellite based system to replace the entire domestic radar system with nextgen taxpayers will be expected to foot a bill expected to run as high as &# billion by most airlines as they upgrade their fleets are already installing equipment needed to fly within the nextgen system but there is only so much they can do many of the exact specifications wont be known until future contracts wend their way through government bureaucracy "well invest in the technology but we need to know what its going to be " says joe kolshak chief of operations for delta meanwhile problems unrelated to technology will continue to affect how efficiently airways are managed labor issues for instance have plagued the faa as it sought in recent years to cut costs paying new hires less since september while at the same time facing a recruitment crunch to replace retiring controllers many of whom have worked for the agency since they were brought in to replace strikers fired by president reagan in privately executives at several airlines say they believe labor disputes are leading air traffic controllers to reduce how many planes they handle at one time creating delays one day this summer for example the faas washington center insisted that traffic be spaced out every to miles as jets entered its airspace normally five miles is the minimum frustrated with the delays caused by the spacing "we called the command center " says deltas mr kolshak "and immediately it dropped to miles with no explanation " controllers and faa managers deny that labor issues are causing any disruptions to the flow of aircraft they recognize however that the greater number of planes flying this summer at times has pushed the limits of individual controllers and operations centers "we dont always get it right " says michael cirillo vice president of system operations services at the faa "there may be spacing at times that we may not have needed " out of the hands of both controllers and airlines is yet another issue that complicates travel "special use" airspace restricted for military or security purposes airways around washington d c for instance must avoid sensitive government buildings and airspace used for training by the military training areas blanket the east coast from palm beach fla to nantucket mass some beginning as close as a mile or two offshore and extending out more than miles if a storm arises to block a critical north south route planes on the coast often cant veer offshore because theyll enter military practice areas even if there is no military activity going on they cant go inland without entering other airways that are already full that forces controllers to put jets into holding patterns and stop departures airlines suggest the military could be more flexible with the airspace and go further ashore to practice but the pentagon says military pilots are constrained by the system too and that offshore flight zones are critical to national security at deltas massive operations control center near hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport the airlines flight dispatchers recently watched on computer monitors as aircraft traversed the east coast after a morning of heavy rains in the northeast on a close up of airways leading to and from the airspace around jfk blue blips indicated departing aircraft while seven green blips represented arrivals though the morning storms had cleared managers were closely monitoring the days weather to anticipate problems and the potential for blocked airways a storm doesnt even need to materialize before the faa sometimes grounds planes before traffic tie ups begin in the sky "we can gridlock laguardia in a heartbeat because of rain in western pennsylvania " says neil stronach deltas vice president of operations planning control and reliability "and thats just impossible to explain to customers "
