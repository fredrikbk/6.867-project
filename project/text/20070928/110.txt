weekend journal taste de gustibus the college try may not get you into college chicago on a beautiful fall day last week i found myself on the main quadrangle of the university of chicago walking with the schools admissions director theodore oneill when a freshman girl approached us "hows it going " mr oneill inquired of her orientation week "this place is mecca " she answered mr oneill decides who gets to go on this pilgrimage and there are hundreds maybe thousands of high school seniors who would kill for the opportunity i have today to spend an uninterrupted hour talking with him these eager boys and girls might try to enthrall mr oneill with their knowledge of the facultys research their love of community service their expansive vocabulary their passion for wind instruments or veterinary medicine or juggling anything that might make them stand out when mr oneill joined the admissions staff here in things were different the acceptance rate for undergraduates was today its about half that even though the freshman class has doubled to a quarter century ago the freshmen who ended up at the university of chicago were mostly just smart kids who graduated from decent high schools a sizable chunk in rural midwestern towns now its a different ballgame this fall mr oneill will sort through several thousand applications trying to find the perfect freshman class what has made it so much harder for students to get into top colleges and what is this cutthroat competition doing to kids to begin with there was a baby boomlet around the year many of todays high school seniors were born also despite skyrocketing tuition more parents can afford to send their kids to college and higher education is more important for gaining secure employment mr oneill says that "students today have a better sense of what it takes to make themselves look like good candidates " they take as many ap classes as they can prepare for the sats polish their essays etc and many parents pay tutors and coaches to help with this effort but he tells me it is an "open question" whether the universitys applicants are actually of a higher quality than those of years ago how many areas of american life are there today in which people work harder and spend more money only to see the same results they did decades before well thats not quite true according to mr oneill who proudly points to what he thinks is one of the biggest improvements to the university of chicago in the past few decades diversity the school used to be about two thirds male and overwhelmingly white now the gender ratio is about even and of the student body is black is hispanic and is native american how has this happened for one thing mr oneill tells me he has de emphasized the sats in the admissions process theyre used as "corroborating evidence" for what his staff learns from teacher recommendations high school records and essays ultimately mr oneill believes that "there are some things that are more important than test scores " a few months ago black presidential hopeful barack obama a former u of c lecturer told george stephanopoulos that he didnt think his daughters should be treated differently in the college admissions process from any other "advantaged" kids but mr oneill disagrees he would give the obama girls "a break" anyway "those children for all their privileges will have interesting things to say about american society based on what im assuming their experiences are " on tuesday mr oneill participated in a meeting of the education conservancy which is "committed to improving college admission processes for students colleges and high schools " hosted by yale university the meeting consisted of college administrators discussing how to get "beyond rankings " college "ranksters" as conservancy president lloyd thacker refers to u s news and similar surveyors can be blamed he argues for much of the crazy atmosphere surrounding college admissions at a news conference after the meeting some of the administrators complained that rankings didnt provide enough data or tried to quantify things that arent quantifiable what was needed were more "descriptive" measures of colleges mr oneill expressed the same sentiment when i spoke to him the group is trying to develop a system in which high school students would be asked to evaluate their own "learning styles " and then a web site would "match" them with colleges providing the right sort of learning environment leave aside the silliness of asking a high school student for this level of self knowledge or the fact that most colleges sound the same when describing themselves the real problem is that such a system would add another fuzzy element to the admissions process as it is colleges already discount so many of the concrete measures in addition to ignoring test scores when its convenient admissions officers have a hard time keeping track of which high schools are rigorous and which are not the u of c has freshmen matriculating from different high schools this year what does an "a" mean at any of them "we dont know " mr oneill replies what about the essays more and more kids pay coaches to compose them the u of c has picked some odd topics to get around this "write an essay somehow inspired by super huge mustard" or "use the power of string to explain the biggest or the smallest phenomenon" but coaches can get creative too i suspect that what bothers kids most about the process is not the cutthroat competition they face but the arbitrary nature of the whole thing you struggle to give schools what they want but ultimately folks like mr oneill may simply ignore your grades or your test scores focusing instead on whether youve had the right "experiences" or have the right skin color to be
