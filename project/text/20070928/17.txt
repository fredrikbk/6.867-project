bond traders begin to get up off the canvas signs of stability emerge as risky deal debt sells volume remains light a little more than a week after the federal reserve slashed interest rates signs are emerging that credit markets are improving though investors say it is hardly time to signal an "all clear" for the market bond trading volumes have picked up but remain below normal and investors agreed to buy almost twice as much of a risky loan offering as expected even the market for some mortgages is stirring again but there are still weak spots including some corporate debt issues and the commercial paper market and investors are still worried about the large volume of new debt set to hit the market in the next few months in a deal that just a few weeks ago seemed nearly impossible to complete wall street investment banks yesterday sold investors &# billion in risky bank loans issued by first data corp to finance its leveraged buyout it was the largest sale of leveraged loans since that of hca inc last year it was also nearly double the &# billion in loans the banks said they were attempting to sell still the underwriters which include credit suisse group and citigroup inc hold

past major hurdles investors remain wary of the pipeline of &# billion in junk bonds and loans that need to be sold to fund leveraged buyouts that pipeline is smaller now because a piece of the first data deal has been done and because other deals like the buyouts of harman international industries inc and slm corp might never get done but the task still remains large and other corners of the corporate debt market are still struggling lawyers for delphi corp say the company is having trouble securing &# billion in financing on favorable terms as the auto parts supplier seeks to complete a chapter reorganization plan at a court hearing yesterday an attorney for the company said the tightening of credit markets made it difficult for delphi to obtain loans on the terms expected which might delay its exit from bankruptcy protection until early bond trading volumes meanwhile arent quite back to normal tom swaney a portfolio manager at oppenheimerfunds in boston said it has been difficult to trade even short term corporate bonds that have investment grade credit ratings "the brokers are not willing to take much market risk themselves " he said but other signs of stability are

backed by home loans that is allowing lenders such as countrywide to raise money by selling some of the mortgages they have been holding since early last month when many investors fled the market in recent months investors have grown anxious about a rise in defaults on mortgages and a fall in home prices which reduces the value of the collateral backing home loans so many shun mortgage securities other than those guaranteed by government sponsored investors fannie mae and freddie mac or insured by the federal housing administration mr sambol said that in recent days countrywide has been able to sell some high rated securities backed by so called nonagency mortgages which arent eligible for sale to fannie or freddie or insured by the fha he said some investors were bidding for prime securities backed by "jumbo" loans those above the &# regulatory limit on mortgages that fannie or freddie can purchase "its too early to call the crisis over " mr sambol said but the modest revival in investor demand is "a positive sign " hsh associates a financial publishing company in pompton plains n j says interest rates on year fixed rate jumbo loans last week averaged or about percentage point more than the average for the "conforming" loans that fannie and freddie buy in late august jumbos were almost one percentage point above conforming loans the long term average for jumbos is
