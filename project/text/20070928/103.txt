weekend journal hollywood report to be young gifted and country rissi palmer finds her place on the country music charts starbucks apple give a boost the chorus to rissi palmers "country girl " which entered the billboard hot country songs chart at no last month hints at the singers status as a nashville outsider "you dont have to be a georgia peach from savannah beach " the year old newcomer sings "dont need no kin from west virginia to have it in ya " among the reasons ms palmer stands out in music city are her pittsburgh birthplace and st louis upbringing the most unusual thing however about ms palmers success in a genre synonymous with good ol boy culture is that she is african american shes the first black woman to have a hit on the country charts since when dona masons "green eyes cryin those blue tears " reached no ms palmer and her record label entertainment say that among radio programmers retailers and other industry veterans there is inevitably skepticism when they hear about the statuesque black country artist "the first question you always get is is she really country " says terry johnson chief executive at atlanta based which plans to release ms palmers self titled debut album next month black country artists are rare but not unheard of charley pride has a string of hits going back to the s the singer who calls himself cowboy troy scored a novelty hit alongside big &amp rich a few years ago hootie &amp the blowfish frontman darius rucker recently signed to capitol nashville as a solo country artist and ray charles recorded dozens of country songs though several were pop hits none made it onto the country charts according to a cmt documentary about african americans and country music in which ms palmer was featured the genres roots are intimately tied to black america the most frequent guest on the season of the grand ole opry was black harmonica player deford bailey innovators such as hank williams and bill monroe credited black musicians with teaching them musical insights the film said but as country grew more prominent jim crow laws were brought to bear on the genre performing a style of music that would come to be called rhythm and blues black musicians were channeled into a parallel world of segregated performance venues record labels and radio stations these barriers would take decades to crack ms palmer cut her teeth as a teenager singing top songs in a group sponsored by a st louis tv station five years ago she was a finalist on "star search " yet during the seven years she spent shopping for a record deal in nashville new york and los angeles she got used to being an object of curiosity "people were always like yeah bring her in i gotta see this " ms palmer recalls "being a black female country artist in this day and age will always get you some sort of interest people will always want to see it whether they want to sign it is another thing " she takes pains to point out that her family roots are in the rural georgia towns of summerville and sparta where her parents grew up listening to all kinds of regional music "for some reason people think black people dont like country " ms palmer says "my family is very country they all listen to country and gospel and soul " many industry insiders say the reason there havent been more black country singers has little to do with institutional attitudes and much to do with simple numbers pete fisher vice president and general manager of the grand ole opry has booked ms palmer for three radio appearances and a coming performance on the famed halls weekly tv program thats an unusual number of appearances for an artist without an album in the marketplace "most industry professionals i know want to be part of helping grow the diversity of our genre " mr fisher says "the honest truth is there are not a lot of african american country artists who come to our attention and then those that do face the same odds as any other performer most dont move on to the next step " neal spielberg a consultant who has been hired by to help shop ms palmers album to retail chains around the country says he has crossed paths with a handful of black singers over the years who identified themselves as country "in each case it was more about the novelty of them being an african american country artist than it was about the music " he says not so with ms palmer who at age turned down a deal from flyte tyme records the label run by r&amp b superproducers james "jimmy jam" harris iii and terry lewis she rejected it she says because messrs harris and lewis were interested in grafting her twangy style onto a pop soul hybrid "i love r&amp b and urban music but it wasnt what i wanted to do " she says "i knew i wouldnt be happy doing that " a flyte tyme employee confirms the label wanted to sign ms palmer messrs harris and lewis couldnt be reached the album ms palmer is releasing next month sits squarely in country musics mainstream "country girl " relies on a style that one critic described as "hillbilly sophisticated " with layers of steel guitar and a yodeling chorus yet the video for "country girl" draws on imagery decidedly african american such as a gospel choir ms palmer finally signed to far from an industry powerhouse after a chance meeting with a freelance talent scout in los angeles mr johnson the ceo founded after selling his familys auto parts supply business for around &# million the labels first signing was a caribbean singer named elvis white whom mr johnson befriended during a series of vacations ms palmer is the labels only country act and mr johnson has assembled a strong team of nashville veterans to promote her in radio retail and digital channels thanks to their efforts the album is getting the kind of push hard to come by in todays constrained music business apple inc is kicking in half of a planned &# online ad campaign says a person involved in the promotion apple declines to comment next month starbucks corp plans to distribute million cards to customers offering free "country girl" downloads part of a month long "song of the day" program that will feature tunes by bob dylan joss stone and others "we feel shes going to be able to directly connect with a broad array of our customer base " says starbucks entertainment president ken lombard if as mr lombard and others hope the album resonates with black consumers as well as the core white country fan base it could represent a crossover opportunity for all involved the early signs are promising ms palmer has been profiled in black oriented jet magazine and favorably reviewed in music row a country music trade magazine for her part ms palmer is aiming high at age she wrote a grammy acceptance speech and sealed it in an envelope she says she carries it in her bible "im going to take it up on stage and im going to read whatever it says inside " ms palmer says with a laugh
