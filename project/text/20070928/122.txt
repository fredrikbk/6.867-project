campaign in china with ads featuring its biggest or at least tallest asset here basketball star yao ming using a theme called "fuel yaos unlimited power " a slew of television and digital ads encourage chinese consumers to support their hero as he prepares for the beijing olympic games but perhaps the bigger story is why reebok whose name in chinese means "swift step " has been slow to use mr yao having lured him away in from nike inc mr yaos year contract with reebok estimated to pay him &# million to &# million a year is one of the most lucrative in the sports world until now analysts say reebok hasnt been getting much mileage from the deal four years after signing mr yao reebok is by its own estimates in sixth place in chinas athletic shoe market far behind rivals including the leader nike puma ag rudolf dassler sport and mizuno corp after signing mr yao a top reebok executive had confidently predicted that the company could "get to a no position" in two to three years in fact many chinese consumers still think of mr yao as a nike pitchman he also appears in ads for mcdonalds china unicom and visa among others "its never been seared in anybodys mind that yao is reebok " said terry rhoads who runs zou marketing inc a shanghai based sports marketing firm how reebok acquired by adidas ag in for &# billion utilizes chinas greatest sports star ahead of the olympics will be an important factor in determining who wins the nations sneaker wars adidass chief executive herbert hainer has maintained that china where there is at least one reebok adidas or nike store opening daily is critical to the companys overall goal to be top player globally thats partly why adidas became a beijing olympics sponsor with reebok which is based in canton mass adidas currently holds second place to rival nike world wide and in china and its catching up fast thanks in part to its now fully integrated reebok acquisition last year reebok boosted adidass sales by to &# billion about &# billion less than those of nike reeboks yao campaign is designed as a trinity of the star the games and the company it seeks to tap a deep vein of patriotism in china where citizens are being bombarded with messages that they all have a part to play to make the games successful an idea reebok hopes will induce the the chinese to shop for sportswear at an appearance in beijing this week the newly married mr yao appealed to fans saying "i and our chinese team need more and more support from you to help me go towards the beijing olympics in " paul harrington reeboks chief executive concedes that until now there has been "underutilization" of mr yao who plays for the national basketball associations houston rockets he attributes it to reeboks too large stable of star endorsers and lack of focus by reeboks chinese distributors "weve been bringing out products in china since with great success " he says "has it been to the extent we want no " another reason for keeping mr yao on the marketing sidelines lies in disputes between reebok and adidas according to people close to the situation after the acquisition some factions within adidas wanted to move mr yao to the german brand arguing it had more resources to promote him than reebok these people say reebok executives demurred says an adidas executive adidas and reebok say there was some discussion about the possibility of moving mr yao to adidas but no dispute now reebok appears to be getting back on track it has slimmed down its stable of stars moving away from links with entertainers and hip hop artists and in the process freeing up more marketing dollars it is devoting some of its revenue to marketing in china instead of the that is average in the industry executives say also reebok bought out its china distributor this year thereby gaining full control over how the product is marketed before that reebok had distributor relationships with symphony holdings ltd a division of yue yuen industrial ltd the worlds largest athletic footwear manufacturer and swire pacific ltd a hong kong conglomerate reeboks distributors had controlled the marketing budget and been more focused on capital investment says mr harrington with the new campaign the company will launch an interactive web site for mr yaos fans the company has also created a special logo for the reebok products mr yao
