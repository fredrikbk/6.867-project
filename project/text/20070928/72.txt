politics &amp economics in china activism is risky pursuit groups proliferate but remain vulnerable to wrath of local officials beijing wu lihong is a nuisance for years he has told anyone who would listen about the industrial pollution destroying lake tai chinas third largest freshwater lake carrying grubby folders packed with photos faded photocopies and old clippings he petitioned government officials and begged journalists to write about the worsening conditions once he said he could go swimming in the water today the lake outside shanghai is so polluted that dead fish wash up on the shores his campaigning eventually earned mr wu praise and even an award from chinas central leadership as well as the ire of local authorities last spring he was arrested and a month ago he was sentenced to three years in prison on racketeering charges he maintains his innocence the case suggests the vulnerability of chinas nonprofit groups which are quickly spreading to address problems such as aids and pollution officials in beijing realize the need for whistleblowers and activists to alert the central government to problems that local officials may be trying to cover up but the central government fearing any power base outside the communist party has done little to build legal protections for nonprofits nongovernmental groups must have a government sponsor and clear bureaucratic hurdles to be legally recognized human rights observers say only about nongovernmental organizations enjoy legal recognition out of a total number of groups that may be as high as three million the rest can be shut down for any reason xu kezhu deputy director of the center for legal assistance to pollution victims says a study of environmental ngos found that only had registered with the government the rest were either operating illegally or had registered as businesses without official recognition ngos find it difficult to pursue lawsuits more important they cant raise money both because it is illegal to do so without permission and because few corporate donors feel comfortable giving money to something registered as a business while some groups have managed to find a way for the more high profile and vocal activists their path has meant penury this summer tai lakes pollution made national headlines after an algae bloom fed by industrial pollutants and fertilizer forced cities to cut off municipal water supplies but the pressure on mr wu was mounting he was dismissed from his job selling soundproofing he was beaten and when he decided to try to register a nongovernmental organization officials told him the region already had one environmental group and didnt need another without a job he soon found himself scraping for money according to court records provided by his wife and reviewed by the wall street journal mr wu claimed he accepted money while essentially acting as a broker for environmental services he also claimed he was tortured during questioning several chinese environmental groups signed an open letter calling for a fair trial for mr wu but in an indication of how sensitive the case has become these groups were later forced to remove the letter from their web sites according to one of the groups and china development brief a newsletter that itself was recently shut down by the government because mr wu was a high profile activist the case is particularly embarrassing for chinas leadership which has pledged to clean up its worsening pollution ahead of the beijing olympics some athletes worried about bad air quality are planning measures such as carrying masks or using special drugs to counter the effects of pollution chinas central leadership has acknowledged the soaring costs of unregulated pollution stemming from rapid economic growth but despite the calls from the top to clean up pollution is worsening across the country in large part because local officials protect polluting factories they have many reasons for doing so promotions are mostly based on economic performance local officials often get kickbacks from factories in some cases industries provide needed jobs this isnt the first instance in which chinas central leaders are at crosscurrents from local bureaucrats last summer in a case that drew international attention a blind rural activist who exposed abuses of chinas one child policy in his hometown was sentenced by a local court to four years in prison even though the central government had admitted the truth of his allegations about forced abortions and sterilizations zhang changjian an activist who successfully sued a polluting plant with help from the center for legal assistance to pollution victims now faces a similar problem he has been unable to register his group local authorities have revoked his business license he was a rural doctor leaving him unable to pay his childrens school fees "our organization is an illegal one now so it is hard for us to apply for organizing big environmental protection activities " mr zhang said mr wu remains in prison his wife who once begged him to stop his activism says she is now being trailed by police as she tries to organize a petition for his retrial "ngos are thriving in china people need them " said nicholas bequelin china researcher for human rights watch "for the civil society to make progress they need people on the front lines and these people often fall and wu lihong was one he decided to go on the front line despite warnings " kersten zhang contributed to this article
