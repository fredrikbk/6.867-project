cable firms try to paddle together operators see national ads using common technology industry all in same boat for years cable operators have tantalized advertisers with the idea of turning the cable set top box into a nationwide conduit of interactive and targeted ads so far its mostly been talk but starting next year operators say theyre going to be able to deliver the new momentum is coming from an industry effort launched last spring designed in part to standardize the technology in the thousands of cable distribution centers throughout the country until now the fragmented nature of cable ownership no one operator covers the entire country has meant advertisers have to reformat their commercials for different cable systems in order to reach the entire u s that complication has made national advertisers reluctant to do any ad buys with cable operators including new interactive ads by standardizing technology though cable operators will be able to work together to compete for national ad dollars the biggest slice of advertising revenue in television and one that now flows almost exclusively to tv networks and cable operators are looking for a new source of revenue now that they have mostly finished launching phone service the industry effort led by steve burke chief operating officer of comcast and landel hobbs time warner cables chief operating officer is codenamed "canoe " reflecting operators recognition that theyre all in the same boat "theres a lot more value out there if we as a sector do it in a common way " says mr hobbs as part of the canoe effort industry executives are also considering whether cable operators need to create a national ad sales organization to sell national ads or whether it can use existing industry bodies mr hobbs says the cable industry is planning to showcase the power of interactive advertising at a number of "common events" next year he declined to elaborate but other executives working on the project say those events will likely include the national elections and the summer olympics to drum up interest among political advertisers cable executives recently traveled to washington to meet with democratic and republican ad buyers and showcase their digital interactive ads to tap into the political ad market canoe is thinking about creating a video on demand channel for coverage of the elections the channel would let advertisers test out some of the new ads with features that allow interactive voting and let viewers click to request a brochure cable operators have long had the opportunity to sell ad time as part of their agreements to carry tv networks such as espn cbs and mtv operators are allowed to sell a couple of minutes per hour of ad time until now though operators have sold mostly to local advertisers competing against local newspapers and yellow pages that has limited the size of the business comcast the biggest cable operator collected only &# billion in ad revenue last year out of its total revenue of &# billion but the operators could make more by selling to national advertisers particularly if they offered interactive ads which broadcast networks cant sell on their own thats because interactive ads usually rely on two way communication between the viewer and the tv distribution facility which is made possible by digital cable boxes supplied by operators these boxes are now broadly available close to of comcast and time warner cable subscribers take their digital services some cable operators are dabbling with interactive commercials already for example some advertisers in the los angeles area have run interactive ads through charter communications inc about subscribers can use their remotes while watching second commercials to trigger longer form ads for marketers looking for new ways to advertise on tv given the rise of ad skipping devices like digital video recorders interactive ads hold promise but advertisers are waiting for things to change in the cable industry "for the cable operators to get the spending and the marketing they need to standardize the technology so that it is scalable across multiple markets " says curt hecht executive vice president and chief digital officer at gm planworks the unit of publicis groupes starcom mediavest group that buys ad time for general motors as part of canoe cablelabs the industrys research and development arm has asked about technology vendors for help in developing an industrywide system for national advertising sales vendors responded last week submitting information on a range of technical issues the industry hopes new technology could keep track of when all the cable systems have commercial time available cable industry officials acknowledge it will probably take years before many of their advertising goals are realized and some advertisers are skeptical about canoe because of delays in similar efforts by the cable industry "i really hope this canoe has more than a paddle " says tracey scheppach senior vice president of starcom usa
