weekend journal tastings small region big tastes spanish reds from ribera del duero are full of surprises many years ago our tasting buddies fred tasker and fred barger were obsessed with an expensive spanish wine called vega sicilia this was unusual at the time because spanish wine to us mostly meant torress inexpensive sangre de toro with the plastic bull attached to the neck vega sicilia came from an obscure area of spain that wasnt even an official wine zone whenever our group held a byob tasting of expensive red wines everyone else would bring the latest california cabernet or a fine bordeaux the freds would bring vega sicilia and it would always be the most talked about wine of the evening we enjoyed it but generally found it more fascinating than delicious with great fruit but so many years of oak aging that it seemed less lively than most of the wines we truly loved now we can only hope that the freds who later also became wine writers were as prescient in their stock investments spain is one of the wine worlds hotspots for reds whites and even sparklers and roses the reds of ribera del duero a mile long region along the duero river in north central spain received formal status in and thanks to pioneers such as alejandro fernandez and his pesquera are considered among spains greatest wines vega sicilia is still famous and even more expensive still despite the renown of ribera del duero wines among wine lovers they havent been widely available until recently it is a relatively small region with about acres of vineyards but there are now about producers making about five million cases a year and the wines are far more available in wine shops than ever we searched all over the u s to make sure of this and when we were convinced we ordered a large sample to see what was out there with the arrival of fall now is definitely the time for this soulful red like rioja ribera del duero is made predominantly from the tempranillo grape which is called tinto fino or tinta del pais locally and like rioja ribera is classified by how long it is aged before release crianza wines age at least a year in oak reservas age at least three years including one in oak and gran reservas age five years including at least two in oak we set our price target at &# but most of the wines in our sample cost far less we bought our wines from retail shelves in seven states our question as always was simple if you pick up a ribera del duero for dinner tonight at your local store what are you likely to find the answer the odds are outstanding that you will pick up an excellent wine that also is a great deal these arent shy wines they tend to be dark and smell like wet rich earth their tastes are big with dark fruit like blackberries and blueberries theres often a hint of chocolate and often quite a bit of sage with a splash of lemon and abundant oak sometimes theres a little bit of leather cedar or tobacco on the nose this big wine holds two surprises the first is how very dry the good ones are considering that they just about burst with ripe fruit you might expect them to seem sweet but theyre beautifully dry especially on the finish the second surprise is that for such big earthy wines the best ones also have a great deal of bordeaux like structure nice edges and complex layers of tastes all of this adds up to a very interesting soulful and tasty mouthful of wine that requires fairly lusty food of course not all of them were winners any of these tastes can be too much if the balance is off some tasted too herbal while others tasted too oaky even with some off putting vanilla flavor a few seemed quite alcoholic while they were generally or alcohol the alcohol wasnt overly apparent in most some simply seemed clumsy dottie described one as "lemony ink " and we cant say weve ever used that description before but the good ones were very good indeed and the average quality level was high not only that but because these arent well known the prices tended to be excellent one wine called torres de anguix was a beauty fascinating earthy and filled with dark fruit we couldnt believe we paid &# for it truly one of the best bargains of the year the importer hand picked selections of warrenton va says cases were made and more than were imported and distributed in states the suggested price is &# to &# heres more good news time after time we found that these wines improved through the evening as they warmed and as they got some air they were intricate with so many hints of flavors from bittersweet chocolate to sage and sometimes a little mint that they changed and grew throughout the night holding our interest for a long time not only does this mean that a single bottle will be enjoyable throughout dinner and beyond but this is a good indication of their aging potential our advice make a fairly substantial meal this weekend veal and peppers perhaps or paella or roast lamb and pick up a ribera del duero if its young and you dont have all night to linger you might want to decant it then drink and eat lustily with this wine its hard not to melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at
