two moves that could pave the way to a full scale crackdown on democracy activists akin to the juntas brutal onslaughts in the past participation of the saffron robed monks has lent some immunity to the largest marches against the regime in decades in a country that is buddhist and where even the ruling generals have shown deference to the clergy in the past that immunity began to evaporate this week as the army deployed to the streets of yangon and cities beyond the capital but despite the militarys tentative violence crowds continued to pour into the streets by the thousands overnight however soldiers occupied some of the key monasteries and blocked surrounding intersections with barbed wire and there seemed to be no sign of the monks on the streets the associated press reports the government told envoys from neighboring countries in southeast asia that five of the monasteries had been declared no go zones a diplomat tells the ap meanwhile soldiers and riot police quickly dispersed one gathering of marchers in yangon and fired warning shots to scatter another of elsewhere in the city the ap reports and bob davis the australian ambassador there said he heard unconfirmed reports that "several multiples" of the fatalities acknowledged by the authorities may have been killed by troops in yangon while scores of people have been arrested or beaten the times of london one of the only western news organizations with a correspondent in the closed country reports that without the monks the "marchers had lost a lucky charm they felt less like crusaders for justice and more like what they resembled scared angry kids in t shirts facing well drilled troops with automatic weapons " the weekend appearance of opposition leader and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi outside her home in a prayer session with monks had given many demonstrators hope but since then security has been tightened around her home and protesters kept away the bbc reports it wasnt clear how tightly the junta was able to shut down access to the internet by far the biggest conduit of pictures cell phone footage and text reports from witnesses to the outside world as the protests built in recent weeks these images and reports have helped kindle support for the protesters across the region and the world but the junta may be immune to the resulting political pressure the bush administration yesterday followed through on its threat to tighten economic sanctions on myanmar and on top leaders of the junta who will now have any u s based assets frozen and be barred from conducting business with american entities as the wall street journal reports but u s sanctions have already diminished any links between the two countries though chevrons gas deal with myanmar was exempted by a grandfather clause the administration may now revisit that exemption the journal says the other active petrogiant there is total and while the french company expressed "deep concern" over the situation it rejected the idea of pulling out the company argues its presence helps tens of thousands of burmese and serves as a model for "business and political leaders looking for ways to address the countrys

western camp there have been differences in approach between the three most important members america the eu and japan " no matter how much outside pressure builds on myanmar the situation there remains a zero sum equation either some kind of democracy is allowed or an historically uncompromising military stays in power and for now the latter seems inevitable court to let musharraf seek re

concentration of military and civilian powers in his hands gen musharraf has said that if re elected he will give up his military office and his recent promotions of senior officers seemed to be setting the conditions to let him do so in the mean time the high courts ruling this afternoon in pakistan is expected to fuel protests from lawyers and opposition parties which have threatened to
