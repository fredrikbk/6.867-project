politics &amp economics local politics web money actblue reshapes how smaller races get financed chicago presidential candidate john edwards has long been one of the top money raisers at democratic fund raising site actblue com but for a short time recently he was almost surpassed by daniel biss a year old mathematics professor running for the illinois state legislature the biss phenomenon illustrates another way the internet is shaking up politics and changing the way races are run this year online fund raising is now filtering down to low dollar state and local races where a little bit of extra money goes further than it would in a national race "it just seemed like a natural choice you set up a site and two hours later youre there " says mr biss who teaches at the university of chicago "the opportunity is so much greater at the local level where the impact is so much greater " so far mr biss has raised &# online for his bid to win a republican held seat representing the north chicago suburbs a figure pumped up in part by an appeal from one of mr bisss friends who vowed to subject himself to various cyberspace humiliations if viewers met certain donating targets the resulting video has been watched more than times on youtube actblue was created as a political action committee in june by two democratic activists from cambridge mass shortly after the presidential campaign of howard dean showed the power of online fund raising the idea was to transfer that force to democrats more broadly since its inception actblue has raised more than &# million for democratic candidates mostly by making it easy for supporters to bundle together small dollar donations made via credit card mr edwards for example has raised more than &# million online via actblue actblue started by focusing on presidential and congressional races last year the site began making its services available for local races in some states local candidates have collected more than &# so far

of democratic secretary of state candidates in seven states five of them won actblue runs on donations from users and provides its services free to candidates republicans have tried setting up similar sites but none have taken off so far some campaigns like mr bisss also use actblue as a low cost way of processing donations from local fund raisers "money that comes in online is not just money that was recruited by bloggers or people making youtube videos " says benjamin rahn an actblue cofounder and long time friend of mr bisss they met at a mathematics "geek camp" at the massachusetts institute of technology one summer during high school a native of bloomington ind mr biss isnt the most obvious political candidate he has no staff and his campaign headquarters is located in the basement of the condo he shares with his wife maps of the district adorn the walls and an upright piano sits along one wall underneath a photo of his late grandmother a concert cellist both of mr bisss parents are professional violinists and his younger brother jonathan is a rising concert pianist mr biss played piano when he was younger too but says he stopped when he was a teen after his brother began receiving acclaim "im the black sheep of the family " jokes mr biss who turned to mathematics and focused on topology a form of advanced geometry he only became politically active after and the iraq war began posting on liberal blogs and volunteering for other democratic candidates "it didnt make sense to be a disappointed observer i no longer thought it was enough to work on math problems " he says the north chicago suburbs where mr biss lives has been represented for years by moderate republican elizabeth colson a physical therapist last year members of the illinois house of representatives raised an average of &# each in campaign contributions according to the national institute on money in state politics a non profit watchdog group ms colson had &# in the bank by mid

colson who doesnt raise money online ms colson declined to comment for this story recently mr bisss wife raised about &# for his campaign via an email solicitation that asked supporters to give &# via actblue in honor of his th birthday about half of the &# he raised in the first half of the year came from online donations the rest has come from more traditional campaigning mr biss spends most

all the best parts of food and all the best parts of liquid " he half joked to his wife who stood nearby her camcorder shaking slightly as she giggled he sniffed inside "it just doesnt smell like something you should be eating " but he ate the chunky gunk anyway spoon by spoon washing it down with the rest of the orange drink "it was the least happy happy meal in history " mr green said later the award winning author of books for teens had vowed to eat a liquefied happy meal and wax the hair off one leg if at least people donated money online to mr biss mr green also promoted the effort on

tells the story of a child prodigy who struggles to understand why he has been dumped times by girls named katherine "to be honest i never thought i would have to eat the happy meal or i would have picked something else " says mr green who figured he would only collect enough donations to be forced to eat a dozen or so peeps the sugar encrusted easter candy mr biss still hasnt watched the happy meal video that has become a youtube hit at his campaigns kickoff recently the video was shown to supporters mr biss put a hand over his eyes "i dont think ill ever be able to watch it " mr biss says
