the gold at crunchs end how banks may benefit from their debt values the gains were real while the bond market mess made the earnings reports for the big investment banks feel like a game of roulette there was one area where they were almost guaranteed to win profits generated by the falling value of their own debt that allowed the firms to book hundreds of millions of dollars in profit helping to offset multibillion dollar charges they had to take on commitments to fund leveraged buyouts now some banks may be set to similarly benefit from their own misfortune financial titans such as citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co which will report third quarter results next month all opted earlier this year to start applying market values to some of their own liabilities according to the research service the analysts accounting observer this means they too might see a boost to profit from declines in the value of their debts during the summer credit crunch "it might not be unusual at all to be seeing gains on debt issued hitting earnings in the third quarter " the analysts accounting observer said officials at citigroup j p morgan and bank of america declined to comment the brokers and banks are doing nothing wrong or improper in booking such gains the accounting rules as they stand allow the practice but some investors are crying foul saying the rules shouldnt have been changed to allow for such gains here is how the accounting method works say &# million of bonds issued by a bank falls in value by &# million or under new accounting rules adopted by the banks and brokerages some liabilities are valued at market prices instead of being recorded at their historical cost the decline in the bonds value means the banks liabilities fell by &# million the difference between the current price of &# million and the original &# million creates an equivalent gain that ends up on the income statement and boosts profits conversely if the bonds gained in value it would mean the banks liabilities went up producing a loss any gains at the banks could potentially offer one bright spot in what is expected to be an otherwise gloomy quarter banks likely face write downs in the value of commitments that they have made to fund leveraged buyouts and will need to increase reserves for soured loans earlier this week citigroup analyst keith horowitz cut his third quarter earnings per share estimate for bank of america to cents from &# citing the recent financial market turmoil and the likely need for the bank to increase loan loss reserves because of its exposure to consumer lending late last week lehman analyst jason goldberg lowered his third quarter earnings estimate for citigroup to &# a share from &# while reducing his estimate for j p morgan to &# from &# the emergence of debt induced gains even if they only offer a slight respite from overall market woes has rekindled longstanding debate about whether such profits should be allowed the opportunity for companies to benefit in this way only recently emerged thanks to new accounting rules that allow companies to apply market prices to their own liabilities opponents of the practice of booking such gains worry that they erode earnings quality and possibly open a new way for executives to massage earnings in the wake of the brokers results moodys corp urged bondholders to ignore this new kind of profit the ratings firm said the inclusion of such gains in earnings "can produce counterintuitive and misleading results" and that it doesnt consider them "to be core sustainable earnings " even some supporters of the use of market or fair values remain uneasy with companies booking gains on declines in the value of their own debt "it was premature to allow the effect of that to come through the income statement " said leslie seidman a member of the financial accounting standards board the body that adopted the rule that allows companies to book these gains yet brokerage executives defended the gains saying they were more than just an accounting gimmick during his firms earnings call sam molinaro bear stearnss chief financial officer said "the gains were real " adding that "theres someone on the other side of that trade who lost money " mr molinaro added that his firm could have easily used financial instruments to cancel out or hedge the impact of any change in the value of bears own credit standing but the firm ruled that out he said bear later recognized about &# million in gains from the change in value of structured notes it sold investors the idea of allowing companies to profit from falls in their own liabilities proved controversial when accounting rule makers debated the idea but many companies especially in the financial sector argued that if the rule makers were going to encourage the use of market values they should allow companies to use them for all their financial assets and liabilities in addition financial firms argued that it didnt make sense to require them to use market prices for the value of a derivative contract that may be hedging the value of a companys own liabilities which would be recorded at its cost that would have produced an accounting mismatch said edward ketz an accounting professor at pennsylvania state university still the outcome is "counterintuitive " he added it may also require investors to "rethink how we are going to evaluate a companys debt to equity ratio " prof ketz said "in the past we would think that if a firm was having problems they would show a higher debt ratio but now if they are performing poorly the debt is going to be going down in value "
