schip for everyone the beltway political class is shocked that president bush and his dwindling republican allies are opposing the democratic expansion of the state childrens health insurance program that consensus as usual has it backwards what ought to be shocking is how many republicans have surrendered or been accomplices in this latest expansion of government health care the schip expansion passed the house on tuesday short of the members required to override president bushs imminent veto though enough republicans have joined democrats for a veto proof senate majority the house vote means congress will send the president a bill that is dead on arrival democrats are already marking this down as a political victory but it also dismantles the pretense that this fight is all about needy children the house gop leadership deserves a great deal of credit for scrounging up enough members to sustain the veto schip was sold in the s as a program to help insure children from low income families who make too much money to qualify for medicaid hiding under the political cover of "kids " democrats now want to extend schip well up the income scale meanwhile many republicans are going along for the media ride settling back into their historic minority status as tax collectors for the welfare state simply on the basis of fiscal responsibility opposing schip is a no brainer on paper the bill expands schip by &# billion over the next five years to a total of &# billion well beyond the expansion supported by the bush administration to fill this pot of federal dollars the democrats will raise the cigarette excise tax by cents naturally however theres a budget sleight of hand known as a "funding cliff " the yearly schip layout increases to &# billion in then abruptly cuts spending by below current funding levels this helps "score" the bill as costing only &# billion over the five year budget window but it also means that come congress will either have to pass new spending or kick kids off the rolls the chances of the latter happening are approximately zero and gop senators chuck grassley and orrin hatch should be embarrassed for going along with this confidence trick more broadly schip is designed as a ratchet that jacks up the governments share of health care spending and every time it grows it steals customers from private insurance all the more so because states have been raising eligibility levels above the of the federal poverty line that schip was intended to serve the democratic bill raises the effective national level to and it overrules a sensible bush administration directive that states enroll low income families before subsidizing the middle class thats because the real democratic game here is to turn schip into a new middle class entitlement earlier this year hillary clinton who goes out of her way to emphasize schip as a key mechanism in her new "universal" health care reform introduced congressional legislation that would raise schip eligibility to currently &# for a family of four that move would qualify no less than of american children for public assistance this would also lead to the bizarre circumstance in which a family would be entitled to schip benefits while also paying the alternative minimum tax that is supposed to capture "the rich " according to a heritage foundation analysis if schip is extended nationally to about families would be rich enough to pay the amt while also on schip so what democrats take away with higher taxes under the amt they would vouchsafe to return in government health care for all the era of big government is back and bigger than ever after president bushs veto democrats intend to keep passing their bill a few more times rather than seek a reasonable middle ground with the administration in order to cover genuinely low income children theyre going to try to roll the house opposition and perhaps gain the upper hand for the coming fall budget battles holding firm is going to be difficult because should be allies are fleeing the front lines many republicans are focused on short term pr while even groups that ought to know better like americas health insurance plans the insurance industry lobby and phrma the drug makers lobby have endorsed the schip expansion these big business lobbies are once again selling out taxpayers to appease democrats who will go after them next in any case but most of the blame falls on senate republicans particularly messrs grassley and hatch these leaders on the finance committee created the facade of "bipartisanship" by signing off on the democratic plan whatever its policy results to adapt lenin republicans are making the rope that will be used to hang them under hillarycare ii see related letter "letters to the editor compromise bill sets up a less expensive schip" wsj october
