antiterror vindication you probably havent seen it reported but the guantanamo trial system for enemy combatants won a big victory earlier this week a military appeals court overturned a much ballyhooed decision in june that had dismissed all charges against omar ahmed khadr an al qaeda operative captured on the battlefield in afghanistan in after killing an american serviceman with a grenade the june decision was widely portrayed as a repudiation of the bush administrations antiterror legal policy so perhaps this should be described as vindication under the military commissions act a panel called the combat status review tribunal makes a threshold determination of whether or not terror detainees are enemy combatants before they are moved into military tribunals judge peter brownback ruled in june that the review tribunal had only screened for "enemy combatants " not "unlawful enemy combatants " thus giving his court no jurisdiction never mind that "enemy combatant" is defined in a way that is inherently "unlawful" i e someone who is part of an international terrorist organization and engages in hostilities against the u s in violation of the laws of war the legal hitch was not using the magic word "unlawful " the appeals panel agreed that the review tribunal had not specifically determined that khadr was an unlawful enemy combatant but it also ruled that it wasnt obliged to rather it said judge brownback ought to have considered the unlawfulness of khadrs conduct under common courts martial procedures as defined by the military commissions act to do otherwise let alone dismiss the charges was "contradictory to the statutes clear structure wording and overall intent " theres little doubt how the coming trial will turn out there is a video for instance of khadr preparing explosives to be used against american forces but in the medias current terror narrative its only worth celebrating when the bush administrations judicial rules are overturned when theyre upheld almost nobody notices so we thought youd like to know
