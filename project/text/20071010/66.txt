district here were deserted but one block bubbled with activity inside a new supermarket couples at wrought iron garden tables ate sushi shoppers stocked up on expensive wines stored in a climate controlled room and other customers picked up their dry cleaning ralphs fresh fare which opened in july is the first supermarket in downtown los angeles in years its initial success in sparking activity outside office hours in the normally quiet business center underscores the pent up demand for residential services in the area but it also is a harbinger of significant changes for the district where a growing number of developers are staking billions of dollars in projects to lure middle class and wealthy residents and to create a vibrant round the clock neighborhood among the projects the curtain is set to rise next week for the inaugural concert at the nokia theater part of a &# billion mixed use entertainment and sports development called l a live in the coming months ground work is to start on the &# billion grand avenue hotel retail and residential project about people work in downtown los angeles but only live there momentum for more projects is building some residential units have been created in recent years since the city allowed offices and warehouses to be converted nearly more residences are under construction and are planned key to the success of the push could be mixed use buildings rather than a standalone supermarket the square foot ralphs anchors a new complex of lofts built above the store retailers often follow residents but in this case the supermarket which sells conventional groceries in addition to providing freshly prepared foods and other upscale services is proving to be a catalyst salespeople and executives involved in the loft development say a surprising amount of interest has come from people who noticed the lofts after shopping at ralphs downstairs "we had a woman who bought because she wanted to live above the ralphs " says harlan lee chairman of lee homes inc which jointly developed the project called market lofts with fellow los angeles real estate firm cim group inc "ralphs is a major major draw " nearly half of the lofts whose list prices range from &# to &# have been sold since they hit the market about five months ago some have closed escrow in the last two months since ralphs opened mr lee says the seven story complex which features a pool fitness center club room and plush screening room has attracted single professionals couples and even young families he adds after years of delays the ralphs located on ninth street between flower and hope has quickly become one of the highest selling kroger co stores nationwide according to local officials and business professionals a ralphs spokesman declined to comment ralphss success has helped market lofts sign leases for other street level stores despite a surplus of small retail space in downtown los angeles it has also spurred kroger interest in additional ralphs supermarkets nearby businesspeople involved in the talks say the combination of new retail outlets and condos has been a boon to people like nathan cartwright who runs a downtown artists studio "im loving being able to get a pizza late at night at ralphs " he says leaving the supermarket at the same time "the somethings who are buying lofts have been coming by the studio to buy art as well " creating a new york living experience in los angeles has only just begun but it is gaining traction the developers behind market lofts have three other projects in the area including an office building they salvaged by turning the upper floors into lofts separately two portland ore developers williams &amp dame and gerding edlen development have teamed up to bring high end and "green" certified condos to downtown in yet another nearby project located in a warehouse area that could approximate manhattans former meatpacking district or tribeca upscale lofts in two s industrial buildings have sold briskly yuval bar zemer a partner at linear city llc which converted a toy factory and an old nabisco facility says he expected demand would be driven by people who wanted to cut their commute but only to of those who have bought in the unit toy factory lofts work downtown "that tells us there is something more than convenience to living downtown its the grittiness the sense of being a pioneer in a neighborhood that is evolving " he says in addition to residential units the toy factory lofts building features shops and a restaurant on the ground floor
