the mossberg solution downloadable movies in a box wheres the magic we test convenience of vudu system and find flaws with help from the web and a little extra cash almost everything becomes more convenient groceries are delivered directly to homes using services like peapod rental cars are available in easier to reach locations using zipcar and movie tickets are bought in advance through fandango but how much is too much when it comes to shelling out a little more for convenience and are you really getting what you pay for this week i tested what could be thought of as the ultimate convenience a box that plugs into your television and internet connection letting you download movies whenever you want to watch them the box costs &# and doesnt include the price of movies which must be rented or purchased for fees as high as &# or &# each respectively this box called vudu comes from a silicon valley company of the same name www vudu com vudus biggest strengths are its easy setup good picture quality and simple user interface easily navigated using a scroll wheel remote control if the director yelled "cut " right here vudu would be a box office smash but actually using this device is just one problem after another for starters though vudu says it has relationships with the major hollywood studios many of the titles it offers dont seem to be popular by mainstream standards lots of them are old or obscure for instance you wont find any of the "pirates of the caribbean" movies but how about a sci fi fantasy movie called "the ice pirates " instead if you do find a movie that youd like to watch you must have a bandwidth speed of at least two megabits per second to download it instantly millions of broadband homes have slower connections than that vudu offers to measure your bandwidth on its home page before you buy it i tested vudu for a week on a typical home type dsl line and my connection only clocks about mbps so it took me about minutes to download each movie while vudus &# price tag might take some getting used to its fees for buying or renting each movie could be harder to swallow after a months worth of use as much as &# if you bought one top tier movie a week worse you have to pay in advance rather than charging your credit card on a pay as you go basis vudu customers must choose a &# &# or &# amount at setup from which movie fees are deducted when your account hits &# the amount selected at setup is charged and the debit process begins again on top of all this vudu relies on a peer to peer network system for faster downloading so essentially this company is using your bandwidth to help it save money it would have otherwise spent on its own servers and bandwidth i set up vudu in a snap plugging it into three things a wall outlet the back of a high definition sony bravia television and an ethernet cord wireless connections wont work with vudu without a special "bridge" or a power line adapter once vudu turned on a friendly voice guided me through setting it up and i got started in minutes vudus home screen is broken down into five menus find movies new releases my movies my wish list and info &amp settings i used the tiny remote which fits perfectly in a hand and rolled through menus using its scroll wheel this wheel can be pressed down to select something saving me from glancing down at the buttons also vudu uses an rf radio frequency antenna so you dont have to point the remote at it in find movies i looked through genres including biography romance family and historical a sorting feature can filter movies by release date mpaa rating critics rating studio availability to rent and availability to own an on screen alphabet can be used to type in names of actors directors or movie titles the scroll wheel speeds up this process parental controls which are only accessible with a special code can be set to block a child from buying or renting movies with certain ratings vudu likes to think of itself as the instant gratification alternative to running to the video store but not many people i know still go to blockbuster for a dvd instead they use mail delivery services like netflix compared with the titles offered by netflix the selection at vudu is pretty slim a more similar comparison might be amazons unbox for tivo which has slightly less than movies though i couldnt find numerous titles i did discover plenty of movies id never heard of a search for last years "casino royale" returned robert deniros "casino" from as well as two asian films "casino tycoon" and "casino tycoon ii " since i never saw helen mirrens "the queen " i tried to find her oscar winning performance on vudu but the closest i came to royalty were "barbarella queen of the galaxy " an alternative name for the cheesy jane fonda sci fi flick and "prom queen " which fell under the gay and lesbian category i tried to laugh this off by watching steve carells "evan almighty " but typing "e v a " into a title search only returned "deliver us from eva " an r rated comedy starring ll cool j i searched and found the same three titles on netflix though amazon unbox only had "evan almighty " i downloaded two romantic comedies "music and lyrics " starring hugh grant a &# rental and a diane keaton movie called "because i said so " which i bought for &# i also rented "zodiac " a suspense movie starring jake gyllenhaal for &# movies that you own never expire but rented flicks must be watched within days and expire hours after you start watching in the case of each movie the original estimates for time to download were daunting two started out by estimating "available in a few hours" and one movies estimate read "available in a few days " but all three finished downloading in about to minutes only one movie can download at a time while watching movies the remotes scroll wheel can be used to fast forward or rewind scenes scrolling faster moves you farther ahead or back the fastest jump moves you minutes the slowest scroll moves you ahead or back five seconds vudu might cast a spell on users who dont mind its poor selection and high bandwidth requirement to deliver instant downloads but for me the convenience of vudu is no convenience at all as is its lackluster selection high prices and slow downloads make it more of a letdown than anything else edited by walter s mossberg email
