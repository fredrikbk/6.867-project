why m&amp a boom in digital marketing should remain hot questions for anton levy company private equity firm general atlantic llc title managing director are the softening economy and credit crunch enough to cool down the overheated merger boom in digital marketing at least one active player thinks not anton levy managing director of general atlantic llcs media and consumer practice notes that digital marketing is still a "high growth category" compared with marketing on traditional media that growth has driven a surge in online media and marketing deals lifting merger and acquisition activity in media to a record this year according to jordan edmiston group a new york investment bank over the past years general atlantic of greenwich conn has invested &# billion in the media and consumer sector more recently it has been paying increased attention to the digital space earlier this year general atlantic beat out ad titan wpp group plc to purchase a majority stake in online ad firm akqa now it is helping the san francisco firm buy other digital assets general atlantics other digital plays include funding zagat com a restaurant and consumer review service and buying network solutions a provider of web address registrations mr anton years old is a key player in the firms digital push he talks below about the m&amp a market in digital marketing and private equitys expanding presence on madison avenue the wall street journal hellman &amp friedman was one of the early private equity players on madison avenue now the advertising and marketing landscape is a hotbed of private equity and venture capital activity why mr levy i think a couple of things one is the secular trends in the overall marketing services marketplace are particularly attractive for growth investors like ourselves you have got this massive shift that you are seeing where all consumable media is trending towards digital environments and the huge ad dollars that are going to follow that audience that large secular trend is creating a lot of different things its creating new business models current companies are trying to adjust their existing business models and a massive amount of people and talent are being attracted to the space wsj years ago the advertising holding companies didnt have much competition when it came to buying up small ad firms what do you offer companies looking for a buyer mr levy i think there are a number of assets that private equity players like ourselves bring to the table one is the opportunities for continued independence for a business two we provide a different kind of economic culture that is very much an equity driven culture that a company may want to retain the third piece is preserving that firms existing culture akqa is a great example of that tom tom bedecarre chief executive of akqa will tell you they have a very special culture and they are very sensitive about retaining that culture becoming part of a much larger organization the risk is that they could lose that culture the other couple of things are flexibility and speed being an independent player with private equity money there is an opportunity to be nimble and quick wsj do you think the credit market woes have the potential to disrupt the current surge in the digital marketing m&amp a space mr levy folks like google yahoo microsoft and time warners aol i think you will see those groups likely to be less affected by some of the macromarket environment issues like the credit market i think they will largely be unaffected folks like ourselves in the growth equity part of the private equity market will also be less affected by the credit market environment so within digital media which is really a high growth category i think you will see less of an impact wsj are valuations on digital ad and marketing companies still rising how long do you think that will continue mr levy i dont know if they are rising they are clearly at frothy levels for this area you are likely to see that continue in the near term there are a lot of strategic buyers that are looking to buy innovation that has been harder for them to grow in house i dont think you will see that slow down i think you will see that continue for the next to months for attractive businesses you are going to continue to see full prices i think you are going to continue to see growth private equity players like ourselves continue to play weve got akqa and weve got an investment in a couple other companies like mercadolibre an ebay like trading platform in latin america i think you are going to see some of the traditional large media companies both on the large ad agency side and the media side continue to buy innovation and talent wsj with valuations of digital firms so high how hard is it to make sure acquisitions pay off how do you make money mr levy from the private equity perspective we are really focused on the strategic acquisitions we are not looking at roll ups we are very focused on how do you leverage a distribution base how do we leverage a brand how do we leverage a customer base and how do we leverage a product portfolio so when you buy somebody there are true synergies that you can leverage right out of the gate wsj what are some of the current hot m&amp a properties in digital marketing space mr levy id say there are a couple of areas that are interesting at this point you are seeing a number of assets in the digital exchange marketplace you are seeing an explosion of advertising networks you have seen a lot m&amp a activity in that area and you will see the area continue to be attractive for investors another area is better targeted advertising anybody who is able to come to the table and help marketers better target customers is attractive
