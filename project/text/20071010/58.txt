families rethink their estate plans with the fate of the federal tax still up in the air advisers are telling clients to stay flexible when to use a disclaimer after flirting with death the estate tax now looks like it isnt going away anytime soon and thats creating headaches for wealthy families and their advisers instead of having an estate plan thats set in stone many people have been flocking to flexible strategies that can help minimize taxes but can still be adjusted as tax laws and circumstances change among the tactics creating provisions in wills and trusts that give beneficiaries or trustees power to make changes as laws and family financial situations change at the same time more people are opting for plans that allow their heirs to "disclaim " or decline part of their inheritance thereby reducing their estate or theyre using simple measures with little or no risk or setup costs to benefit their families and trim their estates such as making annual gifts to family members or setting up special short term trusts right now the estate tax system is in a state of flux thanks to tax laws passed in in recent years advisers say that some clients were essentially frozen and unwilling to enter into expensive estate tax savings plans because they were hoping that the tax would soon disappear or be substantially reduced they didnt want to enter into a complex tax saving trust or other strategy or be subject to hefty gift taxes if the estate tax were to go away currently the amount that can be exempted from federal estate taxes is &# million per person but that number rises to &# million in spouses can typically leave an unlimited amount to each other then the tax is slated to disappear altogether in but it comes back with a vengeance the following year when the exemption reverts to just &# million the top federal estate tax rate on the largest estates is until then rises to in when the law was passed no one expected the uncertainty to drag on this long and the betting in washington is that congress will alter the law in the next couple of years most likely before the estate tax evaporates but not until after next years elections estate tax experts now think its unlikely that the tax will be repealed though the exemption may well be raised and the tax rate lowered as a result many advisers are recommending that clients keep their options open and stay flexible adding to the confusion more states have begun imposing their own estate taxes nearly half of the states now levy estate or inheritance taxes says bruno graziano at cch a riverwoods ill unit of wolters kluwer some states impose much lower exemptions meaning that more money may be subject to estate taxes "were talking about how we can help our clients continue to transfer wealth in as risk free a way as we can because the estate tax is still a moving target " says beth rodriguez who heads wealth advisory services for jpmorgan private bank a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co "people have been more sanguine with the fact that the estate tax isnt likely to be repealed " pittsburgh resident thomas kohr a year old retiree just changed his will on the advice of his lawyer james lange giving his heirs more flexibility "the idea that i dont have to make a decision now but allow my heirs to have the decision making depending on what the laws are at that point in time really makes sense " says mr kohr other families are simply adopting a "wait and see" approach dolores valdez and her husband robert have lived in the same san francisco house for nearly years the house has appreciated substantially in value which could cause their estate to be taxable depending on the tax laws when they die their lawyer michael gilfix of palo alto calif has suggested some estate tax savings tactics but the couple isnt leaping into action yet "my husband wants to wait and see what happens next year and the following year " says ms valdez "it depends on what the government does and also depends on our health " many people are affected when the exemption amount changes according to new data from the irs the number of estate tax returns has dropped by more than from to from about to only and only of those returns were taxable estate tax watchers expect that congress will ultimately reach a compromise on the estate tax that may include raising the basic exemption and cutting the top rate the basic federal estate tax exclusion might rise to somewhere between &# million and &# million says clint stretch managing principal of tax policy at deloitte tax llp theres much less agreement on where the top rate will go with estimates ranging from to around mr stretch says "anyone who says they know whats going to happen between now and is clairvoyant or deranged " says john scroggin a roswell ga lawyer "the problem is that we have to plan for two radically different paths one path is higher exemptions although we dont have a clue where that number is the other possibility is much lower exemptions and higher tax rates in " in this era of uncertainty advisers are suggesting a variety of tactics often depending on the age health and wealth of their clients the trickiest cases advisers say are those individuals with roughly &# million to &# million who may or may not be subject to estate taxes depending on the law at the time of their death clients with a substantially higher net worth they say should generally plan on being subject to estate taxes "the reality is even if they finally come to an agreement about the estate tax for most of our clients the laws will change many many more times before they die " says las vegas estate lawyer steven oshins "it would be short sighted to react too strongly to what is taking place in the near future and fail to see the big picture if the person is wealthy somehow the irs is going to tax them regardless of what particular year that person ends up dying " lawyers are also creating detailed wills and trust documents that allow for alternative provisions if the federal estate tax is modified or repealed mr oshinss standard trust documents for instance have roughly two pages of very small print giving independent trustees the power to amend the documents to take advantage of changes in the law one popular tactic is to set up disclaimer provisions in wills especially if an inheritance could cause heirs estates to be subject to federal or state estate taxes this strategy allows heirs to make decisions based on their financial situations and tax laws at the time they receive the inheritance rather than when the estate plans were made disclaimers however are subject to many rules so make sure to discuss the decision with your lawyer for one thing a will must set out ahead of time a chain of people to disclaim to since many people are wary of entering into pricey tax savings plans if they may not be subject to taxes in the future advisers are also recommending a very simple strategy that incurs virtually no setup costs giving money away to family members while youre still alive you can give away as much as &# this year to anyone you want and to as many people as you wish without any gift tax considerations you dont even have to report your gift you can also directly pay family members tuition and medical bills without incurring gift taxes another popular if more complex gift strategy is a "grantor retained annuity trust " or grat these trusts whose lifespan can be as short as two years are popular with families who have assets that are expected to increase in value such as pre ipo or depressed stock if the assets perform well much of the appreciation in the trust can pass to heirs tax free when the trust ends one caveat if you die during the trusts term trust assets could be taxed as part of your estate defeating the trusts purpose still advisers say that the trusts have little downside or tax risk though setup fees can range from &# to more than &# and because they are short term youre not locking your money away for the long haul if circumstances change dramatically estate planners say that their grat business is brisk jpmorgan private bank for example has done four times as many grats this year as last jpmorgan is also developing new strategies to help clients transfer assets during their lifetime to their heirs without generating big gift tax hits which are currently for instance the firm is developing an "estate freeze" strategy which much like a grat allows appreciation of certain assets such as stock in a family business to be transferred with reduced gift or estate tax exposure tom herman contributed to this article where theres a will with the future of the estate tax uncertain estate planners and their clients are turning to flexible strategies that can be adjusted as the laws change people are writing flexible provisions in wills and trusts giving heirs or trustees the power to make changes some are opting for simple tactics with little or no risk such as making annual gifts or setting up short term plans others are simply taking a wait and see approach and putting off major decisions
