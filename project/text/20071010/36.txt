constitution wasnt carved on stone tablet in regard to steven calabresis oct editorial page commentary "the right judicial litmus test" a non lawyers view of "originalism" in deciding constitutional issues might be an interesting counterpoint to mr calabresis essay extolling its virtues originalists feel that the original intent of the framers is the only criterion that should be used in deciding constitutional issues the philosophy of a "living" constitution is the alternative that gives originalists such heartburn in that case a more expansive but still precedent oriented interpretation of the constitution is embraced one that recognizes that over the past years our country has become technologically advanced more diverse and better educated the constitution is remarkably unclear in many places and for someone to claim that only they have the key is absurd lets look at three examples the first amendment is about as clear as it gets "congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press " but its very clarity creates a problem robert bork says that the phrase referring to speech cant be taken literally that some forms of speech can be proscribed how can an originalist take that position so can some art forms qualify as speech can the right to spend millions on political attack ads be regulated it would be unfortunate if mr calabresi and mr bork were the sole arbiters all points of view should be considered by the courts the second amendment deals with the rights of the people within a well regulated militia to bear arms does it apply to machine guns to grenade launchers to vigilante groups to the guy in the street rights for those sorts or weapons and people cant have been the original intent since such weapons of mass destruction were unknown and the term "well regulated" doesnt apply to vigilantes so someone has to decide these issues and a better decision is likely to emerge if the courts are exposed to all judicial philosophies another example is the ninth amendment "the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people " mr bork says that "there is almost no history that would indicate what the ninth amendment was intended to accomplish " then he asserts that it could only refer to rights that might be granted by the states the judicial activism there is breathtaking an average guy would take the words at face value we have rights that are not explicitly mentioned in the constitution privacy comes to mind mr calabresi wants to impose originalism on everyone to the guy in the street it doesnt pass the red face test there are obvious cases where originalism leads to absurd results life is more complicated than that simplistic approach to important constitutional issues richard c dahlberg la jolla calif mr calabresi underscores the importance of nominating justices who will follow our written constitution he references roe v wade and shows how far the courts have traveled in their violation of the separation of powers and points out that "no sane framer of a constitution would ever have written a document that required bicameralism and the presidents signature to pass ordinary laws while leaving the most sensitive issues of morality and religion up to an unelected unaccountable life tenured elite group of judges " in this he is in the excellent company of ronald reagan in his essay "abortion and the conscience of the nation " president reagan wrote "make no mistake abortion on demand is not a right granted by the constitution no serious scholar including one disposed to agree with the courts result has argued that the framers of the constitution intended to create such a right " president reagans complete essay is available online in the historic documents archive of patriotpost us lets hope that our next president will adopt mr calabresis originalism and nominate judges to enforce our constitution not rewrite it lee robey savannah ga
