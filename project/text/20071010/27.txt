cellphone gear pushes frontier a small box that boasts the capabilities of a cellular tower could lead to big legal and service problems for telecom companies particularly sprint nextel corp the femtocell box which can be sold to consumers boosts cellphone reception in the immediate area by using the surrounding licensed spectrum to route wireless calls back to the central office through a wired high speed internet connection typically a home dsl or cable line the industry especially those wireless operators without a landline business is exploring femtocells as a way to expand their presence in the home sprint nextel is selling the devices in two markets in a limited trial run the service works fine as long as the femtocell remains in the test market where it borrows sprints own licensed spectrum but problems can arise when that box is taken to an area where the carrier no longer owns any wireless licenses forcing the femtocell to illegally "borrow" from someone else causing interference for customers around that device femtocells portability could make it the illegal cable box of the cellular generation "it may be an issue to the carriers who have the license for that particular spectrum " said paul glenchur an analyst at washington d c based stanford group "i think theres a legal issue with that " to combat improper use sprint has installed a global positioning system into samsung electronics co s airave femtocells that restrict their use to the two launch markets according to sprint spokeswoman emmy anderson she added that the femtocells are designed to work only with sprint phones when sprint rolls out the service nationwide early next year it will remove the gps restrictions although it will leave the capability for emergency and location based services without the limitations sprint customers can have a portable cellular tower they can take anywhere other tech savvy subscribers meanwhile could pick up the box and tamper with it so it works with other carrier networks according to some tech watchers proliferation of these femtocells could mimic the spread of illegal cable boxes which unscramble premium channels and can be taken from home to home a black market for cellular signal boosters already exists and broader awareness generated by sprints nationwide push could expand interest in the area observers warn "sprint has these high ideas but they may not have thought through all of the security issues " said emil olbrich an engineering consultant for protiro inc "its just a matter of time before people start getting access to hacking it i can almost guarantee it " others however are skeptical that many consumers will illegally use their femtocells "i doubt that would be possible " said joe ross co founder of consulting firm televate llc adding there are likely security measures in the network "i would presume there are safeguards in place to prevent that " indeed the airave wont work where sprint doesnt own licensed spectrum and isnt compatible with other carrier phones "its specifically designed not to allow that to happen " said jim parker who manages wireless infrastructure for samsungs u s telecom business the federal communications commission has yet to look at the femtocell issue the agency has a few rules governing how existing cellular signal boosters which have been on the market for a while can operate basically a booster is allowed as long as it doesnt cause any interference but femtocells by illegally using another carriers spectrum would make it difficult for other customers around it to make calls "if everyone uses femtocells without their carriers knowledge then it will lead to mass interference " said joe farrin a spokesman for the wireless trade group ctia "theres a reason why that policy is in place " to combat illegal action carriers could police the use of femtocells they could track down illegal users by "pinging" the network to get a location of the device using the box but the industry is working to avoid that because it is burdensome to constantly monitor the network "that wouldnt be the preferred way " said richard burns who runs mobile network services for at&amp t inc femtocells are part of a larger effort by wireless carriers to take cellular calls off of its network when indoors particularly in the home deutsche telekom ags t mobile usa unit has a similar set up which uses a wi fi router and dual band handsets that can move between a cellular and wi fi connection wi fi however uses unlicensed spectrum that while less secure can be used freely carriers and telecom equipment vendors have long touted the potential of providing constant wireless coverage with seamless handoffs between different networks both sprint and t mobile offer unlimited wireless minutes at a flat rate when making calls at home they like the feature because it takes calls off of their wireless network reducing the need for costly infrastructure as traffic increases customers meanwhile have a more reliable phone line "i think its something that has the potential to catch on quite a bit " mr glenchur said at&amp t is exploring the use of femtocell technology to boost coverage in its own network but is treading slowly given the potential regulatory pitfall it is also looking at wi fi as an option "were looking at one or the other " mr burns said "it wont be clear in the near term " it is no coincidence that sprint and t mobile have been more aggressive in pushing technology that would replace the home phone neither company has a landline business to support at&amp t and verizon wireless parent verizon communications inc must deal with a deteriorating base of wireline customers and are likely hesitant to embrace technology that would speed up that trend "they probably would want to be careful with what equipment gets deployed on their network " mr glenchur said
