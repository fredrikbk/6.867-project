business recognizing the value of older directors when univest chief executive william aichele wants advice he doesnt call consultants or read management guru peter drucker instead he visits an th century farmhouse in bedminster pa and chats on a sun porch with his financial service companys oldest director year old charles hoeflich in popular culture we adore elderly mentors look at movies such as "the karate kid" or almost anything with morgan freeman in it or consider "tuesdays with morrie " the best selling book about a sportswriters reunions with a dying college professor but in boardrooms these days it is rare perhaps too rare for old timers voices to be heard many boards now require directors to retire at age or the corporate library a portland maine research group recently calculated that the average american directors age has dropped to down from just four years ago as modern directors get swept up with late night conference calls torrents of email and six hour audit committee meetings it is easy to see why youthful stamina is prized among the experts who think this antiseniority trend has gone too far is r glenn hubbard the year old dean of columbia business school in new york "there are so many retired ceos aged to with all this experience " he says "whats more theyve got time available which active executives dont its a shame to lose their expertise " at their best older directors provide unique wisdom common sense and institutional memory they help keep faith in a solid operating unit that has suffered a brief setback they also sound the alarm on bad ideas while it is still possible to back away cheaply examples involve such issues as tempting foreign deals with potentially corrupt partners and overpriced acquisitions at cubic corp a san diego defense and transportation concern executives a few years ago wanted to acquire a military balloon business that was projecting rapid growth walter zable the companys founder and chairman said no mr zables sticking point all of the balloon makers growth was due to come from overseas markets "the business was flat domestically " and that was a big warning flag he subsequently explained over the years mr zable now had analyzed a lot of businesses if companies couldnt grow in their home markets he found new customers seldom appeared magically abroad of course age takes its toll in many cases stories abound of elderly directors losing focus or napping in the boardroom founders or their heirs may control so much voting stock that it is impossible to unseat them even deep in their dotage it is no wonder that many companies have turned to mandatory retirement to keep the boardroom from turning into a kremlin style gerontocracy but everyone ages differently some people are spent forces by their s others remain strong into their s or beyond for that reason mandatory retirement ages seem like a clumsy almost cowardly way of getting rid of deadwood as peter gleason chief operating officer of the national association of corporate directors puts it "if someone is sharp as a tack at age why get rid of him or her " for an extreme example of staying power as the years pile up it is hard to beat mr hoeflich who retired more than two decades ago as ceo of univest corp of pennsylvania at age he drives a cadillac coupe deville briskly enough on winding side roads that it is hard for a visitor following behind to keep up with him he reads books three at a time his current lineup consists of alan greenspans memoir a work by pope benedict xvi and a john grisham novel mr hoeflich owns just of univests stock so he is in no position to claim a lifetime board seat on the strength of his shareholding instead his impact comes from sharing lessons of a year career in banking that is well suited to souderton pa based univest which operates a few dozen small town bank branches mr hoeflichs timeless advice about building close ties to local communities and getting to know borrowers character still rings true a powerful director mr hoeflich is chairman of univests compensation panel he also sits on the five member executive committee which engages in the most detailed discussions with management his biggest role though may be in one on one chats at his farmhouse with mr aichele the year old ceo "ive known charlie since i was " mr aichele says "he hired me i was in awe of him at first " now the younger man has a much deeper grasp of some issues such as internet banking than his mentor does but on some banking basics mr aichele still wants the older mans counsel "when i did two acquisitions in i spent hours at charlies house talking about integration issues and personnel " mr aichele says "these were my first acquisitions hed been doing them for years there was a lot i could learn from him "
