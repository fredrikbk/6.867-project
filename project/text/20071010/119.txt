republicans spar on economy giuliani romney argue over spending records thompson joins fray dearborn mich rudy giuliani and mitt romney sparred over their tax and spending records as republican presidential candidates met for their latest debate joined for the first time by former sen fred thompson meeting in a troubled manufacturing state to focus largely on economic issues the nine candidates agreed on much including that their party has been guilty of overspending in recent years the debate was sponsored by the wall street journal cnbc and msnbc but several reflected skepticism about free trade that is gaining hold in both political parties the others while professedly free traders acknowledged widespread job losses as a consequence of globalism and a public sense that trading partners particularly china are taking advantage of the u s mr thompson seemed halting at first but overall provided more concise answers than he has on the campaign trail he called for reining in social security benefits over time and while supporting free trade several times chastised china for devaluing its currency to increase its exports thompson aides sought to lower expectations beforehand but the former actor had already done so though many demoralized conservatives had hoped he would fill a perceived void in the republican field mr thompsons low energy style and gaffes since his entry into the race last month disappointed some would be supporters at one point mr romney took a dig at mr thompson who leads him in national polls "is this our sixth debate " mr romney dryly asked the others referring to the television show that featured mr thompson mr romney continued "this is a lot like law &amp order senator it has a huge cast the series seems to go on forever and fred thompson shows up at the end " of all the forums to date this one featured the most direct confrontation yet between messrs giuliani and romney over their respective fiscal records and over who best could take on democratic front runner hillary clinton mr thompson stood stonily between them the onetime republican front runner arizona sen john mccain at times revived his self professed role as a straight talker opposing the ethanol subsidies important to iowa the first nominating state standing up to anti immigrant rhetoric from rep tom tancredo of colorado and calling for reductions in social securitys and medicares growth none of the candidates came out against free trade long a fundamental party position but former arkansas gov mike huckabee and reps tancredo and duncan hunter of california struck the most populist notes mr hunter implicitly criticized the bush administration record on enforcing trade agreements terms while mr tancredo lamented his vote to give president bush authority to get congressional approval of trade pacts without amendments mr thompson defended the u s trade record saying "so far theres been more jobs gained free and fair trade has been wonderful for america " mr mccain said "it sounds like a lot of fun to bash the chinese and others " but "free trade should be the continuing principle that guides this nations economy " invoking president ronald reagan he later said "all this bashing free trade he must be spinning in his grave " while messrs mccain and tancredo both cited the costs of entitlement programs social security and medicare mr thompson has made it something of a signature issue in his fledgling campaign "we are spending money we do not have " he said referring to the programs growth which will balloon as baby boomers begin retiring after while he has proposed no solutions he called the trends "the foremost challenge facing our country economically " he said social security costs could be forestalled by changing the formula for retirees initial benefits to link to inflation rather than wages which rise faster public dismay last year over high spending and in particular over the proliferation of spending earmarks for lawmakers special projects was a big factor in republicans loss of their house majority but mr tancredo said "its not earmarks that push spending you must look at social security and medicare " for days before the debate messrs giuliani and romney battled in news releases and speeches over who had the better record on tax cuts and spending mr romney the former massachusetts governor or mr giuliani the ex mayor of new york on stage they faced off mr romney said both wanted low taxes and spending but differed over a line item veto mr romney favors one for the president to delete individual items in appropriations bills that congress passes he noted in what has become a frequent criticism that as mayor mr giuliani joined a lawsuit challenging the line item veto that suit went to the supreme court which declared it unconstitutional "id have never gone to the supreme court to argue its unconstitutional " mr romney chided mr giuliani snapped back "the line item veto is unconstitutional so you can bang your head up against the stone wall all you want " he continued "if i had let president clinton take &# million away from the people of my city illegally and unconstitutionally i wouldnt have been much of a mayor " at other points the two men seemed to be taking turns at auditioning for who could best attack new york sen clinton in a general election campaign mr giuliani mocked her for espousing "baby bonds" for each new american an idea she recently floated but never actually proposed and for her new idea made yesterday to provide as much as &# in tax credits to match the retirement savings of low and middle income workers rep ron paul of texas a libertarian who has gained a strong following through the internet injected the most dissenting notes on the republican discussion on economics he blamed income inequity and the trade imbalance on the monetary system and wall street and charged that "we have lived beyond our means because we are financing a foreign policy that is so extravagant and beyond what we can control " mr mccain called for a "fairer simpler code" for income taxes drawing some of the biggest applause of the afternoon from the audience all the democratic contenders have called for raising tax revenues mostly by lifting the bush tax cuts for the richest americans but the republicans are for making those tax cuts permanent and generally agreed americans remain overtaxed "were taxed to the max " said sen sam brownback of kansas
