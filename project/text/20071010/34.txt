common sense lesson from awful august never sell in time of panic smartmoney now it can be said with certainty with stocks above their july peaks last week the august market turmoil was indeed a buying opportunity the recent market records and the intervening months provide a good opportunity to assess what weve learned too often investors are so preoccupied with the future whats going to happen next that they miss some obvious lessons from the recent past to quote philosopher george santayana "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it " here are some of my conclusions theres something to be said for the old fashioned buy and hold approach while adroit traders had plenty of profit opportunities amidst the wrenching volatility there were plenty of pitfalls too witness the closing of several prominent hedge funds amidst massive losses you could have slept through the entire credit crisis done nothing and still come out ahead without paying any trading commissions never sell in a panic i find you cant repeat this too often on aug when markets hit their low for this period trading volume was massive and the panic selling was palpable for every buyer there was a seller no one has stepped forward to admit selling at the bottom but there must have been millions of people doing it some may have been forced to do so by margin calls but everyone else should look in the mirror and vow never to do it again panic selling should only be assessed as an opportunity to buy never to sell leverage is dangerous many readers have asked me why if stocks have always risen over the long term i dont use leverage to boost returns the answer is the short term as we saw this summer another group of geniuses got wiped out i dont pretend to be a genius and i want to sleep peacefully at night i never want to be forced to sell by margin calls the higher returns just arent worth the higher risk the s&amp p stock index is up this year even if your results are only average whats so bad about that central bankers wont let a desire to punish imprudent speculators get in the way of their central mission to protect the smooth functioning of financial markets much has been made of the existence of a "bernanke put " the notion that the federal reserve will bail out speculators by cutting interest rates but to me this misses the point for one thing many speculators werent saved by the feds cut but more fundamentally the feds job is neither to punish nor reward individual investors as best i can tell fed chairman ben bernanke was appropriately indifferent to the effect of rate cuts on certain prominent wall street managers his job is to protect the rest of us by focusing on price stability economic growth and the functioning of capital markets whether the fed was wise to cut rates by a half point remains to be seen but we have every reason to believe that the feds motive in doing so was consistent with that mission there will always be volatility in markets and accompanying buying and selling opportunities if you missed this short lived correction and are chastising yourself for failing to take advantage of it rest assured you will get another chance eventually there will be another correction with accompanying panic and dire forecasts earlier this summer volatility was so low that people were wondering if global liquidity really had smoothed out the usual bumps of investing now we know it hasnt risk remains a fact of life embrace it and be prepared next time james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see smartmoney com commonsense
