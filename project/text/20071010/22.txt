business bookshelf ingredients of a family fortune mcilhennys gold by jeffrey rothfeder collins pages &# from the time i tapped the first few drops of tabasco onto the boiled crawfish i caught as a boy in south louisianas bayous it was love at first bite i can remember the slender bottle with its red cap and diamond shaped label standing in quiet superiority alongside the salt and pepper shakers on the kitchen table tabasco was a staple of my cajun home and i have cooked faithfully with it ever since millions of americans most of them it is safe to say without a cajun background seem to share my enthusiasm how did tabasco become so to speak so hot as the legend goes a louisiana banker named edmund mcilhenny his familys avery island plantation in ruins after the civil war took the seeds of a mexican pepper given to him by a confederate soldier and began a condiment business in the forerunner of todays company and the origins of a brand name now recognized throughout the world in "mcilhennys gold " jeffrey rothfeder a former businessweek editor sets himself the ambitious goal of testing the truth of this founding legend and of drawing a historical profile of one of the oldest and most profitable family businesses in u s history he does an impressive job of assembling historical documents ancient newspaper clippings and interviews with former factory workers competitors and family members though no mcilhennys actively involved in the business on avery island would cooperate he admits that sometimes "peoples inherited recollections of decades or centuries old incidents were all i had to work with " but the result is valuable as a general corrective to a record overloaded with secondhand tales today mr rothfeder reports mcilhenny co is a business with &# million in annual revenue still closely held despite buyout offers of &# billion the company produces as many as two ounce bottles of its signature product a day selling it in more than countries with profit margins according to the author of or more and yet for all the products familiarity the family behind the sauce remains something of a mystery still operating from remote avery island part of southern louisianas acadian gothic landscape of high canopies and moss hung cypress trees the story actually begins in the pre civil war era with a new orleans plantation owner named maunsel white who was famous for the food served at his sumptuous dinner parties mr whites table no doubt groaned with the regions varied fare drawing inspiration from european caribbean and cajun sources but one of his favorite sauces was of his own devising made from a pepper named for its origins in the mexican state of tabasco white added the sauce to various dishes and bottled it for his guests "although the mcilhennys have tried to dismiss the possibility " mr rothfeder writes "it seems clear now that in a full two decades before edmund mcilhenny professed to discover the tabasco pepper white was already growing tabasco chilies on his plantation " the authors evidence a letter to the news orleans daily delta newspaper attesting that the "tobasco" is "a new species of red pepper which colonel white has introduced into this country " if nothing else mr rothfeder concludes the mcilhenny sauce was inspired by whites recipe it is certainly true that edmund mcilhenny began bottling and selling e mcilhenny tabasco pepper sauce in the late s some of the first bottles he sold were bought by union soldiers still billeted in the south and enamored of the sauce that lent a dash of spice to bland army rations the product soon spread far and wide and fast thanks in part to a deal with a big national distributor mr rothfeder quotes a letter from a british soldier in india to his mother in "i want to call your attention to a sauce its called tabasco pepper sauce and seemingly emanates from a man e mcilhenny new iberia louisiana a drop or two in soup stew or mixed around with mashed potatoes gives one a great appetite " the concoction was made in a factory town built on a remote island in louisianas bayous that is seemingly designed for hot sauce production avery island is actually a salt dome with vast supplies of one of tabasco sauces essential ingredients but a great part of the sauces early success was owed to the mcilhenny familys business acumen given tabascos three simple ingredients vinegar pepper mash and salt competitors who had been using the tabasco pepper in their own sauces were stunned in when the mcilhennys were awarded a trademark for the word "tabasco " it was as if someone had claimed the word "mustard " the head of the company edmund mcilhennys eldest son john was a former rough rider and a close friend of president theodore roosevelts rival companies suspected that the friendship influenced the governments decision mr rothfeder says but they couldnt prove it the trademark was later successfully defended in court and today stands as an american business rarity a trademark that is also the name of a generic ingredient the mcilhennys have vigilantly enforced their rights ever since but the primary reason that tabasco has dominated the hot sauce category is the consistency of its flavor and spiciness when i talked with louisianas celebrated chef paul prudhomme for an article i wrote about mcilhenny co in this newspaper several years ago he told me that other sauces could be unpredictably too hot or too tart or too salty "i may use drops of tabasco but i can trust that drops " mr prudhomme said edmund mcilhenny with help from a small group of ex slaves and close friends had relied on intuition not laboratory tests to mix his recipe with remarkable results "that edmund mcilhenny instinctually navigated a near flawless balance between heat and flavor when he invented tabasco sauce is either dumb luck or yet another indication of his commercial genius " mr rothfeder writes though the company now offers several flavors of tabasco including a sweet &amp spicy variety not much has changed about making the classic sauce over the past years hand picked peppers a particular shade of red mixed with salt and vinegar and aged three years in wooden barrels that formerly held jack daniels whiskey the mcilhenny process actually dampens the scoville units or heat level in the tabasco pepper which would be intolerable to eat raw "mcilhennys gold" offers plenty of family business lessons particularly on succession planning every mcilhenny chief executive has been a direct descendant of the company founder except for a brief turbulent time in the late s and each has been as colorful as the last in addition to john mcilhenny the rough rider the list includes edward "mr ned" avery mcilhenny a bon vivant and naturalist walter stauffer "tabasco mac" mcilhenny a world war ii sharpshooter and the current chief executive paul mcilhenny a man who once offered "the worlds largest bloody mary" to french quarter revelers not all of these company leaders had the founders astute business sense but each managed to keep the company profitable certainly running mcilhenny co today is infinitely more complicated than in edmunds time and mr rothfeder outlines the challenges the mcilhennys have faced in the s confronted with a shortage of pepper mash the company had to move its pepper cultivation to latin america by the s the rising popularity of salsa buffalo wings and other hot spicy foods began to threaten tabascos dominance as a one stop heat source and today the swelling number of shareholding mcilhenny heirs more than of them has made managing the companys fortunes far more complex than before mr rothfeder offers a glum assessment of mcilhenny co s current state "by apparently neglecting the companys challenges paul mcilhenny has further tempted the ire of the younger shareholders who are increasingly impatient with the businesss torpid pace of growth and the lack of imagination in the executive suite " the author suggests that "the unthinkable" could happen a shareholder revolt and the sale of the company sections of "mcilhennys gold" are evocative and gracefully written when john mcilhenny hosted a memorable debutante ball deep in the companys salt mine in "lacy coruscating light glinted off french candelabras onto the crystalline walls ceilings and floors " but other sections lapse into boilerplate for example the first chapter concludes "edmund took with him hard earned and invaluable lessons about creating promoting and managing a decidedly competitive business which he would use again to his advantage " but even if mr rothfeders style is not as consistently flavorful as the sauce hes describing the mcilhenny story itself is pure gold mr robichaux
