anheusers bulls nothing beats bud rivals deal may help the stock not hurt it dont count out the king bud bulls were unfazed yesterday as shares of anheuser busch cos fell less than on word that sabmiller plc and molson coors brewing co were forming a joint venture that would establish a new no brewer in the u s while anheuser busch will continue to hold a share of the u s beer market through its flagship budweiser and bud light brands the new competitor will have a share by combining sales of beers such as coors light and miller lite and the frontal assault on anheusers home turf comes as the st louis company has faltered internationally failing to keep pace with rivals such as sab or inbev which each have stolen a march into emerging markets that along with negligible growth in recent years in u s beer sales has taken a toll on anheuser its shares have posted a gain over the past five years as sab and inbev have surpassed anheuser in market value inbev even grabbed the bragging rights to being the worlds largest brewer sab is now no in terms of the volume of beer sold after inbev while anheuser the former market leader is no the silver lining this latest attack isnt likely to seriously dent anheuser buschs performance in the u s it also may prompt the companys management to take some international action possibly a merger that would give the company greater entry to south america eastern europe and india anheuser busch declined to comment on the sab molson coors deal or any deals speculation chief executive august busch iv wrote in a memo which was seen by the wall street journal to wholesalers and employees that "we must not lose sight of the fact that this joint venture represents an attempt by those companies to better compete against us " for starters the sab molson coors deal was done out of weakness and is all about cost cutting which highlights anheusers strengths the two companies expect to see savings of about &# million annually thanks to lower costs for transportation and marketing but that is an acknowledgment they werent able to match anheusers operational efficiency and had failed to win significant market share on their own the u s operations of both sabmiller and molson coors for example generate operating margins of less than according to research from stifel nicolaus anheusers u s operations by contrast run on operating margins of about the investment firm said anheuser "executes pretty well they do a good job of blocking and tackling " said greg estes portfolio manager at intrepid capital funds in jacksonville beach fla which has more than &# million in assets and holds shares of anheuser busch that isnt about to change because a new rival emerges he added in addition anheusers "history of stable cash flows" should more than counter recent weakness of the u s beer market "in spite of what analysts and others talk about their declines are too fast and furious for reality " mr estes said he said anheusers stock is fairly valued at current levels but if the market continued to sell it off "sharply" on the sab molson coors news "id probably add to it " in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday anheuser buschs shares fell cents to &# the merger of sab and molson coorss u s operations is likely to boost those companies margins but wont necessarily erode anheusers and anheusers level of profitability could actually improve if a duopoly lets the companies return to the days when they could raise prices by to when anheuser slashed prices several years ago to protect market share the three big brewers lost hundreds of millions of dollars in profits pricing has improved considerably in the past year at the same time anheuser is moving to trim costs by &# million to &# million over the next four years which should help improve margins this could bolster its operational free cash flow which amounted to about &# billion in based on the companys current share price this gave anheuser a free cash flow yield of about any increase in this measure is likely to help push the stock higher mr busch also recently undertook an executive shuffle his first significant management changes since assuming the post in december anheuser also will have time to prepare for increased competition "while the majority of miller and coors brands already are selling through the same distributors we expect issues such as combining sales forces new leadership combining marketing spend and message etc to benefit anheuser in the market in the first six to months after the deal closes " analysts at j p morgan chase &amp co said in a research note in his memo mr busch hammered at this point "there will be significant transition confusion from this change and its up to us to capitalize on this disruption now " anheuser still will have a much wider range of exclusive distribution agreements than the new no the increased heft of sab molson coors may allow it to increase exclusive distribution but this will take time bears arent buying it saying anheusers fortunes are too closely tied to the flagging u s beer market and it has missed the boat internationally "so long as bud is as reliant as it is today on the u s domestic beer market and so long as that market continues to stagnate bud is in a bind " said charles norton portfolio manager of the &# million vice fund which as of the end of august had shorted or bet against shares of anheuser busch while holding american depositary receipts of sabmiller and adrs of inbev mr norton said he wouldnt change his negative stance on anheuser "unless they do something dramatic to change that and expand the international focus " that is exactly what some shareholders are hoping anheuser busch management will be forced to do in response to the new competition in the u s the most hyped scenario is a deal with inbev owner of beers such as stella artois and becks the sab molson coors joint venture "could accelerate buds eventual combination with inbev " citigroup inc analyst bonnie herzog wrote in a note to investors yesterday "also this deal further confirms our thesis that global consolidation will ramp up in the near term " david kesmodel and deborah ball contributed to this article
