business world detroits other legacy burden if the restructuring of detroits costs now underway is so epoch making why havent the stock prices of the two remaining publicly traded auto makers noticed maybe because investors recognize the elephant in the room one whose presence has been a central preoccupation of the uaw and the auto makers even if ignored in media reports that pachyderm is known as cafe aka the governments corporate average fuel economy rulebook how could pending congressional changes in the mileage rules blow sky high the labor concessions being negotiated by the big three let us count the ways dishing responsibility for retiree health care over to the uaw may be a done deal for gm but clinching the unions support for the equally important two tier wage system which would put gms labor costs on a path to competitiveness with toyotas came only when gm offered specific commitments of future work for plants through those commitments at least are paying their way as a negotiating stratagem securing the necessary votes so far from the uaw membership to approve the deal but its hard to see how these commitments can survive under any of the fuel mileage bills now under serious consideration in the house and senate gms plans appear to be based on a presumption that gm will be free to make and sell cars the public wants to buy a new cadillac wagon a pickup version of the hummer full size suvs and pickups based on the new gmt platform a family of rear wheel drive roadsters to go up against bmw yet a schizophrenia runs through the companys plans gm has also scheduled its electric prototype the chevy volt for full production by try finding an independent expert who really believes gm will be able to deliver the requisite lithium ion batteries at an affordable price these cars will likely have to be sold at a loss ditto a great deal of shareholder capital being thrown at hybrids diesel and other fuel saving technologies worse is the suspicion more than a suspicion given utterances from gm vice chairman bob lutz that much of this spending is politically motivated aimed at salvaging some influence in the halls of congress in a generally losing battle against onerous and costly new fuel economy rules detroit is making genuine headway on one of its perverse burdens wage contracts that turned labor into a "fixed cost " requiring the big three for decades to churn out cars at a loss to meet "job security" commitments but the other stanchion of perversity cafe which has exactly the same effect remains in place and will likely become more perverse fords new ceo alan mulally recently arrived from boeing described for barrons his astonishment upon discovering this reality "for all you read about it it was difficult to understand the degree to which the cafe regulations distort the market ford had to put out two small cars and discount their prices to get people to take them so that we could also make and sell cars customers really wanted " now we are ready to answer the mystery for all the good news out of detroit on labor costs fords and gms stock prices have been little improved because investors can already anticipate the cash flow liberated by labor concessions being grabbed by the political class to apply to uneconomic fuel economy investments one analyst shop global insight inc reckons that under a realistic cafe scenario by one third of the new car fleet would have to be diesel powered and half would have to consist of diesel or gasoline electric hybrids this implies massive investments on which the auto makers would not earn a decent return why not because consumers do not value these improvements highly enough to pay the price for delivering them how do we know because car makers would be delivering the prescribed mileage improvements already if there were profits in it cars that get mpg plus are a snap going back to the nash metropolitan and geo metro xfi but consumers have shown over and over that they value energy efficiency gains which auto makers have duly delivered not to maximize miles per gallon in absolute terms but to afford heavier roomier more comfortable cars with more horsepower at any given gasoline price hence the rise of hill terry a house bill backed by the big three and toyota that would raise fuel mileage roughly over years that compromise has been gaining adherents in congress lately for some legislators apparently still balk at taking a wrecking ball to a u s industry for the sake of a vacuous gesture on climate change or whatever hill terrys main attraction is that it would leave in place the distinction between cars and light trucks allowing car makers to carve out a smidgen of flexibility to keep making the suvs and pickups that earn most of their profits nissan is supporting a rival bill that already passed the senate less favorable to the auto makers on fuel economy for a single reason it allows both foreign and domestic cars to be counted together to meet the cafe requirements the uaw prefers the existing rule which keeps detroit manufacturing small cars domestically at a loss instead of importing them at a profit to meet the fuel economy rules the big three have been silent on this aspect of future cafe rules because they need the uaws political support one more way in which detroit is still a long mile from being free to treat its business like a business one more reason too for investors to remain skeptical about their survival and prosperity
