fiscally fit when schools ask for cash terris glad to write a single check a fond farewell to caramel popcorn online edition this time of year parents typically gripe about the amount of homework teachers assign my biggest complaint the other pile of tedious assignments my son gerald brings home school fund raising packages cookies candles popcorn wrapping paper gift baskets holiday wreaths there seemed to be no end to the types of things geralds public school asked our son to peddle to friends family and coworkers and when i say "our son" i of course mean "us " theres no way my husband gerry and i would let our eight year old sell that stuff door to door to strangers the way we did when we were kids so that left the two of us hitting up our friends and family ive always loathed the thought of asking my family to buy these overpriced items though i know they would do it in a heartbeat asking friends and coworkers is equally awkward many times their kids are fund raising too so when we ask them to buy from us we end buying just as much stuff we dont want from them in return and then theres the time issue typically gerald would bring home a fund raising package every other month even if we were inclined to badger our friends and family to buy things they probably didnt want we didnt have the time to go around collecting cash filling out forms and then picking the items up from the school and distributing them dont get me wrong the fund raising effort is for the best of causes without the money raised from fund raising projects geralds school wouldnt be able to offer many of the art science foreign language and music classes my son and his classmates enjoy after a year of fundraising gerry and i decided it was easier on everybody for us to buy a certain amount of things from each of geralds packages ourselves write a check usually around &# a pop for a total of about &# each school year and be done with it we still had to lug the stuff home but that was where the hassle ended but now things have changed this year to my great relief our parent teacher organization decided to cut out the middleman instead of asking parents to sell products to raise funds they simply asked for a one time cash donation for each child by requesting a direct cash donation the pto explained in a letter parents and the school wouldnt have to deal with fund raising drives and all of the funds raised could go directly to sponsoring enrichment programs for the kids the donation requested varied depending on how many kids each family had in the school the pto asked for a &# donation for the first child and &# for each child after that it also asked families that could afford it to sponsor a child from a family facing financial hardship at &# i felt like we were getting off easy no more nasty tasting caramel popcorn i gladly wrote the check we donated &# to cover our son and sponsor a child after all its a great cause and were still giving less than we did when we were inundated with fund raising packages the donation wasnt mandatory indeed schools arent permitted to demand that parents make donations says jan harp domene president of the national parent teacher association "for public schools fund raising has got to be completely voluntary " still the letters from our pto asking parents to make their donations were increasingly shrill pointing out all of the programs the fund raising effort would sponsor and strongly suggesting those programs might be discontinued if parents didnt pony up the cash the letters angered some parents my friend debbie for example feels we already do enough to support public schools financially "we live in a state with the highest property taxes in the nation " she says "wheres it going to end " others were offended by the suggestion that they sponsor someone elses child with one parent telling me she wouldnt send a check unless all families were required to make some financial commitment "its only fair " she said i said i thought the one time cash donation was well worth avoiding the hassle of endless fund raisers but neither of my friends was convinced melissa brown associate director of research at the center on philanthropy at indiana university says asking parents for cash donations in lieu of fund raising drives is likely to be more successful at schools in affluent neighborhoods "one of the scarcest resources we have is time and there are studies that show that as people have higher wealth they prefer to give money than time " she says ms brown says schools are also finding that traditional fund raisers arent bringing in the cash they once did "theres increasing restrictions on how children can circulate fund raising information and schools are finding theres less of a return than there used to be " she says "and fund raisers are a hassle to administer and a major commitment on the part of the pto " geralds schools fund raising drive is still under way so its too early to say whether the pto will stick with the upfront approach or go back to cookie sales but the shrill letters have finally stopped coming which i hope is a good sign do you resent having to raise money
