even an intel founder can still be impressed by technologys pace for a man whose name is so intimately linked with everything that is remarkable about modern technology gordon moore is as flummoxed by all of it as the rest of us cellphones have more features than he can possibly use terabyte size disk drives that can fit in your hand are a "miracle " and he finds it "utterly amazing" that google can return so many search results so quickly "i am continually surprised by what people can do with these things " he says considering the source thats a bit like newton saying he cant believe how quickly apples fall from trees mr moore is the author of moores law a formula he came up with in the s while a founding employee of intel to predict the way computer chips would double in capacity every year or so while computer chips would have improved just as quickly without mr moore he is linked in most minds with their progress and that progress has been taken for granted for so long that silicon valley perpetually frets about a time when it might stop being true mr moore years old and retired from intel discussed all this in an interview last week during festivities marking the th anniversary of the founding of fairchild semiconductor arguably the first tech start up and the precursor to intel outside of his law mr moore isnt as well known as other intel luminaries such as bob noyce or andy grove thats in large part due to his demeanor mr moore has none of mr noyces patrician bearing or the mercurial mr groves love of the spotlight instead he looks and acts like an old fashioned neighborhood pharmacist unassuming and ready with a smile few pharmacists though are billionaires in discussing the great run of moores law its author said the world has been lucky that no law of physics so far has stood in the way of it being true it didnt always look like we were going to be so lucky at one point during the s intel brought out a new more compact generation of memory chips at first they worked fine but customers began reporting that the chips would occasionally and randomly "forget" a bit of information no one at intel though could consistently reproduce the failures mr moore thought it might be the work of cosmic rays but that was ruled out when the chips kept failing even after being encased in bricks "it was driving us nuts " he recalled maybe one of mother natures undiscovered rules had it in for moores law then one day on a whim an intel engineer and amateur mineralogist put a small piece of uranium next to a memory chip the entire chip was erased mystery solved the bits inside a memory chip had become so small that they could be damaged by a single alpha particle which uranium chips famously send out by the gazillions it turned out that some of the casing materials used to make the memory chip also randomly decayed and sent out alpha particles though vastly less frequently than uranium that accounted for the sporadic errors design changes were made and moores law survived in what was probably the first time in industrial history that an entire assembly line was shut down by a single subatomic particle actually many today say that moores law has run its course big chips like the pentium produce so much heat that intel worries more about improving energy efficiency than performance mr moore admits that the limitations of power consumption caught him as well as the industry by surprise these days mr moore spends his days with his wife at their house on hawaiis big island most people would consider it a life of well earned gentlemanly leisure though mr moore said "i suppose i just fritter the time away " with some of his vast wealth from intel he started a nonprofit trust the gordon and betty moore foundation the story of fairchild that mr moore was helping to commemorate is well known in silicon valley william shockley an at&amp t researcher invented the transistor in the late s and then started his own company to commercialize it he recruited eight young engineers mr moore included mr shockley though was considered something of a capt queeg and in despair the traitorous eight left to start their own company fairchild intel grew from that a few years later while mr moore isnt the sort to speak ill of anyone least of all the dead he says mr shockley was as bad as the history books suggest once when a secretary accidentally ripped her blouse on a sharp edge in a door ms shockley got it in his mind that the accident had been a deliberate act and ordered lie detector tests for everyone its hard to avoid asking mr moore if he has ever come across another boss as unpleasant as mr shockley many intel alumni for example grumble about mr grove mr moore laughs off the comparison "the only people who had trouble with andy were those who didnt see him very often " he says "shockley was psychotic andy was just demanding " email me at lee gomes wsj com
