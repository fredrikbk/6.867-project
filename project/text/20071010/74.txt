job strain can be risk factor for subsequent heart attacks for those back at work after a recent heart attack here is something else to think about along with cholesterol blood pressure and diet the job a study by canadian researchers being published today in the journal of the american medical association suggests workplace stress may be as hazardous to your heart health as smoking high cholesterol and other conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease a majority of those who suffer heart attacks during their working years return to work other studies have found the new report suggests that patients and employers alike would benefit from strategies to prevent the human medical and productivity costs of a second heart attack the researchers enrolled patients between and years old who returned to work after a first heart attack and followed them for an average of six years those in high stress jobs were times as likely as those in low stress posts to suffer a heart attack or be hospitalized for unstable chest pain called angina which often is a precursor to a heart attack "it is a very important effect " said michel vezina a researcher at universite laval in quebec and a co author of the study he deemed it "comparable" to the impact of tobacco smoking high cholesterol and high blood pressure prevention efforts should go beyond changing individual living habits to "take into account the work environment " dr vezina said while senior managers for instance may hold pressure packed positions the job related threat to hearts may be significantly higher among their underlings scrambling to meet deadlines on production lines two characteristics define a high stress job dr vezina said one is a demand to do ever more tasks with less time and fewer resources the second is an employees lack of control over work procedures or lack of authority to make decisions these conditions generally reflect the plight of lower level workers and have been shown in numerous studies most prominently in the long running whitehall study of british civil service workers to have a detrimental impact on health and longevity previous research has linked job stress and first heart attacks the new report is the largest to look at its impact on a second major episode "job strain causes bad effects for the heart no question about it " said randal thomas a cardiologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minn psychological distress triggers release of adrenaline and other "fight or flight" hormones which under chronic conditions damage the heart he noted dr vezina and his colleagues are studying strategies to reduce stress for such workers encouraging a collaborative rather than competitive work environment is one possible approach he said exercise meditation and the ear of supportive friends and family can also help jama says
