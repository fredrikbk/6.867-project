physically separate according to their candidate preference "many of you can caucus in iowa " mr obama told scores of high school students via conference call from around the state last month for the kickoff of the weekly "barackstar" nights held for teens at the campaigns field offices "i hope you realize how much power you have potentially to change the world " after a recent foreign policy speech the candidate invited some of the attending teens and their friends backstage told that year old anna murray was student senate president of iowa citys west high school he asked her advice on running for president ms murray smiling broadly was speechless the next day she rushed up to her old government teacher who is the student senate adviser to recount the tale the obama campaign is also actively cultivating teachers along with high school principals using them for entree to the youngest voters sometimes obama aides try to hunt the adults down at home begging for classroom time to be sure teen interest doesnt easily translate into teen votes young voters have notoriously low turnout rates and the complicated iowa caucuses make participating even more daunting seventeen year olds are particularly hard to get at because they arent listed on voter registration rolls so most candidates arent paying attention to that youngest slice of the youth vote iowa high school teachers and students say theyve heard little from the other democratic leaders hillary clinton or john edwards mr obama is the exception driven both by necessity and his particular appeal he trails far behind mrs clinton nationally but is doing his best to keep up in iowa and polls suggest strength among voters under he has a proverbial seat at the cool kids lunch table with his appearance on the cover of vibe and having met with the likes of rapper ludacris at hes the youngest of the presidential candidates years mrs clintons junior she will turn this month a few hundred extra teen votes in iowa could make a big difference for mr obama so rachel haltom irwin the campaigns year old iowa youth vote director attends many of sen obamas appearances building the campaigns email database at a stop in the tiny town of guthrie center she approached the student band and passed around a sign up clipboard under the heading of "barackstars " the field offices hold weekly gatherings tailored toward teens and hand out information packets to be distributed back at school ms perrigo posted some on her "waukee students for obama " facebook group site in storm lake a picturesque town in northwestern iowa sen obamas team invited high school teachers to bring students to a midweek event the district accepted the invitation and provided a bus to transport students craig lyon a storm lake social studies teacher says the field trip did more to interest his students in government than anything else that has happened this semester brent jorth a teacher at van meter high school outside des moines gave an obama field organizer minutes to speak to his american government class "their ears prick up a little bit when they hear obamas name " says mr jorth some of the most active students are at west high school in iowa city where they have formed their own support club for mr obama the only candidate to have an organized base there run by elise walz a senior and jenna broghamer a junior the club has members and meets before school for half an hour every other week they talk about volunteer opportunities with the campaign and events they want to hold including a battle of the bands style mock caucus called a "maucus" ms walz and ms broghamer recently hopped one of many campaign hired school buses to the harkin steak fry in indianola an annual event sponsored by the states veteran democratic sen tom harkin in presidential campaign season the event draws the top democratic contenders as the bus approached indianola a town of more than about miles from iowa city the west high students peered out the windows at the rowdy campaign activity "iowans for hillary" signs blanketing the roadside were the first they saw ms walz frowned "gosh this place is so hillary " she said "i wonder if barack will feel bad with all these signs " the top six democratic contenders spoke in his remarks sen obama took a shot at president george bush and his decision to commute the prison sentence of former white house aide i lewis "scooter" libby "even paris hilton got some jail time " he quipped at the steak fry with a sprawling mix of campaign staffers and volunteers roaming around the open field the rallying was in full swing ms walz and ms broghamer readily joined in whenever they heard an obama staffer start to cheer but looked unsure when rival campaigns approached edwards supporters were handing out newspapers called "the edwards extra " the girls stared at the ground and politely declined when the event was over ms walz picked up some discarded "obama" signs from the campaign litter and dusted them off to take back to school on the bus ride home she asked one of the campaign field organizers to explain the complicated caucus process to her dean fluker a recent university of iowa graduate did his best to do that democratic caucus participants need to do a lot more than just go to a private voting booth and cast a ballot they have to show up in a crowded room and be prepared to defend their choice for the party nomination typically seasoned caucus veterans run the show but nearly everyone is expected to speak up mr fluker told ms walz who pulled her voter registration card out of her khaki coach wallet that they would have more tutorial opportunities close to the actual caucus date later when asked whether she felt confident enough to take part ms walz thought for a second and said "uh yeah i think so " such uncertainty remains a hurdle for the obama teen outreach on a visit to carroll a town in the northwestern part of the state sen obama packed the local rec center auditorium on stage off to his left sat chandra coull a year old senior at carroll high school wearing white cut off shorts and a brown sweater ms coull sat attentively through the program
