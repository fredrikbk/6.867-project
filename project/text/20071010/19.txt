brewers to tap new marketing firepower combined millercoors to push for better deals for major sports events two advertising budgets are better than one that is the verdict on madison avenue for sabmiller and molson coors brewings decision to merge their domestic operations unveiled yesterday the combined companies to be known as millercoors will have marketing firepower to compete on a more equal footing with rival anheuser busch and that will give millercoors much more bargaining leverage with media outlets it will be able to push for lower ad prices and better sports marketing deals a key to success in the beer sector furthermore despite the companies stated intention to look for cost savings in the merger they expect to boost spending on marketing millers chief executive tom long says the combined entity plans to invest more marketing dollars to bulk up its brands against competitors "we want to put more dollars to driving consumer choice and offering them what they want " says mr long who will become president and chief commercial officer of millercoors in charge of marketing and sales strategy "if that means raising our advertising and spending against our brands to get that done we have to get that done " he noted however that the merger could yield savings in areas like consumer research the pact announced yesterday combines two companies that had long been also rans against anheuser busch which controls nearly half the u s beer market miller brewing co the second largest u s brewer by sales has about of the market while molson coors is the no player with about market share helping maintain those relative market shares was anheusers ability to massively outspend its rivals on advertising last year for example anheuser brewer of beers such as budweiser and bud light spent &# million on advertising in the u s according to tns media intelligence an ad tracking service by contrast sabmillers ad outlays in totaled &# million while molson coors shelled out &# million the combined marketing budget "levels the playing field " says michael bellas chairman and chief executive of beverage marketing a new york consulting firm millercoors will find it easier to negotiate for better placement for its ads and to compete more effectively for ad rights to major sporting events media buyers say tony ponturo anheusers vice president of global media and sports marketing is often referred to as one of the most powerful men in sports marketing because of the advertising clout wielded by anheuser busch for example in the brewer locked up exclusive super bowl rights through preventing any other brewer or alcohol advertising on the big game in that time period the big question on madison avenue is whether the merger will lead to a consolidation among ad agencies or media buyers now employed by the two companies currently millers ad roster includes ad firms such as bartle bogle hegarty wpp groups young &amp rubicam and publicis groupes saatchi &amp saatchi while coors ads are largely handled by interpublic groups draftfcb media buying for miller is handled by publiciss starcom coorss ad planning is done by draftfcb while its broadcast television buying is done by interpublics initiative media mr long at miller says the companies havent discussed whether to consolidate agencies "we wouldnt until far down the road in this process " he adds still branding experts say any fallout on the agency side may be limited because the new company will have an array of very different brands that will need to be kept distinct the brands include miller lite miller genuine draft pilsner urquell coors light molson dry and keystone light miller recently concluded an ad review by expanding to three the number of ad agencies handling its primary brands from two previously even so the merger comes at a critical juncture for millers marketing branding experts say the brewer could better define its brand image "miller has been searching for the right voice of the brand " says alan adamson a branding expert at wpps brand consultancy landor associates several years ago miller lite deployed aggressive attack ads against bud light to try and grab attention claiming miller lite tasted better than its rival miller moved away from that type of advertising last year launching humorous ads starring burt reynolds but after sales suffered the brewer recently has returned to poking fun at bud one tv ad now on the air shows a bud light delivery truck following a miller lite truck the back of millers truck reads "miller lite has more taste than bud light " coorss recent ad shows national football league coaches holding news conferences and being peppered with questions about coors by fans experts say the entire beer category needs to do more on the creative front to fend off the inroads that specialist beers have made in the marketplace the beer category is "lacking some fizz " says dean crutchfield a senior vice president at wolff olins a branding firm owned by omnicom group
