sign up for the e mail here debate rookie fred thompson initially faltered in the republican presidential debate but later settled into his role and rudy giuliani seemed to get the better of mitt romney in a spat over taxes and spending the theme of the sixth major republican debate in may have been the economy but personality was the clear winner over policy nearly all nine candidates on the stage in dearborn michigan were in agreement on the need to cut taxes and reduce what they almost universally described as a profligate level of federal spending however much their own party has been in charge when much of that money was spent most tried to walk the tightrope of voicing support for free trade even as they promised a tough response to trading partners who are less than fair "i believe in trade but i believe in opening up markets to american goods and services " mr romney said and nearly all painted china as somewhat of a villain in the american economic story expressing concern about the countrys "undervalued currency product safety issues and intellectual property violations " as womens wear daily notes but while the debate took place in what the wall street journal notes is a "troubled manufacturing state " there was little deep reflection on how the government or american businesses could find better strategies for dealing with those troubles when the debate opened mr thompson "painted a picture of blue skies describing a recession as an unlikely possibility" and making only a passing reference to the events location as newsweeks howard fineman writes a message that seemed to clash with yesterdays big headline in the detroit free press "chrysler to cut deeper " while mr thompsons presence loomed over the others during the long months before he joined the fray he drew little mention from his rivals last night "reflecting in part a sense within the party that his first weeks as an official candidate had not gone well " the new york times says in contrast messrs romney and giuliani went at it employing what the times notes was a "blizzard of often conflicting statistics as they sought to undercut each others records on cutting taxes or spending " mr giuliani was by far the more aggressive of the two ceding no ground on the tax and spend fight even as mr romney tried to play down their differences by saying their sole disagreement was whether the line item veto is a realistic goal for the presidency as abc news reports newsweeks mr fineman argues that mr giuliani won the debate in a few ways "by mentioning hillary clintons name every few seconds a guaranteed applause line " "by mixing it up with romney " and "by not losing as romney did when he declared that he would consult his lawyers before deciding whether he had the power as president to take out an iranian nuclear facility romney may have been right on the constitutional procedure but wrong in a debate where the objective was to woo hardline gop voters " meanwhile most democratic candidates now look likely to skip michigan altogether during the primaries half of the partys slate withdrew from michigans jan primate vote over the states decision to flout party rules about just who can hold their primary first leaving hillary rodham clinton as the only top tier candidate still competing there as the los angeles times reports a prudent fed from the minutes of the federal reserves policy making committees meeting last month when it decided to cut interest rates by half a percentage point a nominally apolitical discussion of the economy heres one of the key passages on why it acted as it did "members emphasized that because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions the incoming data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of economic activity and prices on which the committees policy decision must be based members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic outlook without such policy action members saw a risk that tightening credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment similarly the impaired functioning of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen with negative implications for economic activity in order to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the economy that might otherwise arise all members agreed that a rate cut of basis points at this meeting was the most prudent course of action such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for participants in financial markets with economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation " high court backs administration on secrecy the u s supreme court yesterday declined to consider the appeal of a german man who claims to have been abducted imprisoned and harshly interrogated by the

government has said secretary of state condoleezza rice admitted the u s erred in the arrest of khaled el masri a lower court had declined to let his suit go forward siding with a bush adminstration argument that a trial in the case would hurt national security in recent years "the so called state secrecy privilege has been invoked regularly to bar judges or juries from hearing claims of those

open court would reveal national security secrets " separately in what the new york times describes as possibly the first ruling of its kind a federal judge yesterday barred the administration from
