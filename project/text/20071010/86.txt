mutual funds aid task of nest eggs payment investors who reach retirement face the difficult task of estimating how long they will live and how long their nest egg should last a new type of mutual fund introduced by fund giants fidelity investments and vanguard group seeks to make that task easier fidelity last week launched income replacement funds and vanguard plans to launch three managed payout funds early next year each of which are meant to give retirees a guaranteed regular payment while they remain invested traditionally the role of maintaining a steady income has been taken by fixed annuities the new funds dont have the high expenses of annuities but neither do they offer a guarantee that investors wont outlive their assets as annuities do fidelity and others say the new funds werent meant to be annuity clones "this is just another arrow in the quiver for investors to use " says boyce greer president of fixed income and asset allocation at fidelity "we wanted to provide an income vehicle that had very different characteristics than an annuity " fidelitys income replacement funds are a series of funds of funds combining an asset allocation strategy with an optional monthly payment program which is offered at no cost the funds carry "horizon dates" from to meaning the funds income stream and principal are expected to end on those dates the funds begin with a more aggressive asset allocation weighted toward equity funds and gradually shift to a more conservative allocation emphasizing fixed income and short term income funds vanguards managed payout funds also offer regular payments but have no set termination date the funds will invest primarily in other vanguard funds including domestic and international stock index funds bond and real estate investment trust index funds and inflation protected securities and money market instruments the funds will also invest in commodity linked investments and market neutral or other "absolute return" strategies and are expected to sustain annual distribution rates from to the vanguard managed payout capital preservation fund for example will offer an annual distribution rate of but no guarantee that the fund wont dip into principal "in general the fact that theyre launching these products is great " says brad levin a certified financial planner and president and founder of legacy wealth partners in encino calif "retirees are just not prepared for what theyre going to be facing as they go into retirement " but he worries that investors in the funds "could make mistakes that cause them to run out of money " that is because the funds require that investors choose an appropriate income stream but it isnt uncommon for investors to underestimate their life spans its generally understood that a or retirement account withdrawal rate is sustainable he said but an unsophisticated investor would likely choose an option offering "but can they really deliver that kind of payout over the long term "
