the politics of disaster good news for readers who have dreamed of owning beachfront property in miami even if you cant afford to buy the house at least you can still pay to insure it were sure the current occupants will be most grateful for your generosity as they sip mojitos in south beach weve been warning of the financial disaster looming off the florida coast ever since governor charlie crist socialized the states hurricane insurance market and put florida taxpayers on the hook for billions earlier this year mr crist stumped for and then signed a law making the florida government the states dominant insurer but without the reserves that would be required of real insurance companies the plan will work splendidly as long as there are no hurricanes in florida but the state will face a difficult challenge once the inevitable storm hits how to pry new tax revenue out of floridians just as they begin sifting through the rubble that used to be their homes now floridas politicians are doubling down on their mistake by trying to make all american taxpayers subsidize insurance for florida homeowners congressman ron klein d fla is hoping for a floor vote this fall on his homeowners defense act and has been assured by speaker nancy pelosi that this is a top priority governor crist is also lobbying hard mr kleins bill would force the u s treasury to issue below market loans to state insurance programs while also creating a kind of fannie mae of disaster reinsurance a federally chartered organization called the "national catastrophe risk consortium " like fannie the consortium would carry an implicit guarantee from the federal government as it issues securities in the capital markets distorting prices as it sells subsidized reinsurance to participating states all the while saddling taxpayers with new risks according to treasury assistant secretary phillip swagel "taxpayers nationwide would subsidize insurance rates in high risk areas which would be both costly and unfair " transferring the risk from condo owners in boca to taxpayers in syracuse does not reduce the cost of hurricane disasters in fact now that congress looks ready to volunteer middle class taxpayers nationwide as the financial backstop for lovely beachfront properties south florida developers will have even less incentive to use sturdy materials and set homes a reasonable distance from the waterline we have already run this experiment with the national flood insurance program with predictable results when people can buy insurance at below market rates they tend to stay in accident prone homes taxpayers might be forgiven for wondering whether theyre already paying enough given that there are no fewer than federal agencies tasked with responding to emergencies not to mention myriad state and local agencies and private groups such as the red cross even if some believe that government should be the insurer of last resort should taxpayers pay for every resort sensing that americans might be suffering from disaster assistance fatigue after shelling out &# billion to the gulf coast after katrina mr klein touts the loan programs in his bill as a way to avoid no strings gifts to affected areas but whats the most likely outcome if state insurance programs dont pay back the loans treasurys mr swagel put it this way in testimony to the house last month "with federal financing it is more than likely that there will be significant pressures to forgive outstanding debt in the case of a huge catastrophe " beyond the cost to taxpayers the message to the markets could be equally destructive insurance companies are never going to win the title of americas most beloved companies but it should give all of us a shiver when lawmakers decide to kill an industry because they believe government can do it better what exactly is the offense for which this segment of the property and casualty industry deserves the death penalty florida state representative dennis ross points out that after the storm seasons private insurance companies spent &# billion to rebuild florida are the risks of hurricanes and earthquakes just too difficult for private markets to manage hardly swiss re the largest underwriter of catastrophe bonds reports that business is booming since natural disasters have almost no correlation with corporate bond defaults investors are increasingly attracted to "cat" bonds as a way to reduce portfolio risk while earning competitive returns the insurance market is working floridas governor simply didnt like the price of private hurricane coverage now he may succeed in getting american taxpayers to pay for it while destroying an american industry as mr crists predecessor jeb bush has wisely pointed out government run natural disaster insurance could be more devastating than the disasters themselves see related letter "letters to the editor deep pocket nightmare" wsj october see related letter "letters to the editor catastrophe fund is in
