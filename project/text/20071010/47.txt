email scheme targets executives during a two hour period june something unusual turned up in email security company messagelabs inc s filters messages tailored to senior executives of corporate clients containing programs designed to steal sensitive company data on sept and it happened again and the company captured messages in a hour wave the messages which included executives names and titles were from a purported employment service and offered attachments supposedly containing information on potential job candidates the attachments were microsoft word documents a common type of office file erroneously believed to be safe by most computer users if not intercepted they would have deposited trojan horses or malicious programs disguised as benign ones onto some high powered peoples computers the two email bursts point to a new and sophisticated take on an old style attack with troubling implications for corporations messagelabs says in the past most email attacks of this kind were simple "phishing" scams sent to masses of consumers with the goal of inducing them to part with their financial account information a small number of targeted attacks were seen by security companies but they typically targeted individuals in government or the military these new attacks suggested that a fairly low tech email scheme could create a high class problem for companies placing valuable data at risk and challenging companies to devise foolproof technical defenses messagelabs says it has been intercepting targeted email attacks on corporate clients for at least three years and the numbers began to rise significantly over the past year the company was catching one message a day as of the end of that rose to about a day by may and then jumped dramatically with the june and september attacks both of those incidents targeted executives in a wide range of industries "all of a sudden somebody new hit the scene " said mark sunner messagelabs chief security analyst who that is isnt clear because technical tricks disguised the emails origins he said but it is likely the person or group responsible came from the digital underground centered in eastern europe where malicious program writers and organized crime have long worked hand in hand online to steal and sell data for use in fraud schemes the newcomers appear to be after corporate secrets he said they have sought specifically to infiltrate the computers of chief executives chief financial officers chief technology officers and other senior managers and on occasion their assistants the trojan horses are designed primarily to help the attacker gather microsoft office files from the my documents directories of infiltrated pcs the people targeted "are the custodians of the companys secrets " mr sunner said and have computers full of spreadsheets financial reports merger details and trade secrets "why would somebody be targeting a ceo " scott oneal chief of the federal bureau of investigations cyber intrusion section asked rhetorically "it may be to steal intellectual property it may be corporate espionage it may be to get into the database " attacks of this kind have become much simpler mr oneal said "the how to tutorials out there are getting better and better and people need less and less technical skills " he said unfortunately few are reported to law enforcement because companies fear investigations will disrupt their businesses and result in unwanted publicity such fears are unfounded mr oneal said the agency is careful not to be disruptive and it maintains strict confidentiality in the recent attacks seen by messagelabs the perpetrators tried to improve the chances executives would open the attachments by referencing bogus business matters and including personal details such as name and title which suggests the attackers spent time researching their targets using search engines from google inc and others "its very easy to do a very extensive web search to gather a lot of different information " such as email addresses titles and work histories said david marcus security research and communications manager at security software maker mcafee inc messagelabs said it was able to confirm that the details used in the emails were correct by consulting linkedin a social networking site that is popular among professionals the size of the june and september attacks may be significantly larger than what the messagelabs email catch suggests while the company filters out spam viruses and other unwanted messages from billion emails headed for nearly million corporate email accounts each day thats a small sample of overall corporate email traffic "were definitely dealing with intellectual property theft of quite a high degree " mr sunner said he said the messages look benign and may evade some antispam and antivirus security software in that case the only defense would be executives themselves choosing to exercise caution in opening email attachments if human weakness wins out and the attacker infiltrates that persons computer what the intruder can do is virtually limitless and corporate data may not be the only target or casualty in fact some attackers could go after a targets personal information as in a classic phishing scam jason malo senior manager in verisign inc s anti phishing group said phishers are becoming more sophisticated and creative as they work harder to dupe increasingly cautious computer users and look for bigger scores he thinks most targeted email attacks on executives are personal not professional phishers know that "these are probably people with bigger paychecks bigger houses and nicer cars " he said which means they also have fatter bank and brokerage accounts and higher limit credit cards the underground economy rewards targeting these individuals one underground web site with stolen credit card numbers for sale that verisign monitors recently offered platinum visa numbers for &# apiece compared with &# for regular visa numbers "these folks have some greater risk from a financial perspective as well as the information they know " mr malo said
