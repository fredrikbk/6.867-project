me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q im considering a bmw or audi and wanted to know when dealers will typically start to offer incentives to move inventory off their lots to make room for models amy norris portland ore a your timing is good the season for deals gets going in october as the next years vehicles start arriving at dealerships in large numbers at this point salespeople are often willing to get rid of leftover models but you will not be the only person shopping for outgoing models so you may find the cars youre interested in have been snapped up already the rules of supply and demand also apply to last years cars if a lot of people are shopping for say bmw series sedans dealers will be aware of the demand and wont be "giving them away " q a friend who owns a toyota camry hybrid says he is getting better gas mileage on the highway than in the city is this possible steve zon severn md a it is possible that your friend is getting better fuel economy on the highway despite the fact that some hybrids get better mileage in town getting the most out of a hybrid in the city requires using electric power as often as possible while keeping use of the gasoline engine to a minimum accomplishing this means driving smoothly accelerating at modest rates coasting as much as possible and generally moving more slowly than is typical driving this way takes more concentration and patience than many drivers can muster aggressive driving with frequent rapid acceleration and hard braking can eliminate much of the hybrids in town mileage advantage so how does your friend drive q do you have any suggestions for a midsize suv or wagon that can accommodate three car seats in the second row mike a wayne pa a while some large suvs and vans can accommodate three child seats in the second row its always a tight squeeze i have yet to see three seats successfully installed side by side in a midsize vehicle we have two safety seats not boosters and i think a third would have to go in the third row interestingly few vehicles i have seen have anchor and tether hardware in the third row making them practically useless for small children some have latch or lower anchors and tethers for children a standardized attachment system in the third row and that is what id look for i recently test drove the ford taurus x and was happy to find latch gear on at least one side of the third row i think the answer lies in finding a three row vehicle that isnt too large but has latch in the second and third rows
