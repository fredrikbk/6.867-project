blog is hollywoods must see screenwriters check in as the plot thickens in talks for contract all the action in contract talks between screenwriters and hollywood studios has taken place behind closed doors but as the negotiations continue and a possible strike looms next month a pair of writers who belong to the union have emerged as influential public voices in the debate via a closely watched blog the blog www artfulwriter com is showing the ways in which the internet can become an important public sounding board in union negotiations that largely take place in private run by screenwriters craig mazin who co wrote "scary movie " and ted elliot who co wrote "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end " the blog is watched by both writers guild of america leadership and the studios as a gauge of opinion among the guilds voting members hollywood is looking for signals of how strongly guild members feel about a strike after months of bluster starting over the summer negotiations for a contract between hollywood studios and the guild got tough last week some bargaining sessions collapsed and the union set a strike authorization vote deadline for oct it seems an unscripted writers strike in hollywood could happen sooner perhaps by the end of this month rather than later as the union talks progress the blog has become a focal point for writers to publicly hash out what to do next last week for example mr mazins post justifying his decision to vote "yes" to authorize a strike eventually drew comments from his readers some of whom identified themselves while others remained anonymous while mr mazin years old supports the authorization he has been arguing against a hastily called strike and has been railing against the guild leadership the blog has provided the most public forum for the discussion ahead of informational meetings for guild members being held this week while the wga has long had a blog and online forum it is available only to registered members of the wga and is password protected "when it comes to union matters i am the only game in town on this right now " says mr mazin "i do very little to endear myself to the guild leadership but i go after both sides depending on who i think is screwing up on the particular day " mr mazin has staked out a position that is somewhere between hardcore union activists and the companies they work for "both sides have mismanaged the issue " he says "the studio proposal is nuts and inflammatory and will absolutely precipitate a strike if they stick to it but on the other hand im extremely critical of the wga leadership as theyve backed us into a corner " "you have to admire his passion because he is a loyal loyal unionist and you can just see him trying not to undermine his union " says barbara brogliatti a spokeswoman for the alliance of motion picture &amp television producers which is negotiating on behalf of the studios "hes trying to bring some sanity to all of this " traffic on artfulwriter com has risen in concert with the rising temperature of the rhetoric between the two sides the site generally gets between and unique visitors a month mr mazin says for october mr mazin anticipates at least unique visitors "the blog has been a bit of a touchstone and a bellwether as a place where i can go either as a board member or as a writer to take the temperature reading " says aaron mendelsohn a wga board member who also sits on the unions negotiating committee "theres no water cooler so often writers have to turn to these message boards and blogs to get a sense of what everyone else is thinking " mr mazin says he gets "nervous calls from the guild" about his posts john bowman chairman of the wga negotiating committee says "i like craig and i think its fine that hes having a conversation with writers members of the guild and the general public on his blog but blogs tend to be conversations of the like minded and not really the reflective of the guild membership at large " mr bowman adds that nothing written on the blog "would affect my approach to negotiations" with the studios at issue in the current negotiations with writers and in coming contract talks with directors and actors whose contracts both expire at the end of june are questions about compensation for the use of content on the internet and other digital platforms for their part the studios are looking to reconfigure the entire system of residual payments to writers actors and other creative types until recently conventional wisdom had the writers working without a contract or under an extension after oct until next spring when they could join forces with the directors guild of america and the screen actors guild to negotiate with the studios but with the more real possibility of a november strike by the wga some writers fear the smaller dga will quietly strike a deal with the studios before the end of this year as has happened in other years corrections &amp amplifications the last name of screenwriter ted elliott co founder of artfulwriter com was misspelled as elliot in a media &amp marketing page article yesterday wsj oct
