at hershey sweetness is in perilously short supply last month the charitable trust that controls hershey co met with cadbury schweppes plc to discuss a possible merger say people familiar with the matter but they didnt invite one key executive hershey chief executive officer richard lenny last week the company announced year old mr lenny will retire as ceo at the end of the year three days before that he had stepped down from his position on the hershey trust board it isnt clear whether the meeting in which the trust tried to find out if a deal to buy cadburys candy business could be structured that wouldnt dilute its ownership in hershey had anything to do with mr lennys leaving but it would be unusual for a ceo not to be involved in such a discussion and people familiar with the matter say that mr lennys relationship with the trust had started to sour a while ago the turbulence continued yesterday when the normally publicity shy hershey trust board issued an unusually bitter assessment of the companys performance in the statement the board said it is "not satisfied" with the companys performance and is "actively engaged in an ongoing process" to improve it in the statement hershey trust board chairman leroy zimmerman noted that the iconic pennsylvania candy maker has lost more than &# billion in market value "during this period of unsatisfactory performance " it didnt specify what period he was referring to ironically part of the reason for the unsatisfactory performance has to do with the trusts unwillingness to sell the iconic company in the hershey trust forced mr lenny to put the company up for sale and cadbury and nestle sa jointly bid &# billion for hershey wm wrigley jr co then made a &# billion offer but the trust called off the auction at the last minute amid pressure from the community which feared jobs would be lost and plants closed under a new owner hersheys market cap is now more than &# billion ever since then mr lenny has had a testy relationship with the controlling shareholder which wanted to add another representative to hersheys board people familiar with the matter say so long as hershey was performing well the trust couldnt say much to mr lenny but in recent months as hershey started to suffer because of increased competition from rivals and rising dairy costs the trust made clear it wasnt happy with mr lenny nevertheless the trust was taken aback when mr lenny announced his abrupt retirement and the company announced a successor groomed by mr lenny nothing has come out of the early september meeting so far people familiar with the matter say a spokesman for the trust declined to comment on the meeting as did a spokeswoman for cadbury a spokesman for the hershey company declined to comment on the meeting and the trusts statement and mr lenny didnt return calls asking for comment earlier this year cadbury ceo todd stitzer announced he would separate cadburys drinks and confectionery units and told analysts that merging its candy business with hershey would make sense today when cadbury updates investors on its third quarter performance investors are looking for updates on its plan to split its businesses it is looking increasingly likely cadbury will spin off its drinks which include dr pepper and up instead of selling them due to turmoil in the credit markets since the summer if hershey were to acquire cadburys confectionery business it would have to take on a lot of debt which would hurt earnings and mr lenny wouldnt have wanted to support a plan that would be dilutive to common shareholders says a person familiar with the matter however "if cadbury were to acquire hershey the trusts ownership would be diluted and therein lies the problem " says mitchell corwin an analyst at independent equity research firm morningstar inc the trusts mr zimmerman said in the statement that the trust will continue to be guided by its "resolve to retain its controlling interest" in hershey he said the trust also believes "the long term prosperity of the company requires the company board and its management to build on its strong u s position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth " he added "there are many paths to accelerating growth that do not involve the trust giving up voting control of the company " the trusts desire to retain control of the company in a merger underscores a philosophy that will likely continue to pose challenges for mr lennys successor david west now the companys chief operating officer the company named him to the ceo post a day after it announced mr lennys resignation after a strategy of introducing limited edition items such as marshmallow filled reeses peanut butter cups ran its course last year rival mars inc maker of m&amp ms and snickers was able to steal market share hersheys share of the &# billion u s chocolate market has fallen by two percentage points in the past months while marss has risen by points in channels that are measured according to sanford bernstein analyst alexia howard but hershey still has of the market while mars has in the second quarter ended july hersheys sales were flat at &# billion compared with the same period a year ago and the company earned &# million down from &# million a year earlier its shares yesterday rose to &# the hershey trust in the past hasnt shown an appetite for rapid growth as trustee of the milton hershey school trust the hershey trust collects a dividend from the hershey company for the benefit of the disadvantaged children that the school serves "if a company that does not have a controlling shareholder has a poor return the company could become a takeover target but in the case of hershey the controlling shareholder is a charitable trust that may not have the same incentives to maximize shareholder value " says robert sitkoff a harvard law professor who has co written a paper on the hershey trust that will be published in the columbia law review next spring "because of the trust the company has opted for a lower risk lower return strategy " when mr lenny went to hershey from kraft foods inc in he recruited mr west from kraft mr west was seen as a leading internal candidate to succeed mr lenny as ceo though the timing of this move was surprising some observers question whether he is the right person to turn hershey around after news of mr lennys departure was announced hershey stock immediately rose to &# but the next day after mr west was named ceo the stock fell "they need a marketing genius " says bill madway a visiting professor of marketing at the villanova school of business and a pennsylvania native who has followed hershey closely "this is more of the same " absent a merger mr west appears to face little choice but to keep doing what mr lenny had been doing cutting the companys manufacturing costs and slowly expanding overseas approximately of hersheys sales come from the u s and hersheys recent attempts to expand internationally have come in the form of joint ventures with candy makers in india and china "they havent shown a willingness to make a large investment themselves in overseas markets and its hard to see their international strategy changing much " says morningstars mr corwin "the company just started a three year restructuring program and the wheels are in motion on that so i think its safe to say that there probably wont be any dramatic changes " deborah ball contributed to this article
