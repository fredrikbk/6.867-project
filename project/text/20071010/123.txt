headquarters in auburn hills mich since late last week have stopped bargaining for the time being people familiar with the talks said neither side made any immediate announcement the uaw last staged a strike at chrysler in according to the auto maker that walkout lasted days several uaw plants are exempt from the strike including a sport utility vehicle facility in detroit and a car plant in

talks points of debate include funding terms for a trust to handle retiree health care obligations and the issue of job security creating a trust to cover retiree health care costs similar to the one created for gm requires paying billions of dollars up front which chrysler may not want to do or be capable of doing "cerberus isnt necessarily a long term owner " says aaron bragman research analyst

made commitments to building certain products in the u s as part of its concessions to the uaw but mr bragman says chryslers line of products remains in flux and that the companys focus is to internationalize "product and job guarantees for the u s run counter to their strategy " he says stocks are mixed stocks posted mixed gains wednesday morning with the dow jones industrial average
