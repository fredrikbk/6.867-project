china takes aim at u s on quality control amid criticism over recalls beijing points to defects in exports from america beijing the chinese government scrambling to counter a storm of criticism over the safety of the nations exports is now taking aim at products sent to china from some of americas largest companies in an interview with the wall street journal li changjiang chinas most senior quality control official and head of the governments person inspection service presented a list of defects and dangers he said have turned up in products shipped by u s companies these include turbines from general electric co ultrasound machines from a u s unit of philips electronics nv of the netherlands and farm machinery from deere &amp co mr li pointed to problems ranging from mislabeled pacemakers to engine problems to pesticide laden apples grown in washington state to defective homing pigeons infected with disease in some cases the companies involved had previously acknowledged and responded to complaints from china about the items from january to july for instance the u s exported shipments of goods valued at &# billion to china said mr li who is head of the general administration for quality supervision inspection and quarantine or aqsiq of those shipments chinese quality control officials found problems of one kind or another with shipments or of the total he said in washington u s officials said they were unaware of the examples cited by the chinese government but defended the safety of u s products sean spicer a spokesman for u s trade representative susan schwab said "while chinas recent efforts to improve food and product safety represent a constructive way forward attacking the u s which has one of the best systems in the world for protecting consumer safety is counter productive " recently china scored a public relations coup when a senior executive from the u s toy giant mattel inc apologized personally to mr li for a recall of millions of chinese made toys saying that the companys own "design flaw" was responsible for its biggest recall involving around million play sets containing potentially dangerous magnets the state run china daily newspaper ran an editorial sept with the headline "an apology at long last " at his agencys headquarters in beijing mr li provided the journal with a list of about a dozen american exports that have been seized by chinese officials for quality problems in the past year "i think fairly speaking both the chinese export companies and american importers all shoulder responsibilities " he said earlier this year for example chinese quality control inspectors discovered a broken crankshaft on an imported cotton picking machine made by deere according to mr li an inspection by aqsiq later attributed the problem in model no to a design defect deere ultimately agreed to replace the parts on the &# million shipment of massive green and yellow machines ken golden a spokesman for deere of moline ill said the company recognized a "quality issue" in the engine model for the no cotton pickers shipped to china deere was told that only one machine had actually failed he said the company replaced the part on all cotton pickers "even though the probability of engine failure was low " mr golden said "at no time could the defect have endangered the users of the equipment " he added mr lis list also cited shipments of more than hummer trucks models h and h manufactured by general motors corp of detroit and imported into china by unknown third party suppliers that mr lis office says didnt meet chinese safety requirements "the shape of the front large headlights dont have clear cut boundaries between bright and dark" so that "when two cars are driving toward each other it could have a negative influence on the drivers vision to cause dazzling " according to aqsiq the government also cited problems with smaller amber colored lights on the vehicles and markings on the speedometer that didnt meet chinese standards "these hummers were not manufactured according to chinese standards so there are serious hidden dangers to use these automobiles on chinese roads " said in a written statement provided by aqsiq gm doesnt import or sell hummer trucks in china according to jason laird spokesman in shanghai for general motors third party car dealers routinely ship cars around the world "any vehicle imported by general motors into china or any other country would meet the certification and licensing requirements " says mr laird "we certainly dont support third parties importing the vehicles because the sorts of issues the government is raising can and do occur " mr lis list also included a may shipment of pacemakers manufactured by st jude medical inc a medical supply company based in st paul minn the chinese government said tests showed "hidden dangers" in the pacemakers because voltage settings on the box didnt match the voltage settings programmed into the devices kathleen janasz a spokeswoman for st jude medical said that five pacemakers out of a total of units shipped in april "had a label that did not accurately describe the pacemakers voltage settings " in these cases the box indicated a voltage of while the pacemakers were programmed with a voltage of she added that both the voltage settings indicated on the box and those on the devices are safe for patients douglas p zipes a professor of cardiology at indiana universitys school of medicine and former president of the american college of cardiology says that the mislabeling as described by st jude didnt seem to pose a major threat to patients because even if a physician had implanted the device without double checking its voltage the pacemaker would have given a more powerful signal to the heart ensuring its effectiveness the five mislabeled pacemakers were returned to st jude medical ms janasz said that the labeling process has since been "strengthened to help prevent a similar occurrence going forward " in february the chinese government said inspection officials found a batch of ultrasound scanners manufactured by a u s unit of philips in which the power switch had "the danger of electronic shock " the shipment was blocked from entering china according to the government in december a hospital in fujian province imported the same product and found software problems it returned the ultrasound scanners to the u s this past may ian race a spokesman for the u s unit of philips said his company has no record of the february incident mr race said there was one ultrasound unit that had been replaced at the fujian provincial hospital because of a faulty cable that caused an error screen to occasionally appear on the machines display "this is a minor problem and in no way impacts safety for users or patients " mr race said adding that the company replaced the machine in a shanghai hospital experienced "frequent problems" with an x ray unit made by general electric "just within one year since the installation of this equipment " the document provided by mr li reads "there were post sale repairs including on the spot emergency repairs " ge spokesman peter otoole said there are of the advanced x ray machines installed world wide of them in china mr otoole said the machine has been "running as expected" since march and is scanning as many as patients a day separately the chinese government pointed to problems with gas turbines manufactured by ge and sold to a chinese power company according to the document provided by mr li the turbines had broken down several times most recently in may causing "heavy economic losses" for the chinese firms which included baochang power co in guangdong province baochang was unavailable for comment jim healy a spokesman for ge energy said ge worked closely with the baochang power plant to get the plants back on line quickly after the turbines shut down in may there were two e turbines involved in the shutdowns he said ge has of the e class units installed around the world operating at over reliability mr healy said the outages didnt present a safety risk to the operators he said china power companies have been big purchasers of ge turbines in recent years as the country has ramped up its electricity supply ge chairman and chief executive jeffrey immelt was in china for the signing of an agreement to sell two e gas turbines to wuhan iron and steel company ltd of wuhan china the eclectic list also cited a shipment of american bred homing pigeons infected with a dangerous viral disease as well as a shipment of boxes of apples from washington state that were found to have unsafe levels of methyl parathion a restricted pesticide in both china and the us the washington apple commission says it isnt aware of the shipment adding that methyl parathion hasnt been used in the u s for at least five years kathryn kranhold in new york sue
