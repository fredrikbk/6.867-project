bureaucracy hampers scientific visionaries your front page article about dr donald stein accurately describes how an innovative scientist starts and then pursues original research with the potential to save and improve lives "one doctors lonely quest to heal brain damage " sept the "medical establishment" works through denying data in defiance of true scientific method while dr steins administrators may not have known much about science or the problems of post traumatic brain injury reviewers of national institutes of health grants are expected to be familiar with the scientific method but in fact most of them are unproductive workers of remarkably low originality or achievement they generally value opinion especially their own over solid data these reviewers dont seem to understand the step wise nature of scientific progress so that they wont support a scientist like dr stein when he requests funding for the next step i wonder what finally forced them to confront his data and authorize federal funding i hope the journal will find more stories like this one and bring them to light almost all discoveries with medical impact go through the same process at least this important work is emerging from obscurity michael swift m d ardsley n y this is an amazing story about perseverance and intelligence dr stein is a true role model for any of us especially when we feel like giving in or giving up granted his discoveries and goals are more significant to society than any of my professional and personal goals but its all in perspective obviously a good sense of humor doesnt hurt either karen bean saratoga springs n y
