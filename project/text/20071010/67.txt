how less pay more risk sells itself job security promises have auto workers union poised to ratify gm deal today the contract agreement the united auto workers struck with general motors corp after a two day strike last month freezes union members base pay for four years it shifts &# billion in health care obligations for retirees from gm to a union run trust fund and it pays new uaw workers lower wages for the same work as veterans yet to dave green a local union leader at gms lordstown ohio plant this deal for lower pay and higher risk is "awesome " its "huge " it "sells itself " as voting concludes today the leadership of the uaw is expected to win its campaign to persuade workers to approve the contract to understand why look no further than this economically depressed town halfway between cleveland and pittsburgh in ohios mahoning valley drivers exiting the ohio turnpike are greeted with a giant banner draped across the wall of gms lordstown complex "home of the cobalt and g " but those chevrolets and pontiacs are believed to be money losers the latest in a three decade litany of small cars built here that have suffered at the hands of japanese competition if the plant the size of football fields with jobs and a &# million payroll shut down the town would be devastated "i can go work somewhere else " mr green said "but my neighbor who works at the school wheres he going to go he cant go anywhere " a key selling point for mr green and many of the members of local gm promised to build a new small car and a larger rear wheel drive car at the lordstown plant after it stops building the cobalt and g there in the deal is "a concessionary agreement but its going to help us keep some jobs in this country " mr green said that willingness to exchange ever expanding wages and benefits for job security is the culmination of a two year effort by ron gettelfinger the uaws president to set realistic expectations for members on a new contract amid mounting financial woes at detroits big three auto makers in the summer of as gm was spiraling toward a &# billion loss former uaw president doug fraser warned mr gettelfinger and other leaders in a speech at a union celebration that the problems facing unionized u s auto makers were deep seated and not the result of cyclical forces soon to change coming from the last uaw head to preside over significant concessions in the early s the remarks had particular resonance mr gettelfinger seized on the idea according to people familiar with the events and made it a theme of his effort to move the uaws members toward agreements that would allow auto makers to be more competitive with foreign rivals not long after mr frasers talk delphi corp gms former parts unit sought chapter bankruptcy protection saying that its labor agreements with the uaw which tied wages and benefits to gms levels made it impossible for the company to compete globally even though delphi chairman and chief executive robert s "steve" miller angered uaw leaders with his blunt critique of a contract that forced delphi to pay workers mowing lawns &# an hour in wages and benefits the prospect that the companys uaw workers could lose pension and health benefits in the bankruptcy dramatized the crisis facing detroit and the union about a year after mr frasers talk mr gettelfinger gave a speech to thousands of uaw leaders gathered for the unions constitutional convention in las vegas the problems at detroits auto makers were worse than the union had ever seen mr gettelfinger said the big three "faced a structural change not a cyclical one which could require far sighted solutions by our membership " he said echoing mr frasers words the terms "structural change" and "far sighted solutions" were picked up by uaw local leaders in the run up to this years contract talks mr gettelfinger is now locked in negotiations with chrysler llc which is pushing to alter some elements of the gm agreement the uaw has set a strike deadline of a m today next in line for bargaining is detroits most troubled auto maker ford motor co as mr gettelfinger and local uaw leaders campaigned for ratification of the gm deal they didnt focus on the proposed contracts concessions instead they pointed to features such as a long list of "product commitments" by gm to invest billions for new models to be built in unionized plants a tactic mr gettelfinger learned in nearly two decades of plant floor union politics at fords louisville assembly plant besides lordstown bowling green ky will get a spate of new vehicles and the detroit hamtramck plant will get a major prize the chevrolet volt gms planned plug in electric car to help create momentum auto negotiators said mr gettelfinger used an old uaw ploy scheduling the first votes at locals loyal to him where leaders and members had been promised specific future work local in lansing mich fit that description the more than gm workers in the local have been promised production of two new cadillac models starting in shop chairman art baker called reporters last week to say that more than of workers voting had favored the deal mr gettelfingers efforts havent gone without opposition three former top uaw officers have blasted the union run health care trust saying it would dump the companys risk on the workers some active local leaders including al benchich president of local in warren mich said they are neither satisfied with the contract nor the uaw leaderships explanations of it mr benchich said his chief concern was the two tier wage in a letter sent late last week to his members he said it was reason enough to vote no he argued in an interview that the two tier arrangement rubs against the grain of the uaws "founding principle that everyone be given equal pay for equal work " mr benchich who retired in january but is serving the remainder of his term as local president acknowledged the uaw had successfully set the table for ratification currying favor with individual constituencies and glossing over potentially problematic language in the actual contract for instance many of the people voting on the deal in warren are temporary workers and the contract has favorable terms for them in addition several of the people voting on the deal will be lured to retire very shortly with generous attrition packages he also noted uaw officials said that the next generation of transmissions would be built at the warren plant assuring work well into the next decade but mr benchich said the contract language states that getting the transmission work is "business case dependent that means we have to offer more cuts to make a business case its just a continual downward spiral " in lordstown local president mr greens approach to securing ratification at his plant had been to avoid a hard sell or engaging in arguments tall with short spiked brown hair and matching soul patch mr green years old is a relative newcomer to gm and uaw politics hes worked for gm since when he began as a summer helper on the production line eventually he went full time driving a forklift for eight years mr green who has a bachelors degree in social science took over as local president in march earning &# an hour mr greens message to members just the facts as he sees them the facts are job security steady wages and continued health coverage "im not trying to sell anything " mr green said "the facts speak for themselves " but just in case this past weekend mr green along with a representative from the international union held three closed door meetings in the locals union hall a converted gymnasium in chats with members leading up to the vote he tended not to mention the lower wages for new hires nor did he often talk about wall streets main obsession the unions agreement to take responsibility for retiree health care through a union managed fund called a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba to be free of the obligations gm will contribute &# billion to the trust fund wall street views that as a major union concession that should help gm close cost gaps with asian rivals such as toyota motor corp but when mr green mentioned health care he talked about continued coverage for active workers and not "veba " he said he didnt understand all the vebas particulars but trusted union leaders to tap top notch advisers to manage it and invest more carefully than gm mostly mr green focused on "the awesome feeling knowing theres a commitment" for future work at his plant by yesterday morning mr greens troops had spoken his local passed the deal with about of the vote he said the new contract will return gm to profitability and alter perceptions of its workforce "we did step up to the plate " he said "its just will people recognize that "
