politics &amp economics breaking a primary logjam south carolina decision may help set calendar south carolina may force an answer to a nettlesome question of this presidential primary season when will the voting begin for months states have been leapfrogging each other to move up their primary votes seeking a bigger voice in the selection and more revenue from big spending campaigns but the race has caused confusion among candidates who must make advertising and travel decisions and irked some party officials who want to bring order to the process of picking their nominees it also has cost some states yesterday democrats barack obama john edwards and bill richardson withdrew from michigans democratic primary after the party threatened to take away the states convention delegates if it follows through on plans to move its polling to jan from feb hillary clinton plans to stay in but without convention delegates as a prize the primary will amount to little more than a beauty contest similarly florida is being punished by both parties for calling a jan primary it will lose all its delegates to next summers democratic convention and half its delegates to the republican convention clarity may be coming the democrats have authorized four states to hold early decisions one of them south carolina must by state law announce the date of its primary at least days in advance that means that if south carolina democrats move balloting to jan as expected that announcement must be made within weeks that could trigger other states to finally lock in their dates including an iowa caucus as early as jan meanwhile wyomings republicans have scheduled a jan delegate selecting convention although it will likely mean going to the republican national convention in september with delegates instead of "we feel its worth it " said amy larimer of the wyoming republican party a compressed calendar with the early states voting within days of one another could alter the momentum of the campaigns political operatives say "maybe voters wont have time to reassess" their choices between primaries or between the christmas holidays and the start of voting suggests stuart rothenberg who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter iowa and new hampshire historically led off the presidential election season in late winter but in the last few election cycles they have moved their voting into january as other states tried to share the spotlight by scheduling their primaries ever earlier neither iowa nor new hampshire has set its date but "we will do whats best for iowa and we will be first " said carrie giddins of the iowa democratic party which runs the states democratic caucus new hampshire where longtime secretary of state william gardner alone sets the date also vowed not to be out maneuvered state law requires new hampshire to hold the first primary and "i will follow the law " mr gardner said the calendar creep was set off when the parties independently attempted to impose a primary schedule on the states republicans set a feb to july primary calendar allowing states to choose any date in between any state holding a vote outside those dates is supposed to lose half its convention votes the democrats also agreed to a feb start but allowed four early decision exceptions iowa new hampshire and two other states from among those that chose to apply the calendar it subsequently set put the nevada caucus after iowas and south carolinas primary after balloting in the granite state currently states are scheduled to vote on feb and an additional will vote by march locking up most delegates five months before the democratic convention opens aug and republicans assemble on sept but other states decided to jump the gun nevada and south carolina republicans moved their votes to january to keep up with state democrats florida jumped the feb season opener intruding on the date reserved for south carolina democrats wyoming republicans moved up their date "we wanted a voice for the smaller states we wanted wyoming to be in the spotlight " said the partys ms larimer michigans legislature also moved up the states primary date although the state parties can opt instead to hold nominating conventions that would allow them to keep their convention votes yesterday state democratic powerhouse debbie dingell wife of michigan rep john dingell linked the candidates withdrawal from the michigan primary to national party efforts to allow iowa to retain its historical influence at the expense of larger states "this election is not about president of iowa it is about president of these united states " she said south carolinas day trigger should help resolve some of the jockeying for dates because at least one of the four early decision states will finally be locked in but new hampshires mr gardner said he has no deadline for setting primary dates and that in past years he has waited until late december nevada also has no legislated deadline which means it could wait to be sure it isnt pre empted by any other latecomers party spokesman kirsten searer said the party has asked volunteers to keep open both jan the date assigned it by the national party and jan when it could caucus without having to share the spotlight with south carolina the democratic partys calendar currently has iowa scheduled for jan but iowas law requires its caucus to be eight days before the next "nominating event " that technically would mean new years eve if new hampshire calls its primary as expected for jan but democratic party rules require that delegates be chosen in the same calendar year as the convention friday jan seems unlikely even though iowa generally holds its caucuses on weekends friday nights are reserved for high school basketball in iowa the partys ms giddins noted
