why holiday tv pricing is key christmas will come for consumer electronics retailers the question is at what price after last years price wars on liquid crystal display and plasma tvs u s retailers and investors fear that competition this year will heat up again destroying profit margins on one of the few big ticket discretionary items many consumers may still consider buying wal mart stores inc added to those concerns earlier this month when it threw down the pricing gauntlet weeks before christmas the retailing giant cut prices to on its "top toys of christmas" and said it will announce new price cuts every week in what it called an "aggressive move to lead the market on holiday savings " wal marts price cuts last year put a jolt into promotions for tvs which make up the biggest product category for the likes of best buy co and circuit city stores inc on the one hand lcd and plasma manufacturers dont seem to be repeating last years pattern of sending too many tv sets to the market says bear stearns analyst christopher horvers the average selling price on like for like tv models fell by about between july and september at both best buy and circuit city an improvement over the to declines between june and july mr horvers says on the other hand uncertainties about consumer demand and how retailers will react as the season wears on are feeding more grinch like sentiment "we think that there is a good chance the holiday season this year will be as challenging as the last " cibc world markets analyst vivian ma said in a recent note to clients mr horvers says "things can definitely change" for the worse adding "it only takes one or two players to mess up the party " during its quarterly earnings call last month best buy expressed optimism that it will face less pressure to discount lcd and plasma tvs and other products this holiday season because there is a more balanced supply from manufacturers the retailer should also benefit from fewer competitors as compusa has closed stores and tweeter home entertainment group has filed for chapter bankruptcy protection credit suisse analyst gary balter says he continues to recommend buying shares of best buy saying recently that the stock continues "to trade like christmas may never come " circuit city also expressed optimism for the holiday season "we feel weve done a good job of getting ready at this point and of learning from the mistakes that were made last year to be ready for several different scenarios this year " company spokesman bill cimino says the company in august "knew there were too many plasma sets in the market " goldman sachs told clients recently "by mid october big price cuts started to flow through " so far the retailer hasnt seen similar developments and as a result goldman says it is hopeful the " debacle" in pricing wont repeat even so few analysts expect an industrywide recovery in sales growth that will be close to the levels before the holiday season given shoppers concerns about the u s housing market and the economic outlook research firm tns retail forward forecasts growth in sales at consumer electronics and appliance stores in the fourth quarter compared with growth expected for retail overall consumer electronics and appliance stores generated sales growth a year earlier driven by the promotional frenzy for high definition tvs but lower than expected retail prices and difficulty selling associated warranties and service packages hurt earnings at consumer electronics stores frank badillo retail forwards senior economist is a bit pessimistic saying recent pricing trends at consumer electronics stores suggest price cutting by the fourth quarter holiday will be even steeper than a year ago "combine that with softer demand and the result will be much weaker growth at consumer electronics stores " he says indeed some analysts believe warehouse clubs and wal mart will rely on discounts and promotions to stimulate customer traffic in their stores the recent market share stampede by less well known "tier " makers of lcd and plasma tvs including vizio olevia and insignia is also helping narrow the price gap with top brands analysts say that is creating a risk of post holiday markdowns among higher priced "tier " sets according to sanford bernstein analyst colin mcgranahan in the second quarter vizio leap frogged samsung electronics co sony corp and sharp corp to gain the top spot in unit market share for flat panel tvs from the no spot in the first quarter "holiday may not be a repeat of holiday but watch for blowout sales market share gains from tier brands with different and generally not positive implications for the consumer electronics retailers " mr mcgranahan said in a recent note to clients circuit citys price point positioning is closer to that of the warehouse clubs and its mix of products is also very similar which will make it more vulnerable to competition from costco wholesale corp ms ma
