a lie fanned flames of anti israel hatred thank you for publishing natan sharanskys "palestinian propaganda coup" editorial page oct reminding the world that it is never too late to correct a lie and acknowledge the truth the israeli government press office has just recently acknowledged its finding that the infamous france television footage purportedly showing a palestinian boy being shot by israelis was in fact faked it thus appears that france has perpetrated a villainous libel this was the sort of blood libel that fanned the flames of extremist hatred irreparably damaged israels reputation in the eyes of much of the world and led directly to the murder of more than israeli men women and children by palestinian terrorists all too real were the palestinian suicide bombing massacres that targeted israelis including children in their homes schools buses discos malls and pizzerias the lynchings in which gleeful palestinian mobs seized israelis and tore them to shreds and and all the other acts of barbarism and terror against innocent israelis while mr sharansky is correct that it is never too late to set the record straight it is also true that there is no apology that can suffice to make up for the damage this lie has done stephen a silver san francisco
