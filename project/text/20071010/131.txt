the walton effect art world is roiled by wal mart heiress the art world is of two minds about alice walton two years ago the wal mart heiress purchased asher b durands "kindred spirits" from the new york public library for a reported &# million to some this made her a raider of new yorks cultural heritage while to others she was just a savvy enormously wealthy collector ms walton is using her fortune estimated by forbes at &# billion to fill her crystal bridges museum of american art scheduled to open in bentonville ark in she wants to be accepted by museum colleagues as a kindred spirit so she can collaborate on exhibitions and borrow from other collections but some of her most recent maneuvers have positioned her as a hovering culture vulture poised to swoop down and seize tasty masterpieces from weak hands last year she and the national gallery of art jointly offered thomas jefferson university in philadelphia &# million for thomas eakinss iconic "the gross clinic" like the library jefferson needed money for its "core mission" and saw in a major work of american art an easily liquidated asset ms walton and the national gallery might have nabbed it but chastened by the "kindred spirits" furor she gave local institutions a chance to keep the painting in town by matching her price between them the philadelphia museum of art and the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts succeeded in doing so and ms walton had to content herself with a lesser eakins jeffersons "portrait of professor benjamin h rand" this year she turned her sights on fisk university a historically black college in nashville tenn fisk says it needs to "monetize" its art collection to meet important not art related educational needs it had agreed to sell one of georgia okeeffes most important paintings "the radiator building night new york" to the okeeffe museum in santa fe n m but first fisk had to get court approval the painting is part of the stieglitz collection works donated in to fisk by okeeffe widow of the celebrated photographer alfred stieglitz the santa fe museum which in became the okeeffe foundations "successor in interest" challenged the universitys right to sell from the collection but it agreed not to oppose the sale of a marsden hartley painting if it could have "the radiator building" for &# million regarded by many as a bargain price the deal was struck but before the two parties could get approval from county chancery court ms walton wrote to tennessee attorney general robert cooper jr offering &# million for a half interest in all works as a result on sept chancellor ellen hobbs lyle rejected the okeeffe museum agreement noting that it wasnt a good deal for the "obvious reason that crystal bridges offers more money " her approval will be needed for the new &# million agreement now struck between ms walton and fisk attorney general cooper who had opposed the arrangement with the okeeffe museum says he hasnt yet decided whether to back the new plan "a significant factor in our evaluation will be whether a reasonable alternative emerges that would allow the stieglitz collection to remain here on a full time basis " he said the president of the okeeffe museums board saul cohen blamed "mrs waltons interference" for the unraveling of his agreement with fisk and vowed to oppose the new deal in court no date has been set yet but on sept fisk filed a motion to expedite the court hearing saying that without the money the university might lose accreditation in her campaign for the stieglitz trove ms walton depicted herself as a defender of georgia okeeffes wishes "i understand the importance of honoring a donors intent " she wrote to the attorney general "the radiator building and hartley painting are critical parts of the collection and the collection will cease to exist if these two paintings are separated from the collection " but okeeffes instructions make it clear that the walton deal would not satisfy "donor intent " in her june letter to fisk okeeffe said that it was her understanding that fisk "will not at any time sell or exchange any of the objects" in the collection the universitys then president pledged to honor that understanding loans were to be allowed only for major retrospectives the latest nonprofit looking to its art collection to bail it out of hard times is randolph college in lynchburg va its maier museum houses an important collection of works by major american artists the college initially considered a collection sharing arrangement similar to fisks then on oct randolph announced that it had consigned four paintings to christies for auction next month among them is the maiers signature work george bellowss "men of the docks" estimated at &# million to &# million evidently speed was of the essence randolph risks losing its accreditation because of its high rate of spending from its endowment it will be up for review in december by the southern association of colleges and schools which has already given it a financial warning the colleges selling spree may not end there depending on how well the auction goes wrote board president lucy williams hooper in an oct letter to the college community randolph may have to "revisit the sale or sharing of additional paintings in the coming year " randolph is also seeking court permission to sell unspecified works bought with funds bequeathed by louise jordan smith one of them is "mrs scotts house" a major edward hopper painting her will stipulated that the money be used solely "to form a permanent collection of art " back in may ms walton took a personal tour of the maier and historian of american art john wilmerding who is her acquisitions adviser recently acknowledged that it was because she "was interested" in the collection but he said the initial terms which involved a half ownership and lend backs were complicated and the future could have been too "if they have a budget problem now what happens if you own half of these works and there are new budget problems " in addition mr wilmerding said the fact that the college was violating professional practice by deaccessioning for purposes other than buying art was a "hot potato" that ms walton wanted to stay away from "i think her feeling was that if anything ever came up for auction that was another stage and she might consider buying something " he said now she can the maier situation has caused an uproar on campus both the museums director karol lawson and its associate director ellen agnew have resigned and on sept ms agnew along with other litigants filed suit to block maier sales of works bought with smith funds the wider museum community also mobilized "its worrisome that would be considering purchases of this kind " declared jan muhlert director of penn state universitys palmer museum and a member of the association of art museum directors committee on college and university museums ms muhlert expressed disapproval that "any of our colleagues would take advantage" of a museums selling for purposes other than "replenishing the collection " aamd shot off an admonitory letter last week to randolph college urging it to reverse the decision to auction the four works "such a sale violates the fundamental integrity of the maier museum " it said aamd last february sent a similar letter to fisk ms walton who declined to be interviewed for this article has tried to be discreet about her buying binge announcing very few of her acquisitions and part of her campaign to be collegial has involved loans of important works to institutions around the country including the national gallery seattle art museum amon carter museum philadelphia museum and the houston museum of fine arts but when shes on the prowl for new acquisitions ms walton is still a tiger in pussycats clothing the walton effect is a destabilizing influence in the art world since ms walton dangles before financially challenged institutions the enticement of an easy if ethically dicey alternative to old fashioned fund raising to be sure any institution taking advantage of her ready cash to alleviate its financial difficulties bears full responsibility for violating professional principles in fact robert workman executive director of ms waltons crystal bridges museum assured me that she acquires "more times in response to an approach as opposed to being proactive " the "likely outcome " if not for her intervention would be for these works to disappear into private hands he observed theodore stebbins jr curator of the harvard university art museums and another specialist in american art says he has never met ms walton but admires what she has assembled he sees the masterpiece migration to bentonville as just the latest chapter in an age old story "art always goes where the money goes " ms rosenbaum writes on art for the journal and blogs as culturegrrl www artsjournal com culturegrrl
