the numbers guy holes in one few eyewitnesses earlier this year i wrote that the odds against hitting holes in one since january as amateur california golfer jacqueline gagne claims to have done were roughly quintillion to one she is claiming another six aces this year but new skepticism has emerged about her purported feat a lengthy article in the new issue of golf digest alleges that officials at several courses couldnt verify her performance and that many of her "witnesses" said they never saw ms gagnes ball actually go into the hole after a preview of the golf digest article appeared in august in golf world a sister publication i talked to ms gagne who stood by her claims and said the report was "so wrong" in suggesting that there were no witnesses who had seen the ball go into the hole she said she had personally seen "three or four" of the go in and said others had too i contacted ms gagne after the full golf digest article was published but she emailed back "i am not allowed to speak to any press at this time i have hired a lawyer and i will be seeking action " earlier ms gagne gave me the names of several witnesses including three who she said saw the ball go into the hole i was able to reach linda hogg a frequent golfing partner of ms gagnes who said she was present for ms gagnes april hole in one at mission hills country club in rancho mirage calif and saw the ball roll into the hole "i was watching the ball " she said "it was short on the green and rolled in" the cup four other witnesses who were with ms gagne for holes in one told me they were confident in her claims though they hadnt actually seen the ball go in the hole they did say that in each case ms gagne wasnt the one who discovered her ball in the hole ms gagne told me the same "never once have i ever gone up to the cup alone " a golf pro told me that golfers sometimes arent aware that theyve hit a hole in one until they reach the hole but said it was highly unusual for it to be the case so often for ms gagne robert barnes director of golf at mission hills told me "all that i know is that she has come in the witnesses have come in i have even called the golf pros at other courses as far as i know she had them and its all legit " the balance of ms gagnes holes in one have been spread across six other golf courses one course didnt return my calls at all the rest officials said they couldnt verify her claims two of the clubs said they had no record of ms gagne playing at the times in question ms gagne told me all of her aces were witnessed and said that when she didnt appear on a clubs records it was because she was playing as a guest of friends at silver rock in la quinta calif where ms gagne claimed two aces in a single round general manager randy duncan told me "ive repeatedly sent emails trying to get the proof " hes eager to promote the feat if it can be confirmed "but without validation i cant go on record saying she had them here "
