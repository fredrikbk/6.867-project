going green isnt always easy fighting to save the environment can be tougher than it looks consumer product suppliers are pushing to make their products and supply chains more environmentally friendly in an effort to bolster their images with consumers and garner favor with retail titan wal mart stores inc their initiatives which have ranged from cutting down on packaging to shrinking detergent bottles can help save costs for packaging and reduce fuel costs but those moves also require substantial initial investments and sometimes even changes in manufacturing processes by suppliers "it can improve margins " but there are a "lot of upfront costs" as companies change packaging molds for their products and advertise to get consumers accustomed to changes in familiar products said sanford bernstein analyst ali dibadj "very very small changes can run up and down a supply chain in ways you cant imagine " said ivan hindshaw a consumer products partner at consultancy bain &amp co unilever announced its all small and mighty a triple concentrate version of its all laundry detergent in october as part of that switch the company had new bottle molds created shifted to a different labeling process and changed sizes of bottle caps also to convince consumers that concentrated formula in the new ounce bottles could wash the same number of loads as the standard ounce container it also needed fresh advertising unilevers publicity gimmicks included a washing machine demonstration on "the ellen degeneres show " the company recently said that it plans to sell its north american laundry business and doesnt discuss the financial impact of its "green" initiatives much of the consumer product companies attempts in this area have come in response to a push by wal mart which in turn benefits from a better public image and more shelf space wal mart last week announced a partnership with the carbon disclosure project to measure the amount of energy used to create products throughout its supply chain at that time the retailer also detailed plans to sell only concentrated products in the liquid laundry detergent category a move that it said would save water plastic resin and cardboard "as an industry we will all be spending a great deal of money in molds in converting over as will our retailers in terms of resetting their shelves resetting their warehouses for new packs " said helayna minsk director of laundry for unilever u s ultimately "the consumer is better off because she is getting a much more convenient form of packaging and the retailer can put a lot more bottles on the shelves " she said procter &amp gamble co which is also converting its detergents to a concentrated formulation has said that it expects fiscal to be a net investment year for that initiative procter said one time costs for new molds manufacturing changeover costs retail conversion costs and higher marketing support would hurt fiscal earnings by a few cents a share but that the changes would eventually help retailers consumers and its own supply chain while consumers are paying far more attention to companies impact on the environment it is still hard to gauge and to quantify how much that trend will affect their buying decisions "whats on the horizon is going to be to see if consumers will be willing to pay more for products that are environmentally friendly " says martin franklin chief executive of jarden corp which makes consumer products jarden has been working with wal mart to improve its distribution logistics "if you can improve efficiencies in routing to distribute your products you are burning less fossil fuel at the same time you are saving money by doing so " mr franklin says "we try to look for win wins we have a business to run "
