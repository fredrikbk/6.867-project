honda and uaw clash over new factory jobs residency rules exclude most union members indignant in indiana anderson ind when honda motor co announced last year that it was building a new plant amid the farms of southeastern indiana hoosiers cheered then honda announced in august that only people living in of the states counties could apply for jobs a move that excluded most of the states thousands of unionized laid off auto workers hondas unusual hiring restriction highlights an often overlooked aspect of the united auto workers unions declining power while detroits big auto makers and their unionized suppliers have been slashing jobs wages and benefits foreign car companies have added u s plants and created thousands of new automotive jobs yet they have effectively kept auto workers with uaw membership cards out of their factories hampering the union from gaining any foothold where the jobs are of the auto engine and transmission plants in the u s that are wholly owned by foreign companies none have been organized by the uaw despite repeated attempts mainly foreign auto makers have located plants in southern states where the uaw has little presence and where right to work laws limit union power when they have ventured into northern states such as indiana and ohio they have mostly chosen rural locations far from any unionized plants and uaw halls the moves now are helping the foreign owned plants begin to lower wage scales in the case of hondas latest plant in greensburg ind the company received &# million in tax breaks and other incentives at least &# million of it in statewide funds but the company wasnt required to consider all state residents for jobs margaret ward is one of the people excluded the uaw member spent years assembling car components in anderson just outside the honda hiring zone along with about other people she lost her job early this year when a former general motors corp lighting factory closed the last of three auto related factories to close in anderson after spending six months on unemployment assistance shes working at a battery plant "i dont feel like this is fair to anybody in this area to anybody in the state " she says under the national labor relations act companies cannot discriminate against workers because of affiliation with a union they are however allowed to restrict hiring to certain geographical areas if they have a legitimate business reason for doing so a spokeswoman for the national labor relations board said uaw officials are gathering information in hopes of filing official complaints with the nlrb or possibly the equal employment opportunity commission honda spokesman david iida said the greensburg hiring policy is not intended to prevent union members from applying the auto maker just wants workers to live within an hours drive of the plant so they can get to work on time even in bad weather he said the area does include a uaw organized plant in indianapolis and one organized by the international union of electrical workers in connersville both of which closed and together idled about people honda wont accept applicants from outside the hiring zone who would be willing to move into it mr iida said because that could slow down hondas "aggressive launch schedule" to start production in late many uaw members dont believe hondas rationale noting thousands of workers from shuttered or downsized plants in muncie fort wayne and kokomo are excluded along with those who worked in anderson "ive probably had people ask me whats going on down there because they cant apply for jobs " said ollie dixon a city councilman in anderson and vice president of uaw local "i think its directly related to the union they dont want people who are going to go in there and support the union " some states have required that companies benefiting from government incentives spread the rewards broadly indiana didnt a spokeswoman for indiana gov mitch daniels said that honda as a private company is free to define its hiring process as it wishes the first term republican known for dissolving the unions representing state employees after his election didnt discuss the hiring policy with honda while negotiating to bring the plant to greensburg the spokeswoman said he was just pleased to have jobs come to indiana greensburg mayor frank manus says he also was initially unaware of hondas plan but in a telephone interview he said he believed a desire to keep its plant nonunion was "certainly a factor" in the companys decision to restrict its hiring honda plans to hire production workers in greensburg where basic wages will start at just under &# hourly and rise to &# over the next three years in big three assembly plants uaw workers get about &# an hour until recently nonunionized plants owned by foreign auto makers have paid close to that about &# an hour which helped damp worker interest in unions as eroding membership and contract concessions hurt the uaws ability to keep up a wage standard foreign makers have begun lowering what they offer in greensburg and elsewhere wages are pegged to the average of all manufacturing jobs in the areas not just auto plants indianapolis about miles northwest of greensburg is the only big city in hondas hiring zone it also is the only place in the hiring area where major uaw locals are located the rest of the zone is predominantly rural and has few manufacturing workers uaw members in indianapolis are free to seek jobs in greensburg mr iida says ms ward counters that despite some layoffs most uaw members in indianapolis are employed and dont need honda jobs unlike in anderson "we have a lot of people in anderson who need jobs but we cant apply " she says hondas policy in greensburg is a departure from the way it and other foreign auto makers have previously staffed plants in the u s several years ago honda put a plant in lincoln ala and took applicants from anywhere it ended up hiring workers from of alabamas counties according to the company the state which had provided honda with &# million in incentives required the company to consider workers from across the state "we wanted to spread the opportunity across our state and wanted plants to be able to hire the best people in the state " said calvin miller director of the alabamas talladega county economic development authority korean auto maker hyundai motor co also opened a plant in alabama in and accepted job applications statewide as a condition of alabamas incentive plan said hyundai spokesman robert burns when toyota motor corp put a plant in indiana in princeton in the southwest corner of the state anyone from indiana was allowed to apply for a job but in the end toyota hired almost all of the workers from within miles of the plant a toyota spokesman said at toyotas new truck plant in san antonio skilled tradesmen were hired from as far away as the midwest the spokesman said but neither plant has unionized african american leaders also have questioned whether hondas hiring plan discriminates against black workers the population of the county hiring zone is white with almost all of the nonwhites living in marion county where indianapolis is located in the hiring zones other counties the population is white "i think its wrong and unfair " said james burgess president of the madison county naacp in anderson of hondas hiring policy a racial discrimination argument defeated a hiring policy honda used in the s when it expanded two plants in rural ohio and gave preference to applicants who lived within miles of the facilities that excluded residents of columbus the nearest large city to both plants with a large african american population while the population within the hiring zone was overwhelmingly white honda settled a complaint by the eeoc by paying black and women workers &# million and offering them jobs in greensburg honda is working hard to encourage minorities to apply for jobs said company spokesman jeffrey smith indianapolis was specifically included in the hiring zone to open the door to african american applicants he said and honda invited black leaders to the groundbreaking and has advertised in minority newspapers the greensburg plant he added "will be a diverse and inclusive workplace " honda built its first u s auto plant in in marysville ohio and toyota soon added its first wholly owned plant in georgetown ky in the s more foreign auto plants sprang up bmw ag in spartanburg s c mercedes benz in vance ala nissan motor co in canton miss southern states provided a safe haven from uaw influence that permeates big three auto plants in the midwest in right to work states unions cant force employees to join or pay dues by honda had five assembly plants in the u s and was looking for a site for a sixth to produce civic compacts which were selling briskly because of the rise in gasoline prices indiana doesnt have a right to work law but was in the running for the new plant because it was located near hondas ohio plants and those of many of its suppliers the state also had a new governor with a pro business mind set within days of taking office in january gov daniels used an executive order to void contracts between the state and several unions representing public employees a few weeks later he set off to japan with the message that indiana could be a safe secure location for toyota and honda in march toyota announced a deal to produce camry sedans in an unused part of an indiana plant owned by fuji heavy industries ltd which created jobs that june the governor was back in japan but had to cut the trip short to rush back for hondas announcement in greensburg a town of people in a corner of the state known mainly for pig farms and corn fields residents had sent honda hundreds of letters pictures and drawings in hopes of convincing honda to settle there rather than choose a competing site in ohio about people donned red t shirts and stood in the shape of hondas logo for an aerial photo officials from greensburg and the surrounding counties boasted that the area offered plenty of cheap land easy access to interstate highways and workers with no ties to the uaw when honda announced its choice greensburg residents packed a community center to celebrate the news "this is probably one of the wildest dreams ive ever had " mayor manus told the crowd uaw jobs have been disappearing from cities in east central and northern indiana for several years muncie indianapolis and several other smaller cities have had to absorb plant closures kokomo and fort wayne have seen major downsizings few places have been hit as hard as anderson years ago it was the home of three big gm plants that provided some uaw jobs life revolved around factory work union teams filled up city bowling and softball leagues most downtown streets are one way to accommodate heavy flows to and from the plants during shift changes at local a mural pays homage to one of the unions proudest moments a sit down strike against gm in over the years gm sold each of the plants to suppliers the first closed in then last year delphi corp the former parts division of gm announced it would close its anderson plant the third the taillight plant owned by guide corp ceased operations earlier this year idling its workers one of them was ms ward a native of anderson ms ward got a nursing degree from the university of miami but eventually took a union job because of the good pay and benefits by the time the guide plant closed honda had already announced it would build its plant in greensburg ms ward years old was thinking she could find work there a cousin of hers works at the companys alabama plant and encouraged her to apply in july she went to a jobs fair and found a honda recruiter she left determined to apply a month later at another jobs fair a honda recruiter told her not to bother "she said anderson isnt in hondas hiring area and im like what hiring area " ms ward recalled one morning recently in september honda began taking applications for jobs at the greensburg plant over the internet ms ward considered using a friends address in indianapolis but worried what would happen if the company called and couldnt reach her she never applied in just two weeks more than people applied for jobs at the plant and honda stopped taking applications
