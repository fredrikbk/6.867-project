the daily fix pudge will return to detroit while a rod seeks a home online edition scott boras has his first big rodriguez deal of this offseason the detroit tigers exercised their option on veteran ivan rodriguez and will pay him &# million to catch next season the price was too steep but the tigers who went to the world series last year but are watching the playoffs from home this year had no choice michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "if they let him go they would still need a catcher and this is the toughest position to fill " mr rosenberg points out he then runs through the tigers unappealing alternatives including this "perhaps the tigers could have gone without a catcher in but only if their opponents hit every pitch and then the tigers would have to bring back nate cornejo and who wants to do that " pudges payday may be prelude to a historic signing of boras client alex rodriguez whether by his current team the new york yankees or some other club a rod can opt out of the final three years worth &# million on his current contract a move that the yankees have promised will guarantee he doesnt wear pinstripes next season mr boras hasnt set a price for a rods services but new york daily news columnist mike lupica speculates it could go as high as &# million over years leaving new york would be a mistake for a rod ian oconnor writes in the record "is there a problem here alex " mr oconnor writes "the yankees are providing you the biggest stage and the biggest wage and the best chance to qualify every year for the tournament you so desperately want to win for the sake of your legacy you have won over the fans for the most part you have prospered since the cathartic confession of your divorce from derek jeter you have just outplayed your famous ex in a playoff series you actually have recorded an honest to god postseason rbi " to get that run batted in a rod had to drive himself in hes a stunning for with no runs batted in over his last playoff plate appearances with runners on base "it makes no sense " tom verducci writes on si com "hes too good hes too good to strike out twice on six consecutive pitches from paul byrd as he did in his first two trips to the plate on monday night were talking fat pitches pitches down the middle eighty seven miles an hour " nonetheless a rod was far from the biggest yankees bust in this postseason and as mr verducci points out inept starting pitching is to blame in the clubs run of losses in their last playoff games will all the spending on the two rodriguezs and others pay off three of baseballs four remaining playoff teams paid their entire teams just a little more than a rod might make by himself next season in fact the indians rockies and diamondbacks ranked in the bottom eight in team payroll thats a big departure from recent seasons not since the florida marlins won the world series has a team in baseballs bottom half in payroll even made the league championship series "baseball has changed for the better " nick canepa writes in the san diego union tribune "brains now can beat money " yankees radio broadcaster suzyn waldman was audibly crying after the yankees lost their fourth straight playoff series theres no cheering in the press box but is crying ok new york times sports media columnist richard sandomir thinks it can be "it would be easy to condemn waldman for losing her composure demonstrating her feelings for manager joe torre and shedding her professional stance " mr sandomir writes "but waldman is not a standard analyst she can get away with reacting in a way that a male counterpart might be ridiculed for i cry at "cinderella " she said in the moments before she sobbed she is an empathetic personality her clubhouse demeanor is as much reporter as mother confessor so her catch in her voice weeping about torres probable departure was not surprising " mr sandomir adds "to me it is worse to be a clueless announcer than one who is emotional in a sport where crying is prohibited by the cinematic manager tom hanks " disgraced olympic track champion marion jones has admitted to using steroids and to lying about it this admission which cost her and former relay teammates their medals from the games in sydney does not deserve any admiration dave perkins writes in the toronto star "its certainly not confessing not in this book when you admit the truth only after getting caught and penalties await further lying " mr perkins writes "she faces sentencing on cheque fraud charges and to continue the daily lie would only worsen her sentence thats the way it goes in the justice system youre supposed to show remorse and come clean in front of the judge to differ is to invite a harsher jail term those who want to take seriously her tearful pleas for forgiveness are the same people who believed her finger pointing palmeiro like proclamations about being clean " at this time in last years college football season four undefeated teams in the top were national powerhouses whod been ranked in the top headed into the preseason this year only no lsu fits the bill hence usc after its stunning loss to stanford fell only to no and remains a contender for the national title "how can anybody explain so far " chris dufresne writes in the los angeles times "nine of the schools in this years preseason ap top have already lost three have lost twice and one has lost three times the cumulative record of the preseason top is six of the teams are no longer in the top two national title contenders michigan and louisville are no longer ranked in the top so yes usc can recover from a stupefying stanford setback to win the national title if it happens though we wouldnt recommend ever bragging about it in palo alto " southern methodist football was handed a death penalty sentence by the ncaa years ago no other college sports program has been shut down since then and smus subsequent struggles help explain why "two decades later smu coaches and players some not born when the ruling was meted out still are struggling to return the team to prominence " eric prisbell writes in the washington post other schools meanwhile have sought to avoid the same treatment by cooperating with regulators investigations and hiring compliance officers chuck klosterman has some ideas for fixing the way sports is covered among his suggestions de emphasize reporting of tv ratings stop arguing for the sake of arguing and slow down sports coverage "is arguing for a wide scale unilateral deceleration of sports culture ridiculous " mr klosterman writes in esquire "perhaps it would certainly put a lot of people out of work but i suspect its the only true solution to this problem and we still have time moreover theres absolutely nothing to lose unless of course you are the kind of person who dreams of the day when three different networks simultaneously tell you why you shouldnt be watching their
