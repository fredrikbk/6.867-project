"limit on the number of avatars visitors who could be in the store at the same time " he says "we sold more virtual products than we expected but it clearly wasnt going to compare to the channels we already use such as retail stores or online stores " some companies are looking at second life and other virtual worlds such as "there" and "gaia online" as a place to build brand awareness rather than sell products millions of us a san francisco consulting firm often advises companies on marketing techniques in virtual worlds "we are not necessarily creating stuff " says reuben steiger chief executive of millions of us "it is much more about creating experiences on second life " for example millions of us recently helped warner bros entertainment and the cw television network launch a "virtual upper east side" in second life to gain publicity and create enthusiasm for the television show "gossip girl " the idea says steiger was to mimic new yorks upper east side neighborhood where "viewers of the show can hang out with the avatars of the cast members and ask them questions " even for small businesses the virtual marketing strategy is simple says steiger consider your customers and their respective needs people in second life who are essentially living in a fantasy world respond to experiences rather than repurposed everyday advertisements to gain their attention and consequently their business steiger recommends providing experiences instead and like any business he added "the key to success is to make something really great "
