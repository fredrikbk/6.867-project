mitsubishi pick of pratt jet engine could set trend a nascent engine technology that could jump start development of a new generation of single aisle jetliners got a big boost from mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of japan the technology developed by united technologies corp s pratt &amp whitney unit could be used on aircraft that might someday replace airline workhorses like boeing co s and the airbus a pratt says it allows engines to increase fuel efficiency and cut noise mitsubishi a tokyo heavy machinery maker yesterday picked the new technology for its planned mitsubishi regional jet which would be japans first domestically manufactured passenger aircraft in four decades the jet promises to ratchet up competition in the market for aircraft that typically seat or fewer passengers pratts technology has been closely watched by boeing and european aeronautic defence &amp space co s airbus unit which are considering building a new generation of single aisle planes boeing and airbus already have attracted significant attention for their next generation long haul models the twin aisle boeing and airbus a because of their fuel efficiency and other benefits one important question is whether pratts technology can work over longer distances than regional jets fly mitsubishi has been steadily gaining traction for its regional jet which would seat from to passengers with the selection of pratts new engine mitsubishi officials said they would begin offering the plane to potential customers the final step before officially committing to build the plane officials say they hope the new airplane can be in the air by as early as with the new engine "we feel strongly that we will be able to create an aircraft that will have an impact " mitsubishi heavy industries president kazuo tsukuda said he added that each aircraft will be priced roughly between three billion yen and four billion yen or &# million and &# million a low range for that market niche though it is unclear what final prices will be the company estimates the regional jet would cost billion yen to develop and may include a government investment of billion yen pratt has been developing the technology called the geared turbofan engine for almost years it includes a gearbox just behind the main fan blade that enables the fan and the internal engine parts to spin at different speeds pratt says this allows it to run more efficiently burning about less fuel and making less noise pratt has spent roughly &# billion in research on the engine in recent years but boeing and airbus have been reluctant to endorse it out of concerns that its gearbox would be too heavy and could create maintenance worries "we are very much aware of the technology and applaud pratts efforts to continue the research and development in this area " an airbus spokesman said boeing declined to comment both big jet makers are under pressure from airlines to produce a new generation of more efficient planes to replace the and a both have said they are waiting for the engine manufacturers to make significant improvements in reducing noise and fuel consumption an accomplishment they dont expect until or later todd kallman president of pratts commercial engines division said mitsubishis decision was "really good news" for the geared turbofan in a research note bank of america aerospace analyst robert stallard called mitsubishi heavys endorsement of the geared turbofan "a considerable boost " the mitsubishi jet program already faces stiff competition competitors such as canadas bombardier inc and brazils empresa brasileira de aeronautica sa known as embraer have established products russias sukhoi co last week rolled out a seat regional jetliner that it hopes to eventually sell world wide and china has said it plans to develop its own indigenous single aisle plane
