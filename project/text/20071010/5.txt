a work in progress buying art on the web saatchi online offers a view of nascent internet market seeing artists in a night as art lovers descend on london this week for the opening of a glitzy art fair called frieze art sales have never been hotter at galleries and auction houses but the online marketplace for art is still as mottled as a monet water scene with vast amounts of art available at various web sites but a scarcity of big ticket buyers does art actually sell online its long been hard to tell now one big online gallery saatchi online is offering its first financial clues to the answer and a clearer picture of the much hyped internet art marketplace and its challenges more than a dozen internet sites from ebay to ugallery com offer tens of thousands of new artworks but top collectors like agnes gund in new york and curators like weston naef of the j paul getty museum in los angeles largely ignore whats offered on online art sites preferring to buy directly from auction houses or dealers even christies international initially struggled last year to persuade collectors to click and bid using its new online venture christies says its online bidders bought &# million of art over the past year saatchi online made a splashy entrance into this market over a year ago when it invited artists to upload and sell their creations on his site with the site taking no commission fees with charles saatchi a high profile british ad executive and art collector at the helm the site has been seen by some in the art world as a litmus test for internet sales now that over artists have signed up mr saatchi says he felt compelled to find out whether the sites artists were achieving any real world sales "people were always asking " he says "and i got tired of saying i dont know " in august the staff asked a randomly selected artists on the site how much art they sell on the site per week the who responded said their combined sales amounted to &# a week last month his staff posed the same question to a different group of artists on the site about a quarter replied and their combined weekly sales topped &# mr saatchi also says the site regularly gets over million user generated "hits" a day although the log ticks up every time a visitor opens any new page or image on the site his in house team doesnt tally the numbers of "unique" users but media metrix an independent research firm that tracks online traffic says the site got visitors in august mr saatchi says the sites numbers show the web site is "filling a need " but they also suggest that the site remains a relatively small player in the &# billion plus global art market one reason collectors believe that galleries support of their artists mean the works are more likely to increase in value over time collector sam schwartz of beverly hills calif who favors the works of sterling ruby and robert mapplethorpe says he would "never" consider buying from the saatchi site "i buy lots of art by looking at digital files " he says "but only when i already know the artists work in a tangible way and when i know their dealers will back them up " there are other reasons art buyers are reluctant to shop online galleries play the role of curator sifting through reams of art to serve up their picks while the bounty of choices on the internet can be daunting and the anonymity of the internet purchases may work against it in a field where where top collectors often want their peers and museum curators to know which artists and prestigious galleries they like best still some artists have scored big sales through the saatchi web site one of them is regine freise a set and stage designer from berlin ms freise says her realistic portraits had been turned down by at least berlin galleries before she posted a few on saatchis site in may within hours she had sold one "teabreak " for around &# she has since sold two other paintings to a swiss collector bringing her art sales on the site so far this year to about &# up from "none" the year before "im just amazed " she says jeffrey neuenschwander who bought "teabreak " has bought five paintings via saatchi online in the past year "i still like going to galleries but online you can scroll through or artists in an evening and see a large cross section of work " he says he typically asks artists to email him several images of work hes interested in so he can better judge color and scale other artists say the sites exposure hasnt reliably translated into sales changwoo ryu a london based artist was ranked first in a weekly "top " artist roundup on the site in may but says no buyers have surfaced charlene weisler an artist in manhattan says her saatchi page led to an invitation to exhibit her street graffiti photographs in a city apartment that was also on the market but she says no collectors have bought her work yet via the site while many other art selling web sites often charge gallery like commissions saatchi onlines nonprofit extension launched in may allows artists to sign up free and create tailored home pages on the site featuring their artwork and resumes artists are free to field email inquiries from any potential buyers visiting their pages and they can keep all proceeds from any art sales buyers in turn can shop around the clock for contemporary art made world wide the artists post images of everything from rudimentary sketches of nudes to wall size paintings by gallery veterans separate areas on the site are reserved for art students and children who want to display their art saatchi has held onto a portion of his original web site as a way to catalog his own private art collection mr saatchi says he is still trying to introduce elements to help more of the sites artists stand out on monday he unveiled a paypal assisted click and buy feature called saleroom and within the next year he plans to translate site pages into portuguese and russian the site is already offered in mandarin but mr saatchi concedes the venture still has some distance to go before it can truly compete with the experience of buying art in person in fact he himself usually arranges to borrow potential art purchases so he can see them in person first however he says next month marks an end to his self imposed restriction against buying work from his own site dealers say they dont feel threatened mary leigh cherry a los angeles dealer says she has no plans to hunt for prospective artist clients on art selling sites "there are just so many active artists already out there " she says "the market can only absorb so much " nicole asendorf a recent art school graduate from cottekill n y posted her work on saatchis site over a year ago in march she found her first taker ugallery com another online art selling site which has since signed her to a contract to use their site to sell her abstract paintings for anywhere from &# to &# apiece ugallery gets an undisclosed cut of her proceeds total sales so far just over &# for paintings she says adding "i just want my stuff to sell "
