a recipe for confusion at the ballet the sleeping beauty american ballet theatre metropolitan opera house through saturday june new york in the case of unsuccessfully prepared concoctions "too many cooks" often get fingered in the instance of american ballet theatres unsuccessful new production of "the sleeping beauty " which runs through saturday lets consider something like "too many catalabuttes " catalabutte is the officious yet inept court minister whose blunder of omission on the invitation list for a royal christening leads to a protracted near fatal spell cast over an entire fairy tale kingdom the fuss budgety catalabutte was the creation of marius petipa the french born balletmaster who led imperial russian ballet to its glories in the late th century and whose remaking of charles perraults famous tale about a sleeping beauty in a wood would become an enduring ballet classic petipas bumbling courtier found colorful depiction in the now world famous score tchaikovsky composed to satisfy the choreographic plan and let the story soar abt credits its new two act reworking of "the sleeping beauty" as having "choreography after marius petipa" with "additional choreography and staging by kevin mckenzie gelsey kirkland and michael chernov " mr mckenzie is abts artistic director ms kirkland a well known retired ballerina mr chernov ms kirklands husband and a little known teacher and director the ballets stage designer tony walton and costume designer willa kim are both familiar for their work on broadway richard pilbrow and dawn chiang designed the lighting catalabuttes gaffe is duly enacted during the first scene where for a while the show proceeds effectively the setting framed by delicately frescoed arched walls is fairy tale palatial the courtly characters dressed in a spectrum of prettily graded french blues are suitably regal the tangerine skies of the lighting marvelously changeable throughout the more than hour spectacle are maxfield parrish vivid but once the prominent good fairies arrive as if flying by way of somewhat ungainly lifts from their hardworking cavaliers the picture starts to get murky tchaikovskys music includes a marvelous "pas de six" meant to give the beneficent fairy godmothers opportunities for individual and group dancing in this staging however petipas sparkling movements and arresting geometric "tableaux" are often arbitrarily adjusted and almost smothered by busywork for the hands and arms would be mimetic details frequently blur the intended stage groupings built into petipas choreography the crucial lilac fairy whose gracious presence counteracts malign efforts elsewhere enters bearing an inexplicable length of royal purple chiffon the climactic entrance of the neglected and thus enraged fairy carabosse comes amid the belching release of hissing smoke and what looks like the crash landing of a meteorite she is never much more than a generic harridan in a fright wig carabosses spider like japanese beetle colored minions are intermittently effective the appearance of a beautifully hued rainbow at the end of the scene momentarily makes one forget the visual murk marring the "pas de six " aurora the ballets heroine and central focus has most of her petipa based choreography intact during the scene celebrating what petipa noted as her th birthday but recent tradition has turned into her th ms kims tutu for aurora looks somewhat faded while the surrounding characters sometimes appear gaudy and over dressed the villagers waltz known as the "garland dance " is a mix of previous versions made to replace petipas grandly scaled number including those by frederick ashton and kenneth macmillan mr waltons storybook castle looks somewhat squat and is overrun with calla lilies once aurora is put to sleep the protective brambles meant to seclude her slumber creep only vestigially into view act two which combines the original productions second and third acts piles on the confusions devised by the staging team to supposedly clarify the story prince desire enters with what might best be called four ballet buddies the five leap about impressively but pointlessly alongside a rivers edge that snaking and occasionally glowing body of water which dominates mr waltons autumnal landscape is the result of mr chernovs efforts at dramaturgy the program says the river was formed by tears of auroras mother the heartbroken queen after she was kept outside the sleeping kingdom by the lilac fairy the stage business that is meant to show the princes yearning for the sleeping princess pads out the act with a labored choreographic addition more ungainly lifts fill out this scene set to the contemplative violin solo that tchaikovsky composed as an entracte further dry ice fog and a griffin shaped skiff also play their extraneous parts eventually the approach to the slumbering castle involves a "spiderman" incident this shows the prince momentarily stuck in a silvery web that can be seen almost exclusive from the right side of the theater the final scene is the most shapeless of all mr waltons rococo little theater setting reminds one especially in its powder blue palette of the private theater at versailles but there the connection ends the program calls the scene a "wedding celebration " as is traditionally the case for this final act here however we are shown a reduced half hearted jumble of fairy tale characters all except in the famous "blue bird" number minus their specific dance music aurora and her prince eventually perform their familiar pas de deux and then get blessed by the lilac fairy looking rather like a living door knocker she hovers on wires uncomfortably above the wedding couple while holding a gigantic crown festooned with wispy purple swags except for a somewhat embalmed looking and posturing veronika part as aurora on opening night abts dancers variously acquitted themselves well with the challenges presented by this unconvincing look at a th century masterwork lively performances can and will override some of the misguided thinking that now stymies this production one response toward a "too many cooks" dilemma is a "back to the drawing board" effort a clear and coherent staging based on petipas plans could yet be arranged in the colorful frame already in place all thats needed is a single minded good fairy with a strong hand a clear eye and sound appreciation for what "the sleeping beauty" offers in terms of stirring ballet theater mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
