a cultural conversation with janet price ceo of a new cavalcade of the arts toronto wags smirk that toronto is equivalent to new york run by the swiss and frankly i dont know if that would be such a bad thing for if one word could characterize canadas largest city it is the word "agreeable " the streets are clean the architecture a pleasing blend of postmodern towers and monumental victorian buildings with beautiful residential neighborhoods complete with front porches and back yards nestled in the middle of town there are tree lined european style boulevards and parks an efficient subway and a true sign of beulah land for me streetcars you can also get around quite easily on foot even at rush hours the streets are hardly packed with people a pleasant change for this new yorker yes toronto is a most agreeable city and i have come here to experience the preparations for an event calculated to enhance its allure even further luminato torontos first international interdisciplinary arts festival during its inaugural run which continues through june luminato is offering an extraordinary array of events both ticketed and free in venues spread around several square miles from the citys posh yorkville neighborhood to its buzzing harbourfront centre and restored distillery district along the lake ontario shore highlights feature a host of world premieres and novel collaborations including "book of longing " a recorded reading of original verse by canadian poet and singer songwriter leonard cohen set to live music composed by philip glass "the passion of winnie " a multimedia "opera" by filmmaker warren wilensky for which winnie madikizela mandela herself will make a special guest appearance and an original play based on the last days of glenn gould written by celebrated filmmaker john mcgreevey cultures throughout the globe mingle in a variety of edgy treatments among them a striking mixed media chamber work "constantinople " by the toronto based gryphon trio danza cubas original production of "vida " a vivid exploration of cubas social history and "kshetram dancing the divine " a celebration of indian bharatanatyam temple dance and music by lata pada and sampradaya dance creations and thats only skimming the surface there are art installations and gallery shows a free "lart boat" to reveal to passengers new sculptural works visible only from the lake street fairs light shows readings jazz zydeco cabaret in the s style spiegeltentntavern and of course an international cornucopia of food and drink in a world brimming with international festivals luminatos inaugural affords one the chance to discuss with janice price luminatos ceo just what it has taken to create this kind of arts jamboree ms price a toronto native spent the past decade in the u s most recently as president and ceo of philadelphias kimmel center for the performing arts prior to that she was the interim executive director and vice president of marketing and communications at new yorks lincoln center for the performing arts at the start of our conversation ms price acknowledges that "we canadians live with a constant awareness of having to differentiate ourselves culturally from the gigantic neighbor to the south " indeed based purely on externals canadians and americans look alike and our speech often sounds alike so i ask how luminatos polycultural polyglottal profile uniquely represents canada ms price explains that luminatos cultural mix springs from the desire to dispel a widely held misconception "much of the world still perceives toronto as a lot of white people in parkas " she says "when in fact toronto is the most immigrant intensive city in the world close to of toronto residents were not born in this country " canada she notes has handled this influx differently from the u s "instead of a melting pot canada desires to create a social mosaic instead of encouraging assimilation in canada we say to our immigrants let us fund you to teach your children your native language and to celebrate your native culture luminato reflects this through collaboration and diversity which i consider two of its fundamental principles " to my comment that diversity is an oft used buzzword nowadays ms price responds "diversity for me is much more complex than a little kitschy folk dancing or folk art for instance in lata padas kshetram dancing the divine we see how classical indian dance and music adapts and changes in the worlds most multicultural city and then redefines itself though the interpretation of an indian born artist educated in toronto " at the same time she feels that "in its desire to define itself culturally to its own people canada has been relatively absent from the worlds stage canadas own performing arts organizations havent really kept up at creatively getting themselves beyond our own borders " part of the difficulty she feels is the difference in outlook between canada and a country like finland and she bases this comparison on her own experience "during my decade at lincoln center and the kimmel center i think i presented every finnish artist that country sent out and thats because finland clearly decided that exporting their culture is a national imperative canada concentrated instead on striving in our own universe " looking inward however canada and toronto in particular invested a great deal of money in its arts infrastructure restoring such landmarks as the magnificent elgin and winter garden theaters originally built one above the other by marcus loewe as the canadian flagship for his vaudeville and cinema chain building new ones like roy thomson hall the toronto symphonys home and adding improvements to existing ones such as daniel libeskinds startling glass extension to the royal ontario museum this has given toronto the ability to create a truly city wide festival rather than one bound to a single campus or building but ms price and her colleagues regard the buildings as a concrete means to a greater end housing the festival so that it can continue creating new work by bringing artists together and providing funding for collaborations within toronto and beyond its borders "a fundamental aspect of luminato is that there must be a curatorial place for our local arts groups every single year " she says "and we will be happy for our colleagues at other international festivals to come and see what we offer and possibly present some of these offerings at their own festivals later on but ill feel that luminato has truly succeeded when another festival joins us in creating a new work at the development stage we have some companies here that would be natural partners for a bam or a barbican or a sadlers wells so as we introduce those people we can jointly create fresh work in which we both have a stake " obviously in todays throwaway culture audiences at a generally contemporary arts festival can often be hard pressed to determine for themselves which works have permanence and which dont its a question ms price herself has given considerable thought "part of the excitement of a festival is that it may provide you with the only time you will ever see this or that artistic project " she observes "the work may have only been meant to be seen once or you may feel that it was worth seeing only once but we want audiences at this first festival to leave saying we wouldnt have seen this in toronto if it werent for luminato " mr scherer writes on classical music for the journal his latest book "a history of american classical music " is being published by sourcebooks in august
