business can lee scott overcome retailers growing pressures at wal marts annual meeting last week chief executive lee scott confessed to the intimate group of assembled in the university of arkansas bud walton arena that friends have asked him "lee it seems like sometimes your job must be a drag how do you get through all that " good question its also worth asking how much longer will he do it wal marts stock has risen about &# a share since fridays festival which featured speeches by top executives interspersed with jokes from comedian sinbad and a performance by "american idol" winner jordin sparks yet the stocks rally itself is a sign of mr scotts troubles it happened because his critics forced him to raise the white flag of surrender and scale back plans for new store construction in the u s by more than instead of spending that money on new stores the company now plans to return &# billion to shareholders through buybacks other retailers have cut growth plans and other companies are turning to share buybacks but for the worlds largest retailer the latest retreat is an uncomfortable acknowledgment that shareholders have better uses for that money than mr scott does "this hasnt been an easy year " rob walton wal marts chairman and son of company founder sam walton told the crowd the company made a big misstep by trying to sell upscale products to its no frills customers meanwhile democratic politicians continue to use it as whipping boy for alleged corporate callousness sen barack obama said recently that he wouldnt shop at a wal mart store while fellow presidential candidate sen hillary clinton once a director of the company called its success a "mixed blessing " then there is julie roehm the advertising executive who wont go away wal mart says it fired ms roehm because she had an affair with a subordinate sean womack and took gifts from an advertising firm draftfcb that was angling for wal marts business ms roehm is now defending her honor by trying to trash mr scotts her latest court filing accuses the wal mart ceo of buying "yachts" and "a large pink diamond" at "preferential prices " and accepting private plane rides from entrepreneur irwin jacobs whose companies do business with wal mart she also charged that mr scotts son eric created "the appearance of a conflict" by going to work for mr jacobs the courts will have to sort out the truth in all of this but a close reading of the documents shows ms roehm is far more spirited in attacking mr scotts supposed misdeeds than in defending her own she denies the affair with mr womack but has little to say about the email provided by mr womacks wife in which he writes to ms roehm "i think about us together all of the time little moments like watching your face when you kiss me " likewise ms roehm denies that she and mr womack were angling for new jobs with draftfcb yet she has scant explanation for an email in which mr womack told tony weisman of draftfcb that he and ms roehm were "both interested in having a equity stake in our next gig" and that "in the two of us you have a team that can help lead your organization in a powerful way " the email ms roehm says is "out of context " ms roehm deserves credit for chutzpah but she may have met her match in irwin jacobs on friday mr jacobs filed a defamation suit against her saying the accusations involving him are simply untrue in an interview yesterday mr jacobs told me that ms roehm and her lawyers "will wish to god they never heard my name because i will not go away i will hang onto this thing until i get satisfaction " mr jacobs says the "yachts" cited in ms roehms filing are a couple of fishing boats made by a company controlled by mr scott and purchased at full price he says he doesnt own any private airplanes and while eric scott used to work for him the younger mr scott never did any business involving wal mart as for the diamond mr jacobs says he knew nothing about it until he read about it in the newspaper "lee never lets me pick up a check for anything " says mr jacobs "its almost comical " still the combination of sluggish stock performance and persistent attacks must be taking their toll on mr scott and they are clearly taking their toll on the company he runs at fridays meeting rob walton whose family owns of the companys stock gave the ceo what seemed to be a ringing endorsement "the board and the walton family have absolute confidence in your leadership lee we appreciate you and we thank you " but when such public displays of support become necessary you have to wonder how long they will last corrections &amp amplifications wal mart stores inc s chief executive officer lee scott bought fishing boats made by a company controlled by entrepreneur irwin jacobs yesterdays business column mistakenly said the company was controlled by mr scott wsj june
