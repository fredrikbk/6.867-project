common sense a roadmap for those eager to buy stocks now sit tight smartmoney bull markets are great but they pose their own set of problems especially in long running low volatility ones like this one for one thing they dont offer many obvious entry points i last signaled a buying opportunity almost exactly a year ago on june lately ive been hearing from many of you who are eager to buy the question is when theres no easy answer if youre following the disciplined strategy i use in this column youve recently raised some cash that money is meant to be held in cash until another buying opportunity presents itself i buy at intervals of declines in the nasdaq and sell at intervals of increases the median decline and rise in bear and bull markets in other words you have to be patient its not such a bad fate with short term cds and money market funds yielding close to with little or no risk theres also nothing wrong with selling some stocks to buy others as long as you maintain a constant exposure to the market but ive also heard from many readers who have recently come into some money and as a result are overweighted in cash others have written to say theyve never owned stocks and want to buy some for the first time its been especially frustrating for those who want to buy the "ten stocks for the next ten years" i recommended in the may issue of smartmoney magazine www smartmoney com tenstocks since those stocks have been doing even better than the market averages since march the date the stocks were chosen theyve collectively gained compared with the s&amp p s rise of thats a strong performance but no reason to abandon them just because you missed the earliest part of the run what worries me about people putting new money into the market now or investing in stocks for the first time is that they could be buying at a market peak this is the antithesis of the common sense mantra to buy lower and sell higher of course theres no way of knowing if the market is at a peak only time will tell but for those who feel the risk of missing further gains outweighs the danger of buying when the market averages are setting new records heres my advice buy only on a day when the averages are down thats a simple way of guaranteeing you dont buy at an absolute market peak even if it turns out youve only missed it by a small amount dont put all your cash to work at once make a list of the stocks you want to buy and how much you want to invest and then spread out your purchases in the case of the stocks for example you could buy one stock a week for weeks you may end up paying more but you will also be able to take advantage of any pullbacks in that period start by buying stocks on your list that are well off their highs for example among the stocks i recommended two have declined harris interactive is off and sirona dental systems is down in any broad market pullback they seem likely to drop less than stocks for which expectations are much higher by contrast tetra tech has gained and id save it for later viasys healthcare is up but its a special case since its the subject of a merger agreement with cardinal healthcare it may be worth remembering that there was a big rally in the spring of too with many people clamoring to buy the averages peaked in april less than two months later the nasdaq had dropped and a common sense buying opportunity was at hand for those of you waiting now i assure you that there will be another buying opportunity eventually james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy jonathan clements is on vacation when to invest the common sense system uses the following stock strategies buying stocks when the nasdaq average drops selling stocks when the nasdaq average jumps spreading out your stock purchases to take advantage of further pullbacks
