wellpoints ceo takes the reins facing challenges angela braly was already under pressure heading into her new job as wellpoint inc s chief executive last friday the choice of the year old lawyer over several more senior company executives announced in february came as a surprise and as head of the largest u s company run by a woman she is likely to be watched especially closely then two days before she took the helm last week ms braly and outgoing chief executive larry glasscock asked wellpoints well regarded finance chief david colby to resign for violating the health insurance giants code of conduct now on top of the usual challenges of becoming a new ceo ms braly is faced with managing a company facing questions over what misdeed led to mr colbys departure though ms braly and mr glasscock made clear in last thursdays announcement that mr colby years old had violated a company policy they have kept a tight lid on specifics only adding that the violation wasnt illegal and didnt affect the companys business or finances mr colby couldnt be reached for comment and a lawyer representing him didnt return a call yesterday the resulting rumors at wellpoint and in the industry have distracted attention away from ms bralys ascension and the appointment of mr colbys successor wellpoints year old chief accounting officer wayne deveydt wellpoints stock fell or &# on the day mr colbys departure was announced and hasnt recovered it ended composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday at &# about the same as last thursday in an interview yesterday ms braly said an investigation of mr colby by an outside law firm began just days before the board was informed last wednesday "we did what we thought was fair and equitable " she said while she declined to provide more details she said it was necessary to reveal that mr colby had violated the code of conduct in some way "it was clear with the position involved that it was important to be as transparent as we could be " she adds "but its always a difficult situation " she acknowledged however that wellpoint did receive a subpoena for mr colbys company emails and text messages from rita dicarlo who filed a suit against mr colby in ventura county superior court alleging he promised and failed to give her possession of his &# million home in an exclusive california golfing community wellpoint officials wont say whether the suit is related to mr colbys resignation but it has fueled speculation that an entangled personal life was behind it ms dicarlo had apparently lived in the house for some time and the indianapolis star published an announcement of his engagement to her last year although he still has a divorce pending ms braly said "were going to focus on the future " adding that she has been busy on the investor conference circuit becoming more well known to analysts and investors in recent weeks ms braly says she has toured states where wellpoint operates blue cross and blue shield health plans visiting with some managers she also has been meeting with some of wellpoints biggest employer customers wellpoints circumspect approach is a departure from much of the current thinking on how to handle messy executive departures "more and more companies are coming right out in situations like this to say what has occurred in order to quell rumors " says freada klein a san francisco consultant who specializes in workplace bias issues gerald meyers a business professor at the university of michigan and crisis management expert agrees that "classic crisis management says come clean get the dirty linen out tell the story quickly and get it over with " a dallas native ms braly has an upbeat and unassuming nature that belies her toughness colleagues say her predecessor mr glasscock who will stay on as chairman has hailed her deal making savvy she jumped into the health insurance business after practicing law at a st louis firm in when she became general counsel at blue cross blue shield of missouri the health insurer was in the middle of a protracted political and legal battle to convert to for profit status which ms braly helped smooth over and brokered a deal she joined wellpoint when it took over the missouri plan in and during the merger between wellpoint health networks and anthem blue cross and blue shield in again played a key role in overcoming political and regulatory hurdles since ms braly arrived at wellpoints indianapolis headquarters in she has overseen wellpoints medicare contracting business public policy legal affairs and government relations as well as other responsibilities on wall street in particular ms braly has big shoes to fill mr colby was a chief architect of the &# billion wellpoint anthem merger which created the countrys biggest health insurer in terms of members he had also once been considered a prime contender to succeed mr glasscock who unexpectedly announced his resignation this year for what he described as family reasons on a wellpoint conference call about mr colbys resignation last week one analyst described him as "well loved " but as directors considered a successor to mr glasscock the more mild mannered ms braly emerged as the front runner as wellpoints general counsel and public policy strategist ms bralys experience dealing with the government already a large insurance payer and becoming even larger through medicare and other assistance programs landed her the ceo job those skills are expected to be important as health plans struggling to grow in a stagnant market face increased antitrust scrutiny in acquisitions and as soaring health care costs put pressure on state and federal governments to come up with reforms "directors concluded that her experience communicating with the government at a time when health care insurers can expect their top executives to be testifying before congress was what wellpoint needed going forward " says a person knowledgeable about ms bralys promotion in recent months ms braly and wellpoints board worked hard to retain mr colby as her no shortly after she was chosen to be the new ceo wellpoint named mr colby vice chairman and granted him a one time award of shares of restricted stock worth roughly &# million and stock options he wont reap those awards as the restricted stock wasnt vested when he resigned the company said ms braly is one of just women now heading companies on the fortune list and runs the largest in terms of revenue following her are patricia woertz ceo of archer daniels midland co and indra nooyi ceo at pepsico inc ms braly often notes that " of health care decisions are made by women" and that wellpoints ranks mirror this some of wellpoints managers and of employees are women as are a third of its directors ms braly is the mother of three school age children her husband retired from his familys trucking business in texas a few years ago to move with her to indianapolis where he is a stay at home father "when my children were babies i was the one who really had the responsibility for their care " ms braly said in a recent interview "but the balance changed over time and he became the person who was more responsible for the kids activities and i was able to focus more on my career "
