india may try to replicate cotton success new delhi cotton output in india is surging just a few years after it started growing genetically modified varieties now some are saying the country may have to shift that model to other crops if it is going to succeed in its quest for food security bacillus thuringiensis or bt cotton is the only genetically modified crop commercially grown in india and the wide acceptance of bt cotton has catapulted india into its new role as a major producer and exporter of raw cotton and textiles cotton production is on an upswing at a time when production of most food crops including staples such as wheat and rice has stagnated leaving a supply gap for food that can be met only by high priced imports at the national development council meeting in new delhi last week prime minister manmohan singh referred to indias "technology fatigue" and "the lack of any breakthrough in agricultural production technologies in recent years " agricultural growth in india lags behind even sub saharan africa while farm incomes remain perilously low and most farmers struggle with high debt the consequences for the indian economy couldnt be starker india employs more than million of its billion people in agriculture which last year contributed some of gross domestic product or the total value of goods and services produced there and yet even as the second most populous nation struggles to produce enough food for its own people it is remaking itself as a major producer of cotton accounting for almost a fifth of global output second only behind china and providing of global exports all on the back of bt cotton india has around million acres under agriculture but almost two million acres are lost each year to nonfarm activities for cotton plantings are on the rise to million acres this year from million in the season of the current total bt cotton accounts for million acres against fewer than acres in since the period indias cotton output has almost doubled to million bales weighing pounds each and average yields are up by around two thirds largely because of lower rates of pest infestation in the hardier bt cotton varieties while increases in cotton plantings have largely come at the expense of cash crops such as peanuts and not food crops tighter land supply makes the wider acceptance of higher yielding genetically modified foods a necessity according to some "if more volumes have to be produced on less land and with limited supplies of water transgenics will have to play a pivotal role " said bhagirath choudhary national coordinator south asia for the international service for the acquisition of agri biotech applications a nonprofit organization the agency promotes the use of transgenics or genetically modified crops mr choudhary reckons that next year will see cotton production hit million bales observers say bt cotton is the only significant technological breakthrough in indian agriculture since the green revolution of the s when the introduction of hybrid seeds jump started production and ended indias reliance on imports for its staples scientists in india are investigating the use of transgenics in at least crops including rice wheat corn rapeseed and potatoes but large scale trials have yet to be conducted many foods can be grown only once a year so testing can take a decade or more from laboratory to field trial to commercial sign off observers worry it may take several more years before commercial cultivation of food crops begins unless research is accelerated but for cotton farmers circumstances couldnt be better the number of transgenic bt cotton hybrids available for sowing this year has reached from just in "in the next few years indias entire cotton crop will be genetically modified " said r k baldua vice president at gujarat ambuja exports a cotton trading firm but the enormous increase in acreage hasnt been without controversy echoing concerns raised more than a decade ago particularly in europe environmental activists point to the biosafety risk that bt cotton poses to agriculture at large they fear that the bt gene could contaminate crops grown in adjoining fields and enter the human food chain new genes in foods can be problematic in two ways by releasing harmful toxins or by raising a foods propensity to cause allergic reactions scientists test transgenic crops for both
