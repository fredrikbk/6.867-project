unintentional reminders of the five week trial which included testimony from major washington media figures joint chiefs of staff chairman gen peter pace wrote that "i was always impressed with mr libbys professionalism and his focus and attention to the matters at hand " mr libbys lawyers had argued the defendant was so busy with weighty matters he was the victim of faulty memory when

tannen the noted author of books about how men and women and communicate such as "you just dont understand " she is a georgetown university professor and libby neighbor she described how mr libby once offered to lend her family a tool to fix the problem with a septic drain field and then fixed it himself a national institutes of health researcher wrote that she had met mr libby years ago after her

spokesman for the national association of criminal defense lawyers called the letters in the libby case "extraordinary in more than years of doing this i believe this is the most amazing letter writing campaign ive seen " one former associate of mr libby who didnt write was his ex boss the vice president after the sentencing mr cheneys office put out a statement that said "on a personal level lynne and i remain deeply saddened by this tragedy and its effect on" the libby family noting that the defense has indicated it plans to appeal the conviction mr cheney added "speaking as
