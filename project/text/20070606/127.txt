trading up years of global growth raise inflation worries chinese indian labor long damped prices but effect is reversing for the past decade low priced labor from china india and eastern europe has helped much of the world enjoy economic growth without the sting of inflation now that damper on prices is beginning to reverse and global inflation pressure is starting to build companies in many countries are operating at close to full capacity facing shortages of everything from land to equipment western workers and their low cost rivals both are winning higher pay thanks to rising demand in some cases the global links of the economy are increasing costs rather than lowering them as far flung businesses compete for the same resources central banks are increasingly worried about spare production capacity running out which could force them to raise rates to their highest level in years to stave off inflation that could puncture the ebullience of stock and bond markets which have become accustomed to a rare combination of fast growth low inflation and low interest rates already long term interest rates are on the rise in anticipation u s year treasury bonds hit a nine month high of nearly yesterday "markets have gotten used to the idea that the global economy will keep producing downward pressure on prices " says ken rogoff a harvard economics professor and former chief economist at the international monetary fund "but that phase may be ending " in remarks to a bankers conference in south africa yesterday u s federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said rising chinese domestic costs could eventually feed through to u s imports but likely would only have "modest" effect still he reiterated that risks to moderating inflation "remain to the upside" in the u s because demand is high relative to capacity european central bank president jean claude trichet has warned that european industries have little scope left to raise production and has asked unions to show restraint in seeking wage increases for the overall health of the economy the bank is expected to raise rates when it meets today germanys engineering sector the mainstay of its export led revival is operating at of capacity leaving the lowest amount of slack since the s amid falling unemployment germanys most powerful union ig metall recently pushed through a pay raise of to cover much of the manufacturing sector this year the bank of england raised interest rates last month in part because "there might be less disinflationary pressure in the global economy " according to the minutes of

at any time since the mid s according to the confederation of british industry even the price of chinese exports such as furniture and clothing is rising and provincial authorities there raised long stagnant and still tiny minimum wages by an average of last year indian outsourcing giant infosys technologies recently raised entry level wages and expects to do so again amid increasing competition for its workers to be sure globalization still is helping contain some price pressures and growth is still strong inflation remains moderate at around in industrialized countries and not much above in many developing countries the lack of price pressure has allowed central banks to leave their short term interest rates percentage points lower on average than at the peak of the worlds s economic boom j p morgan says even though the world economy is growing even faster now the flood of cheap imports into the u s has benefited consumers there and subtracted about one percentage point a year from u s inflation for the past decade says the international monetary fund goldman sachs economists said in a report last week "there are pockets where inflation has risen more than expected but the most recent evidence is that inflation is receding " especially in the u s and japan still signs are now multiplying that global growth is fueling inflation rather than restraining it says richard fisher president of the federal reserve bank of dallas and a nonvoting member of the feds policy committee "more and more i hear people complain about the rising costs of hiring indian m b a s or the wages paid to chinese workers " he says as an inflation damper he adds global capacity has gone from "tailwind to a headwind " bruce kasman chief economist at j p morgan chase warns investors world wide have been underestimating central banks willingness to raise rates to avoid a repeat of the spiraling inflation of the s the last time the world economy grew as strongly as today it wont require much higher rates he says to "cause significant damage in the markets " global crosscurrents from china and india and other fast growing developing nations are raising some costs in the developed world u s farmers for instance are paying more to export grain because the large ships they use are busy serving chinas booming domestic market the price to use the ships has risen to almost &# a day from &# last year says oivind lorentzen iii president northern navigation america inc a stamford conn based shipping company the collision between rising demand and tight supply is evident in germany

trucks and cargo trailers many of whom underestimated the surging demand for commercial transport "were basically sold out " says managing director hans joachim nikolin this month continental raised its tire prices by up to partly passing on the cost of natural rubber which has soared amid high demand from asia the shortage of tires poses a problem in turn for companies like schmitz cargobull ag europes largest maker of cargo trailers the company had planned to make around trailers in the year through march up from the previous year instead it ended up making as demand for transporting goods and materials around europe soared notably in the fast growing economies of europes ex communist east europes tire makers didnt have enough tires available to cover the extra production so schmitzs purchasing manager josef buddenkotte flew to china to buy more tires there to hold down the surge in costs schmitz expects to make trailers in the year ahead and has just raised its prices by schmitz added a third production shift to cover demand but with germanys labor market tightening has had to pay bonuses to attract enough staff schmitz also will have to digest a rise in wages this year under german industrys deal with the ig metall union demand for wood is booming too including for the specially treated plywood that schmitz uses in its trailers finnish forestry products company upm cant

hundred million chinese are still scraping out a living on farms in theory they could triple their incomes by taking a job in manufacturing or construction but the demand for labor and its supply are
