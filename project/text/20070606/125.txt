weyerhaeuser reaches juncture weyerhaeuser co investors have more to consider than the price of lumber or the merits of paper versus plastic these days the time when investors confidently could predict weyerhaeusers stock price based on metrics such as the outlook for the housing and pulp markets are over at least for now in the past three months weyerhaeusers stock has traded at historical highs despite the soft u s housing market the companys real estate and home building division is also under pressure weyerhaeusers forward price earnings ratio stands at according to factset whereas rivals international paper co and temple inland inc are at and respectively but while weyerhaeuser shareholders await a return to housing market health they can contemplate four possible nearer term catalysts that could have a significant impact the possible sale of the containerboard packaging and recycling business a restructuring of the company into a real estate investment trust legislation to give tax relief to c corp timber companies which are those that must pay taxes first before distributing profits to shareholders and a buyout by private equity investors who covet timberland last summer when it became apparent that higher interest rates were at last starting to slow the housing market analysts speculated shares of weyerhaeuser then in the &# range could decline further making the company a possible takeover target instead the stock recently traded at &# off its high of &# on feb but well above its week low of &# set in july the current lofty stock price reflects not so much the current outlook for weyerhaeuser products but rather how much the company would sell for if it were broken into parts said paul latta an analyst with mcadams wright ragen on that basis wall street values the federal way wash company at between &# and &# a share based on recent sales of large tracts of timber by other companies "there is still a market for timber out there and the stock is in an unusual position in that its actually selling at a discount to the sum of the parts valuation " said mr latta who rates the stock at "hold " weyerhaeuser has been under pressure of late to "unlock" the value stored in the company by selling assets or restructuring into a reit a move that typically holds tax advantages for investors although possibly not in weyerhaeusers case international paper and temple inland have restructured or are in the process of restructuring by selling assets while potlatch corp and rayonier inc have converted to reits weyerhaeusers most recent move completed in march was to combine its fine paper division with domtar inc to form a new corporation domtar corp weyerhaeuser said the deal created significant value for shareholders through a tax free transaction when it released first quarter earnings in early may weyerhaeuser said it would consider strategic opportunities for its containerboard packaging and recycling business bruce amundson a weyerhaeuser spokesman said recently that there is no update on the companys evaluation of the future for those assets analysts say there are a number of potential buyers including smurfit stone container corp koch industries owner of georgia pacific temple inland meadwestvaco corp sappi ltd and packaging corp of america each has existing operations that would be enhanced by such an acquisition "i dont think people would expect something in the next couple of quarters but we might have a template of how it could unfold" in the domtar transaction said steve chercover an analyst with d a davidson &amp co for weyerhaeuser to contemplate converting to timber reit status a sale of a nontimber asset would put it closer to the necessary structure to qualify for it on an asset basis mr chercover said in order to qualify to convert into a reit of assets have to be timber related and of gross income has to be generated from timber assets or timber related assets said the analyst who rates the stock neutral converting into a reit potentially could trigger a large tax liability depending on how the internal revenue service viewed the transaction if the irs deemed the conversion primarily a strategy to avoid taxes it could trigger a &# billion to &# billion tax liability this liability would be based on the estimated value of the companys timber today compared with what it cost when weyerhaeuser bought much of the million acres it manages in the u s more than years ago the company has said instead weyerhaeuser continues to support legislation currently before congress called the tree act of that would give tax relief for it and other c corp timber companies mr amundson said the legislation calls for a reduction in taxes generated by timberland for qualified timber growers this would bring the total tax rate down to for the company and for individual shareholders comparable to a reit at while the legislation has failed in past years chances have improved because some tweaking of the proposal has resulted in broad industry support for the measure this year mr chercover said as if all these possibilities arent enough to consider investors are also well aware of the growing role private equity is playing in u s markets hedge funds and other private equity players are buying companies of ever larger sizes making even a company the size of weyerhaeuser with its &# billion market capitalization a potential candidate mr latta said "its a little large for a typical equity deal but its by no means out of bounds " mr latta said private equity isnt loath to pay a price based on the sum of the parts value particularly when timberlands are involved mr chercover said "they havent had the same kind of bubble popping mania that residential real estate has had because timberlands are a great vehicle for preserving wealth long term " mr chercover said these alternatives may have the potential for big shareholder gains but investors will have to remain patient for the short term especially given the gloomy outlook for the housing market analysts said while there is "significant" opportunity for weyerhaeuser to unlock the value of its parts "we think the pace of change will be relatively slow in coming " wrote claudia shank an analyst with j p morgan in a recent report
