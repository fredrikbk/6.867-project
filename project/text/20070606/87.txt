politics &amp economics basque threat adds to europes fears spains peace strategy fails as eta separatists end truce european terrorists re emerge madrid spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero came to power betting that a policy of conciliation toward the basque terrorist group eta would put an end to decades of killing and tension yesterday eta sent word that mr zapateros gamble had failed in a communique sent to two basque newspapers eta said it was formally ending a month cease fire and would return to violence to defend its goal of creating an independent basque homeland "its clear that the false solutions presented thus far lead us nowhere " eta said in the statement "zapateros goodwill has turned to fascism " eta said the statement raises the specter of a new wave of bombings and political assassinations eta has been weakened by a decadelong police offensive and terrorism experts say it only has a few score hard core militants prepared to strike but the group has historically opted for surgical strikes against high profile people politicians judges and journalists that require less infrastructure than large scale terrorist attacks the groups statement also adds to a rising concern among european governments home grown terrorist groups believed to have been stamped out are re emerging in january a rocket propelled grenade landed in the u s embassy in athens the attack believed to be the work of local greek radicals shattered a calm that the country thought it had achieved after years of bloody battles with left wing extremist groups earlier this year police in italy unearthed a network of left wing terrorists who had been stashing arms and recruiting a new generation of adherents the group has links to the red brigades which carried out kidnappings and assassinations throughout italy in the s and s but which the state believed it had eradicated the resurgence of left wing and separatist terrorism comes at a moment when most governments have been focused on threats from islamist terrorism mr zapatero had made the controversial "peace process" including talks with eta and concessions to violent basque nationalists the centerpiece of his government "eta is once again mistaken " mr zapatero said in a news conference following etas statement yesterday "the future of the basques will never be determined by terrorist violence " he said the cease fire may have been effectively dead since late december when an eta car bomb in the parking garage of the madrid airport killed two people etas threat yesterday to renew widespread violence in spain could thwart mr zapateros chances at re election next year just as center left politicians are in retreat across europe the apparent failure of mr zapateros conciliatory approach raises a larger question about security in europe mr zapatero was elected in the immediate aftermath of the march madrid train bombings carried out by islamist extremists which killed people he reversed the previous governments policy of supporting the u s led war in iraq arguing that it had made spain a target for terrorists he withdrew spanish troops from iraq and launched what he termed an "alliance of civilizations" aimed at better relations with the muslim world some critics believe mr zapateros policies have made spain more vulnerable "al qaeda has been closely following this governments dealings with eta to see just how far the government can be pushed " says gustavo de aristegui the foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition center right popular party in parliament "with the alliance of civilizations and everything else theyve done theyve made this government a hostage to all sorts of terrorism " he says etas communique comes a week after regional elections that took place during a period of escalating street violence by pro basque independence radicals although mr zapatero upheld a ban on etas political party batasuna he allowed a refounded basque separatist party accion nacional vasca to participate in the elections that allowed hundreds of pro eta candidates to be elected across the basque region still many in etas political wing were angry that the government had stricken from the ballots the names of more than candidates thought to have connections to terrorism eta or "basque homeland and liberty " has killed almost people since when it began its violent campaign for a separate basque nation which in addition to the spanish region of basque country would also include the region of navarre and a swath of southern france previous spanish governments used relentless police and judicial action against eta terrorists and their political backers more than eta terrorists were arrested in the past decade and the groups political wing was banned from taking part in elections that cut off public funds for pro eta politicians and stripped them of parliamentary immunity the combination helped weaken etas operational ability and drained its grass roots support which is especially strong in many small basque towns where pro eta politicians are often the majority party but after almost years the spanish government couldnt snuff out eta entirely simmering street violence death threats and extortion have for years been a constant in basque country one of spains richest regions mr zapatero hoped to end decades of violence by engaging with pro independence radicals he modeled his peace process on the good friday accords that helped bring peace to northern ireland but mr zapateros determination to negotiate with eta fomented tension with the popular party many fellow socialists and victims of terrorism massive street demonstrations against mr zapateros plan have been a fixture in spain for more than a year pressure to end talks with eta increased after the december bombing in the madrid airport etas first deadly attack in three years and the theft of pistols by eta commandos in southern france late last year spanish antiterrorist officials warned the government that eta was taking advantage of the cease fire to rebuild its strength just as it did in a cease fire in and but the spanish government anxious to keep negotiations open made further concessions it released one former eta killer from prison after he staged a hunger strike the government appointed state prosecutor blocked efforts to prosecute the leader of etas political party for advocating terrorism the government also allowed most pro eta candidates some former members of eta to run in the recent regional elections despite a spanish law that forbids political parties that advocate violence from running for office "the process of negotiation and surrender begun by zapatero has taken us from seeing etas imminent defeat to a situation in which the terrorist group has recouped its institutional presence its public financing and its operational structure " read a statement yesterday by the ermua forum a pressure group comprising victims of basque terrorism
