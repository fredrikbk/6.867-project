free scooter libby i lewis "scooter" libby was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison yesterday and yet the response from the white house was to turn its back on the vice presidents former chief of staff a spokesman said president bush felt "terrible" about the ordeal that mr libby and his family have endured but if that is true mr bush is a stroke of the pen away from ending that ordeal with a pardon the white house has insisted throughout mr libbys prosecution that it would let the "process" play out well the "process" has now come to the point that in all likelihood mr libby will be ordered to report for incarceration by august if not sooner judge reggie walton did agree to hear arguments over staying the sentence while mr libby appeals his conviction but he also expressed deep skepticism that a stay was warranted meaning mr libby probably has no more than days before his sentence begins if he goes to jail it will be above all for two reasons he was energetically defending the administrations prewar intelligence at a time when most everyone else in the administration from condoleezza rice to colin powell and steven hadley was running from it and he refused to do a harold ickes and fail "to recall" when investigators came knocking it bears repeating that although judge walton increased the sentence on grounds that mr libby had obstructed an investigation into the leaking of classified information neither he nor anyone else was ever accused of that supposed crime mr libby ironically was right to believe he was in no jeopardy for the conversations he had with reporters in june and july special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald has repeatedly said that mr libbys lies prevented the government from learning the truth in that investigation but mr fitzgeralds version of the truth has now been ratified by a jury and still there is no evidence of an underlying crime if mr libby had not tried so hard to reconstruct passing conversations with several journalists months after the fact its hard to imagine he would be in his current position staring down a month sentence and &# fine as for president bush it was the cowardice and incompetence of his administration that led mr libby to this pass feeling "terrible" wont keep his man out of prison
