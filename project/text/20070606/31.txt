contradictory impulses make american conservatives unique i enjoyed peter berkowitzs very fine article "the conservative mind" editorial page may however his choice of friedrich hayek russell kirk and leo strauss as the three chief sources of conservative thought highlights some of the great difficulties of discerning a peculiarly american tradition of conservatism as many have pointed out its not clear that kirks brand of traditionalist conservatism is all that accommodating of the american regime also while strauss clearly had some affection for american constitutionalism and i believe classic liberalism generally he was also a sometimes austere critic of it finally hayek didnt exactly consider himself to be a conservative although it is fair to say that his concern for the traditions and customs that make liberty possible make him a less than typical libertarian part of what makes identifying a characteristically american conservative tradition so difficult is that its foundations are replete with less than conservative elements a universal theory of natural rights individualism contractualism etc on the other hand one could also argue these unconservative abstractions are tempered by a genuinely conservative spirit the continuity with british constitutionalism the significance of the influence of aristotle and polybius the emphasis on local communities in the fed anti fed debates for example and a deep sense of the limitations of human nature it might be the case that the hybrid character of americas founding make it impossible to fit into any simple conservative category any explication might require recourse to an understanding that pays proper deference to conservative and liberal impulses alike in this sense it might actually have a great kinship to the political thought of john stuart mill in the sense that he tried to combine the apparently incompatible thought of jeremy bentham and samuel taylor coleridge mill believed that a successful society required both contradictory impulses for its continued health ivan kenneally visiting assistant professor political science rochester institute of technology rochester n y mr berkowitz is correct in his outline of the growing democratic lockstep in this country i would offer a smaller less noticed trend on the national scene emerging throughout pockets of "blue state" america which may illustrate how the ideological lockstep is not to the partys long term advantage one such pocket is minnesotas mesabi iron range where i grew up current discourse in the range may be creating "mondale republicans " much as s discourse gave us "reagan democrats " since the late s the range has experienced a shift from staunch unquestioning support of mondales democratic party to serious public questioning of the issues that now most resonate with that party this is evidenced in everything from political signage to letters to the editor although these "rangers" would not exactly say their political affiliations have been hijacked by liberals with particular agendas they often express outrage over many of the democratic elites pet causes abortion on demand gay marriage and most significantly radical environmentalism the iron ranges elusive economic prosperity depends upon forestry mining and tourism all affected deeply by this agenda minnesotas democratic farmer labor party used to not only listen to but also advance the interests of the iron range as mr berkowitz notes the interesting conversations are now on the conservative side where more and more pockets of the blue state rust belt america may find both an ear and a voice christine malovrh plymouth minn
