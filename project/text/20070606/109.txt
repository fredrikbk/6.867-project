entertainment to oversee its branded entertainment efforts he talks below about the technique and about the widely publicized travails of anheuser busch with its branded entertainment site bud tv wall street journal why are marketers and the entertainment world so enamored with branded entertainment mr friedman its interesting to everyone in the entertainment marketplace today because the cost of promotion is extremely high if you look at the feature film business the average cost of opening a movie is &# million in the television business it is extremely difficult for marketers to cut through the ad clutter the television business is also looking to offset marketing cost and can do that with branded entertainment where they can get the help from advertisers from the branded side because of time shifting right now about of television viewing is shifting because of that there have to be other solutions for advertisers wsj bud tv one of the most aggressive moves by a marketer into creating

education about the car so they can purchase the car the car companies were thrilled it provided them with another way to feature their products rather than just running traditional noninteractive advertising its funded by the automobile companies the deal gives us the ability to take more of our shows including drivetv and others global the pact also will give us insight into what is working globally wsj during this years upfront cw unveiled "cw now " a show that wont have any commercial breaks instead advertisers will sponsor the content as tv networks and hollywood push further into product placement and branded entertainment do they face resistance from consumers or even legislation mr friedman there has always been government intervention when it comes to kids marketing but not so much when it comes to the adult market there is the potential for spoilers in the branded marketplace those people who do not create compelling content for consumers and those who try to subliminally integrate messaging wsj the road to hollywood is littered with road kill what advice would you give marketers who are just looking to get into the space mr friedman "dont smoke the entertainment crack pipe do whats right for the consumer " ad notes u s advertising spending declines tv and newspapers take the biggest hits advertising spending in the u s slipped in the first
