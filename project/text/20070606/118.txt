the evening wrap frazzled pharma online edition glaxosmithkline and federal regulators found themselves on the defensive as lawmakers sought answers about what some researchers say are the high heart risks involved in taking a popular diabetes drug moncef slaoui the head of research and development at glaxosmithkline told lawmakers at a hearing of the house committee on oversight and government reform that the overall safety of diabetes medication avandia is comparable to other diabetes drugs and provides substantial benefits to diabetics "the sum of the science establishes that avandia when compared to other widely used anti diabetes medicines is not associated with an increased risk of death including death from a cardiovascular event " mr slaoui said the drug which regulators approved in was linked to an increased risk of heart attack last month in a study published by prominent cleveland clinic cardiologist steve nissen who also testified at the hearing glaxosmithkline has stood by the drug yesterday the new england journal of medicine which first posted dr nissens data posted preliminary findings from a study called record that found no evidence that avandia is tied to an increased risk of death but the authors of the analysis said that the study which wont end until next year didnt provide enough data to reveal whether avandia is associated with an increased rate of heart attacks rep henry waxman chairman of the congressional panel acknowledged that the proceedings werent going to establish whether avandia is safe he said that the more immediate issue for lawmakers was whether or not the food and drug administration needs greater resources and authority to address safety concerns that arise after a drug has been brought to market regulators came under heavy criticism a few years ago when the now withdrawn merck painkiller vioxx was linked to a higher risk of cardiac complications and the avandia uproar echoes that case in a number of respects the fda defended its response to questions about avandias safety commissioner andrew von eschenbach said the drugs label was updated "on several occasions" to reflect new information including data on heart safety risks today the agency said that it would go a step further and ask glaxosmithkline to place a "black box" warning on avandia and that it was asking that takeda pharmaceutical maker of a similar drug called actos do the same for that medication actos is co marketed by eli lilly the agency plans a meeting of outside experts to scrutinize data on avandia at the end of july glaxo stock which has been hammered of late declined slightly today glaxo wasnt the only mammoth drug company dealing with sour news today jon symonds will depart as chief financial officer of drug maker astrazeneca in order to take a management position at goldman sachs group the company said mr symonds had been seen as a likely successor to former astrazeneca chief executive tom mckillop but when u s operations chief david brennan got the nod instead many onlookers suspected that mr symonds might choose to seek out greener pastures the news was no less upsetting for being foreseen at least from the standpoint of some observers mr symonds was regarded as a critical member of the management team around wall street particularly amid a nice recent streak for the companys shares attributable in no small part to the companys strong financial performance according to graham parry of merrill lynch mr parry said that mr symondss exit comes as the company is trying to bulk up its pipeline and integrate large acquisitions like its recent purchase of medimmune shareholders didnt appear alarmed astrazenecas stock was little changed still being a drug industry cfo has recently seemed a little

water and markets in europe slipped on rate jitters ecb boosts interest rates as expected the european central bank raised its key interest rate from to the increase marked the eight time since december that the bank has moved borrowing costs in the bloc higher and brings the price of money in europe to its highest level since september economic growth in the euro zone has been strengthening for some time and with consumers and businesses feeling flush and unemployment falling to record lows europes policy makers have begun to fear that brisk activity and tight labor markets will fan inflation there thus may be more rate increases on the way ecb president jean claude trichet promised that policy makers would continue to keep price trends under the microscope saying monetary policy in the bloc was "on the accommodative side" and that the central bank would act in a "firm and timely manner" to keep prices stable still in the same way that traders suddenly transform themselves into budding linguists when a few words from the federal reserve float across the tape markets applied their hermeneutic muscles to mr trichets comments and decided that because he had said the ecb would watch inflation "closely" instead of "very closely " the bank had turned a bit more dovish on price trends labor costs on the climb many onlookers believed that when the u s economy slowed nearly to a dead stop during the first quarter the fed would at last be forced to push rates down a peg but federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and the central banks rate setting committee have kept their eyes firmly fixed on inflation and data today helped reinforce why policy makers remain concerned over prices productivity during the first quarter grew at a revised rate but unit labor costs a gauge of inflation in the labor market jumped higher than an earlier estimate of whats more labor costs during the fourth quarter rose adjusted upward from a previously estimated rise economist joseph brusuelas of ideaglobal said that lends support to the feds inflation worries even amid the modest rate of expansion in the broader economy since labor costs account for about two thirds of business expenses and other economists said that the data may foreshadow a potentially more troubling issue for the fed down the road "we fear that the puzzle we will be asking in a year is why has trendish growth produced such a significant pickup in price pressures " wrote stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital another stem cell breakthrough researchers reported creating embryonic stem cells without using eggs or destroying embryos in a development that may help overcome some ethical questions about the use of stem cells in medical research in experiments on mice four independent teams of scientists returned old mature cells such as skin to their primordial embryonic state further experiments showed that the derived cells had the same properties as true embryonic stem cells such as the ability to turn into heart nerve and other tissue types some contributed to the creation of baby mice three of the experiments didnt use eggs and didnt require the destruction of embryos "weve shown that we can reset the clock " said rudolf jaenisch of the whitehead institute for biomedical research and lead author of one of the studies which is published in the journal nature but he said that "were very far away from this being turned into routine medical treatment " bush downplays putin comments president bush said "russia is not going to attack europe " in an effort to ease anxiety that began building when russian president vladimir putin said over the weekend that he would retarget moscows missiles toward europe if the u s went ahead with plans to install a missile defense system in the czech republic and poland "russia is not an enemy " mr bush said repeating words he used at a news conference held in prague yesterday "there needs to be no military response because were not at war with russia russia is not a threat " mr bush cited iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads declaration that it was "too late" to stop irans nuclear program as justification for basing a shield in europe and reiterated that moscow has no reason to worry about the plans mr bush and mr putin were scheduled to meet later today on the sidelines of the group of eight summit which opened today in germany ford makes strides on quality ford motor made significant strides in a closely watched annual quality study in which each of the auto makers domestic brands
