unused patents expose owners pay up or be shut down those were the stark choices facing research in motion ltd in march the company had exhausted all avenues of appeal in its patent dispute with ntp inc and faced the possibility of a permanent injunction on blackberry smart phone sales so rim paid &# million to settle with ntp a virginia patent licensing company three months later a texas jury sided with finisar corp in its patent dispute with directv group inc finisar a fiber optic components maker requested a permanent injunction on directvs set top box sales the judge refused noting among other things that finisar hadnt made the "slightest effort to ever use its patent " why was finisars request denied while ntps request seemed so assured that rim coughed up &# million the answer ebay inc versus mercexchange llc the landmark decision commonly known as ebay was issued by the u s supreme court on may two months after the rim ntp settlement and about a month before the finisar directv verdict before ebay permanent injunctions were granted routinely to patent holders who won infringement cases the ebay ruling ordered courts to apply a four factor test when deciding whether an injunction is merited for instance to win a permanent injunction patent holders must prove that they suffered irreparable injury and that remedies available at law such as monetary damages arent adequate compensation ebay was a product of the battle between companies that generate their revenue from licensing and litigating patents and the firms they target at issue is whether this growing subset of patent holders dubbed "patent trolls" by detractors stifle innovation by using litigation to extract excessive damages from infringing firms while it will take years before ebays effect on the patent industry can be fully assessed a year after the decision one trend is clear patent holders who dont use their patents arent winning permanent injunctions since ebay there have been patent disputes where permanent injunctions were sought according to a weblog maintained by joseph miller associate professor at lewis &amp clark law school in portland ore injunctions were granted in and denied in nine successful requests had two key elements patent holders practiced their patents and the infringing parties were competitors the new standard has led some patent holders to try new strategies aimed at restoring leverage one emerging trend is the filing of infringement actions at the u s international trade commission which isnt bound by the four factor test patents confer the right to exclude others from making or selling inventions for a limited time roughly years in the u s traditionally patent holders have used this limited monopoly to produce and market their inventions some patent holders license their patents to third parties while this isnt new patent licensing has become a lucrative business in its own right this was partly fueled by the demise of the internet bubble which left many companies with nothing but their intellectual property assets today an entire industry built around buying selling litigating and licensing patents has emerged justice anthony kennedy took note of this trend in his concurring opinion in ebay "an industry has developed in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but instead primarily for obtaining licensing fees " justice kennedy added that threat of injunctions can be used to charge exorbitant fees to companies that want to license a patent the use of injunctions as a "hammer" to extract large license fees helped trigger a backlash against the burgeoning patent industry ebay was the first of several recent supreme court rulings to curtail the clout of patent holders and a patent reform bill before congress proposes tougher standards for assessing damages some patent licensing companies argue that ebay helps large companies retain control of the overwhelming majority of patent royalties "what they want is an unlevel playing field " said paul ryan chief executive of acacia technologies inc a newport beach calif patent licensing firm joe beyers vice president of intellectual property licensing at hewlett packard co said ebay helped restore balance in the judicial system "you should get fair value for inventions but what trolls were doing was using the injunction risk that is so detrimental to an operating companys business to get more value than was warranted " he said mr beyers said some patent license companies are trying new strategies such as initiating infringement actions at the itc earlier this year st clair intellectual property consultants inc a grosse pointe mich patent licensing company alleged in a complaint to the itc that eastman kodak co infringed on its patents ronald schutz a lawyer for st clair said ebay was "one factor among many" that prompted st clair to turn to the itc if st clair prevails an itc administrative law judge could ban imports of kodaks digital cameras which are made overseas a kodak spokesman said the company doesnt comment on pending litigation barry ungar chief litigation counsel at rembrandt ip management llc a bala cynwyd pa private equity firm that invests in intellectual property assets said ebay could result in more litigation because the reduced risk of an injunction gives companies little financial incentive to settle "if a company loses an infringement case they end up paying in damages what they would have had to pay at the outset " he said "its heads i win tails i break even " ebay has also raised questions about how future royalties should be assessed when an injunction is denied this wasnt an issue before ebay because injunctions were virtually automatic forcing infringing parties to settle as rim did stop producing an infringing product or modify the product to work around a disputed patent if decisions on future royalties are left to the courts patent holders fear they wont receive fair value "a court set royalty typically falls short of the way markets develop " said paul schneck chief executive of rembrandt while injunctions are harder to come by since ebay the potential for lucrative damages from patent lawsuits remains take finisar it was denied an injunction and didnt get the &# billion in damages it was seeking from directv but it was awarded &# million directv was also ordered to pay finisar a royalty of &# per set top box until finisars patent expires in directv is appealing the verdict finisar is appealing the denial of the injunction
