reducing the risk of variable annuities sales of retirement investments surge as purveyors add new guarantees on returns but fees are even higher variable annuity sales have accelerated sharply helped in part by new guarantees aimed at protecting your nest egg longer life spans and a declining role for traditional pension plans have raised concerns that more people could outlive their retirement savings that has boosted interest in variable annuities which can provide a stream of income for a set number of years or the rest of your life but variable annuities are also subject to market risk related to the performance of their underlying mutual fund like investments now a growing number of annuities contain guarantees to shield against such market risk called living benefits these guarantees offer investors peace of mind about their retirement savings but at a cost living benefits can add between and in annual fees to a variable annuitys typical costs which range from about to of the assets in the annuity whats more if you diversify your annuity investments among stocks bonds and other assets you can often exceed whatever minimum protections the guarantees promise variable annuity sales after dipping early this decade started moving higher in and then leaped ahead to &# billion in gross sales last year the latest data available from &# billion in according to nava inc the variable annuity trade association helping to fuel the growth is the popularity of living benefits insurers say roughly two thirds of variable annuities sold in the first half of the latest data available carried a living benefits rider thats up from two years earlier when just over half the contracts sold contained such a rider another sign of their popularity fidelity investments which helped set a trend in the industry in when it rolled out a low cost variable annuity stripped of most bells and whistles plans to begin offering a living benefits rider "clearly were seeing that living benefits are really driving variable annuity sales " says mike degeorge general counsel for nava the variable annuity trade association "they have become very popular with investors " variable annuities have a checkered past largely because of high fees complexity and previous troubles with state and federal regulators angered by inappropriate sales to seniors in recent years the industry has begun to clean up its act by in some cases lowering fees simplifying the contracts and imposing sales standards on the sales force variable annuities have for years outsold the more conservative fixed annuities which provide returns based on a fixed interest rate still investors should exercise caution when purchasing a variable annuity because you wont be able to readily access all your money to cover emergencies such as health care most people should put no more than about a third of their nest egg into annuities living benefits can be confusing each rider has its own guarantees and not all riders are right for every investor moreover most annuity contracts generally only allow investors to choose one rider meaning you need to understand which one if any is right for you and once youve purchased an annuity whatever rider you chose is mostly in place for the life of the contract there are three basic types of living benefits riders the guaranteed minimum income benefit as its name suggests assures future income at a minimum level the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit provides assurance that you can withdraw a certain percentage of your investment annually in some cases for life and the guaranteed accumulation benefit ensures that your nest egg wont lose value if markets turn down each insurer tweaks the benefits in various ways and at varying costs some insurers such as northwestern mutual life insurance co offer no riders the company says a well structured financial plan can provide the same benefits that riders do one of the most popular choices among consumers is the guaranteed minimum income benefit this benefit is for savers who are certain theyll annuitize their contract once it reaches the payout phase instead of withdrawing the cash to create a pension like income stream if you know you wont annuitize paying for this benefit is wasted spending this benefit guarantees that at a predefined point usually years out you can "know with absolute precision exactly what your annuity will minimally provide" for the rest of your life says robert goldenberg a vice president at axa equitable life insurance co which helped to pioneer early versions of living benefits in the s that can help with long range retirement planning and shields against a steep market decline just before you retire if your investments excel then you can annuitize the larger amount to create an even bigger stream of income though youll have paid hundreds or thousands of dollars in fees for a benefit you never needed if your investments flounder you can exercise the benefit to your advantage the rider most commonly offered by insurers is the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit this is generally for people who dont expect to annuitize their contract because they want to retain access to their assets in retirement but still want a guaranteed level of income two versions of this benefit exist one provides guaranteed withdrawals over a set period the other over your remaining life with either version the payout is generally pegged to your initial investment not the future account value the lifetime version limits withdrawals to about or of your initial investment and the payments continue until your death this is best for people who fear outliving their cash but still want access to a lump sum if they need it the version with a set payout period provides for a withdrawal rate of about annually but once the initial investment is depleted the payments stop depending on investment performance however your account could still hold cash if so you either reclaim that money as a lump sum or annuitize it or you could opt not to exercise the withdrawal benefit in the first place and instead take the larger account value and withdraw it or annuitize it for a larger payment "allocate your assets properly and have realistic expectations for withdrawals from your overall nest egg and you wont need this benefit " says frank oconnor the variable annuity expert at morningstar inc the least popular rider is the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit this is for savers who are "risk averse and reluctant to invest any money in the stock market " though they know they should to generate necessary portfolio growth says navas mr degeorge accumulation benefits ensure that no matter how your investment portfolio performs youll recoup at least your principal after a period of seven to years pay a little extra and youll recoup your original investment plus to a year if your investments perform well then at the end of the period you get the higher account value and the rider expires worthless some insurers will refund some of your fees if the benefit is never used or will allow you to drop the rider after a few years but dont expect to buy this guarantee and then aim for the stars with aggressive investments insurers generally impose prescribed asset allocation models unlikely to lose value over long periods buying peace of mind consumers are buying more variable annuities drawn in part by guarantees known as living benefits the guarantees help shield an investors nest egg from the ups and downs of the market but come at an added cost living benefits vary and some may not be right for every investor so its important to choose carefully a well diversified portfolio can yield more than the minimums promised by living benefits guarantees
