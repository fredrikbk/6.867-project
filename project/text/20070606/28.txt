citigroups new frontier in a pilot project in boston bank tries to get its pieces to fit even as citigroup inc moves more of its business overseas executives of the big bank under pressure to expand without major acquisitions are betting on boston in an attempt to boost revenue the city is the site of a pilot program aimed at generating domestic growth by using the banks retail branches to attract customers who can then tap into the banks other services from corporate cash management programs to personal financial advice at the same time bankers who advise the citys wealthy clients are being prodded to coordinate with their colleagues in new york and around the world to offer sophisticated financing services that might not be available from local banks that new thinking was demonstrated on the morning after valentines day when two dozen citigroup bankers sat in a conference room at the millennium bostonian hotel surrounded by color coded laminated place mats that identified them and described their jobs although they worked only blocks apart most didnt know one another anne greenwood a year citigroup veteran who had recently been named to the newly created position of "market leader" for boston opened the session by noting that the site of the boston tea party which helped spark the american revolution was just steps away so was the faneuil hall market which had been revitalized in the s after falling into disrepair "it isnt an accident that we are holding a meeting here " ms greenwood recalls telling the group "hopefully this background can help us think of ways to do things differently " although boston represents a tiny part of citigroups sprawling empire that last year generated &# billion in profit and &# billion of revenue there is a lot riding on the city for charles prince the veteran citigroup lawyer who now holds the positions of chief executive and chairman it has been nearly a decade since sanford weill assembled citigroup by acquiring a string of financial services companies but the bank is still struggling to put the pieces together "it would be much easier for me if i could wave a magic wand and catch up all the things that i wish had been done years ago but the short answer is there is no way to do it except to grind it out " mr prince told investors earlier this year ironically mr prince is trying to put the banks parts together just as some investors frustrated by the banks lethargic stock price bloated cost structure and disappointing financial results have called on the company to break it apart last month hedge fund manager and activist investor edward lampert disclosed that he had bought more than million shares of citigroup prompting speculation that he too will ratchet up pressure on mr prince in boston citigroup is overhauling operations and corporate culture in a city where computers dont talk to each other and bankers who have spent years coddling wealthy clients can be reluctant to share them with colleagues last fall citigroup opened its first retail branches in the city joining the banks force of smith barney brokers who have been there for some years a financial adviser from citigroups smith barney brokerage unit now sits in each retail branch in boston elsewhere financial advisers are teaming up with colleagues in other parts of the banks sprawling network to pitch more products to clients ms greenwood who is overseeing the effort provides updates to mr prince every few days later this month for the first time customers who have a citibank checking account in boston and a smith barney brokerage account will be able to see all of their account information on the same statement the notion is simple and is being pursued by banks around the country once known simply as cross selling in which branch bankers hawked credit cards and mortgages to checking account customers banks are now trying to boost results by overhauling technology and establishing formal programs that provide financial incentives to bankers who work together "it sounds like the easy no brainer and its always on everybodys to do list but you need management and capital commitment " says craig pfeiffer director of marketing and business development at smith barney j p morgan chase &amp co recently assigned a team of corporate bankers to develop comprehensive plans for corporate clients that stretch across different parts of the bank "too many people were selling their own products without feeling accountable for j p morgan chases overall relationship with the client " ceo james dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders bank of america corp meanwhile recently upgraded technology so that personal bankers and brokers can get access to the same file on a client leaving notes for one another about that customers potential financial needs and wachovia corp last week made a move to expand its financial services offerings with a deal to acquire st louis brokerage a g edwards inc the key for the banks of course is to see if the efforts can result in new revenue that is meaningful to the bottom line if citigroups effort in boston succeeds the bank hopes to roll out similar programs in offices around the country still that is likely to take years and will be difficult in cities where the bank already has beachheads in key businesses where the corporate culture historically has kept bankers apart also citigroup is still a bit player in boston with a handful of branches in the city and an anticipated branches in the boston area by the end of the year bank of america by comparison has branches in boston alone and more than in the area for now citigroup is relying on bankers like peter princi to spread the gospel the former minor league baseball player who is one of citigroups top producing brokers in boston grilled one of his new york colleagues on the phone before agreeing to introduce him to one of mr princis wealthy longtime clients after two weeks of phone calls mr princi took joseph curran a commercial banker to meet his client an executive at a real estate company last month messrs princi and curran took the client to a yankees red sox game in new york the customer is now pursuing a commercial loan and credit default swaps with the bank
