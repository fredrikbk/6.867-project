cellphone users accessed a dating service from their mobile phone in march according to seattle based m metrics a mobile research firm up from million in march dating is in many ways made for mobile phones says mark donovan an analyst with m metrics because people are often most eager for a date when they are "out and about " but the services particularly those based on location are likely to appeal most to users in dense urban areas where the dating pool is likely to be larger and more concentrated mobile dating services also face pressure to prove that they are safe for users and cant be exploited by stalkers posing as daters to address such concerns meetmoi makes its matches without divulging members locations to each other and it automatically logs users out of the location they put in after two hours "you tell us when you want to become available " says meetmois founder and ceo andrew weinreich he adds that the service is safer than other dating services because a user can have only one account pegged to his or her phone number unlike internet dating sites where users can register under multiple aliases still some worry that location based features might be misused "right now the application would become a stalking application if you added gps " says ted verani senior vice president of sales and marketing for trilibis mobile creator of mobile dating service webdate mobile he adds that gps may be appropriate when technology improves to enable users to better regulate who sees what other hurdles for potential miscreants include an often complicated sign up process while many services will work across most phones they often require the users to sign up for a mobile internet data plan some carriers may block some services or features of services like sending profile pictures because they consume too much traffic and pricing plans still vary widely with some services like charging per text message and others charging monthly subscription fees rebecca harrington a year old student at pennsylvania state university says she has found mobile dating significantly more streamlined than repeatedly logging into a computer she has had some luck with zogo and she recently decided to meet up with a guy she chatted with over the service "the best part is the anonymity and that it is discreet " she says
