business world my sweet press lord heres my dream and its a not good one the day comes when a controversialist like rupert murdoch bids to buy the journal and no one cares thats one of the considerations swirling in a mess that from any partys perspectives except mr murdochs makes the decision faced by the bancroft family which controls dow jones our parent company so vexing the future of the paper is at risk if we do the deal its also at risk if we dont our owners in the way of other businesses have not made themselves richer by growing their capital in the journal nonetheless in their stewardship of the paper theyve let us do what we do without interference which is something we all cherish even those of us who dont find mr murdoch an ogre naturally would treat as dubious any change of circumstance that might portend a change in this our own very satisfying situation mr murdochs dealings in china have been a concern this column tongue in cheek once assailed him for his "offenses against freedom and democracy " such as dropping the bbc from his star tv lineup to appease beijing but we also let the reader in on a secret "mr murdochs judgment about when to trim may not be perfect but most sensible people want star tv in china " in any case his trimmings in china have been far less egregious than those of yahoo with any owner you take a chance and the risks include not just errors of commission inappropriate interference but errors of omission letting the business run itself when it really needs a strong hand to alter course and correct its follies much is heard about editorial independence some of it fusty some of it exactly to the point what makes the new york post such a delight is partly the entertaining suspicion most of the time probably unwarranted that hidden agendas and childish rivalries are behind the decision to bash this muckety muck and spare that not for nothing is the post the favorite read of new yorks catty media social and business elite and nobody mistakes it for a paper of record mr murdoch clearly knows what hes doing fitting a newspaper to its market opportunity one has a reasonable suspicion that he also understands the very different market position and opportunity of the journal indeed wed like to think hed end up more hostage to the journal its visibility credibility and power to embarrass than the paper would ever be to his business and personal interests the flipside is that great newspapers arent great because nobody is running them in his wonderful memoir the journalist and eminent business adviser peter drucker wrote "every first rate editor i have ever heard of reads edits and rewrites every word that goes into his publication good editors are not permissive they do not let their colleagues do their thing they make sure that everybody does the papers thing a good let alone a great editor is an obsessive autocrat with a whim of iron who rewrites and rewrites cuts and slashes until every piece is exactly the way he thinks it should have been done " his qualities as a newshound and shrewd businessman mean in all likelihood that mr murdoch would prove a responsible proprietor for the journal despite hyperventilation at the prospect by some readers and employees hes certainly equipped by experience to make the necessary judgments to protect the papers stature while expanding its reach and has the resources to do so though strictly from the perspective of someone who works here id still prefer to be owned by a company exclusively in the news business one that lives and dies by the reputation of its newsgathering here i confess to a personal bias related to nothing more than reading the washington post over the years which is that its an exceptionally brainy newspaper intelligence as a quality is hit or miss in most newspaper writing and editing at the post they seem to have institutionalized it you rarely find the collapses of critical judgment that seem to be routine at other papers when say a trial lawyer appears claiming evidence of racism in the auto dealership industry or at an oil company absent too are the excesses of billboard journalism the habit of editors casually intruding a noisy paragraph that oversells and distorts the story below leaving an unsatisfying jumble of facts that dont live up to the assertions at the top we dont love everything in the post or all its reporters and it has certainly benefited from conservative competition from the washington times it also lacks the leverageable assets that mr murdoch would presumably use to build the journals brand and distribution opportunities but the posts editorial page has become remarkably more sensible in recent years although its web site remains awful and the style section has gone down the tubes the company itself is principally in the news business warren buffett sits on the board guarding against investment misadventure a few readers have harrumphed that mr murdoch reputedly would try to shorten the journals articles hes not the only one washington post executive editor len downie has instructed his crew to write shorter too and the post already strikes me as a very well edited paper news stories are rounded complete but not overwritten they also have a semblance of being written by somebody with a living mind not just re executing the medias general template on a given news event for an everyday example see the posts recent contributions on the chinese pet food scare more than that if you read a lot of newspapers what sneaks up on you are the outward manifestations of a quiet non braggy excellence that should be attractive to anyone looking to ensure the journals long term future mr murdoch is the only one who has put money on the table hes not the only one some of us wish would
