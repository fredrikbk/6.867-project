americas open frontier venice this weeks meeting of the g was supposed to focus of global warming if that is not overshadowed by saber rattling from moscow and while president bush last week offered up a few bones to his critics on the subject the u s and europe remain on the whole miles apart at a recent conference here hosted by the council for the united states and italy an american venture capitalist and a german parliamentarian revealed just how different the outlooks are on the opposing shores of the atlantic the debate was not between a global warming skeptic and an alarmist but between an american businessman and a german politician who both accept the need to address climate change and come to very different conclusions about how to do so the german took the floor first his was a bold thesis the economic transformation required to address global warming will bring huge energy efficiencies and hence huge economic benefits even if there is no global warming problem but vested interests in the energy sector stand in the way of that transformation "we cannot " therefore "wait for the industries that in many cases will be the losers to make the necessary changes " he told the audience of american and european industrialists to this american ear this smacks of the tales about the man who invented a car that runs on water but was bought out by detroit to protect their market but from a european perspective it makes more sense the story according to which politically connected industries block economic developments that would be beneficial overall but redound to the detriment of the big players is one expounded mostly by cranks in the u s but is commonly accepted in europe this results from the fact that in europe this kind of thing happens market signals on employment wages and production are all attenuated by governments heavy hand to a much greater extent than they are in the u s stagnation in europe has many faces but one of the most important is the stasis of the corporate constellation most european economies are dominated by the same large companies that ruled the roost decades ago while in the u s many of our largest and most successful companies didnt exist a generation ago this comparison is not new but its relevance to the global warming debate is not well understood as a former carter administration official at the conference put it "america is psychologically an open frontier society europes frontier closed a millennium ago " in other words the characteristic american response to say climate change is to believe that technologies and even companies that do not now exist will crop up to solve the problem assuming there is a problem the characteristic european response as exemplified by the german conspiracy theorist in venice is to focus on how to get the businesses to behave "better " the open frontier view was captured by a silicon valley representative in the room he stood up to announce that "clean tech" would be to this decade what high tech was to the s the companies that would revolutionize our energy usage he claimed were now being funded by venture capitalists and the ciscos microsofts and googles of the next decade would be the companies that solved the energy puzzle we hadnt heard of any of them now he insisted but they would be huge is he right maybe who cares its his money and the money of his colleagues in the valley the point is if theres a conspiracy to keep revolutionary clean technology down he didnt get the memo the notion that this is simply a trans atlantic divide can easily be overstated there are statist americans and entrepreneurial europeans but the divide between the open frontier camp and the closed frontier camp is very real and of the utmost importance to the global warming debate if you believe that the means for addressing human influence on the climate have not yet been invented but moreover that the best chance of developing them lies with entrepreneurs whose ideas have not yet been tested in the market then global warming is just another opportunity and if the doomsayers are right a potentially huge one the dividing line can be seen again in the divergent approaches of the u s and western europe to the challenges posed by economic change most european employment law is focused on preserving the jobs that already exist policies designed to create new jobs are viewed as threatening to the status quo and they are threatening the question is whether the status quo is presumed to be better than an unknown future if you believe that the economic frontier is closed then you are wont to suspect that the future is at least as likely to be worse than the present as it is to be better and so you fight to preserve what you have venice is a good city to host such a debate its beautiful remarkable unique but its future is behind it a city that grew rich and beautiful by trading with the far flung reaches of the world is today a relic desperately clinging to its former glory its frontiers have closed and then receded to its immediate environs going forward the question that needs asking is will fear of carbon make venices
