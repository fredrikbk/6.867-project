dow jones chairman emerges as key player in bid mcpherson is a bridge between board family burkle enters picture as members of dow jones &amp co s board of directors and controlling family appear to move closer to an agreement for rupert murdochs news corp to acquire the company board chairman m peter mcpherson has emerged as a new player the year old mr mcpherson became chairman only on april he is a former president of michigan state university who worked in the gerald ford white house early in his career and currently is president of the national association of state universities and land grant colleges he has become a bridge between the family and the companys directors who are in a delicate negotiation of their own over the fate of the company their interests dont always align some of the boards independent directors have concluded that a sale should be consummated quickly and that an effort to get a price higher than the &# a share that news corp has offered only by a few dollars a share should be part of the effort mr mcpherson though seems less in a hurry at mondays meeting with mr murdoch he refused to accept the news corp chairmans proposals for an independent editorial board and pushed along with the family representatives for further negotiation according to people familiar with the matter mr mcpherson couldnt be reached yesterday evening mr mcpherson briefed dow joness top management and some directors monday evening after the meeting and he gave a full report on the session to an ad hoc committee of directors yesterday afternoon the two sides have yet to schedule a new meeting but they will likely reconvene in some form this week or next according to people close to the situation as of late yesterday the family board members had yet to brief their relatives on the monday meeting the familys advisers are working on revising their proposals for an independent editorial board for the next round of negotiations with mr murdoch according to those people the picture is complicated by the possibility of a third party bid a consulting firm retained by a union representing some dow jones employees said that it would explore plans for a possible bid with supermarket magnate ron burkle probably involving some form of employee ownership any bid is seen as a long shot because mr murdochs &# a share offer represents a big premium over a stock that had been trading in the thirties a spokesman for the consulting firm said it had received two other calls from investors interested in joining the effort a spokesman for mr burkle declined to comment some board members are eager to ensure that mr mcpherson and the bancroft family dont make any side promises to mr murdoch according to a person familiar with the boards deliberations some board members were concerned that by negotiating on their own with mr murdoch the family had lessened the boards leverage in extracting a higher price the ad hoc committee of the board made up of dow jones chief executive officer richard f zannino textron inc ceo lewis campbell the chair of the governance committee harvey golub the chair of the compensation committee and chairman of campbells soup co and mr mcpherson is expected to take the lead on any negotiation with news corp while the bancroft family can veto any deal it is the boards role to put any offer up for a shareholder vote mr mcpherson was appointed chairman after a protracted negotiation over the tenure of peter r kann dow joness former chairman and chief executive when mr kann was nearing his retirement date from the board there was some last minute discussion among directors about keeping him on to ensure that the board would have at least one director with a journalistic background in the end the board agreed to compromise appointing mr mcpherson as chairman now as the board committee gears up to consider mr murdochs offer there are various interests they will have to serve in weighing any proposal for the bancrofts taxes on a cash offer are a factor the cost basis for the familys shares is very low so they would have to pay a federal capital gains tax of as well as state capital gains taxes depending on where they live this is true even though most of the income from a sale would flow back into the family trusts that could make a deal involving payment in news corp stock more attractive not all of the bancrofts want to accept mr murdochs offer but it would be difficult for a minority to block a sale most of the familys stake in dow jones is tied up in a web of trusts that give individual family members little say in how the shares are voted in addition as part of a plan that allows the bancrofts to lower their stake in dow jones without losing control of the company the family agreed a few years ago to a provision that would convert all of their supervoting class b stock to common shares if the total falls below million shares currently the family owns of the companys class b shares or about million nearly all of which are held in trusts if the trustees who oversee those trusts vote in favor of a deal the number of class b shares owned by the bancrofts would fall below million triggering a conversion of the remainder to common stock in this case the voting power of the remaining class b shares would increase because the pool would be smaller but that still wouldnt be enough to block a sale last year mr burkles investment vehicle yucaipa cos joined with the newspaper guild in a failed bid for newspapers that mcclatchy co had recently purchased from knight ridder inc when the papers went on the block representatives of the newspaper guild which represented employees of many of the papers sought out mr burkle as a financial backer he had been recommended to them by
