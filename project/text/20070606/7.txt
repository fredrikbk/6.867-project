analysis of avandia finds no increased risk of death a preliminary analysis of results from a continuing study of the glaxosmithkline plc diabetes drug avandia found no evidence it was tied to an increased risk of death but the findings released by the new england journal of medicine seemed to simply stoke the debate over the medications safety one day before congress is to hold a hearing focused on the safety of avandia the journal released early findings from a study called record which is scheduled to end next year both the hearing and yesterdays publication online come in the wake of an analysis by cleveland clinic cardiologist steven nissen released last month by the new england journal that tied avandia to a potential risk of heart attacks the authors of the new analysis said the study didnt provide enough data to show whether avandia is associated with a higher rate of heart attacks they also wrote that the analysis was inconclusive on the main questions that the trial is supposed to answer avandias effect on the risk of hospitalization or death due to heart related causes the drugs maker glaxosmithkline said the new data from record bolstered its claim that avandia is as safe as other diabetes treatments "patients and physicians should find these data reassuring " moncef slaoui head of research and development at glaxo said in a statement but editorials released by the new england journal questioned the importance of the early record findings avandias safety was called into question last month when dr nissens analysis which pulled together the results of multiple studies sparked a wave of public concern typically the findings of a large clinical trial like record are considered more conclusive than such an analysis but the record trial isnt complete weakening its ability to answer questions definitively the food and drug administration said yesterday it will convene a meeting of outside experts on july to discuss avandia and similar drugs the latest new england journal analysis was written by researchers overseeing record a large study designed to show avandias effects on the heart the study compares the rate of cardiovascular hospitalization and death in patients taking avandia plus one of two older drugs versus those taking the two older drugs in combination the study funded by glaxo and involving patients with type diabetes is due to be completed in the researchers overseeing record were concerned that dr nissens paper would cause some patients to drop out of the study so they decided to analyze early results of the study and rush them into print according to philip home a medical professor at newcastle university of the united kingdom and chairman of the steering committee overseeing the trial because the trial was unfinished there werent enough data to determine the true difference between the treatment regimens dr home said after following patients for an average of years patients in the avandia group and patients in the other group were hospitalized or died from cardiovascular causes the researchers wrote the difference wasnt statistically significant meaning it could have been due to chance there was also no statistically significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes or any cause or in the number of heart attacks in the two groups stuart pocock a professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine who is on the record study group said the findings of the analysis are "somewhat reassuring " though not definitive the journal paired the record results with editorials that raised questions about them in one david nathan a professor at harvard medical school wrote that the findings "do not provide any assurance of the safety of treatment with" avandia and that doctors shouldnt "feel comfortable using" the drug because of the lingering safety questions in another editorial university of washington professor bruce psaty and wake forest university professor curt furberg wrote that when they pulled together the record findings with other available data they found avandia was tied to a potential heart attack risk jeffrey drazen editor in chief of the new england journal said the record data were rushed out because some of the findings might be revealed in todays congressional hearing and "it would be better for the whole story to come out in a peer reviewed journal " dr nissen said he agreed with the editorials and believed the record publication is "not reassuring its simply inconclusive " dr home is involved in consulting and other relations with major drug companies including glaxo but said his consulting and lecture fees go to institutions with which he works such as his university dr pocock has gotten consulting fees from glaxo dr nissen is leading a clinical trial about avandias rival drug actos funded by actoss maker and has consulted in the past for glaxosmithkline on other matters he gives drug industry payments to charity dr nathan has gotten lecture fees from drug companies including glaxo
