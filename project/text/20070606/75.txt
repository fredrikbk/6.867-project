pay shows scant effect on medical treatment a central premise of the governments medicare planners in recent years has been a concept called "pay for performance" the idea that medical care can be improved by financially rewarding better treatment but the results of a medicare agency pilot project published this week suggest the efforts may be less effective than proponents hope researchers at duke university examining heart attack treatment at hospitals found that hospitals that received financial incentives to follow treatment guidelines didnt improve their practices significantly more than hospitals that got no financial benefit the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services launched the pay for performance pilot in participating hospitals provided the cms with performance information for five conditions including heart attack hospitals in the two highest performance levels for a condition received a bonus in the duke study published in this weeks journal of the american medical association of the hospitals were participants in the cms pilot and received the financial incentives the other "control" hospitals didnt get such payments the findings showed that "the pay for performance program was not associated with a significant incremental improvement in quality of care or outcomes for acute myocardial infarction " or heart attack duke cardiologist eric d peterson and colleagues wrote in the journal article a prominent cardiologist not involved with the study steven e nissen chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic concluded that the results "suggest we ought to slow down a minute before going into pay for performance " researchers looked at information from hospitals treating patients over three years beginning in they evaluated such factors as whether the hospitals prescribed aspirin and widely accepted cardiac drugs called beta blockers and ace inhibitors and whether patients were counseled to quit smoking compliance rose to from at the pay for performance hospitals at the others compliance also rose to from researchers found a "slightly higher rate of improvement for of targeted therapies" but concluded that "overall there was no evidence that improvements in in hospital mortality were incrementally greater at pay for performance sites " its possible the financial penalties for not complying werent sufficient "those with the poorest performance risked future financial penalty " researchers said but didnt actually pay such a penalty bonuses for complying with performance standards totaled &# million to a total of hospitals in the first year and hospitals in the second year "one read on this is that the carrots have to be bigger " dukes dr peterson said hospital officials involved in the medicare pilot project said this winter in a conference call with reporters that financial incentives were small relative to their budgets dr peterson also noted that all of the hospitals evaluated had separately volunteered to be part of an initiative to improve heart attack treatment to comport with treatment guidelines of the american college of cardiology and the american heart association he said the fact that the hospitals had volunteered could have improved results in the hospitals that werent pay for performance still the findings raise the question of what the medicare system will do next a medicare spokesman said the agency hadnt seen the study and so couldnt comment on it
