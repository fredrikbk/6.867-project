bernankes sense for now hands off lingering housing slump low unemployment keep economic risks in balance federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said he remains worried about a pickup in inflation but he suggested the american publics stable inflation expectations make it less likely the fed will have to raise interest rates in remarks delivered via satellite to a bankers conference in cape town south africa mr bernanke also said the u s housing slump will last longer than he had previously expected but it hasnt spilled over into other parts of the economy his remarks were in line with the feds assessment of the economy at its may policy meeting while low unemployment means the economy is at risk of overheating that risk is offset by the continued housing slump that suggests the fed sees little need either to lower or raise short term interest rates in coming months the fed meets again june core inflation which excludes energy and food prices has ebbed and while it "seems likely to moderate gradually over time the risks to this forecast remain to the upside " mr bernanke said he cited as a particular risk the "high rate of resource utilization " a reference to the combination of low unemployment and the high degree to which businesses are using their production capacity the shortness of slack in the system indicates that "final demand may still be high relative to the underlying productive capacity of the economy " in response to questions from the audience at the international monetary conference an annual event founded by the american bankers association mr bernanke acknowledged that the high price of oil represents a "challenge " but he added "we have very well anchored inflation expectations which makes the inflationary impact and the monetary policy response much more benign for a given change in oil prices " yesterday crude oil for july delivery settled at &# a barrel down cents on the new york mercantile exchange high oil costs could yet seep into other goods and services but mr bernankes remarks indicate the fed would be reluctant to raise rates unless the public seemed to expect higher inflation to last mr bernanke also elaborated on the feds altered view of the housing market when home sales leveled off last year it appeared that demand had stabilized he said but sales have generally declined further this year and tighter lending standards for subprime mortgages will further constrain demand lighter demand makes it harder to pare the still large supply of unsold homes he said and as result construction "will likely remain subdued for a time " both mr bernanke and european central bank president jean claude trichet who also spoke to the conference raised concerns about how little investors were being compensated for their purchases of risky assets world wide "the price of risk is now currently quite low as best as we can tell " mr bernanke said "that may not necessarily be wrong but it does raise concerns that should the benign environment be interrupted by a geopolitical event or some other developments the price of risk would rise " market participants would reduce their appetite for risky assets and the market fallout could be "more serious" than in similar episodes in recent years in a separate speech in london fed governor kevin warsh said advances in financial innovation have allowed investors and banks to better price and distribute risk so shocks to investor confidence are less likely to cause "lasting damage " he cited as evidence the short lived selloff in february triggered by a plunge in chinas markets he cautioned it may also be that markets have yet to face a "sufficiently stringent stress test " which could yet cause banks securities dealers and others to retreat from new financial products
