politics &amp economics europe lays tracks truck boom spurs railroad funding brussels europe is pouring billions into new train tracks hoping to do something about a dirty secret at a time when brussels is leading the fight against carbon emissions more and more european freight gets shipped by truck the &# billion in planned investments through represents an unusual confluence of the continents business and social agendas companies want better rail service to cut transport costs keep up with the boom in global trade and connect disparate markets politicians see the rail project as jibing perfectly with europes goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions a hot topic that will be on the agenda when leaders of the worlds richest countries meet starting today in germany the cost will be borne mostly by the eu and national governments underlying the ambitious construction planned in the s was a drive to integrate european nations while injecting jobs and cash into the economy rising concerns about climate change and emissions have given extra ammunition to supporters of this type of big government spending the main beneficiaries of building contracts so far have been a handful of dominant construction companies in each country two major projects come on line this month a cargo only route connecting the port of rotterdam and germanys industrial ruhr region and a tunnel through the swiss alps linking italy and germany europes dependence on trucks stems from the failure of its vaunted passenger rail network to provide a cheap efficient alternative for cargo between and the last year for which data are available the percentage of european goods shipped by truck rose to from while rails share fell to from the rest goes by canal or in the case of oil and gas pipelines in the u s in of freight was moved by train and by truck the result on europes roads is a big economic bottleneck "european roads cant handle the road traffic anymore " says john verschelden a vice president at apm terminals international a company that unloads containers at the port of rotterdam "everybody is looking for easier connections especially to eastern europe " environmentalists welcome the philosophy behind more trade by rail but argue taxpayer subsidized trade hurts the environment by creating economic activity they also call for building more efficient technology for trucks and trains instead of spending so much on infrastructure the eu says the new tracks will cut carbon dioxide emissions by million metric tons a year by reducing projected growth in transport related emissions to from still the argument for trucks is compelling from the standpoint of europe based business even though trucks are more expensive they are usually faster more flexible and can reach more destinations lack of available land is one reason rail freight isnt more prevalent in europe companies say that in the u s its relatively easy to find room to locate a factory near train tracks in europe such land has usually been snapped up decades or centuries ago in eastern europe where more land is available economic growth has outpaced track building leaving trucks to carry the transport burden of the regions conversion to capitalism from communism the eu hopes that by laying track right into ports and other logistics hubs it can cut down dependence on trucks eu countries have kept rail freight costs artificially high through national monopolies in the s the eu ordered countries to dismantle protections including different gauges of track that prohibit goods from crossing borders efficiently that process was meant to be completed this year but obstacles remain train drivers licenses for example arent recognized across borders it was only last year that a non french freight train was allowed to carry domestic cargo on french rails "it still costs a lot of money to equip a train so it meets every countrys safety standards " says jos dings an analyst at transport environment a brussels based think tank eu authorities hope their massive building plans will help drive down rail costs and eventually make rail freight more attractive the projects on the drawing board all of which are meant to be completed by reflect the technical challenge of integrating the member eu into one economic bloc because spain and portugal have a different gauge of rail track than the rest of europe for example more than &# billion is being spent to make their track accessible to all european trains there is some evidence the eus strategy is starting to work polzug intermodal gmbh a cargo company specializing in container transport by rail between germany poland and other parts of eastern europe reports annual growth much of this is coming from companies setting up shop in eastern europe "because roads are so congested we get a lot of business from companies setting up assembly plants " says marketing and sales director marcel sames mr sames names electronics maker sharp corp and tire maker michelin group among his companys clients there is so much demand to lease wagons to ride the new tracks that the company cant get them delivered fast enough "we have wagons but we could use another " he says one railroad project opening this month the mile loetschberg tunnel goes under the alps from italy to germany cutting travel time in half to minutes the region is one of europes busiest transit points for german cars and machines heading south and italian shoes and wine going north more than freight trucks cross the alps every day the &# billion project will initially be used only for freight before being opened to passenger trains in a more important and expensive project is a &# billion mile track that runs from rotterdam europes busiest port to the german border where it links up to the dense rail network of western germany one of europes industrial centers the dutch government hopes the "betuwe" line named after the region it crosses will draw more export traffic for rotterdam and help companies that ship into the port such as procter &amp gamble co boeing co and timberland co to speed delivery of goods to germany and eastern europe in addition the french national railway sncf next week is inaugurating freight service between rotterdam and lyon because the netherlands has a different electricity standard sncf had to buy two new locomotives after relying on canal barges and trucks to carry goods throughout its rich commercial history the netherlands is building up railroads to stay ahead of rival ports antwerp belgium and hamburg germany in the scramble to attract asian container ships "this is a renaissance for trains " says jelle rebbers communications manager for railion gmbh a german rail freight company that has a subsidiary in the netherlands
