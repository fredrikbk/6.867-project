business bookshelf success with a human face bill &amp dave by michael s malone portfolio pages &# to the extent that most americans are thinking about hewlett packard co these days it is for things that the company itself would rather be forgotten last years newsroom spying controversy the noisy departure in of chief executive carly fiorina and the notoriously lofty price of the companys ink cartridges which makes a trip to the office supply store as painful as one to the gas station but of course there is much more to the h p saga than recent contretemp the company is rightly seen as a legend a smart innovative and civic minded enterprise that over years has embodied the best of american braininess and business acumen in "bill &amp dave " the h p story is told by michael s malone a journalist and onetime company employee whose enthusiasm for h p seems to know no bounds bill hewlett and dave packard as mr malone relates were engineering classmates at stanford university during the s both were fascinated by radio and their interest in all forms of electronics was encouraged by fred terman a professor in stanfords engineering department the professor also persuaded bill and dave to start a company once they had graduated neither had a specific product in mind but they didnt really need to those prewar years were the dawn of the electronics age and two bright lads handy with a soldering gun would surely be able to cook up something in some cases literally mrs packards oven was used to bake the finishing on some of the early products working in the original silicon valley garage bill and dave came up with their first product an audio oscillator that walt disney bought in for the making of the movie "fantasia " thousands of other products would follow during world war ii h p became one of an elite crew of high tech companies that war planners back east could call on for help with the wars end h p was in the perfect position to take advantage of the economys need for electrical engineering expertise h ps main business during its first decades was designing and selling test equipment for engineers oscillators voltmeters and the like dry stuff mostly though now and then a product would capture the publics imagination such as the atomic clocks that h p began selling during the s they were so accurate that if you took them on a plane ride theyd slow down exactly as predicted by einsteins theories of relativity h ps products had a reputation for being durable and well designed if expensive what h p really stood for the saying went was "highest priced " in the s and s the company expanded into consumer markets it pioneered the pocket calculator and then built a massive printing business personal computers were eventually on the h p menu too of course during all this time the company was famed not just for its catalog of products but also for its human face best described by a set of principles known as the "h p way " messrs hewlett and packard insisted on making money but thought it also important to treat their workers with decency and respect while the company could quietly force out nettlesome hires when it needed to it was known for its general aversion to the sort of mass layoffs that are now routine business strategy in a memo mr hewlett reported hearing of staffers being fired without proper notice that their work was being judged unsatisfactory "there is just no excuse for this " he wrote "it is not humane it is not hp like it is not justified " its been a while since sentences like those have been heard in an executive suite it is thus hard not to be a fan of bill and dave that mr malone a veteran silicon valley journalist is a fan is apparent from his aggressively assertive subtitle "how hewlett and packard built the worlds greatest company " he wrote his book he says to spread the h p way hoping that business leaders facing a big decision will ask themselves "what would bill and dave do " its a perfectly good question for managers to ask at one time or another but one thing bill and dave probably would not do is speak about their accomplishments with mr malones hyperbole his first job out of college he tells us was in the h p public relations department and even now his prose has something of the breathless quality of promotion his working assumption seems to be that anything bill and dave did was the first the best the greatest the result is sometimes counterproductive rather than feeling persuaded to admire and emulate bill and dave a reader may begin to suspect their chronicler of over praise it doesnt help that much of the book is a re hash of earlier h p journalism including in many cases writings by mr malone himself for example in mr packard spoke at a gathering of ceos and urged them to pay attention to civic matters in addition to the bottom line from the quotations on display in "bill &amp dave " most readers will probably regard mr packards remarks as sensible and polite even platitudinous but for mr malone the speech was an "incredible historic moment the turning point between one era and its successor" little did these captains of industry know that mr packard was soon "going to pull the entire edifice of traditional business down around their heads " youd think it was samson who had given the talk post shearing or consider h ps decision to offer catastrophic health insurance to its work force its here called "extraordinary" and "a radical innovation" in labor relations but it was no such thing health insurance was common at big u s companies during the war since wage controls prevented them from using pay to compete for scarce labor mr malones exuberance reaches its climax toward the end of "bill &amp dave " first he describes the rise and fall of ms fiorina the ceo hired in to give a push to the companys lagging stock price mr malone portrays her as a self promoting harridan who is heedless of the h p way and drags the company into calamitous business deals notably he claims the compaq acquisition her successor mark hurd by contrast is the founders second coming bringing profits and tranquility back to their kingdom but this is a cartoon version of events if h p is now back in the game a certain amount of the credit goes to the dirty work done on ms fiorinas watch like the big staff cuts and mr hurd has himself continued the dismantling of some of the relics of the bill and dave years including their generous pension plan in an era when private equity buyout artists sit poised to swoop down on any company that makes a false step can anyone afford to run a company with the humanity that bill and dave showed during americas great postwar boom the question haunts any thoughtful ceo there may be the outlines of an answer in mr malones account but it is buried under too much love mr gomes writes the journals weekly portals column on technology
