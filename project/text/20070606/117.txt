the daily fix as showdown with spurs looms a columnist roots for cleveland online edition the washington post one of the things the fixers have learned in our years of link wrangling is that the clearest view of a series team or city is often found at a certain remove as an example s michael wilbon surveys the mood in cleveland as lebron james and the cavaliers get ready to do battle tomorrow night with the heavily favored san antonio spurs for the nba title and his column is a heartfelt portrait of a city and what sports has meant to it mr wilbon recalls that whenever sports misfortune befell cleveland as it has nonstop for more than years hed call his uncle to commiserate "this time " he writes "it felt good to call him after cleveland had won something and even better to hear him alternately laughing and choked up say its been a long time since jim brown im turning and i was getting worried i wouldnt see us get close to winning anything again i dont think most of us expected lebron to break through and carry us this far this year the place is so high in spirit its such a beautiful time to be in cleveland dont look here for any cleveland jokes if any american city is deserving of the lift in civic spirit that only a sporting championship can deliver its cleveland " in the new york times howard beck appreciates mr jamess game while warning that uninitiated fans expecting the basketball messiah are in for a bit of a learning curve mr beck notes that mr james can dominate as a scorer just ask the detroit pistons about that but "is just as likely to defer to teammates and control a game with his passes on some nights his points come almost quietly he can go for a quarter a half or an entire game without looking for his shot at all yet fans are used to a particular kind of n b a superstar the guys who jump the highest run the fastest dunk the hardest and more often than not score the most points every night the public adores scoring and expects its stars to be a little selfish jordan was the high flying archetype leading the bulls to six championships in the s james in contrast is a brawny foot player who can sometimes score like jordan or kobe bryant but who can also pass like the former n b a star magic johnson and who seems smart enough to know which style to choose from minute to minute " on espn com bill simmons begins with boyhood memories of john havliceks farewell and how he was surprised years later to realize just how well he measures up against later renowned players "which begs the question does greatness have a shelf life " he asks mr simmons recalls that after mr jamess demolition of the pistons he wrote that "jordan never physically overpowered an opponent the way lebron ramshackled the pistons and compared him to bo jackson and the way he wreaked havoc in his prime by saturday after everyone had calmed down i found myself recalling some of jordans killer moments how he coldly destroyed clyde drexler in the finals how he prevailed against the rugby tactics of pat rileys knicks how he stole game against the pacers by repeatedly getting to the line like a running back moving the chains how he ended his chicago career with the incredible layup steal jumper sequence in utah and regretting that like nearly everyone else i had fallen into the lets degrade the old guy to coronate the new guy trap " so why do fans fall into this trap "wed like to believe that our current stars are better than the guys we once watched " mr simmons writes "why because the single best thing about sports is the unknown its much more fun to think about what could happen than about what already has we dont want lebron to be as good as mj we need him to be better than mj we already did the mj thing who wants to rent the same movie twice we want lebron to take us to a place weve never been " last night the philadelphia phillies beat the nl east leading new york mets in extra innings a satisfying win but it only got the phils to and theyre still seven out a decidedly mediocre showing for a team that entered the season thinking of a title but thats nothing new in philadelphia since the turn of the century the phillies have consistently missed out on success usually by annoyingly narrow margins in a commentary that mixes frustration wit and numerical analysis mike gross writes in the lancaster sunday news that "the phillies have not only lolled on the brink but done so spastically and with something like indolence for the entire st century in years of sports ive never seen anything quite like it " three links from world soccer the international herald tribunes rob hughes recounts the bizarre scene from a european cup qualifier saturday in copenhagen where a fan charged the field and attacked a referee interrupting what had been a stirring comeback by the danes from a deficit the fan was apparently upset by a penalty awarded sweden for a cheap shot by one of the danish players "we might conclude that the kind of person who leaps over a small wall onto the pitch is following the example of one of the players wearing his national team colors " mr hughes writes in the daily telegraph sue mott considers the implications of upward mobility in english sport the game is becoming more middle and upper class "as owners you dont have the local butcher made good as the purchaser of football clubs any more " ms mott writes "prime ministers prime movers prime suspects yes but purveyors of prime meats and viands no as managers you dont have to be a former british player any more educated by studs up centre halves on wind blown pitches instead of more formally the classroom you can be erudite rounded thinking and foreign in fact preferably so if chelsea arsenal and liverpool are right " trinidad &amp tobagos players are fighting for their share of soccers money pot sixteen of the players from the national side that played with inspiration last summer in the world cup are threatening to sue the national federation and meanwhile arent playing for their country in an upcoming tournament "the soca warriors as regrettable as their absence from the gold cup may be are using their cachet from the world cup in other ways " billy witz writes in the los angeles daily news "instead of getting stuck on the field theyre preparing to do so in court " the los angeles timess chris dufresne remembers this about the first baseball game he ever attended it was angels senators it was and frank howard hit a home run "did it happen " he asks "memory like a knuckleball can play tricks on you distant recollections tend to wobble and flutter a while back though i stumbled upon a baseball research internet site called retrosheet org which has unleashed an ambitious assault on every double play ever recorded retrosheet boasts box scores for every game played since plus selected years from earlier seasons phil rizzuto had two words for this kind of accomplishment holy cow did i really summers ago see frank howard knock one from me to you you bet i did all it took to prove was mouse clicking to a game by game recount of the angels season there it was may at anaheim stadium senators th mcmullen walked howard homered holy cow " thats the beginning of a nice look at a site the internets founding wizards probably never imagined but that makes you think the digital revolution is if anything underhyped if youre a baseball fan about to visit retrosheet for the first time a warning scrap whatever you planned to do for the next few hours self indulgent addendum heres jaces account of using retrosheet to try and track down what he thought was his first ever ballgame tip of the fix cap to reader chris slowik found a good column from the world of sports dont
