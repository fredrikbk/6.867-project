after a brain injury a business plan when an accident damaged his brother rob groeschen built a company to help him one evening in rob groeschen received a disturbing phone call an irate man in cincinnati had found mr groeschens older brother tom then years old wandering in his backyard mr groeschen got in his car and finally found his brother hours later across the ohio river in kentucky "i screwed up again " tom said then he promptly forgot what had happened not long after that rob groeschen decided he had to do something about his brother as children they had been best friends but since tom suffered severe brain damage in a car crash he had struggled to resume a normal life while rob watched in an agony of guilt and frustration "i ran away from toms accident for years " rob says "but it always haunted me " an estimated nine million people in the u s are disabled from stroke traumatic brain injury or brain hemorrhage while rehabilitation helps some many remain like tom groeschen unable to function at anywhere near their former capacity people with brain injury vary widely in their abilities from day to day often their memory and thought processes are damaged by their injury sometimes their accidents batter their judgment and their actions occasionally can veer wildly into the inappropriate yet with few options for additional help most have nowhere else to go but back to an unwelcoming world some must depend heavily on their families most of whom are ill prepared to deal with a family member who has changed profoundly even the most attentive families are forced to simply watch as loved ones degenerate to rob groeschen standing by finally became unacceptable as a bashful kid he had idolized tom a high school football hero more than years later rob who had become a wealthy businessman decided to complete the reversal of roles he created an unusual new business to help tom and gave himself a new mid career mission applause washed over tom groeschen then as he rose to accept a trophy naming him one of the top high school football players in kentucky one of those clapping was his younger brother rob then tom and rob the youngest of the six children of jack and lavern groeschen pronounced gresh en grew up in fort thomas ky a hilly suburb across the ohio river from cincinnati their father died when they were still in grade school tom was athletic and gregarious rob scrawny and shy when they played pickup baseball tom always chose his brother first saving rob the embarrassment of being chosen last in high school blond good looking tom was homecoming king prom king and the star running back for highlands high schools state championship team rob was basically unnoticed lacking motivation for classes or sports an old friend of robs john bankemper recalls "rob was the one no one ever had any expectations of " but tom let rob hang out with his older friends and if anyone picked on rob tom intervened the night of the football banquet tom insisted that rob attend and sit next to him "tom was the coolest " rob says "i was proud just to be his brother " around midnight on aug two police officers knocked on the groeschens door they told mrs groeschen that tom who was about to start his sophomore year at eastern kentucky university had been in an auto crash assuming it was minor she and rob drove to a nearby hospital where they learned to their shock that tom actually was at the nearest trauma center the university hospital in cincinnati earlier that night tom and a friend had been partying on an ohio river houseboat around p m they went for something to eat police later found toms green dodge charger smashed into a guardrail off interstate in northern kentucky his friend was lying outside the car with a broken nose and multiple cuts tom was unconscious in the rear of the car with only a faint pulse its not clear who had been driving both tom and his friend say they dont remember and police say no records remain tom had suffered severe head trauma and a collapsed lung and for a few moments his heart had stopped three days passed before his family knew he would even live mrs groeschen recalls a social worker speaking to her in a hushed tone "youll have to bury the person you knew and accept the person you have now " tom groeschen lingered in a coma for more than three months withering away to pounds down from his playing weight of on his foot frame one day rob picked up his brothers leg and was horrified to see how spindly it was that fall rob started school at eastern kentucky where he had planned to join tom his mind was elsewhere "i felt i should come home " rob says "i was feeling that the light was on me now it was now what are you going to do " in november mrs groeschen moved tom to the cardinal hill rehabilitation hospital in lexington ky rob visited most days watching tom struggle as therapists tried to teach him how to speak walk and hold a fork toms determination made a big impression on rob almost the way toms football stardom had sometimes friends accompanied rob on visits they noticed he was uncharacteristically silent afterward after one visit he told his friend brad kisker "one day i know im going to be toms caretaker " tom left the rehab center in february after officials told the groeschens there wasnt much more to do for him by then he could walk mostly on his own pushing his wheelchair he could speak somewhat intelligibly though his voice often trailed off many families at this point place their loved ones in a nursing home but mrs groeschen rejected that idea believing that tom would return to normal mrs groeschen had tom audit classes at northern kentucky university he dropped out after a month when professors concluded he couldnt retain information nor could tom handle plumbing and painting classes at a vocational school he took a job in a kitchen but got fired after cutting himself chopping radishes and bleeding on food he lost a grocery store job because he couldnt control the floor polisher he flunked a tryout at a bakery when he couldnt work the cake icing applicator eventually over many months the groeschens came to realize the old tom might never truly return "it was we can do this we can do that " says lavern groeschen "well we couldnt " home from college in the summer of rob took tom out for beers at a local pub friends wanted to reminisce about high school and football tom grinned but couldnt remember any of his glory days a wandering eye at times made him look strange robs friends sympathized but that just made him relive the accident "i would think why not me " he says now "why didnt it happen to an underachiever " seven years later rob was succeeding professionally in orlando fla he had moved there after graduating from college in and taken a job driving a hazardous waste truck for safety kleen an environmental services company his easy manner appealed to customers safety kleen put him through several leadership programs and in named him a sales manager he called tom weekly but left his brothers care largely to his mother during visits home "being around tom would drive me crazy " rob recalls when tom set a drinking glass down he often put it precariously on the edge of a table outside tom skipped down the street careful not to step on sidewalk cracks rob often felt relieved upon returning to florida for a while he dated a physical therapist rob already was feeling he should be doing more for tom and she encouraged him to do it he liked his carefree life in orlando but worried that if he didnt act soon he might never in he asked safety kleen for a transfer the company gave him a bigger managerial job in ohio "i was more confident that i could make a difference in his life just by my presence " rob says "he was one of my programs one of the things i needed to do " tom was living with his mother in fort thomas a short drive away he and rob saw each other every few days when rob started dating brenda hatton a schoolteacher he had tom tag along with them to cincinnati reds baseball and cincinnati bengals football games at times it was awkward like many people with traumatic brain injury tom had lost some ability to recognize inappropriate behavior seeing a pretty woman hed make the lewd sort of remark an adolescent might make sometimes hed go to the restroom and disappear and rob would have to search the stadium for him brenda took it mostly in stride she thought she knew how much tom meant to rob but she was especially moved by what happened the night rob took her to a safety kleen awards banquet in after accepting a plaque for his sales performance rob returned to his table in tears he was remembering the football banquet hed attended with tom all those years ago and he was thinking about how toms achievements since the accident had inspired him to succeed for both of them "this is for tom " he told brenda "i couldnt have done this without tom " at the same time rob was learning that what he could do for his brother was limited he and their mother tried to find tom jobs but again he wasnt up to most of them for years they tried to get him into an assisted living apartment but tom performed too well on reading and other tests to qualify many people in toms condition face similar obstacles tom isnt retarded hes brain injured and many brain injured people vary widely in their abilities the assisted living apartments have limited capacity and are intended for the profoundly impaired when tested tom ever the competitor rose to the challenge and ruled himself out by doing too well tom finally found a job he was able to hold onto cleaning bathrooms at a truck stop on interstate in northern kentucky near cincinnati each morning he woke at a m to take buses two hours to work after work he took the bus back home to his mothers house then usually fell asleep watching television he no longer had any friends when asked what he did for a living he responded disparagingly "i clean up s after people " he held the job for a decade eventually earning &# an hour he frequently told his mother and brother that he regretted the night of his accident "i screwed up again " was a constant refrain like many brain injured people tom developed self destructive habits he started smoking he shoplifted dozens of cigarette lighters when rob explained that stealing was wrong tom couldnt understand arguing that the stores had plenty of lighters rob says some nights tom got lost coming home he missed transfers fell asleep in bus stations and sometimes just wandered off for no apparent reason each time rob spent hours looking for him thats what happened in when tom wound up in a strange backyard in a rough cincinnati neighborhood a resident thought tom was drunk rob says tom gave the man a phone number for mrs groeschen who called rob rob told tom to stay put but by the time rob arrived tom was on a bus heading in the wrong direction rob finally tracked him down at p m at the bus station in covington ky by then rob had started his own business a recycling and hazardous waste handling company called resource one with such big customers as sherwin williams co and the honda america unit of honda motor co rob built it into a &# million a year business growing at and more annually he and brenda now his wife lived with three daughters in a hilltop home overlooking woods and a creek but for all of his success his "program" for tom wasnt working his hope was to find a job for tom that was rewarding and a semi independent place for him to live he began to think of potential environmental services businesses that could employ people like tom the jobs had to be simple and safe yet challenging enough to be rewarding if such a company could turn a profit it could become that last link in the chain to help brain injured people re enter society rob thought in rob began discussing the idea with his business manager and accountant kathy obrien to learn about options for the brain injured they visited rehab centers and workplaces for the impaired in arkansas tennessee and illinois nationally there are few working situations well suited to people with brain injuries "the difficulty with traumatic brain injury is that a person once had a higher level of function " says gregory oshanick national medical director of the brain injury association of america in general "a person with brain injury will experience depression in an environment like a sheltered workshop " he says the ideal workplace would strike a balance between simple tasks and encouragement of growth while offering sufficient break time and honing of social skills for example workers would be given chances to master simple tasks like assembling products but also the chance to gradually expand their responsibilities many brain injured people once had greater abilities and can get frustrated if theyre not challenged at the same time the ideal workplace would integrate the teaching of "life skills" like appropriate conversation and behavior activities normally done with specialized therapists as he considered the options rob tapped thoughts about his motivations into a home computer "i personally have not recovered from toms accident but continue to look for reasons and answers " rob wrote in the fall of one night soon after that he announced to brenda "i cant wait for something to open up for tom i have to do it myself " on jan rob opened a warehouse and office facility in blue ash ohio a cincinnati suburb it housed his thriving original business plus a new nonprofit company he called in return his plan was that the new company would hire people with special needs especially those with brain injuries with its nonprofit tax advantage he thought the company could make money by selling products used in industrial maintenance to absorb spills among other items rob says the companys name signifies both a return to normal life for the brain injured and his personal payback to tom rob tom and other employees marked the occasion with a small champagne party in the front office tom drank nonalcoholic champagne many mornings tom and the five other brain injured workers recite a pledge of self esteem written by author and therapist virginia satir "there is no one else exactly like me " they recite "i know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me i can discard that which is unfitting keep the rest and invent something new for that which i discarded " then they go to work stuffing ground up rags and defective diaper fabric into foot long pieces of blue cloth to make industrial "socks " the socks are used by in return customers like honda to soak up manufacturing oil and grease each worker stamps each sock he makes with his own stamp they take minute breaks every hour there are pool and ping pong tables and general manager charlie parris who isnt brain injured brings in outside instructors to teach writing art exercises and other skills some workers put together gift baskets another product that the company sells in return is losing money so far but rob is convinced that he simply needs to market his products better in return was months old when robs friend and financial adviser monte hazelbaker grilled him about its finances at a cincinnati reds game rob confessed he already had lost &# on the venture "wouldnt it be easier to hire tom at resource one and shut down in return " mr hazelbaker recalls asking "you could give money to charity you could lease out part of the building " "im well aware of that " rob said "but no ones going to do what im doing " he felt there were few other places that offered employment intended to support people with brain injuries running both in return and his other company has put a strain on robs marriage brenda says she initially wasnt disturbed three years ago when rob announced his plans for in return "it was definitely just dropped on me " she says "had i looked into a crystal ball and seen the tons of extra stress this would cause well frustration is getting the upper hand now " she says rob sometimes seems emotionally absent around her and their three daughters "i have these feelings like listen buddy youve got to slow down and yet i feel bad about saying that because hes doing such good " last christmas morning brenda tearfully confronted rob "i miss you " she said "youre putting yourself on an island " he promised to do better recently though he says he was surprised when he realized his daughter jackie was about to celebrate her th birthday he had been so busy he simply didnt focus on how fast she was growing up that especially disappointed brenda because rob usually makes a big deal out of birthdays she says she thinks she knows where "his crazy need to go go go" may come from "its as if hes trying to be two people " rob acknowledges that his efforts to make in return a success have distracted him from his family and says hes trying to remedy that "i dont want to be a workaholic " he says "but i am " people who have seen tom lately say they hardly recognize him he used to sit alone eyes downcast trying to be invisible he slurred his words if he talked at all now he generally speaks more clearly on the job he smiles he smokes less and has quit shoplifting he works out on a stair machine daily jennifer cavitt a university of cincinnati neurologist who sees tom occasionally says "he has a more positive attitude and part of this no doubt is from his enjoyment of the new job situation " the job provides structure for tom but offers room to develop he has begun managing other workers some and works on various product lines at in return most of the manufacturing is simple such as stuffing absorbent material into cloth and the like but tom gets a chance to train new workers and to be in charge of one product line recycling defective shock absorbers and all the workers get the chance to socialize during breaks and work on physical development and skills like writing and artwork rob believes that if he can make the business sustainable it can be replicated elsewhere to return the brain injured to society tom even shows flashes of humor after learning how to send email at work tom sent one to rob who was out of town "were making some changes around here " tom now years old recently was approved for an assisted living apartment he proudly calls it "my one bedroom mansion " but asked about his youth he says "i dont remember growing up " outside his warehouse the sign for in return sits above the one for resource one robs for profit company rob says he wants to hire more workers at in return and start a van service to shuttle them to and from work hed love to train future greenhouse workers if he can find money to build a greenhouse "within our walls we can help people " rob says "i want to help " more than anything rob wants to broaden the possibilities for his brother he thinks tom might someday be able to manage others like himself maybe even get married and have children "im not sure there is a ceiling " rob says as for rob in return "certainly has given me a purpose in life " he says he still looks up to his brother saying "i cant imagine moving on from this earth not knowing what will happen to tom "
