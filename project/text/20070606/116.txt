the afternoon report getting prices right online edition with the global economy firing on all cylinders workers are beginning to have more success in demanding higher wages but central banks are concerned that rising paychecks among other factors may signal rising inflation as expected the european central bank raised its key interest rate from to the increase marked the eight time since december that the bank has moved borrowing costs in the bloc higher and brings the price of money in europe to its highest level since september economic growth in the euro zone has been strengthening for some time and with consumers and businesses feeling flush and unemployment falling to record lows europes policy makers have begun to fear that brisk activity and tight labor markets will fan inflation there thus may be more rate increases on the way ecb president jean claude trichet promised that policy makers would continue to keep price trends under the microscope saying monetary policy in the bloc was "on the accommodative side" and that the central bank would act in a "firm and timely manner" to keep prices stable still in the same way that traders suddenly transform themselves into budding linguists when a few words from the federal reserve float across the tape markets applied their hermeneutic muscles to mr trichets comments and decided that because he had said the ecb would watch inflation "closely" instead of "very closely " the bank had turned a bit more dovish on price trends economists generally expect that the ecb will boost rates another quarter point or two before the year is out and europes policy makers certainly arent alone central banks around the world have been taking steps to increase interest rates amid worry that capacity utilization is climbing to levels that will force firms to raise prices workers in developing economies like china and india have begun to win wage increases which could drive up import prices while firms in large developed economies such as germany and britain are running nearly flat out bond markets have already started to squeeze longer term interest rates higher the yield on the year u s treasury note has been scratching toward for the first time in more than nine months and if rates continue to climb it could chop global stock markets off at the knees ashraf laidi chief currency analyst at cmc markets says higher global yields "will increasingly weigh on equities and risk appetite " that much discussed ocean of liquidity that has helped drive the recent buyout binge could if not dry up give off a distinct odor of low tide many onlookers believed that when the u s economy slowed nearly to a dead stop during the first quarter the fed would at last be forced to push rates down a peg but federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and the central banks rate setting committee have kept their eyes firmly fixed on inflation and data today helped reinforce why policy makers remain concerned over prices productivity during the first quarter grew at a revised rate but unit labor costs a gauge of inflation in the labor market jumped higher than an earlier estimate of whats more labor costs during the fourth quarter rose adjusted upward from a previously estimated rise economist joseph brusuelas of ideaglobal said that lends support to the feds inflation worries even amid the modest rate of expansion in the broader economy since labor costs account for about two thirds of business expenses and other economists said that the data may foreshadow a potentially more troubling issue for the fed down the road "the puzzle now is why hasnt sub par growth brought more of a deceleration in core inflation we fear that the puzzle we will be asking in a year is why has trendish growth produced such a significant pickup in price pressures " wrote stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital markets dont like productivity numbers traders took one look at the productivity data
