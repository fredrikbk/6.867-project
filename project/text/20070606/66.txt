journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources technology small teams advance open source effort crowds of people can solve a lot of problems better than a small team but it usually takes a small team to get the most out of a crowds efforts the so called open source movement has exploded over the past years exploiting the internets quick communication that allows hundreds of people to collaborate on a single project its two most famous products are perhaps linux a computer operating system that builds on the work of a multitude of volunteers and wikipedia an online encyclopedia that allows anyone to write or edit its entries a defining moment for the movement was a paper presented at a technology conference in germany by programmer eric raymond titled "the cathedral and the bazaar " he described how software had traditionally been built as if it was a cathedral with a small coterie of engineers "working in splendid isolation " linuxs volunteer programmers on the other hand behaved like "a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches " which nevertheless managed to put together software at a pace far quicker than software built using the cathedral approach ten years on business writer nicholas g carr says linux and wikipedia have shown the power of the bazaar to improve and refine what already exists it can "find and fix problems to collect and categorize information or to perform any other time consuming task that can be sped up by having lots of people with diverse perspectives working in parallel " however the bazaar has difficulty coming up with innovative ideas it seems a cathedral style group is always needed at a projects core to efficiently harness the bazaars energy matt asay who has guided several open source business projects says he finds that without that core a decision by committee approach tends to produce "stale conservative code " linuxs success isnt as egalitarian as it seems says mr carr in mr raymond praised linuxs founder linus torvalds for realizing that "given enough eyeballs all software bugs are shallow " however linux has always had a central authority originally mr torvalds himself later a small group of engineers that synthesized the work of the volunteers similarly the expansiveness of wikipedias entries lies in its contributors wide range of interests however the encyclopedia is slowly putting together a management team to identify and improve poorly written articles and correct imbalances like the one where the "flintstones" entry is twice as long as the one on "homer " strategy + business summer publishing as jordan scraps censors citizens take newfound power book publishers and writers in jordan worry that the departure of government censors exposes them to a more hostile and less liberal force the jordanian people themselves in the jerusalem post daoud kuttab describes how jordans decades old laws censoring books were quietly scrapped this month following a similar lifting of censorship of published news but with few rights guaranteeing free expression and strong antidefamation laws writers and publishers face a host of obstacles to their work people can still be imprisoned for their opinions or have their opinions suppressed under other laws a former cabinet minister recently narrowly escaped arrest after a jordanian citizen filed a complaint about statements he had made on television officials have even confiscated the tapes to an interview that jordans prince hassan bin talal king abdullahs uncle gave to al jazeera angry citizens claiming defamation represent the greatest new threat to publishers and writers under the old system once the censor approved a work no one could sue the publisher or author in a radio interview elias farkouh who works at the progressive azzmenah publication publishing house said "while we are happy to be rid of government censors we are now totally unprotected from the whims of society " in recognition of this some former censors have offered to give consultations to publishers nervous about giving offense author rifqa dudeen worries that now that censorships disappearance has allowed the publication of her book "the tale of an arab youth in america " she could be sued by anyone whom it offends according to mr kuttab they would likely win the jerusalem post june see more on our blog at wsj com informedreader send comments to informedreader wsj com
