an independent newspaper dont believe the man who tells you there are two sides to every question there is only one side to the truth " so wrote william peter hamilton one of the first men to hold the job of editorial page editor of the wall street journal in the early decades of the last century for editorial writers worth their pay those are words to live by and we hope to be living by them for a long time to come thats a point worth stressing amid the news that the bancroft family may soon sell the journals parent company to rupert murdochs news corp or some other bidder the bancrofts have been exceptional stewards of this newspaper for more than a century but capitalism is dynamic and those of us who extol the virtues of joseph schumpeters "creative destruction" for others cant complain when it sweeps through our own industry thats what is happening as the internet breaks up long time media business models and dow jones is hardly immune the bancrofts have every right as owners to sell or not based on their own dictates and what we say wont matter in any event where we do have a say however is on the question of journalistic "independence " theres been a lot of debate lately about what that means we thought our readers might like to know what it has meant at the journal and specifically for these columns over the decades for starters the bancrofts are unique in their hands off ownership they are often compared as family newspaper proprietors to the grahams at the washington post or the sulzbergers at the new york times but members of those families run those newspapers exerting influence over the news and opinion operations in that sense those newspapers are hardly "independent" of those families everyone knows that the influence of times publisher and ceo arthur sulzberger jr extends to selecting not merely the editorial page editor but columnists political endorsements and as far as we can tell even news coverage priorities we dont see how this differs from most of what mr murdoch is accused of doing with his newspapers the same lack of independence also applies to most non family media companies such as gannett a newspaper owner whose make no waves corporate ethic turns nearly all of its editorial pages into mush by contrast the bancrofts have allowed journalists to run the news and editorial shops that family ethic became a guiding principle under jessie bancroft cox step granddaughter of clarence barron and the business leadership of the great barney kilgore at the editorial page this has meant that for a century we have been able to adhere to a worldview we now distill to the phrase "free people and free markets " this began more or less with the classical liberalism of william hamilton who as a scotsman before emigrating had dabbled in british liberal party politics it has continued through a series of editors who have adhered to those principles despite shifting political fashions and partisan winds over the years this independence has also meant the freedom to challenge prevailing media conventions and political power following hamilton as editor in the s thomas woodlock battled keynesian economics and the new deal the journal was skeptical of fdrs dalliances with prewar britain until the day war began and our short editorial was headlined "we have a duty " the editorial hangs in our office today as he campaigned for re election in harry truman denounced the journal as the "republicans bible " a line that earned him a rebuke from editor of the editorial page william grimes because "our loyalties are to the economic and governmental principles in which we believe and not to any political party " in one of his visits to the white house editor vermont royster was thanked by john f kennedy for supporting his free trade agenda "young man " said royster "the wall street journal was supporting free trade before you were born " the journal hasnt endorsed a presidential candidate since herbert hoover preferring instead to praise or assail the candidates ideas on occasion this has meant the journal has come under outside pressure both commercial and political but the bancrofts and our publishers have always stood firm in the s these columns defended journal reporters against general motors for disclosing the car companys tactics against independent auto dealers only weeks after we had defended gm against the governments trustbusters gm pulled its advertising for a time only to back down later and the episode helped the journal build credibility as independent of advertising interests our former editor robert bartley once told us of being called on the carpet by henry kissinger then the secretary of state for opposing detente and arms control with the soviet union journal publisher and ceo warren phillips accompanied bartley to the meeting and started things off by asking mr kissinger what all of his spengler pessimism talk vis a vis the russians was about the anti detente editorials kept coming and bartley and mr kissinger later became friends the s were especially controversial with the journals reporting about whitewater and bill clintons ethics and more than one liberal thought he could mute bartleys campaign in the wake of the vincent foster suicide but the bancrofts and publisher peter kann stood up to the pressure perhaps the sternest commercial test has come as we have expanded abroad especially in asia the journal has been banned or had its circulation restricted in many countries and a reporter for another dow jones publication went to jail in malaysia in singapore a big market for the journal the government made the editorial page the first target of its campaign to curtail western coverage of its domestic politics in the mid s while other companies notably bloomberg have surrendered pre emptively the journal has been nearly alone in fighting back freedom of the press has improved in asia as democracy has expanded and were proud to continue fighting for freedom and human rights today in china we could tell other stories but the essential point is that our owners have allowed us to speak our mind on behalf of a consistent set of principles readers may like or loathe those beliefs and our way of defending them but we like to think this brand of independence is one reason the journal has attracted such an influential readership to borrow a phrase from modern business lingo we hope it is part of our value proposition at a dinner honoring their century of journal ownership in bob bartley expressed his gratitude to the bancrofts for their support noting that some of his editorials over years must not have sat well with everyone in the ideologically diverse clan but bartley added that his proudest boast was that he ran the only editorial page "that sells newspapers " we cant say what any future owner would do but we doubt one would be foolish enough to undermine this market appeal on january william grimes wrote a memorable editorial "a newspapers philosophy " that summed up our worldview this way "on our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view we believe in the individual in his wisdom and his decency we oppose all infringements on individual rights whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government people will say we are conservative or even reactionary we are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one we would say we are radical " even years later that still sounds good to us whether the bancroft family sells or not and no matter who is the buyer we plan to stand for those beliefs for as long into the future as we are able see related letter "letters to the editor straight shooters" wsj june
