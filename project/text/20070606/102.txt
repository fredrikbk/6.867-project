smoother flight plan for airline pensions your may editorial "pension crash landing" mischaracterizes the airline pension legislation passed recently and wrongly implies that it reverses a compromise agreed to last year when the pension legislation passed last year airlines that froze their pension plans were allowed to use a favorable interest rate in computing their past unfunded liabilities and were given years to pay off that past underfunding for airlines that did not freeze their plans past underfunding had to be computed at a considerably less favorable interest rate and had to be paid back over just years this meant that congress granted relief for the past pension liabilities of some airlines while denying the same or even similar relief to other airlines that were committed to providing their employees with retirement benefits through a defined benefit plan during final consideration of the pension reform bill last august both democrats and republicans agreed that the competitive imbalance created by the legislation should be addressed as quickly as possible in or early so as not to perpetuate a competitive imbalance among the airlines that inequity was addressed recently in the supplemental appropriations bill and the congressional budget office determined that those pension amendments will in fact save the federal government money the pension amendments passed by congress and signed by the president are an attempt to create a more level playing field the amendments grant the airlines that are contractually bound to continue all or some of their plans such as alaska american airlines continental and hawaiian similar relief for the past underfunding of those ongoing plans while requiring that any future benefits earned be calculated under the same rules that apply to all ongoing pension plans although the interest relief granted for ongoing plans is less generous than that granted for frozen plans the relief is delayed until and the past underfunding must be paid off in years instead of the amendments do create a more level playing field in a highly competitive industry the amendments also allow the marketplace not congress to pick winners and losers continental itself has both a frozen and a nonfrozen pension plan it has continued to make contributions significantly in excess of the minimum requirements to both plans and remains committed to fulfilling its promises to employees while continental plans to make contributions to its pensions significantly above the amount legally required this bipartisan solution corrects a disparity imposed on certain airlines by congress as a result of the passage of the pension protection act of and helps all airlines remain competitive jeff smisek president continental airlines houston
