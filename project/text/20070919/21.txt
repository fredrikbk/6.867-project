cancer vaccines draw interest after more than years of setbacks research into therapeutic cancer vaccines is starting to show promising results and attract the investments of large pharmaceutical firms but the field remains risky and so far no drugs have been approved for use about eight million people die from cancer each year a figure that is expected to rise by to approximately million in making it the worlds largest single killer disease according to the world health organization therapeutic vaccines stimulate the bodys immune system to attack cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alive while more traditional cancer treatments kill both types of cells although the vaccines wont prevent cancer altogether they are expected to be used in addition to radiotherapy chemotherapy and hormone therapy to prevent cancer relapses an estimated &# billion a year is spent on cancer treatment with a number of promising cancer vaccines now in late stage trials minneapolis based research firm arrowhead publishers expects these drugs to generate annual sales of some &# billion by paris based sanofi aventis sa the worlds second largest cancer drug company by sales after switzerlands roche holding ag in march bought the rights to the vaccine trovax from the u k s oxford biomedica plc for about million euros roughly &# million the biggest cancer vaccine deal so far trovax is in phase iii trials for kidney cancer and is being tested in colorectal and prostate cancers phase iii clinical trials are the final large trials measuring a drugs efficiency before it is submitted to authorities for approval they follow phase i trials which investigate the safety of a new drug in a small number of people and phase ii trials which evaluate a drugs efficacy in treating a specific condition elsewhere u k drug giant glaxosmithkline plc and germanys merck kgaa are going head to head to get the first lung cancer vaccine on the market merck kgaa isnt related to merck &amp co of the u s glaxo in june said it will recruit more than patients for a phase iii study of the lung cancer vaccine mage a which it bought from the u s s ludwig institute for cancer research in merck kgaa also is in the process of recruiting more than patients for a phase iii study of its lung cancer vaccine stimuvax bought from canadas biomira inc haakan mellstedt a professor in oncological biotherapy at karolinska institutet in stockholm says the development of vaccines is difficult expensive and takes time but clinical results are starting to show progress "there are possibilities here and now the big companies are starting to be interested but they havent had the courage before because it has been too risky for them " he says unlike other cancer treatments which can cause hair loss infections and vomiting scientists believe the vaccines wont have any notable side effects because very few problems have been reported thus far in trials "it is an ideal treatment method for people who feel well since it is practically without side effects " mr mellstedt says sanofi aventis and glaxo declined to comment on when they expect to file for approval of the vaccines or how long it will take to complete the final trials merck said it expects its trial will be finished toward the end of in earlier studies most therapeutic vaccines that showed promising results when tested on animals simply didnt work when tried on humans philippe monteyne glaxos head of global vaccine development concedes cancer vaccine research hasnt been successful in the past but "it hasnt been years of failing but years of learning " he says early studies of mage a showed the drug reduced the risk of cancer reoccurrence by which prompted glaxos large investment in late stage trials "the fact that gsk took the decision to embark on this huge study the biggest study ever in the field of lung cancer shows how much confidence we have in this approach " mr monteyne says wolfgang wein senior executive vice president for oncology at merck serono sa a merck kgaa division gives a similarly positive outlook for stimuvax he says twice as many cancer patients were still alive after three years of adding stimuvax to regular treatments compared with patients using only the regular treatments promising late stage results also are emerging from biotechnology firms genitope corp antigenics inc and pharmexa a s according to norwalk conn based information consultancy windhover information while antigenics of new york is adding more research to an existing request for approval of the kidney cancer vaccine oncophage horsholm denmark based pharmexa plans to file for approval of the pancreatic cancer vaccine gv in late fremont calif based genitope expects to present a final analysis of the non hodgkins lymphoma vaccine myvax in the fourth quarter of this year still no cancer vaccines have been approved by the food and drug administration a key consideration for drug companies seeking approval in countries around the world "the cruel reality is that compared with most pharmaceutical areas this approach hasnt had one approved product " says florian shoenharting co founder and partner at the biotechnology venture capital firm nordic biotech it has invested million euros &# million in biotechnology firms in europe and the u s but hasnt invested in cancer vaccine projects market approval of cancer vaccines has been denied because trials havent reached their primary targets of slowing tumor growth indications the vaccines could prolong lives arent considered in the approval process because those results were additional findings in the studies jeffrey schlom chief of the laboratory of tumor immunology and biology at the u s national cancer institute in bethesda md says companies need to set survival rates as the primary endpoint of cancer vaccine trials rather than reduction of tumor growth and conduct trials over a longer time period "measuring patient survival could take five to seven years which is expensive but necessary " he says
