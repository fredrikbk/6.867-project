shippers set for consolidation a wave of consolidation has crashed into the bulk shipping industry in an industry where there had never been a billion dollar deal there were two this summer but far from forging ahead into new territory the companies genco shipping &amp trading ltd and eagle bulk shipping inc say they are following in the wake of another waterborne industry oil tankers "we view the tanker industry as a lead indicator for what will happen in dry bulk in about five years " eagle chief executive officer sophocles zoullas said on july eagle paid &# billion for midsize supramax freighters to be delivered in through "in the five year outlook the potential for consolidation in our highly fragmented industry is tremendous " mr zoullas said the top bulk shippers by tonnage control now represent a fraction of a fragmented market as of february there were about vessels in the worlds bulk carrier fleet with about owners even after the two huge deals this summer the biggest publicly traded bulk companies have fewer than ships a minuscule piece of the world market todays shipping magnates say their situation resembles where the oil tanker industry was a decade ago ten years ago the tanker industry wasnt well followed by the capital markets and the top publicly traded tanker companies had a combined market cap of &# billion said bjorn moller who has been president and chief executive of teekay corp since when the company had just ships today teekay has ships and a market cap of &# billion making it one of the largest publicly traded tanker companies in the world "now the market cap of top publicly traded tanker companies is about &# billion " mr moller said bulk freighters carry anything that cant conveniently fit in a standardized container or tanker it is basic stuff iron ore coal grain the raw materials developing economies are made of the way the industry works buying a ship is almost like buying a new business minus the debt incurred new revenue adds immediately to a shipping companys bottom line as a result shipping stocks trade up on acquisition news both genco and eagle shares hit highs trading up as much as when news of their deals broke both companies now have relatively high price earnings ratios genco trades at times forward earnings while eagle trades at times forward earnings compared with the industry average of for the oil industry the growth of publicly traded companies coincided with a wave of consolidation mr moller said the top tanker companies in the world now control of the worlds fleet double from years ago "parallel that to dry bulk today " mr moller said "the top owners control maybe of the worlds tonnage and dry bulk is set for further consolidation " to be sure the two industries arent entirely analogous consolidation in the tanker industry over the bull market of the past years was driven by a fleet replacement necessitated by environmental disaster the wreck of the exxon valdez after the wreck international shipping bodies led by the u s mandated the phasing out of single hulled tankers like the valdez and replacing them with sturdier double hulled tankers less likely to leak in the event of a wreck the regulation had the effect of driving smaller less capitalized players out of the market "suddenly tanker companies needed a bigger infrastructure to operate " shipping executive peter georgiopoulos said "youre not going to be able to be a fly by night two or three ship company anymore operating tankers " as chairman of both genco and tanker company general maritime corp mr georgiopoulos has seen both sides of the oiler bulker coin mr georgiopoulos said he prefers to buy when markets are down but nonetheless he has bet big on bulk shippings continued strength on july genco bought nine massive capesize bulk freighters for &# billion doubling its fleet dry bulk is enjoying a sustained bull run that has defied seasonal trends when china entered the world trade organization in shipping demand surged more than tripling ship prices and rates public companies with their ships operating at margins are forced to do something with the cash it is a motive for acquisitions that their private peers lack public companies "are the guys who drive up prices and pay too much " said basil mavroleon managing director at charles r weber co a greenwich conn ship broker "they have to think about their shareholders return on capital if im a private guy i can sit on the beach its my money i dont have to worry about any of that " mr georgiopoulos said in his experience consolidation takes place at market highs as public companies leverage their share equity valuation to buy up private assets "i think when the market is booming the numbers seem to make more sense " mr georgiopoulos said "the banks are more excited the market is more excited a lot of it has to do with momentum " other shipping companies have similarly low levels of leverage and plan to expand eagle unlike genco wasnt considered a prime candidate for a big acquisition until its deal was announced several analysts cited diana shipping inc which is about leveraged against assets and excel maritime carriers ltd about leveraged against assets as more likely buyers both diana and excel say they are looking to expand through acquisitions availability may be whats holding them back "simply therere no ships available " said mr zoullas of eagle "ship owners have generally done very well in this market and no one wants to diminish their fleets " with global trade intensifying the prospects for a long term consolidation seem good analysts are generally bullish on the industry through when a massive supply of new ships on order puts the outlook in doubt for the most part they expect at least a few more good years for consolidation "if you look at the numbers you cant call this a peak because it could still go up further " said urs dur a shipping analyst for lazard capital markets "i think were in the fifth inning probably you can feel it "
