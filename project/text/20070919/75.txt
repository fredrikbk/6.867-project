me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q which number is more important to performance horsepower or torque and what is the impact of the cars weight on that performance ravi thummalapalli iselin n j a the general rule is that heavier vehicles like minivans pickup trucks and family cars tend to perform best when their torque rating is at least a bit higher than their horsepower rating a lightweight sports car can perform well with a lower torque rating both numbers matter and should be considered together but torque is more meaningful in everyday driving it affects how quickly a vehicle accelerates from a standstill such as merging into traffic or leaving a stoplight horsepower comes into play more when passing on the highway q i saw a notice at the gas station that the regular unleaded may contain up to ethanol is it safe for all cars to use gasoline blended with ethanol pavittar safir roswell ga a it is safe to use gasoline mixed with ethanol or e indeed you may have used the blended fuel before without knowing it this fuel blend is covered under warranty by automobile manufacturers and some recommend it because of its high octane and performance characteristics q before i bought a bmw il with miles on it i had a prepurchase inspection done and some repairs made by a reputable mechanic a clean bill of health was issued five hundred miles later the transmission broke down before i go to the mechanic what are my options jonathan pollack greenwich conn a im guessing the car didnt come with a warranty that covers the transmission so your options appear limited transmissions can break for reasons that would not be detected in the typical inspection if your mechanic checked the transmission fluid and it looked fine he may have figured it was in good mechanical shape still an internal flaw can cause a failure any time on top of that i have heard that bmw series transmissions from the late s and early s have a greater than average tendency to "let go" shortly after miles your best route may be discussing the problem with the mechanic who did the inspection and getting him to fix the transmission he may do the work at a more reasonable cost than a bmw dealers service department questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
