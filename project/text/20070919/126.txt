the morning brief for the fed funds rate its cut and then wait online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the federal reserves half point cut in interest rates seems to have been a pre emptive strike against the unknown an aggressive move not without its own risks and one targeting economic troubles that are still beyond the horizon it is usually helpful to compare policy statements from the federal open market committee to those from its previous meetings but yesterdays statement accompanying the half point reduction to in the fed funds rate its target for overnight lending between banks offers a radically different message than the more sanguine statement the fomc issued on aug interestingly yesterdays statement also seemed less stark than the view of "appreciably" increasing "downside risks" in an assertion on aug when the fed lowered the discount rate it charges for short term loans it makes to banks instead the fed noted that "the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally " and in an unusually explicit explanation of its actions the fomc said "todays action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time " in other words the fed seems to see itself helping not the market players jolted during last months turmoil but rather all those whose livelihoods are affected by a housing downturn that threatens to cut off the credit that feeds and nourishes the u s economy the threat that so spooked the financial markets in the first place the developments in the financial markets the fomc said have only "increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook " apparently to the point that fomc members felt they had to forego the usual assessment of whether inflation or slowing growth poses the biggest risk for while the fomc is now a lot more worried about growth than it was aug "the committee judges that some inflation risks remain and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully " when deciding to cut the fed funds rate by half a point rather than a moderate quarter point step and unanimously at that the fomc seemed set on priming the lending pump and then waiting to see where this uncertain economy is going it is tempting to wonder what fed policy markers thought after the statement was released and stock markets soared through the roof leaving the impression that some investors saw the return of an era of easy money with yesterdays move the wall street journal says fed chairman ben bernanke "may have shown himself closer in style and tactics to predecessor alan greenspan than some market watchers had suspected that carries risks critics may start referring to the bernanke put as they once spoke of the greenspan put under the former fed chairman " a put the journal explains is a kind of option that can shield its holder from an investment loss "yet mr bernanke has shown that giving the impression he might be shielding investors matters less than keeping the economy out of recession " the journal adds after all as the new york times notes by lowering the cost of borrowed money the feds move could lower homeowners mortgage rates stabilize share prices for investors and make financing easier and cheaper for both wall street and companies across america "something for just about everyone " of course thats just what some critics of the easy credit behind the housing boom had feared re educating detainees in the house of wisdom it may sound like one of the more orwellian twists of the post era but marine maj gen douglas m stone the commander of u s detention facilities in iraq tells a group of defense bloggers his introduction of "religious enlightenment" for detainees as young as years old is making progress in what he calls "the battlefield of the mind " gen stone says the religious courses led by muslim clerics who "teach out of a moderate doctrine " are mostly aimed at bending "back to our will" iraqi detainees who have been held for more than a year the washington post reports most of the younger ones the post says are held in a facility the military calls the "house of wisdom " the number of iraqis detained by the u s has increased to from about last year and gen stone says his teams are trying to identify

allowing shippers to forego more costly routes through the panama and suez canals could still be a while away especially since new supporting ports will have to be built and theyll have to take into
