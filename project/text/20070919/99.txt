politics &amp economics why clinton embraced employer based insurance candidate discovers workers and bosses attached to status quo washington democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said in drafting a new health care plan she considered doing away with the employer based system but concluded that people like it "we looked at every permutation of how you get to universal health care " the new york senator said in an interview with the wall street journal "theres great attachment to the employer based system even though it is eroding " since world war ii employers have benefited from tax breaks for providing health insurance to workers with neither employer nor employee counting the value of the insurance as income many analysts say the employer based system isnt the most efficient or logical way to deliver insurance and people in both political parties have suggested moving away from it but one of the lessons mrs clinton said she drew from her failed attempt at health overhaul when her husband was president was that insured americans get nervous if they think their coverage will have to change sixty percent of employers offered health insurance this year down from in large companies with or more workers almost universally provide coverage but there has been a marked decline among smaller companies to this year from in according to a survey by the kaiser family foundation and health research and educational trust mrs clinton said she was surprised to hear employers tell her that they didnt want to give up that role "were asking why do you want to be in the health care business " she said "and i would say a really healthy majority of ceos said we want to be making those decisions it may be because its the only thing they know it is something that has always been done so they dont want to give it up but that came as something of a surprise to a lot of us " the new york senator said many employees are also "adamant" about keeping the workplace based coverage mrs clintons plan proposed this week attempts to shore up the employer system not replace it the plan looks to lock up large businesses as insurance providers by requiring them to provide coverage or pay into a government fund small businesses would be offered a tax credit if they provide insurance all employers would be given the chance to shop for plans in a new government run network of private and public plans mrs clinton said that if large employers got organized they could pressure health insurance companies to make important changes such as insisting on electronic health records and standardized forms she promised that if elected president she would do the same for the health plans that serve federal workers "there will be things i can do by executive order " she said adding that the "vast majority" of her plan would need congressional approval also the clinton campaign said mrs clinton doesnt see punishment for people who remain uninsured but is not ruling it out either she said she hopes that incentives including tax credits would be enough to get people to voluntarily get insurance laurie rubiner a clinton health policy adviser said this issue would have to be worked out with congress should mrs clinton win the election next year massachusetts will begin fining people who fail to prove they have health insurance those fines will eventually equal half the cost of the least expensive plan available to them for some that figure would top &# per year
