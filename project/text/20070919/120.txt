the attorney generals job the nomination of michael b mukasey to be attorney general of the united states has met with almost uniform praise this troubles democrats and republicans alike for democrats dealing with a nominee of such considerable professional substance almost certainly complicates the partisan desire to keep up the drumbeat for documents from the white house or to otherwise keep beating a politically deceased alberto gonzales on the republican side there is natural suspicion of someone so highly recommended by sen charles schumer in any case judge mukasey is superbly qualified to fill the role of the nations chief law enforcement officer but legal talent is one thing the ever important presidential relationship quite another the office of attorney general was created by an isolated paragraph in the judiciary act of and judge mukasey clearly meets its requirement of being "learned in law" yale law school followed by ample experience as a federal prosecutor in private practice and for years a half dozen as chief judge demonstrating important managerial capability on one of the busiest federal courts in the land the southern district of new york gets more than its share of complex securities and corporate cases along with the usual docket of federal criminal prosecutions judge mukasey threaded the legal needle in early terrorism cases distinguishing himself in the words of his appellate reviewers as a man of "extraordinary skill and patience assuring fairness to the prosecution" and defendant alike it is widely assumed that judge mukasey inherits a justice department in some considerable disarray with vacancies at the top of almost all the divisions and suspicion and frustration among the career ranks but at least he inherits a department edmund randolph the first attorney general had to get along all by himself the department of justice not being created until years later while judge mukasey will be forced to take a considerable pay cut from the private practice he has enjoyed since leaving the bench in hes certainly better off than randolph who had to make do with a half salary about &# but randolph had an initial advantage judge mukasey lacks he was well known to the president george washington had utilized randolphs legal counsel numerous times before he assumed public office despite rose garden oratory president bush doesnt really know judge mukasey and therein lies a challenge to effectiveness some of the most effective attorneys general in modern times have been close associates even kin of the president bobby kennedy when he was just years old assumed the role for his brother and by many accounts acquitted himself well giving pivotal advice resolving the cuban missile crisis aggressively pursuing organized crime and laying the framework for the early federal civil rights legislation likewise close friend and california legal adviser edwin meese for whom i worked had the ear and total confidence of president reagan the seamlessness of this relationship gave birth to a strengthening of efforts to reduce both the demand and supply sides of the illegal drug trade a substantial reform of the antitrust policies to coincide with other deregulatory steps to spur a then sputtering and inflated economy a revival of respect for the separation of powers and the interests of the states and a judicial selection effort that underscored fidelity to text and a restrained judicial role it was mr meeses careful screening that led to the nomination to the federal bench of men and women of judge mukaseys caliber including judge mukasey himself in by contrast clinton attorney general janet reno whose legal credentials were impeccable was often thought to lack necessary access to the president president clintons third choice when his first two had confirmation difficulty ms reno is remembered for missteps that led to the deadly branch davidian siege but also for the expansion of the independent counsels inquiry into matters related to monica lewinsky depending on your political perspective the latter was either a profile in courage or an abuse of process that provoked an unwarranted impeachment process of course to sen pat leahy and the democrats and even some republicans like sen arlen specter exasperated by the inability to obtain the answers they demanded from mr gonzales judge mukaseys lack of texas pedigree or long standing presidential friendship is almost certainly a plus sen leahy who has flirted with the idea that the justice department should be the equivalent of an independent agency will certainly see judge mukaseys lack of prior history with george w bush as a strength frankly a bit of distance from the president can be and at this moment in time likely is beneficial whatever the complete motivation for the selective dismissal of u s attorneys either the firings themselves or the public controversy surrounding them has seriously eroded public confidence in whether the legal framework is being evenhandedly applied robert jackson who served as attorney general to fdr before being named to the supreme court is famously remembered for his admonition to u s attorneys that they have "more control over life liberty and reputation than any other person in america his discretion is tremendous while the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in society when he acts from malice or other base motives he is one of the worst " judge mukasey could scarcely find a better opening text for his confirmation proceeding than the jackson quote and upon assuming office could likewise use it to reaffirm the u s attorney guidelines that prosecutions are rarely to be countermanded by washington except to ensure "uniformity of policy and action " forthright commitment to these rule of law principles should rightly banish prescriptions to formally make the attorney general an independent agent president carter floated that idea post watergate only to have his attorney general griffin bell opine that any law restricting the removal of the attorney general by the president would be unconstitutional and promote unaccountability "because laws are not self executing their enforcement obviously cannot be separated from policy considerations " wrote mr bell this is the consensus view of academic study as well scholar nancy baker who has done a comprehensive study of the office quotes former attorneys general elliot richardson and william saxbe as arguing that too high a degree of insulation of the office from politics could create a tyrannical bureaucratic monster in the end the attorney general more than any other executive officer must combine a personal and professional commitment to the law and the constitution with a measured degree of sensitivity to the political constituencies represented by the justice departments own civil service personnel the house and senate judiciary committees the federal courts the bar and the legal academy and yes of course the president can judge mukasey bring us back to this straight and narrow path beyond his vast experience and reputation of integrity it helps tremendously that he has given considerable thought to reforms aimed at the greatest immediate threat to the civil order terrorism in an op ed on this page judge mukasey demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the capability of regular courts to deal with detainees some say the shortness of time will make judge mukasey only a place holder but the times do not permit that luxury we have dealt with terrorism in fits and starts sometimes on a war footing and sometimes through the lens of criminality it may well be both or neither and whether it is a specialized national security court with more flexible rules of evidence or something else it is a reasonable bet that judge mukasey will counterbalance any defendant limitations to access to classified information with adherence to a rigorous burden of proof and the observance of ethical standards of course beyond terrorism there is dealing with an increasing rate of violence in urban settings jump starting fair minded civil rights enforcement that addresses both invidious electoral exclusion and voter fraud the perennial problem of drug abuse disparate sentencing and new challenges posed by identity theft and the theft of intellectual property that should easily fill out the rest of the next attorney generals hours the notion that the forthcoming hearings ought to rehearse past grievances would be a mistake there is serious work to be done and a serious person has stepped forward who can do it if we let go of the partisan past mr kmiec assistant attorney general and head of the office of legal counsel to presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush is a professor of constitutional law at pepperdine university
