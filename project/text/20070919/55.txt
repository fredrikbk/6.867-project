hillarycares new clothes hillary clinton has been blasted for months by her democratic presidential rivals because until monday she hadnt delivered her formal campaign promises for "universal" health care but john edwards and barack obama were unfair she beat them to the punch by at least years the former first ladys health care overhaul ended disastrously still it poured the philosophical and policy foundations of the current health care debate as she unveils hillarycare ii mrs clinton likes to joke that its "deja vu all over again" and it is unfortunately her new plan is called "health choices" and mentions "choice" so many times that it sounds like a freudian slip and sure enough "choice" for mrs clinton means using different means that will arrive at the same end an expensive bureaucratic government run system that restricts choice begin with the "individual mandate " the latest fad after mitt romneys massachusetts miracle it compels everyone to have insurance either through their employers or the government not only would this element of hillarycare require a huge new enforcement bureaucracy it is twinned with a "pay or play" tax on businesses that dont or cant afford to provide health insurance to their employees the plan also creates a new public insurance option modeled after medicare and open to everyone regardless of income to keep insurance "affordable " hillarycare ii offers a refundable tax credit that limits cost to a certain percentage of income yet the program works at cross purposes because coverage mandates always drive up the price of insurance and if the "pay or play" tax is lower than a companys current health insurance costs a company will have every incentive to dump its employee plan and pay the tax meanwhile the private insurance industry would be restructured with far more stringent regulations mrs clinton would require nationally "guaranteed issue " which means insurers have to offer policies to all applicants she would also command "community rating " which prohibits premium differences based on health status both of these have raised costs enormously in the states that require them such as new york but mrs clinton says they are necessary nationwide to prevent "discrimination" that infringes "on the central purposes of insurance which is to share risk " not quite the central purpose of insurance is to price and hedge against reasonably predictable risks it does not require socializing every last expense and redistributing wealth no liberal reform would be complete without repealing the bush tax cuts of and mrs clinton would foot the bill for her plan with this tax increase the rest of the estimated &# billion per year in new government spending would be achieved by "modernizing" health care delivery and "promoting wellness " though this &# billion in savings is speculative if not fanciful further tax hikes would be required that &# billion is a back of the envelope calculation and team hillary is keeping the specifics in its pocket given how poorly "universal" policies fared the last time around who can blame them mrs clinton and ira magaziner headed a health care task force with more than members that eventually produced numbing pages of proposals its hardly surprising this boondoggle died without so much as a congressional vote yet mrs clinton insisted that the public had been spooked by rush limbaugh an article in a marginal political journal and advertising campaigns such as "harry and louise " in other words the lessons she learned were political not substantive she thought she had overreached with too sweeping changes so she and her husband began to slice their universal health care ambitions into smaller initiatives like the state childrens health insurance program schip this is her strategy now hillarycare ii is designed to cause minimal disruptions to current private insurance coverage in the short run while dressing up the old agenda with slightly different mechanisms and rhetoric rather than fight small business this time she is trying to seduce it with tax credits for small companies that provide insurance only later when costs rise will the credits shrink or other taxes rise to court large manufacturers like the auto and steel industries shell offer another "temporary" tax credit to subsidize their health care liabilities her plan in short is hillarycare i in better clothes a transitional platform to shift people to the default option which is government insurance whats striking about all this is how little new thinking there is like the other democratic proposals hillarycare ii would mark another major government intrusion into health care it would keep all of the systems current problems most of them created by government policies and entrench and expand them the creativity is all in the political repackaging
