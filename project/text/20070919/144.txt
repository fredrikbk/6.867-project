why firms like smucker may feel pinch of debt crunch when fruit spread purveyor j m smucker co started buying mortgage backed securities in they seemed like a safe way to diversify some of its investments now however that asset class is in a bit of a jam shares of banks and brokerages have fallen sharply since the markets cooled for commercial paper and other securitized debt that might hold mortgage backed loans but they arent the only players with home loan related holdings in recent years smucker joined the ranks of other nonfinancial companies such as garmin ltd microsoft corp netflix inc and sun microsystems inc by investing in what had been viewed as relatively safe investments that produced slightly better returns than cash and government bonds and could be sold quickly if needed many of these companies are cash rich looking for a secure place to park their millions and none are expected to cash out any time soon the issue for investors is how these companies determine the "fair" value of their mortgage backed securities in the current environment and whether they are telling the whole story about how easily these assets can be liquidated and for how much "it concerns me from the standpoint of transparency whether the cash stated on the balance sheet is a true representation of the cash available to the company " said jeffrey diecidue a hedge fund manager at uca llc in short hills n j who has less than &# million in assets when the credit market is liquid determining the fair value of mortgage backed securities can be easy since there is an abundance of bid and offer quotes but when things are tight as they are for certain mortgage related debt securities now assessing fair value is difficult because there are far fewer buyers than sellers that means a companys portfolio of securities might not be fairly valued and the cash it could raise in a sale could be less than it has reported the amount of mortgage backed securities owned by nonfinancial companies as a proportion of their total assets is low and some like smucker say they invest in only highly rated loans but in the current environment just saying investments have high credit ratings gives investors little comfort as the traditionally staid commercial paper market has shown recently even triple a rated debt can be backed by subprime loans causing investors to balk prices to fall and trading to seize up at the end of july smucker had &# million in mortgage backed debt classified as noncurrent marketable securities available for sale which are assets the company intends to sell for cash if it is needed for future operations while that debt is just of smuckers total assets it makes up of the companys total marketable securities and of its noncurrent marketable securities at navigation device maker garmin of short term marketable securities or &# million are in high grade mortgage backed securities garmin like other companies that hold this type of debt doesnt provide details in its securities filings about the assets polly schwerdt director of investor relations for garmin said "were not carrying any sort of esoteric types of investments " she added however that garmin is likely to reduce its exposure to mortgage backed securities "because theres risk in the category " a spokeswoman for smucker said the company owns "high quality collateralized mortgage obligations " which are big pools of home mortgages smuckers mortgage backed securities werent issued by the government or federal agencies such as fannie mae or freddie mac she said other companies with mortgage backed securities including biomet inc microsoft novell inc netflix and sun microsystems declined to comment semiconductor maker lsi corp didnt respond to requests for comment john olson chief financial officer of memory chip maker xilinx inc said the company buys only diverse high grade securities and no collateralized debt obligations or cdos which are debt pools that can carry triple a ratings while still being backed entirely by subprime debt "fortunately our treasurer was smart enough to know that cdos arent always what they say they are " he said mortgage backed securities make up &# million or of xilinxs &# million in short term investments still complicated investments have hurt other companies in the past in for instance procter &amp gamble co sustained heavy losses from derivatives on its balance sheet and sued its financial adviser bankers trust for selling these complex contracts to the consumer products company for the moment investors will pretty much have to take companies at their word when they say such mortgage backed financial instruments are liquid and their stated fair value estimates are based on market prices most nonfinancial companies classify their mortgage backed securities investments as available for sale meaning they arent required to record changes in fair value on the income statement which is followed closely by investors and analysts instead changes in fair value of such securities are recorded on the balance sheet in "other comprehensive income " which affects shareholders equity but is less of a focus for wall street those disclosures will begin to change next year when a new accounting rule kicks in for u s companies this rule which will first be required of companies with financial years beginning after nov calls for companies to provide more information about financial instruments for which they apply fair or market values for investors like mr diecidue the rule cant come soon enough "the current market volatility in connection with these asset backed securities presents a conundrum to the investors because its harder to know the true book value of a company " he says referring to the measure of a companys assets minus its liabilities david reilly contributed to this article
