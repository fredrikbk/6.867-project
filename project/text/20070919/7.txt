animal warehouse park builds horde of exotic treasures tusks skins are stockpiled on south african reserve critics fear elephant cull skukuza south africa in one corner of a nondescript building here in the kruger national park sits a foot high pile of lion skins a few feet away theres a stack of elephant feet with savanna dust caked into the parched skin nearby there are rows of yellowing ivory tusks kept under heavy guard lest they be snatched away by traders in illegal ivory like many wildlife areas in africa and many hunters the world over kruger officials believe no good animal part should go to waste so on the demise of one of the parks exotic animals elephants lions kudus and black backed jackals to name a few workers often gather up what the vultures and hyenas dont get to first and haul it back to this macabre mammal mausoleum the warehouse serves as an important but little known connection between africas hot and dusty plains and the many collectors and designers throughout the world who need impala skulls or other unusual animal treasures for furniture or accessories sidestepping a stack of elephant ears during a recent tour kruger officials pointed out for instance that the bristles from elephant or lion tails can be made into bracelets buffalo hides are good for upholstering cars zebra skins are great for handbags pillows and rugs giraffe bones are used in the grips of some handguns when they have sufficient stock to warrant a sale park officials place ads in south african newspapers and hold an auction interested buyers from around the world submit offers by mail or phone some animal rights advocates contend that these types of sales stoke the market for exotic animal parts which in turn encourages poachers to hunt more animals the park doesnt make a killing by any means at its most recent sale last year kruger raised only about &# but the money makes a handy contribution to the parks conservation programs craig ballard who runs a pensacola fla internet retailer called african game industries says he scored tons of buffalo hides from kruger a couple of years ago paying roughly four to five south african rand or about cents per kilogram his web site now offers buffalo skin shotgun bags for &# along with zebra skin coasters &# wart hog tusk bottle openers &# and zebra footrests &# such items are "not everybodys taste " mr ballard says even so "there are hundreds of people competing" for materials and not many good sources of supply thats where places like kruger in eastern south africa come in it is reputed to have some of africas best variety of wild game including cheetahs leopards giraffes impalas and servals a kind of cat that captures its prey with curved leaping pounces it is one of the most popular safari destinations in all of africa animals in this national park are dying all the time sometimes at the hands of poachers and sometimes at the hands of park officials who put down unruly beasts that cause trouble when animals die naturally kruger workers often leave them to scavengers but sometimes especially when park officials are on the scene theyre able to gather up the valuable bits employees soak the skins and deposit them along with other items in the kruger warehouse an earth toned building with two large high ceilinged rooms and a higher security storage vault in the back once inside the animal parts are separated into piles rhinoceros horns are tossed into a black storage basket skins ears and feet are stowed neatly on wooden pallets behind signs that read "elephant feet" or "lion " brown tails hang from a mound of buffalo skins not everything is for sale the warehouses other chief function is to keep the most sensitive pieces under close guard partly in anticipation of the day when international agreements restricting animal trade may be relaxed that applies for instance to some rare leopard pelts but most of all it applies to ivory in world governments agreed to ban international ivory transactions because the sales encouraged poachers to kill elephants for their tusks since then krugers elephant population has shot up to about and tusks lately have been stacking up at the rate of three or more tons a year racks built to hold the ivory trove recently collapsed under all the weight the warehouse has about tons of tusks potentially worth millions of dollars if they were put on the open market much of the ivory is stored in a restricted access vault at the back of the building behind a inch thick metal door the ivory is accessible only with two guards who carry separate keys both of which are needed to enter one day recently ivory pieces were spread across the concrete floor of an adjacent storage room as new racks were being built the tusks which numbered in the thousands looked like giant curved cigarettes stacked three feet deep in every direction the vaults staff dutifully grades each piece for quality in accordance with international ivory control regulations some pieces are so old that they look like petrified wood others are new smooth and clean the officials painstaking work is likely to be rewarded before long south africa and surrounding countries lobbied for years to loosen the ivory ban so they can sell down their stockpiles in june the convention on international trade in endangered species which governs such sales approved a one time mass sale to be held at an unspecified time to be followed by a moratorium lasting nine years under the cites agreement kruger can sell tons most likely to buyers in japan which had to prove to international authorities that its practices do not promote poaching ivory is prized in japan for making hanko or personalized signature seals used to stamp official documents many outraged animal rights advocates have called on kruger and others to burn their ivory but "we think that would be bad " says raymond travers a kruger spokesman the ivory "has enormous value and wouldnt it be nice if that value could be used " park officials are also thinking about what to do with their nearby elephant abattoir which needs to be upgraded to make sure its in good working order after years of mostly lying dormant built in the s the slaughterhouse was designed to deal with the mess from elephant culls which were common at the time the building located a few minutes drive from the animal stockpile has powerful winches for lifting elephant carcasses so the giant animals can be carved into smaller parts the facility also includes a cannery where elephant meat can be mixed with broths and spices as well as a smokehouse for making elephant jerky south africa imposed a moratorium on the culls in the mid s amid complaints from activists south africas department of environmental affairs and tourism is thinking of restarting the culls to help manage the countrys growing elephant populations elephants can cause extensive environmental damage when their numbers surpass an areas ability to sustain them yet public opposition remains fierce and its unclear whether the culls will ever occur kruger officials say they prefer not to take sides on the propriety of creating a market for animal parts the manager of the stockpile and abattoir whose name has been withheld at the request of kruger officials who fear she could become a target of ivory thieves says shes happy to sell feet tails and horns "as long as it doesnt increase poaching " miho inada contributed to this article
