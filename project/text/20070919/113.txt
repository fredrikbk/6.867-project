subways get going at wal mart wal mart stores inc is losing its taste for burgers and fries subway the fast food chain that likes to promote its sandwiches as a healthy alternative to traditional fried and grilled fare began doing business with the worlds largest retailer only three years ago but from a lone restaurant inside a wal mart in ozark ala subway has quickly overtaken mcdonalds corp as wal marts primary fast food concessionaire across the u s at one time mcdonalds was the exclusive in store restaurateur for wal mart but now subway a unit of closely held doctors associates inc of milford conn is in wal marts compared with mcdonalds so far this year subway has opened wal mart locations in the u s more than three times mcdonalds in some ways subways rapid rise at wal mart isnt surprising the sandwich chain has been expanding at a torrid clip world wide while mcdonalds has been reining in growth focusing on boosting sales and returns at existing locations also a restaurant inside a wal mart cant operate a drive through window thats a big drawback for the hamburger giant which does about half its business with motorists another major factor however may be whats on the menu wal marts embrace of subway comes as it battles an image as a ruthless corporate giant with stingy wages and benefits for employees looking to portray itself as a good citizen wal mart has been tackling greenhouse gases and wasteful packaging pitching the virtues of "sustainability " it also has been emphasizing healthier foods at its stores including organics as it struggles to cap rising health care costs wal mart has singled out employee diets as a concern andy ruben wal marts vice president for corporate strategy and sustainability suggested this spring that "eating healthy meals instead of fast food" might be a good start an internal memo leaked to the media in revealed that the retailer was looking for ways to cut its health care costs without damaging its reputation it noted that rates of obesity related heart disease and diabetes were growing faster among its employees than the public among its recommendations were discouraging unhealthy people from working at wal mart and requiring all jobs to include some physical activity such as cashiers gathering shopping carts in parking lots the memo sparked an uproar and wal mart retreated on the shopping cart idea but it has since launched what it calls "personal sustainability projects" for employees to take better care of their bodies and the environment more than of wal marts million u s employees are participating in the fast growing program organized by san francisco based act now productions in addition to recycling more and cutting energy use workers this year have been resolving to get more exercise and eat better subway franchisee maurice novak thinks he is a beneficiary of the program six months ago he was invited by wal mart to replace a mcdonalds inside a store in great falls mont after the hamburger chain let its lease expire mcdonalds cited disappointing sales but mr novak thinks there were other factors at work too "theyre trying to push healthier lifestyles they have a green initiative a sustainability initiative " mr novak says of wal mart "it made sense to get a subway in there the management is thrilled to have us " as it opens new stores wal mart hands out lists of prospective locations to both mcdonalds and subway but the sites on the lists dont overlap and the two brands arent allowed to bid against each other for a specific location wal mart executives declined to be interviewed for this article but a spokeswoman said in an e mail that wal mart picks its in store restaurant vendors to "align with the customer needs in each market matching customer tastes and preferences with the right restaurant partner " elizabeth rolfe director of new business development for subway contends that one reason the chain is sought out by wal mart is that "theyre looking for the healthy alternative " she also noted that unlike mcdonalds subway outlets have "no cooking no frying " mcdonalds rejects the suggestion that it is trailing subway in the wal mart race because of its food while mcdonalds does occasionally choose to exit less profitable wal mart locations it gets "the lions share of what we ask for" when it comes to leases with wal mart says bill lowery a mcdonalds vice president in charge of business with the retailer "as far as food service inside wal mart we are still their best bet from an economic and any other standpoint " mr lowery says adding he is unaware of any situation in which the retailer had asked mcdonalds to vacate a store in favor of a rival concessionaire while the average full size standalone mcdonalds grosses about &# million a year the company says its wal mart restaurants average just &# annually subway doesnt disclose its sales but technomic inc a chicago based restaurant industry consultant estimates that the typical subway unit grosses around &# a year industry sources say it makes little difference to a subways sales whether it is inside a wal mart or not "a subway can make it on fewer dollars " says dennis lombardi of wd partners a dublin ohio based retail and restaurants development firm by the same token a mcdonalds franchisee may calculate that the investment return from a full size store is much greater than that from a wal mart satellite unit subway which has more than u s stores versus about for mcdonalds enjoys an advantage in that its operation can fit into a smaller space than a standard mcdonalds subways employ relatively small ovens to bake bread they dont use fryers and grills which require costly ventilation systems and hog more energy both chains have master leases with wal mart allowing them to be in a store for years while neither restaurateur will discuss contract terms "our rent is based on our sales " says subways ms rolfe mr novak the montana subway franchisee who has two other stores in great falls says that so far his wal mart location is performing well "equal to my busiest store " he appreciates the fact that he doesnt have to maintain restrooms and that security isnt an issue since wal mart takes care of that and while he says he has received compliments from many customers not everyone feels that way occasionally would be patrons will order french fries when told that subway doesnt serve them mr novak says that some "turn around and walk out "
