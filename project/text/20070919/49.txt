fed cut aims to contain damage stocks soar as bernanke tackles credit crunch with half point move federal reserve chairman ben bernanke moved aggressively to stop the spreading credit crunch from sinking the nations economy with a surprising half percentage point cut in interest rates casting aside for now worries about appearing to bail out investors the cut which exceeded the quarter point reduction most economists had expected signals that mr bernanke fearing broad damage from the market turmoil that erupted a month ago preferred to risk doing too much rather than too little the move came amid a sizable drop in home sales construction and prices that could send mortgage defaults higher and damp consumer spending with yesterdays move mr bernanke may have shown himself closer in style and tactics to predecessor alan greenspan than some market watchers had suspected that carries risks critics may start referring to the "bernanke put " as they once spoke of the "greenspan put" under the former fed chairman a put option protects its holder from a loss on an investment yet mr bernanke has shown that giving the impression he might be shielding investors matters less than keeping the economy out of recession thats how mr greenspan interpreted the feds action "the question they had to weigh was was punishing those speculators more important than doing something that they perceived to be in the greater good " he said in an interview yesterday with fox news channels neil cavuto the fed cut its target for the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks to from it also cut its discount rate charged on direct loans to banks by the same amount to the cuts sparked a rally on wall street the dow jones industrial average up just points before the decision was announced soared points or to its biggest percentage gain since but in a sign some investors fear that the cut could also foster inflationary pressures the dollar fell sharply long term treasury bond yields rose and oil prices also jumped crude oil futures surged cents a barrel to &# a second consecutive record on the new york mercantile exchange but still well short of the inflation adjusted high of &# hit in april in a break from the past the fed did not say whether higher inflation or weaker growth was its greatest worry or whether those worries were equal it thus gave no hint about what its next move would be "some inflation risks remain " it said but "developments in financial markets have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook " markets put high odds on a quarter point cut at the feds next meeting on oct the half point cut put an exclamation point on a drama that began more than a month ago at its last meeting aug the fed left the federal funds rate its main target for short term interest rates at and signaled continued worries about inflation days later credit market concerns erupted in europe over losses in bank linked hedge funds and off balance sheet investment vehicles that had purchased u s subprime mortgages in the following weeks investors and lenders became increasingly suspicious of each other and unwilling to lend driving up interest rates for all sorts of borrowers on wall street cries soon rose for the fed to cut rates immediately instead the fed on aug cut its discount rate by half a percentage point and eased terms on direct loans from its discount window in hopes banks would use the feds cash to restore liquidity to credit markets the aim fed officials said at the time was to make a distinction between the feds role of keeping the financial system functioning normally and its responsibility for economic stability by contrast mr greenspan tended to treat financial stability and economic stability as inextricably linked and saw a rate cut as the best way both to restore investor confidence and cushion the economy his critics say those cuts over time emboldened investors to take on ever more debt and drive asset prices first stocks then houses to ever loftier levels making the ultimate correction more painful that criticism has intensified both with the turmoil in housing and the recent release of mr greenspans memoir mr bernanke heard that criticism but ultimately has shown himself of much the same mind as mr greenspan the fed cant take responsibility for asset prices only for growth and inflation "economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year but the tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally " the fed said in a statement accompanying yesterdays decision "todays action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets " fed officials had been leaning toward a rate cut in recent weeks but the case for the larger move may have been sealed by a report two weeks ago revealing that employment declined in august for the first time in four years that showed the economy had slowed markedly even before the full force of the market turmoil had been felt as recently as july fed officials had expected the economy to grow around this year while the fed has lowered that forecast the size of its rate cut was motivated more by the wide range of possibilities around that new forecast due to the still unknown reaction of business and households to tighter credit markets the larger than expected cut represents insurance against more catastrophic scenarios the market turmoil is likely to hit housing first and hardest investors have grown wary of holding loans from all but the safest borrowers that has led to a sharp jump in rates on "jumbo" mortgages those above &# which cant be sold to federally chartered mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac the ranks of home buyers have thinned especially in high priced markets and borrowers with shaky credit have difficulty finding a mortgage at any rate the lack of buyers will likely drag down sales make it even harder for home builders to trim bloated inventories and force them to drop prices further john makin a scholar at the american enterprise institute said even with the rate cut the economy will probably shrink in the fourth quarter of the year though by less than if the fed hadnt acted "if the economy continues to weaken credit conditions will weaken again because of falling housing prices youve got to break that cycle where you have bad credit bad economy bad credit bad economy theyre taking a first step to break that cycle " david seiders chief economist at the national association of home builders said even though treasury bond yields the main determinant of mortgage rates rose slightly yesterday the rate cut might boost credit market confidence and lead to a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and treasury yields allowing mortgage rates to fall several banks announced they were cutting their prime rates the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans to from it was only a month ago the fed declared it was still more worried about higher inflation than weaker growth those concerns havent entirely ebbed yesterday the fed said that while underlying inflation had "improved modestly this year some inflation risks remain " allan meltzer a fed historian at carnegie mellon university said the cut was a mistake reminiscent of the s and s when the fed put more emphasis on unemployment and less on inflation in its actions that caused inflation to ratchet higher over the years until fed chairman paul volcker brought it down again "whats the market saying " mr meltzer said "that this is an expansive move that will bail out the economy " he added "i never believed in the greenspan put but the market believes it and now it will certainly believe there will be a bernanke put " some fed officials may have shared similar concerns either about inflation or about the risk of stoking further speculation only seven of the feds reserve banks requested the half point cut in the discount rate four of the five absent banks are headed by presidents who have raised such concerns none of the four however have a vote on the feds policy making federal open market committee this year and that may be why the vote to cut the federal funds rate was unanimous
