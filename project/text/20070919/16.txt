business bookshelf happiness in the daily grind how starbucks saved my life by michael gates gill gotham books pages &# it could be the plot of an uplifting movie starring say tom hanks the fortunes of a man from a privileged background take a sharp downward turn when he loses a high powered corporate position and destroys his marriage in middle age unemployed and unhappy he has a chance encounter with a young black manager at a coffee bar and a job offer follows the result our hero now in his s finds happiness while toiling at a starbucks with people far younger than himself in fact mr hanks is slated to star in the screen version of "how starbucks saved my life " but the story is not the caffeine fueled invention of a hollywood screenwriter it was actually lived by michael gates gill whose memoir is largely a chronicle of his year working at a starbucks on west rd street and broadway in manhattan but we also learn in evocative flashbacks that mr gill spent his childhood as the loved but achingly lonely son of brendan gill the bon vivant and longtime staff writer at the new yorker the contrast between michael gills upper crust background and his current circumstances is striking of course but it is his own errors and hard won life lessons that give his story a bittersweet piquancy and save it from self pity or self congratulation at yale mr gill was inducted into skull &amp bones a fellow member of that secret society used his pull to get his friend michael a much coveted slot in the training program at the j walter thompson ad agency over the next decades at jwt mr gill put in long hours winning promotions and handling major accounts he married and had four children too but he tells us with regret his career always came first then the agency was acquired by a man with his eye on the bottom line mr gill a creative director was now in his s and earning four times the salary of his juniors one day he was summoned to breakfast off the premises not a good sign and was fired by a woman he had once mentored she then walked out of the restaurant sticking mr gill with the check suddenly his path in life is no longer smooth his new consulting business dwindles to nothing he drifts into an affair with a woman in her mid s she becomes pregnant when the child is born mr gill feels that he has to tell his wife who ends their marriage as for his lover she quickly tires of mr gill and so a decade after that jwt firing mr gill finds himself a divorced nearly broke uninsured year old father of five he is then diagnosed with a brain tumor that while not life threatening robs him of some hearing in one ear thats when mr gill has the lucky accident that opens the book on a rainy march day he is feeling sorry for himself and wants to "recapture some sense of the favored place i had once occupied in the universe " so he revisits the upper east side block where he had lived as a child and he stops at a starbucks he doesnt notice the sign announcing a regional hiring open house so he is startled when the young woman in a starbucks uniform seated at the next table asks "would you like a job " dressed in a brooks brothers suit and feeling every bit the unemployed executive mr gill is stunned by the question and he figures out later crystal his future boss at a branch across town is less than serious but "i could not think of a polite lie or any answer but the truth " when he finds out about starbucks generous health benefits he sweats out the weeks before he receives her job offer the next year proves a revelation for mr gill who as a loyal customer turned devoted employee learns just what effort it takes to make a starbucks run and run smoothly never a math whiz mr gill is so fearful of the cash register and of keeping those complicated orders straight that he becomes a crackerjack cleaner "i wanted to win crystals respect " he recalls so he attacked his cleaning job with "manic energy " even his co workers are impressed "i guess they hadnt expected this old white guy to enjoy digging out grout so much " it is a pretty sure bet that mr gill is one of the few starbucks employees who in an earlier life had once reached for a cucumber sandwich a little too eagerly in the presence of queen elizabeth or who threw apples at ezra pound mr gill infuses his narrative with such memories often to make an analogy or illustrate a point but when he dons the starbucks uniform he becomes just plain "mike " a name no one had called him before and he repeats to himself the mantra "less past more future " he commutes from his small apartment in bronxville n y via metro north and two packed subway trains hours each way he lugs bags of garbage up a basement staircase and out to the curb then in a plot twist worthy of hollywood this former master of the universe finds a role in the store that he seems born to play that of a starbucks coffee master describing the beans at seminars and serving samples and treats to curious customers naturally he still has to clean the place and ring up sales too he tells us that respect and dignity are a crucial part of the starbucks creed in a way they never were in the hard driving world of jwt crystal tolerates no cursing or street talk from her mostly african american staff starbucks "partners" that is its workers are never told to do things they are asked politely "i could be sincere at starbucks " mr gill writes "because i was finally in a work environment that valued those precious moments of truly human interaction " he wonders why every company cant function as starbucks does and then answers his own question at least in part because "it cost money " he notes that starbucks makes an expensive investment in its employees offering a benefits package that includes not only health insurance but also educational assistance and even stock the store becomes a high pressure refuge for mr gill he warms to the regular customers or "guests" and to all but one of his co workers a college graduate with a drill sergeant manner who thinks the job is beneath her and who moves on to the marines with not enough time in the workday to dwell on what he has lost mr gill gains a larger serving of happiness than he ever could have imagined mr gill suspects that his parents who had died before his starbucks employment began would not have been pleased with his new life as a working stiff in a baseball cap and apron but surely brendan gill would have appreciated a tale well told in the best tradition of the new yorker "how starbucks saved my life" is one great
