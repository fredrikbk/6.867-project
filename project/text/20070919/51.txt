goldman vows to do better changes in store for global alpha fund the managers of goldman sachs group inc s flagship global alpha hedge fund broke their silence after a disastrous august with a letter to investors that promised changes in the way the fund operates but contrary to the expectations of some goldman wont close the fund or inject any of its own money as it did with a smaller fund weeks ago instead the letter promises to better handle borrowing and volatility to shrink the size of the fund and to "adjust our process " goldman marketed alpha as its flagship wealth management product for its best clients which included asian tycoons rich families at home and goldman partners the fund is now valued at &# billion last year the fund had about &# billion under management investors who have seen the fund drop this year after falling last year arent likely to be pacified in august alone the fund dropped a stinging blow for a fund that is invested in an array of assets including stocks bonds currencies and commodities all over the world a goldman spokeswoman declined to comment the letter which went out last night over the names of mark carhart and ray iwanowski the funds once highflying managers referred to the widespread dislocations across capital markets in recent weeks the letter said the fund would constrain its borrowing in the future one of the factors that led to the problems last month and consider the level of borrowing as a separate risk factor the letter also said that as a result of recent volatility the fund would adjust positions more rapidly "our intent is to move aggressively to limit the size of the fund and to increase our agility in times of market stress " the letter added the letter which didnt offer any apologies for the losses defended the quantitative approach that has proved so disastrous over the past year the quantitative approach which uses computers to drive many investments "remains attractive " that approach has been especially problematic for numerous funds that used similar computer equations to put on the same stock market trades many of those investors were hurt when they were forced to sell at the same time the letter conceded that there was more money invested through quant strategies across the market than the managers realized but it said global alpha would benefit from troubles that have driven other quant funds out of business or to change their strategies the performance of the fund is a blow to goldmans reputation as a smart trader and risk manager
