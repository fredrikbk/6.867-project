board chairman and chief executive of the largest bank in the netherlands abn amro holding nv alleged they were doing a "terrible" job for shareholders it demanded that the bank be broken up or sold behind tci is one of the hedge fund worlds most combative financiers christopher hohn of london the year old son of a jamaican car mechanic mr hohn is part of a network of hedge funds that have swooped down several times on companies and insisted on change executives at some of the targeted companies have complained that the funds push close to the boundaries of securities laws requiring investors to disclose it when they work together one german chief executive having been shot down in one of mr hohns sorties wrote a book about the experience titled "invasion of the locusts" and called the hedge fund bosss style "poison " tci says it has followed the law in each case and acted independently of the funds to which it has ties mr hohn relishes the fights a family new years card in described his "exceptionally exciting year overthrowing german ceos " the &# billion bidding war over abn amro is the biggest example yet of mr hohn sparking change a bevy of other london funds some with ties to tci joined his campaign after a furious battle among europes leading banks a consortium led by royal bank of scotland group plc is in the drivers seat to acquire the dutch bank abn amros shareholders meet tomorrow to discuss the consortiums offer and a lower bid by britains barclays plc hedge funds often hunt in packs in a typical case several of them have independently acquired shares of a company perceived as undervalued waiting for the right moment to push for a sale once one fund jumps in with a public demand the rest follow that much is legally innocuous the controversy arises when the attackers have connections among themselves in some circumstances laws require the ties to be disclosed and the group must follow rules that apply to any single shareholder including disclosure of stakes above a certain size the theory is that the target company and the public are entitled to know when investors acting together own a big stake national laws differ on the details in the netherlands the relevant jurisdiction in the abn amro case shareholders neednt disclose cooperation unless they have a formal agreement dutch lawyers say elsewhere in europe the requirement may kick in if funds have common directors or hold stakes in each other in the u s a group is loosely defined as having an agreement or profit sharing arrangement among other factors lawyers say hedge funds are finding plenty of targets in europe some targets are sprawling corporations with units that can be broken off and sold others are old line underperforming businesses that formerly didnt face activist shareholders as debt market troubles make buyouts more difficult some expect hedge funds to step up their push for internal change at companies mr hohn is particularly feared a blackberry devotee he reads and sends email messages to executives late into the night and into the next morning executives whose companies he has targeted talk of his calling them at all hours in meetings mr hohn sometimes asks the same question repeatedly people who have been present say his style was on display in september when he met with executives of euronext then an independent company operating stock exchanges in paris and other european cities mr hohn said euronext shareholders deserved the chance to vote on two potential merger partners the new york stock exchange and deutsche boerse ag mr hohn whose hedge fund owned about of euronext favored a merger with the german exchange while euronext chief executive jean francois theodore wanted a deal with the nyse the meeting at mr hohns headquarters soon turned contentious as mr hohn began lecturing euronext about shareholders rights "im going to make sure that shareholders have a choice " mr hohn said repeatedly mr hohn added another jab alleging that mr theodore wanted a deal with americans so he could get an american style pay package the urbane frenchmans expression turned icy "that is a very serious allegation " he said according to a person familiar with the exchange mr hohn didnt raise it again euronext declined to comment as did mr theodore through a spokeswoman mr hohn gave up the fight late last year after nyses share price rose making its share based offer more valuable and deutsche boerse dropped out in june euronext and nyse agreed to combine in a &# billion deal tcis other campaigns have had mixed success the hedge fund drove mittal steel co the worlds largest steel maker by output to pay &# billion more than it planned to shareholders of the brazilian unit of a company mittal had agreed to take over in june but this year tci lost a public fight to force electric power development co of japan to pay a big dividend as the former government owned company marshaled support from establishment shareholders overall mr hohns approach has paid off for his investors through august tci had risen this year according to a person who has seen the results compared with a gain on the hfri fund weighted composite index a broad industry measure of hedge fund performance last year tci posted a return of about compared with for the hfri index its assets total about &# billion mr hohn grew up in surrey england at private equity firm apax partners colleagues spotted his ambition "it became obvious he wanted to leave when he published his cv by accident on the central server instead of his private pc " says jon moulton mr hohns boss at the time who now works at another private equity firm after seven years at hedge fund perry capital mr hohn left to run his own fund tci opened for business in january backed by investors including yale universitys endowment a few months after tci opened mr hohn began aiding allies in the business he helped edoardo mercadante a former asset manager at merrill lynch &amp co start a hedge fund called parvus asset management uk llp mr mercadante says he gave tci a minority stake in parvus in return for investor introductions and back office support tcis two co heads of business management have served in similar roles for parvus tci has an stake in parvus according to tci filings to u k authorities earlier this year its not uncommon for a hedge fund to lend its infrastructure to a newcomer in exchange for some kind of remuneration such as a stake in the newcomer tci and two funds it assists parvus and another fund called algebris investments say they maintain complete autonomy in making investment decisions they "do not have access to each others portfolio positions or trading activity " tci said in a statement mr hohn has also tapped an influential acquaintance lord jacob rothschild a london businessman from the famed european banking dynasty lord rothschilds investment company or his family have put money into both parvus and tci lord rothschild calls mr hohn a "harsh and brilliant critic " he says "we heard about parvus through tci we have him to thank for that " in january mr hohn started his first big public fight trying to force deutsche boerse to drop its &# billion offer to buy london stock exchange plc mr hohn thought deutsche boerse was overpaying by the end of february tci had acquired at least a stake in deutsche boerse following the tci move a new york hedge fund in which lord rothschilds son is a partner chimed in with its own public protests around the same time lord rothschilds fund of which mr hohn was later named a director acquired a stake of about gbp million or about &# million in deutsche boerse according to that funds annual report a spokesman for the sons fund called atticus said in an emailed statement that the fund makes "independent investment decisions " lord rothschild says his fund acted independently of both atticus and tci the pressure worked after months of trying to fend off the hedge fund campaigns deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert withdrew his offer mr hohn wasnt finished next he called for mr seifert to resign mr hohn and lord rothschild went to frankfurt to meet with mr seifert and deutsche boerse chairman rolf breuer in april mr hohn also took parvuss mr mercadante to at least one meeting with mr seifert a month later mr seifert threw in the towel and announced he was quitting mr seifert bitterly recounted the events in a book of which he was co author with a german professor the title "invasion of the locusts intrigues power struggles and market manipulation " recalling one conversation with mr hohn mr seifert wrote "hohn claimed that he together with his allies had control of between and of deutsche boerses capital and began to read out a long list of owners at the end he boasted my position is so strong that we can bring mickey mouse and donald duck onto the supervisory board " "his rules of the game are poison for an open and fair market " mr seifert wrote a subsequent investigation into hedge fund trading of deutsche b&amp ouml rse by german markets regulator bafin found there was insufficient evidence to ask prosecutors to bring charges bafin didnt disclose which hedge funds it was investigating but an official says tci was among them mr hohn said at the time "we have not acted in concert with other shareholders according to the law " mr hohn was riding high in january a hohn family holiday card recounted the achievements of the four hohn children their mother and the paterfamilias "chris has had an exceptionally exciting year overthrowing german ceos and expanding his investment conquests to china and brazil " the hohns wrote the holiday greeting noted that "chris and his teams investment performance" was " this past year and over return over the last two years " mr hohn met his american born wife jamie cooper hohn at harvard he attended the business school there and she went to the kennedy school of government formerly an employee at nonprofits in new york and washington she now runs the charity funded by tci called the childrens investment fund foundation it has given grants to former president clintons foundation and aids support groups in kenya and india tci charges investors a fee on average of of assets under management plus to of profits of the management fee a third goes to the charity if net return exceeds investors must pay an additional of assets to be directed to the charity in the year ending august the foundation received about &# million from tci and other sources according to its u k filings the money has flooded in so quickly that the foundation says it is unable to give most of it out yet last year its grants totaled about &# million a spokeswoman said the figure is projected to rise to about &# million next year the hohns have said they approach the charities they fund with the same exacting method mr hohn brings to investments the foundation employs "portfolio managers" to oversee its donations and track progress through numerical results mr hohn is hoping to reap another windfall in his campaign at abn but he faces a reprise of the questions about his tactics at an initial meeting this january with abn chief executive rijkman groenink mr hohn brought along davide serra who manages algebris investments tci has a minority stake in algebris and the two funds have offices on adjacent floors of the same mayfair building mr groenink says he figured the two funds had a relationship "otherwise why then would these two hedge funds together ask for an appointment " he asks "i understood that indeed mr serra had been doing all the analysis on abn " in addition lord rothschilds fund acquired an undisclosed number of abn shares between feb and may a spokesman for the fund says lord rothschild didnt discuss the purchases with mr hohn on april abn announced it had agreed to sell itself to barclays for about &# billion in stock while breaking off an american banking unit for a separate sale mr hohn was upset he favored a higher potential bid from the consortium of european banks which wanted to keep the u s unit a few days later at abns annual meeting algebriss mr serra asked mr groenink why abn shareholders werent being given the chance to vote on the offers before answering mr groenink said "mr serra is related or linked to tci for those of you in the audience who dont know that " mr hohn wasnt in the audience but his lawyer was frank peters took a microphone from a person sitting nearby mr serra "doesnt work for tci he is not representing tci " said the lawyer mr groenink had another reason to feel troubled by the hedge funds circling the bank people familiar with the situation say abns board became concerned that someone was leaking information to algebriss mr serra a person familiar with the matter says in april the european bank consortium sent a letter to abn expressing its intention to bid for the bank that same day mr serra telephoned a person close to abn to inquire how the bank would respond to the bid according to people briefed on the conversation abn directors and executives hadnt yet received the consortiums letter and didnt know about the approach mr serra said he didnt make such a phone call and declined to comment further on alleged leaks an abn spokesman declined to comment in late april abns chairman arthur martinez informed the board that the u s department of justice would be looking into allegations about an abn executive as part of its previously disclosed investigation into abns handling of money transfers from countries under u s sanctions mr serra called a person close to abn and said he was aware of the new twist in the probe according to people briefed on the conversation mr serra declined to comment on this reported call mr martinez and an abn spokesman declined to comment about any possible leaks mr hohns quest for fresh investment targets continues in recent months tci has bought about &# million worth of stock in railroad operator csx corp atticus the hedge fund of lord rothschilds son owned million csx shares in march according to a u s securities filing then a holding worth about &# million now an atticus spokesman reiterated that the fund makes its decisions independently and noted that atticus owns shares in three other major u s rail companies a spokeswoman for csx said company executives have met with tci multiple times in recent months mr hohn accuses the company of refusing to lay out a clear plan for improving performance a spokesman said the company has "the most aggressive financial targets in the industry "
