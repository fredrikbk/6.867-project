ken burns returns to war new york its one of the greatest stories of world war ii never told " after making critically acclaimed documentaries for more than two decades ken burns at age understands how to draw the attention even of those who think they know all they need to know about a topic on a recent visit to the wall street journals editorial page he was in top form "the story of joseph medicine crow " mr burns said "is something ive wanted to tell for years " the grandson of a scout for gen george armstrong custer mr crow fought his way across europe with the u s army after the defeat of nazi germany he returned to lodge grass mont started to tell tales from the battlefield and then learned that hed done what probably no crow would ever do again hed met all four criteria necessary to become a plains indian "war chief " mr burns counts those criteria off on his fingers touch a living enemy soldier disarm an enemy lead a successful war party and steal an enemys horse mr crow had managed the first three in part because he had run headlong into a german soldier as he rounded a corner in a small village in germany the collision knocked the germans weapon to the ground mr crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand to hand in the end mr crow got the best of the german grabbing him by the neck and choking him he was going to kill the german soldier on the spot when the man screamed out "momma " mr crow then let him go joseph medicine crows opportunity to make off with an enemys horse came along when a contingent of mounted german soldiers was positioned in front of mr crows unit in a daring night raid he slipped behind enemy lines quickly tied a bridle with a strand of rope mounted one of the horses and stampeded the others as he rode off he sang a traditional crow song mr crow now in his s is one of the more than four dozen people who tell their stories in "the war " a new hour documentary miniseries on world war ii directed and produced by mr burns and lynn novick it will debut on pbs next week but mr crow nearly missed having his story told in "the war" after the film was nearly done there were complaints that the documentary didnt include enough hispanics more of their stories were put in and given the opportunity to extend the film mr burns added mr crows as well mr burns is one of the most well known and influential documentary makers in american film history "the civil war " his hour epic released in remains the most viewed documentary in pbs history an estimated million people tuned in to watch at least one of its episodes for more than a quarter century mr burns has made more than a dozen other films his first s hourlong "brooklyn bridge " helped cement his reputation within pbs as a filmmaker who can make history accessible to a broad viewing public in the years that followed he made films on a wide variety of topics including the statue of liberty which focused on personal stories of immigration and assimilation and the american born art form of jazz throughout his career he had the goal of telling the story of the u s and its people "ive been making the same film" over and over he told me but his success has come at a personal price "the civil war" minted his reputation but spending years poring over individual tragic stories of the millions of people caught up in the bloody and protracted military conflict left him emotionally spent not long after "the civil war" came out mr burns and his wife amy stechler split up and mr burns vowed never to do a war film again he turned his attention to a documentary on baseball telling a reporter from the new york times "i will take pleasure in exposing the activities of men playing on the field rather than dying on it " mr burns spent the next decade creating films but resisting pressure to make a world war ii documentary in the summer before the devastating terrorist attacks on sept however something came across the transom that changed his mind the veterans administration estimated that world war ii veterans were dying every day "im in the memory business " he said while visiting the journal "when a veteran dies without his story being told thats like a library burning down " earlier this month mr burns phoned me from mobile ala and told me another reason he decided to make "the war " he feels a "huge pang of regret" for not asking his own father who died in october more about what the war generation had gone through "dad damn it come back and tell me more " he said some million americans served in uniform during world war ii more than would die in combat battles took place throughout the pacific north africa and europe and at home the large mobilization effort remade the u s "war towns" boomed just about overnight as the defense industry geared up to churn out the planes tanks and ships needed in our war against nazi germany and imperial japan its probably impossible to make a definitive documentary about an event that touched nearly everyone on the globe and "the war" doesnt attempt that feat instead it largely focuses on telling the stories of luverne minn mobile ala sacramento calif and waterbury conn those of the people who headed off to foreign battlefields and the vast majority who didnt "the war" devotes more than a quarter of its time to the home front where viewers will see mobile and sacramento expand so rapidly that there werent enough beds for all of the new residents flooding in to take defense jobs and where the waterbury mother of a dead soldier lets out a wail the whole neighborhood seems to hear "it gets to the idea that were emotional archaeologists " mr burns told me to make this film mr burns ms novick and dozens of others at florentine films the production company mr burns cofounded not long after graduating from college in interviewed hundreds of people who either lived through the war or had a direct connection to relatives who did the process mr burns and ms novick explain was organic in some cases they found people by placing ads in local newspapers many came to their attention through word of mouth and a few were locally well known so the producers sought them out the film makes clear that world war ii was a "necessary war" in which the u s was unquestionably on the right side but one that nonetheless came at a steep price and that price as in every bloody military conflict was paid in two ways families at home suffered from the loss of their loved ones and those on the front lines witnessed even meted out brutality they never would have imagined before the war for example one u s marine to the horror of his comrades robbed a wounded japanese soldier using a knife to pry loose his gold teeth asked about a line in the film that revealed this theme early on mr burns recited it from memory before it could be completely read to him "the second world war brought out the best and the worst in a generation and blurred the two so that they became at times almost indistinguishable " "the war" isnt aimed as a commentary on the global war on terror or the war in iraq production on it began before but mr burns told me that he thinks the timing is good "it agitates the questions about war" that should arise from viewing the reality that is armed human conflict mr miniter is assistant editor of opinionjournal
