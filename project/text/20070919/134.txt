toy makers make it hard to miss whats u s made the recent wave of recalls involving chinese made toys doesnt worry michael araten the president of knex building sets produces a large portion of his toys in the u s and now hes printing the labels to prove it with foreign supply chain problems continuing to wear away at the reputations of such toy makers as mattel inc and rc corp some domestic toy manufacturers are mounting marketing campaigns aimed at showcasing home grown goods to retailers and potential customers american flags have appeared on some corporate web sites companies are rushing to reissue toy packaging with patriotic colors and toys are being slapped with big labels that say made in the usa knex industries inc a family owned company that produces plastic construction sets in hatfield pa spent much of august redesigning its toys plastic packaging to promote the items american origins about a third of the companys goods for the year or roughly million units are involved the newly labeled items will hit retail shelves near the end of the month consumers are expected to be on the lookout for toys made in the u s and europe during the coming holiday season following four major toy recalls tied to dangerous lead paint in china "i have heard well educated high income parents say im not buying anything from china " says sean mcgowan an analyst with wedbush morgan securities inc who covers the toy industry while making good on such a vow is easier said than done roughly of the toys sold in the u s are produced in china mr mcgowan says he believes american toy makers are smart to tailor their advertising to beef up domestic credentials anna woodruff a year old mother from tucson ariz says that recent recalls have led her to go looking for u s and european made items but its actually her four year old daughter whos driving the purchases "shell say mommy you almost forgot to look at the label " says ms woodruff who adds that recently her daughter was worried about lead paint in a chinese made book the woodruffs response is exactly the kind of behavior u s toy manufacturers are hoping to target step co a maker of outdoor playsets and plastic kiddie furniture based in streetsboro ohio says nearly of its products are made at plants in ohio and georgia and it has already drafted a new version of its company web site to include a large american flag hyperlinked to a page that lists the companys u s made products the toys are being repackaged as well around of them are getting new stickers saying made in u s a "theyre overlabeled now " concedes brian kirkendall vice president of marketing at step but "were reacting to what our customers want " other companies attribute the demand to retailers "suddenly its becoming a real selling factor as they look at the package " says john gessert president of american plastic toys inc he adds that stores are pushing for even larger font sizes on the u s origin labels mr gessert has already whetted retailers appetites for domestic manufacturing by purchasing a line of new ads in the industry publications playthings magazine and the toy book that "accentuate that weve been made in the usa since " like many of its competitors the walled lake mich company opted this year to market its toys in new flag colored packaging new labels for toy cars which the company had planned to roll out at the beginning of have been moved up so theyll start appearing in november altogether this summer more than million toys were recalled while the majority of them had design flaws caused by toy makers a substantial portion of the problem involved the use of lead based paint that apparently resulted from corrupt manufacturing practices in china this month mattel recalled nearly toys from chinese manufacturers believed to contain lead in a letter released by congress yesterday mattel said some of the recalled toys contained nearly times the amount of lead permitted the u s consumer product safety commission bans paint with lead levels over parts per million or mattels noncompliant toys tested as high as or parts per million the letter said nevertheless wedbushs mr mcgowan warns that new "homemade" marketing while a smart move this holiday season could backfire in the long term many of the toy makers that still rely on u s factories often companies that make heavy plastic toys do so because chinese shipping costs are so high "if they could keep the cost down theyd move " he says adding that branding a company as a usa only toy maker may limit its overseas options down the line but knexs mr araten says the companys manufacturing future may be back in pennsylvania in any case the company which produces its toy parts domestically but sends many overseas to be packed into individual boxes plans to take the unusual step of bringing some of its foreign operations back to the u s for heavier toys mr araten expects lower transportation costs to offset the lower wages that have made countries like china a draw for manual labor producing toys close to home has an added benefit mr araten says "if im selling toys off the shelf faster we can make them and restock them even faster " when that happens he notes about of his toys will be completely american made and he plans to eventually market this to customers too meanwhile toy stores say theyre making sure customers looking for american made toys will know where to go retailer toys "r" us inc is ensuring that sales associates will be able to assist customers who are concerned about toys origins a spokeswoman says
