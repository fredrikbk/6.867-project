the daily fix baseball pennant races heat up as mets red sox keep sliding online edition with less than two weeks left in the regular season major league baseballs pennant races are starting to get interesting in the national league east the philadelphia phillies trailed the new york mets by seven games following a loss on sept to the colorado rockies clearly if the phillies were going to make the playoffs it would be by winning the wild card but then the phillies beat the rockies the next night flew to new york and swept the mets over the weekend now one week and one marathon inning victory over the st louis cardinals last night later the phillies have slashed the mets lead to one and a half games "with games remaining the phillies are in two races " writes jim salisbury in the philadelphia inquirer "they can thank themselves for that they put the mets into a funk by sweeping them at shea stadium over the weekend " the reason for the teams recent winning ways you ask "it has character next to offense the phils lead the national league in runs character is this teams best attribute " mr salisbury continues and as much as the phillies have surged the mets have stumbled losing five straight including two to the washington nationals "the mets arent just collapsing they are in a complete free fall a hard to believe harder to watch meltdown that threatens to make all the good feelings and all the positive karma accumulated across the past two years seem like a feeble fraudulent tease " writes the new york posts mike vaccaro the slide has some fans and members of the media questioning mets manager willie randolphs intensity mr randolph insists they are mistaken writes jack curry in the new york times "randolph is trying hard to emulate joe torre the yankees manager as a vision of tranquility " mr curry writes "he does not want his players to sense that he is panicking especially as they are sputtering randolph knows television cameras blanket him and he said he did not want to behave the way larry bowa used to as the boisterous manager of the philadelphia phillies " mr curry writes the mets arent the only team giving away a divisional title the boston red sox also the recent owners of a seven game division lead have seen it wilt to two and a half games causing visions of to dance in their fans heads eric gagne the reliever acquired from the texas rangers in a much ballyhooed deadline deal played a starring role in the red soxs loss to the toronto blue jays with the red sox clinging to a lead in the eighth mr gagne walked three batters forcing home the tying run and then gave up a two run double to pinch hitter russ adams as the boston globes amalie benjamin writes "it looked and felt like so many other moments in the second half of the season eric gagne sitting in front of his locker his head slightly bowed his uniform long gone replaced with a u s m c bulldog hoodie sweatshirt the crowd gathered around as gagne stood threw a towel on the floor turned and waited he knew the questions were coming and as has been the case since his arrival in boston he had no answers " despite the loss and the shrinking al east lead boston herald columnist tony massarotti tells red sox fans to relax and come back from the ledge this isnt after all theres a wild card nowadays "some of us thought red sox history changed forever in we thought the inferiority complex went out with the year drought the curse of the bambino and all the other nonsensical stupidities that unnecessarily burdened a franchise and its followers " mr massarotti writes "maybe we were wrong maybe red sox fans need something silly to worry about because they are unhappy unless they are miserable "lest there be any doubt the sox are in tune up mode with regard to the postseason for them at least the yankees are not as much of a concern as eric gagne daisuke matsuzaka or hideki okajima " the chicago cubs and milwaukee brewers seem set to take the national league central race right down to the wire with his team holding a one game lead over the brewers cubs manager lou pinella decided to pitch his two aces carlos zambrano and ted lilly on three days rest this week so far the gamble hasnt paid off as the cubs fell to the cincinnati reds writes the chicago sun timess chris de luca mr zambranos performance not to mention his sept meltdown against the los angeles dodgers has cubs general manger jim hendry anxious writes the sun timess rick telander "now hendry is fretting because zambrano needs to rise up and be the bell cow that brings the herd home " yet mr zambrano hardly resembled the ace he is supposed to be when the game started "far from looking inspired or strong as he insisted he was the big man looked confused and wild " mr telander adds in their battle with the brewers for the nl central the cubs are pulling a ruse writes the milwaukee journal sentinels michael hunt americans love to root for the underdog so why then in the race for the nl central are sentiments in the cubs favor "the milwaukee brewers are the classic david " mr hunt writes "one of the smallest markets in the majors down for a quarter century excruciatingly bad for most of that time with a battered rocky balboa mug to show for it " mr hunt writes "then there are the chicago cubs strip away the mythology and they are goliath massive market big payroll big name stars and free agents a marquee manager who earns more than the entire brewers plus homer infield combined " in the early morning hours yesterday the u s advanced to the quarterfinals of the womens world cup with victory over nigeria the victory and the teams advancement into the quarterfinals is in no small part due to the play of its back line of cat whitehill christine rampone stephanie lopez and kate markgraf they are dangerous on offense in fact ms whitehills throw in led to the u s s lone goal against nigeria but "the quartets main contribution is of course playing defense and theyve been outstanding the u s has conceded just two goals in the tournament one a gift from keeper hope solo the other a shot that was set up by a deflection " mark
