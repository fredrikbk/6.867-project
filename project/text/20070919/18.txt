business lack of salvage skills hurts home lenders to make an american mortgage executive wince just say "stockton " last month realtytrac com an online property marketplace cited the central california city as the nations foreclosure capital with foreclosure notices filed in its metropolitan area during the first half of this year one for every households a month backlog of stockton homes is for sale buyers are scarce prices are skidding thats bad news for the mortgage industry which could use some pointers on coping with adversity some shakeout in the housing market was inevitable but as defaults and foreclosures mount nationwide there are signs home lenders are responding in ways that arent making the rout any easier on themselves for the past years the mortgage industry has focused mostly on developing better ways to make sell off and service home loans those "front end" efforts have fueled tremendous growth all the while the industry has largely neglected the "back end " the grim but vital task of salvaging loans that go sour jerry abbott sees the consequences of that neglect every day his stockton real estate brokerage seeks buyers for foreclosed homes many of his sales are at a to discount to already weak market prices legal costs associated with foreclosure eat up more of the proceeds lenders take a big hit but at least they recover something to mr abbotts chagrin many lenders dont grasp the futility of holding out for boom time prices in a collapsing market lenders trying to sell a foreclosed home for &# often dont react pragmatically by cutting a deal when a bidder offers &# instead they might counter with a token and potentially insulting price reduction of &# in such situations mr abbott says homes dont sell for ages and when they do they fetch far lower prices its easy to see why lenders havent spent the past decade fine tuning their problem loan strategies in boom times default rates are tiny dicey loans can look prudent even the occasional foreclosure isnt too bad christopher cagan head of a real estate research group owned by first american corp found last year that when foreclosed properties account for or less of total sales in a local market the foreclosed homes sell at very close to prevailing market prices once hard times arrive however troubles multiply when foreclosures account for a tenth or more of total sales those homes sell at discounts of or more to prevailing prices mr cagan found buyers turn skittish sellers panic the allure of owning a single fix er upper is replaced by dismay about a blighted neighborhood to steer through a period of high defaults lenders need to maximize recoveries handle transactions in an efficient orderly way and recruit new buyers into what may be a stigmatized market thats not as much fun as booking double digit growth but their long term success depends as much on bear market savvy as it does on bull market enthusiasm right now mortgage lenders arent handling any of these tasks with great flair the general practice is to sell foreclosed properties quickly in "as is" condition rather than fixing them up and waiting for an upturn financial analysts hate to see foreclosed property euphemistically known as "real estate owned" on lenders balance sheets so especially near year end lenders may dump foreclosed holdings on any terms they can get in some markets there isnt much choice kal mughrabi a real estate broker in springboro ohio specializes in foreclosed sales at an average of &# per home at those prices he says repairs and cosmetic upgrades are for the next owner "youre better off just doing a cleanup and selling it " mr mughrabi says "if the carpet is awful tear it out and sell it uncarpeted " a separate headache stems from the way mortgages increasingly are packaged into complex securities and offered for sale to investors that has been great for investors but it often means there isnt any dominant owner of a mortgage to call the shots if a loan goes into default "paralysis can set in" when tough decisions need to be made says fred cannon a mortgage company analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods the most common problem deciding what to do when a bargain seeking bidder wants to buy a foreclosed property at a big discount to the asking price some mortgage service companies have created rapid ways for bidders to get an answer online others rely on slower methods to poll dozens of institutional owners in different time zones "it can take two weeks to get a response to an offer " says dawn leone a real estate broker in canton ohio "weve had some buyers get fed up and pull out " in europe homes can be snapped up en masse by institutional investors who turn them into rental properties that option generally hasnt existed in the u s where defaulted properties typically are sold one at a time the internet has made it easier for american bargain hunters to know whats available but big lenders have been surprisingly passive leaving the business of listing foreclosed homes to free standing entrepreneurs rather than creating a well designed national marketplace themselves dean williams a tulsa okla real estate specialist has been encouraging lenders to try auctioning off their foreclosed properties in batches instead of hiring real estate brokers to sell them one at a time his firm williams &amp williams does about &# million of sales annually and he says volume has been doubling but most lenders he says "just dont get it theres a lot of pushback "
