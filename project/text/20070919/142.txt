wireless spectrum is on hold wireless companies which spent billions of dollars in last years government auction of airwaves have been unable to use a major portion of this radio spectrum because of the surveillance activities of several federal law enforcement agencies for t mobile the issue is impeding its u s expansion the company a unit of germanys deutsche telekom ag was the largest bidder having spent nearly &# billion to acquire the spectrum in june a total of megahertz of radio spectrum was sold raising &# billion for the treasury the justice department and the department of homeland security continue to use airwaves for mobile surveillance of criminal activities that t mobile and others purchased at auction as a result bellevue wash based t mobile usa has been unable to expand to regions where its service is patchy or nonexistent "it makes the deployment of wireless networks by the commercial industry almost impossible if theres any risk of interference with these government systems " said mark gibson a senior director at comsearch a consulting firm working on behalf of both the government and some of the companies that acquired spectrum at the time of the auction the companies were aware the spectrum they were seeking to acquire was being used by various federal departments the government agencies were given &# billion raised in the auction to relocate to other radio spectrum but most of them have yet to move so some five months after the agencies received funds to move to other airwaves companies such as t mobile havent been allowed to use more than half the spectrum they bought the companies were told government agencies would be sharing use of the auctioned airwaves while they prepared to relocate but they didnt know the agencies were using the airwaves for surveillance activities related to sensitive crime fighting investigations "its kind of a black box its difficult to tell when how much and where the spectrum is being used by these agencies " said one person familiar with t mobiles position as a result some industry analysts believe t mobile made a huge gamble in investing heavily in spectrum without fully knowing what the government agencies were doing an official involved with the auction said the companies were warned bidders participated knowing they didnt have full details about the governments ongoing use of the spectrum said john kneuer assistant secretary of the commerce department in charge of the national telecommunications and information administration as a result he said the companies could have chosen not to participate "these are critical government missions and we cant compromise critical government missions " said mr kneuer whose agency is overseeing the transition to private sector use of the airwaves mr kneuer said surveillances could cover potential drug operations to investigations related to issues of national security since the auction was completed last year industry officials discovered that five government agencies within the homeland security and justice departments are using the spectrum for mobile audio and video surveillance for crime fighting purposes and because of the covert nature of this surveillance the agencies wont tell the companies when where or even how much of the spectrum they are using this has left the companies unable to share this radio spectrum which they claim is contrary to what they were led to believe before the auction the agencies using this spectrum include the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the drug enforcement administration the federal bureau of investigation immigration and customs enforcement and the secret service according to the ntia this lack of access to the spectrum represents a competitive setback for t mobile it had sought to build up its capacity in the face of larger rivals at&amp t inc verizon wireless which is owned by verizon communications inc and the united kingdoms vodafone group plc and sprint nextel corp t mobile roughly doubled the spectrum it controlled in the largest u s markets as a result of the auction according to people familiar with the matter "t mobile hasnt been able to begin offering mobile broadband service because it hasnt been able to get a hold of this spectrum " said michael gallagher a former head of the ntia t mobile is poised to begin selling new cellular phones as soon as it gets the green light that it can use the spectrum a person familiar with the matter said the company is in negotiations with the ntia the justice and homeland security departments to quickly gain access to the spectrum representatives for four agencies as well as homeland security didnt respond to requests for interviews kimberly bruce a spokeswoman for the secret service said it has quit using the spectrum a t mobile executive declined to be interviewed saying he didnt want to prejudice negotiations with government agencies the justice department also declined an interview request but agreed to answer questions submitted in writing the department said the spectrum is being used in support of tactical operations to build evidence in criminal cases the government agencies were allowed to set their own timelines for when they would vacate the spectrum homeland security said it would be off it in a year while justice said it would take three years from the end of this past march mr kneuer said the ntia is trying to determine if interference would occur if the agencies and the companies jointly used the spectrum t mobile has also offered to pay up to &# million to buy new equipment or modify existing equipment for the agencies to use temporarily mr kneuer said the government likely wouldnt view this proposal favorably other major acquirers of spectrum in the sale were smaller wireless carriers leap wireless international inc and metropcs communications inc both keen to expand beyond their regional bases this month metropcs announced an offer to buy leap an offer leap spurned on sunday both verizon wireless and a consortium of the three largest cable companies who are developing their entry strategy into the wireless industry were also significant players in the auction for verizon the issue is less urgent as it has larger existing spectrum holdings meanwhile members of the house energy and commerce committee are complaining to the bush administration about the slow pace of the airwaves being transferred to the private sector "bidders who paid the u s government billions of dollars for licenses are entitled to make use of these frequencies as long as there is no harmful interference demonstrated " said a letter sent to administration officials in june from committee chairman john dingell d mich rep joe barton r texas and other lawmakers
