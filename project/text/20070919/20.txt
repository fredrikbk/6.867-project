america are broadening to the billboard industry an old business with a presence along thousands of roads and on buses and trains the undertaking by billboard companies suppliers and advertisers range from new materials for lighting and banners to throwing out generation old habits in daily operations with an environmental awareness also comes the promise of improved profits in an industry with &# billion in annual sales the billboard industry faces a long slog down the green road some billboards dot expressways around the country according to the outdoor advertising association of america nearly all of these foot long billboards are covered with ad banners made from polyvinyl chloride or pvc a petroleum product widely considered toxic to water and soil add to that or more smaller billboards that are plastered with thick paper panels neither the pvc banners nor the paper billboard materials are practical to recycle or reuse forcing companies to cast off hundreds of thousands of pounds to landfills each year at the billboard companies expense and taking a toll on the environment the industry knows it must change as eco friendliness becomes a must for corporations "whenever we look at new products energy conservation is really at the forefront of our efforts where two or three years ago it was a nonfactor" said jodi senese cbs outdoors executive vice president for marketing the unit of cbs corp the countrys second largest billboard company plans to discontinue pvc vinyl ad sheets in favor of alternatives made from a plastic that is easier to break down and reuse cbs outdoor plans to rid pvc from certain of its ad faces total by the end of next year the commitment by cbs and others to eliminate pvc comes several years after mr ridless huddled with billboard companies to come up with replacements for the industrys standard materials it wasnt clear how to replace the strong proven pvc vinyl with something that would look sharp when printed with an ad be durable enough to withstand bad weather and be inexpensive enough for wallet conscious billboard companies armed mostly with "common sense and curiosity " mr ridless and his firm located outside of denver spent two years and &# million developing a product they call eco flexx it is made of a core of woven polyethylene one of the most common plastics in the world and used to make grocery bags toys and bulletproof vests "were proud that we took it on and im excited that it looks like its working " said mr ridless "i guess i would do it again " he joked the advantage of eco flexx is that it can be broken down and reused the banners also weigh about one third of the traditional pound billboard vinyl billboard companies hope the lighter banners can mean reduced reliance on large trucks and other gas guzzling machinery they need to transport and install billboard ads efforts are also under way to reduce or eliminate paper plastered billboards which appear along smaller roads than the largest highway billboards "weve been working probably five years to come up with a replacement for paper " said bob switzer vice president of operations for lamar advertising co "we are probably on the cusp of that happening " mr switzer said lamar puts about tons of paper into landfills each year costing the company about &# "we dont want to do that anymore " he said the change requires not just new materials but a new system for hanging up the ad posters traditionally installers had to stick thick paper sheets onto the face of billboards using a slather of gooey paste circle graphics lamar and other companies are trying to replace the cumbersome process familiar to anyone who has wrestled with hanging wallpaper they have come up with a new technique that replaces paper panels with a thin lighter weight sheet of material that hangs rather than sticks to a billboard this means no more glue a major expense for the billboard companies mr switzer says lamar spends &# million a year on adhesive advocates also say ad messages look better with the new hanging system which prevents sagging or tearing as paper panels are left out in the elements lighter paper and the new spring mounted posters also may result in fewer injuries to the workers who plaster up the ad banners a number of billboard companies are also working on new lighting to cut the energy needed to illuminate ad messages at night or the electricity used by the flashy digital displays common in new yorks times square and rapidly spreading elsewhere clear channel outdoor holdings inc the industry leader with more than ad displays worldwide is converting lighting on its largest roadside billboards to reduce energy use instead of the typical four watt lights on each billboard clear channel is using just two lighting fixtures from holophane of newark ohio cbs also is using prototype lighting developed from an unlikely synergy between the companys billboard and entertainment arms cbss television production team in los angeles looking for new lighting for tv studios experimented with lower wattage bulbs and suggested they could be used in the companys billboard business as well billboard companies and their vendors say they believe the costs experiments and research will be paid back with lower costs to do business there will be less tangible benefits too "its important for us to be viewed as and to be a strong corporate partner " said don allman chief executive of billboard company titan worldwide "and frankly its just the right thing to do "
