for rent italian gems in need of some repair the government of italy offers businesses a chance to lease historic properties rome the th century renaissance villa sits on acres in the hills outside florence the main manor house bears the crossed weaponry crest of the tolomeis a family of tuscan aristocrats and the small chapel is adorned with frescoes of angels at play all told there are seven buildings comprising square feet villa tolomei is one of italys architectural gems it is also available for rent the italian government is offering a year lease valued at &# a year or &# million for the entire term the italian state has one of the most impressive property portfolios in the world counting medieval castles renaissance villas frescoed baroque churches plus many acres of urban palazzi but since the s successive administrations have launched massive sell off campaigns only to see them get tangled up in red tape or stumble over political opposition now the government is taking a new course leasing the properties for long periods instead of selling them outright "this is a program that takes our valuable properties that are in need of repair and restores them but it also helps us to make the most out of our assets and bring in a steady stream of needed income " says elisabetta spitz the director of the agenzia del demanio the states main property arm the government is hoping that the shift in strategy may help it get over the hurdles that tripped up previous efforts in conservationists were up in arms over the potential sale of properties such as the villa della regina in turin from the th century arguing that italy was signing away its architectural jewels the attempt to sell such properties also ran afoul of the countrys notoriously stringent preservation laws preservationists think the leasing plan can work as long as it specifies that there will not be an option to buy at the end of the year term "a leasing program is better then selling but the state needs to ensure that these properties are protected when the lease term expires and this needs to happen before anything is signed " said marco parini vice president of italia nostra an organization that works to protect italys historic and artistic properties the agenzia del demanio set sept as a deadline for bids for villa tolomei it expects the villa could be redeveloped as a conference center or even a hotel the agency confirmed that it has received proposals but declined to disclose how many rent of &# million for years might sound like a bargain but villa tolomei illustrates the problems the state is up against the villa was transferred to the state in and for a short period was used by italys military police but it has been vacant for decades its grounds are overgrown and the buildings sit in varying states of decay to bring it back to life would require potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars it will be the responsibility of whoever leases villa tolomei to restore it so that it can be used the new leasing strategy is part of a broader effort to bring order to the states sprawling property holdings up until this year the state didnt even have a central record of all it possessed "the state had this enormous wealth but no idea how much and where exactly " says giorgio benvenuto chair of the senates finance committee for years politicians have been trying to sell off buildings to raise extra cash and help pay down the countrys enormous debt the third largest in terms of overall dollars after japan and the united states but political will was no match for bureaucratic hurdles "in the past it was impossible to get anything done there were so many obstacles in the way we have been at a standstill for years " said gualtiero tamburini president of assoimmobiliare a real estate trade association for example in then finance minister giulio tremonti created a special agency patrimonio spa to manage and sell state owned real estate but sales were slow while the agencys own costs grew so far this year it sold only two minor properties another gambit a &# billion bond launched in backed by state owned real estate nearly landed the government in hot water sales of the real estate mostly apartments came at a trickle and the government was forced to borrow heavily in order to make its bond payments on time mr tremonti also proposed selling off large tracts of state owned beaches and forests to bring in revenue but that idea collapsed under a firestorm of protests now the state is taking what it hopes will be a more systematic though modest approach the agenzia del demanio spent three years compiling an accurate inventory of properties it oversees with the help of the culture ministry it identified historic properties that could be put up for lease it still has no idea about how much all these properties might actually be worth "these are properties that we thought would fit into a leasing program and could be given a new life but that doesnt mean they dont have a cultural value " said laura moro an architect in the cultural ministry who worked on the inventory process "these are properties we still want to keep " while leasing might ease the bureaucracy it brings in far less cash for the state the inability to sell such historic properties has hurt the market in italy which is considered by many people in the real estate industry to be a difficult market to penetrate unlike the united kingdom and the u s "its a less mature less transparent market " says dominic white london based director of investments at property fund manager cordea savills he says that even professionals who work in italian real estate are often plagued by a lack of knowledge about which way the market is headed that uncertainty he says has damped investor enthusiasm the new bidding process is open to investors in italy and abroad there is a pre qualification phase that ensures that the parties submitting a bid actually meet the economic requirements for example the bidder must have at least five years worth of experience in the business they want to operate at the site and a net worth of at least &# million the bidders of course outline what they envision doing at the site and the time frame for implementing it the leases are available for business and not residential purposes the agency sees villa tolomei redeveloped for tourism but said it would examine all proposals historic properties coming up for lease include the th century castel dellovo which looks out on the bay of naples the rectangular castle whose name according to legend comes from an enchanted egg placed at the site by the poet virgil offers views of the waterfront and the surrounding area the agency is hoping it might be converted to an exhibition space or conference center the venetian arsenal the shipyard that mass produced the naval fleet of the powerful venetian republic will also be up for lease the agency also has dozens of forts guard houses and country estates it is looking to unload "if we are talking about real estate italy is rich " says ms spitz the director of the states main property arm "who else has this much historic property "
