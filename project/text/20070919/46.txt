gates crafts long term iraq plan with limited role for u s forces defense secretary seeks bipartisan agreement no talk of democracy washington defense secretary robert gates sketched out a long term vision for securing iraq that includes a continuing american military force that is a fraction the size of the one there today no permanent u s bases and a significant navy and air force presence in the persian gulf region in an interview in the pentagon mr gates also said part of the long range security structure would be stronger military partnerships with some of americas friends in the gulf area helping them build better counterterrorism forces as well as regional air and missile defense systems to check iranian ambitions what was missing from his vision for iraq and the broader region was talk about transforming the region and spreading democracy instead the pentagon chief seemed much more focused on transforming the debate in washington so the next president inherits a long term strategy for iraq and the region that both republicans and democrats can support "i came here with a pretty clear agenda " mr gates said "mainly i was focused on how we can put iraq in a place where we can have a long term stabilizing presence that has broad bipartisan support " it is a vision that mr gates a former head of the central intelligence agency said was born of his experience as a national security official during the cold war in those years as in the broader struggle now under way against islamic extremism he said the only successful strategy is one that can be adopted by multiple presidents both republican and democrat over many years for now that view seems to be translating into a much more pragmatic approach both on the ground in iraq and back home as recently as last year u s war plans for iraq focused on building a strong multisectarian democracy that would serve as a model for the rest of the middle east with national reconciliation largely stalled mr gates and gen david petraeus the top commander in iraq have given local commanders greater latitude to forge alternative strategies that seek to stabilize specific regions across the country as the top priority even if it comes at the expense of a strong central government the shift has produced some modest improvements in the security situation in iraq it has been less successful in changing the tenor of the debate in washington where frustration with mounting u s casualties and the inability of iraqis to meet national reconciliation goals is fueling a divisive debate the political battle over the war seems likely to grow in intensity as the presidential elections near sen carl levin the democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee blasted the bush administration in a speech this week for "not doing anything to pressure iraqi leaders to keep their commitments" on meeting national reconciliation goals he called for setting a clear timetable for the withdrawal of u s forces that would send a message to sunni shiite and kurd leaders that they had to reach agreement quickly on major issues such as distribution of oil revenues mr gates said he had made limited progress building any sort of consensus around a bipartisan approach for iraq that would carry over into the next administration "i am working hard to reach out to people across the spectrum up on the hill to keep the channels of communications open and build trust " mr gates said "i cant say we have made a lot of headway on that score yet " where mr gatess pragmatic approach has had a more profound impact is in iraq itself his long term vision for u s forces in iraq bears a striking resemblance to that offered by moderate democrats and the bipartisan iraq study group with u s troops focused on fighting al qaeda training iraqi forces and providing a "safety net" in case they get overwhelmed in his speech sen levin outlined the same missions for american forces in the future the difference is timing sen levin said he believes the u s can take on the more limited role by april mr gates and gen petraeus believe the surge of u s forces has been essential to pulling the country back from the brink of chaos they have said u s forces should shrink in numbers and shift missions more gradually "it is going to happen at a different pace in different provinces " mr gates said the pentagon chief also has allowed gen petraeus to take a far more decentralized approach in iraq aimed at bolstering local and tribal leaders both politically and economically it is a strategy that bears some similarity to the democrats"soft partition" approach in which iraq would be ruled by a weak central government that distributes oil revenues and largely self governing shiite sunni and kurd dominated regions mr gates said it is "too early to tell" whether iraq is headed in that direction commanders on the ground seem to be moving that way marine commanders have begun to explore whether they can build a free trade zone in iraqs sunni dominated anbar province that would allow businessmen in places like jordan and saudi arabia to establish economic ties to the area without going through the bureaucratic shiite dominated government in baghdad such a free trade zone would require the central governments approval "i think the notion of creating the freedom for people to work through the central government and directly with partners around them makes all kinds of sense " mr gates said "my view is that whatever works economically ought to be tried "
