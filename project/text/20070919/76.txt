mortgages and monetary policy in the past years there have been two macroeconomic policy changes in the united states that have really mattered one of these was the supply side reduction in marginal tax rates initiated after ronald reagan was elected president in and continued and extended during the current administration the other was the advent of "inflation targeting " which is the term i prefer for a monetary policy focused on inflation control to the exclusion of other objectives as a result of these changes steady gdp growth low unemployment rates and low inflation rates once thought to be an impossible combination have been a reality in the u s for more than years both of these reforms work in part because they stabilize peoples expectations about aspects of the future the supply side tax cuts in contrast to keynesian on again off again temporary tax cuts are designed to be in place over the long run and help to assure us that the returns to todays hard work and savings will not be taxed away tomorrow inflation targeting is a commitment that no matter what unpredictable shocks the economy is subjected to the fed will do what is needed to restore a fixed target inflation rate and so maintain a "nominal anchor" to expectations this summers subprime mortgage crisis puts the long run emphasis of inflation targeting to a severe test something has to be done right now what should it be there are two distinct aspects to this test which deserve separate analysis there is an immediate risk of a payments crisis a modern analogue to an old fashioned bank run many institutions not just banks have payment obligations that are far in excess of the reserves to which they have immediate access against these obligations they hold short term securities that they believed could be liquidated on short notice at little cost if some of these securities turn out not to be liquid in this sense and especially if no one is sure who holds them then everyone wants to get into treasury bonds we have seen this very clearly recently in the widening yield spreads between treasury bills and privately issued commercial paper in this process some losses are incurred and have been but the more important risk is that a need to liquidate can force otherwise solid enterprises into failure i have to add that one of the papers that helped make ben bernankes reputation as an economist was his article outlining the large real costs of the demise of banking institutions during the s there is no way to rule this possibility out based on market forces alone if everyone else wants to cash out then i want to be first in line so we need a second commitment by the fed unrelated to inflation control to stand ready to provide the liquidity if needed to serve as lender of last resort by reducing the discount rate and encouraging use of the discount window instead of reducing the funds rate until yesterday i think mr bernanke was trying to separate the short term problem of lender of last resort and the long term problem of inflation targeting and to show that we can and will deal forcefully with the liquidity crisis if one should emerge without weakening the commitment to price stability the need for a lender of last resort function is one qualification to the discipline of inflation targeting but it is a necessary one there is a second line of argument that seems to me much less compelling it starts with the fact that monetary policy necessarily affects future inflation rates not the current rate that has already been determined when the open market committee meets we also know that whatever funds rate target is chosen all kinds of others forces anything that happens to the real economy will affect next quarters rate of inflation or next years so we would like to forecast these other forces as well as possible and take them into account there is nothing wrong with this logic but how useful it is depends on how good we are at forecasting the non monetary determinants of prices in fact inflation forecasting is notoriously one of the squishiest areas of economic statistics in this situation it is all too easy for easy money advocates to see a recession coming and rationalize low interest rates they could be right who really knows and in any case we may not know enough to prove them wrong so i am skeptical about the argument that the subprime mortgage problem will contaminate the whole mortgage market that housing construction will come to a halt and that the economy will slip into a recession every step in this chain is questionable and none has been quantified if we have learned anything from the past years it is that there is a lot of stability built into the real economy to me inflation targeting at its best is an application of milton friedmans maxim that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon " and its corollary that monetary policy should concentrate on the one thing it can do well control inflation it can be hard to keep this in mind in financially chaotic times but i think it is worth a try mr lucas professor of economics at the university of chicago received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences
