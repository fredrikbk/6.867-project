lerach ed crime pays in this country " bill lerach william s lerach tort lawyer and corporate scold supreme copped a felony plea yesterday for his involvement in a class action kickback scheme that has already led to the indictment of his former firm milberg weiss under the agreement mr lerach will serve up to two years in prison and pay &# million to the government remarkably however the plea deal doesnt require mr lerach to cooperate with the prosecution of his former firm or testify against his co conspirators in light of the multidecade sentences meted out to such white collar criminals as worldcoms bernie ebbers and enrons jeffrey skilling mr lerach seems to have gotten off easy in the worldcom case former chief financial officer scott sullivan got five years after helping to convict mr ebbers and enrons cfo andrew fastow was first sentenced to years later cut to six after copping a plea and testifying against mr skilling and kenneth lay mr lerach will get a fraction of that time without cooperating for a scam that persisted for at least two decades wed like to see the justice department publicly explain this seeming double standard mr lerach was for years the foremost practitioner of the so called strike suit in which a company is sued simply because its stock has dropped the allegation is always "fraud " but in practice such suits have become at best merely a redistribution of shareholder money from one group of stock owners to another with lawyers like mr lerach cutting themselves in for a third or more of the loot the multiyear investigation into milberg weisss kickback scheme has revealed that many of these suits were themselves fraudulent at their core it turns out that there were often no real harmed parties at all merely secretly paid agents of the lawyers bringing the suits mr lerach who posed as the defender of the little guy against corporate fraudsters was himself involved in a long and wide ranging conspiracy to enrich himself and his chosen plaintiff stand ins when he said "crime pays " he was ostensibly referring to executives who had misled shareholders the reality was that he and his partners at milberg weiss were the ones fleecing shareholders as mr lerach has now publicly acknowledged in mr lerach took umbrage at the penalty meted out to michael milken though the u s probation office calculated that the crimes mr milken pleaded to had cost investors all of &# already years into the milberg conspiracy mr lerach declared "that number is so infinitesimal compared with the damage michael milken caused that its laughable i wish i knew a word smaller than infinitesimal " its hard to put a number on the money mr lerach took off shareholders over the past three decades or so but its safe to say that &# million isnt close even after his fine and minimal jail sentence he will presumably remain a rich man where do the shareholders who saw their companies coffers drained by mr lerachs ginned up strike suits go to get their money back
