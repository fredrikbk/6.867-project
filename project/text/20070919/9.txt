behind u k s shift on bank bailouts the troubles at british mortgage lender northern rock plc have already claimed at least one major casualty bank of england governor mervyn kings tough love approach to handling the global credit crisis as market turmoil bred trouble among banks mr king refused to join other central bankers in flooding the market with funds criticizing that approach as encouraging the kind of risky behavior that spawned the crisis to begin with now in their efforts to respond to a bank run reminiscent of th century panics policy makers in the united kingdom mr kings central bank included are stepping in with the most spectacular bailout of all news that u k chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling who oversees the treasury together with the bank of england had taken the highly unusual step of guaranteeing all deposits at northern rock combined with an unscheduled gbp billion &# billion injection from the central bank brought a measure of calm to depositors and investors yesterday a treasury spokesman said the guarantee extends to any solvent bank in similar circumstances northern rock said that lines at its branches and traffic at its call centers had decreased sharply in london yesterday northern rocks shares rose to pence &# after losing about on each of the two previous trading days shares of other u k mortgage lenders bounced back sharply as worries eased policy makers turnaround though has left some economists wondering whether they have now sent exactly the message that mr king had wanted to avoid "i think its awkward to say the least" said jonathan said senior economist at the london based centre for economic and business research "because they have for the past month or so stuck their necks out saying they didnt want to bail out the banks because of problems of moral hazard and now theyve had to go back on that " contesting the notion that the central bank was abandoning mr kings stated aversion to encouraging moral hazard a bank of england representative said "mr king has made clear that there is a big difference between protecting depositors and bailing out companies and shareholders " mr king has cut an outspoken and independent figure ever since he took the helm of the bank of englands nine member monetary policy committee in when banks worries about lending to one another pushed short term interest rates to record highs in early august mr king stayed notably on the sidelines as the european central bank and the u s federal reserve took extraordinary steps to ensure that cash hungry banks could get the money they needed in written testimony to the u k parliaments treasury committee last week mr king slammed those moves saying that "the provision of large liquidity facilities penalizes those financial institutions that sat out the dance encourages herd behavior and increases the intensity of future crises " some contend that mr king put the u k banking system at risk "i think there is a difference between managing systemic risk and avoiding moral hazard and i think the boe has very much erred in the direction of concern about the latter at the risk of inflaming the former " says malcolm barr u k economist at j p morgan in london negotiations to help save northern rock over the past few weeks show the central banks bailout aversion in sharp relief as short term money markets froze northern rock one of the u k s top five mortgage lenders was most affected because its business model relied heavily on short term borrowing unable to secure the financing it needed from the bank of england northern rock recognized it was in dire straits and approached a handful of potential buyers to rescue it but early last week a potential deal with larger bank lloyds tsb group plc fell through after the bank of england citing moral hazard concerns refused to provide emergency market rate funding instead with no buyer northern rock friday became the first bank in more than a decade to get an offer of emergency funds directly from the bank of england essentially the bank did for northern rock what the fed had already done for all u s banks accept highly rated mortgage securities as collateral for loans albeit at a penalty rate but that concession from the previously intransigent central bank didnt have the desired stabilizing effect unnerved depositors jammed the northern rock web site and lined up at branches throughout the u k to withdraw their savings the central bank likely didnt anticipate its agreement to provide emergency short term funding to northern rock would provoke such turmoil now many suspect that the throngs of worried savers helped spark enough political concern that the bank ultimately agreed to the governments provision of a far broader bailout recognizing that the damage to its own veneer of independence was secondary to averting a full on crisis to be sure some observers contend the bank of england has remained true to its word all along noting that the government intervened specifically to guarantee deposits not northern rocks shareholders "i dont see this as the boe changing their policy at all " says michael saunders u k economist with citigroup in london "remember that the institution is not guaranteed the solvency of the institution investors are not guaranteed " such distinctions though were lost on others who pointed out that the investors who bid up bank shares yesterday appeared to see the move as a general bailout and a reversal of the central banks policy "im not sure theyve covered themselves in glory in this process " says ben broadbent u k economist with goldman sachs in london andrew peaple contributed to this article
