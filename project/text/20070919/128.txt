the new art of art finance would it sell at what price and most important to whom these questions surrounded british artist damien hirsts "for the love of god" a life size cast of a human skull in platinum covered with pave set diamonds weighing carats from the moment it went on exhibit at london art gallery white cube in june with an asking price of gbp million about &# million it instantly became the most expensive artwork by a living artist and in the minds of many people who follow the art market "for the love of god" also became the symbol of an overheated art market ready for an overdue correction following the announcement by a spokesman of mr hirsts gallery that "for the love of god" had been sold for &# million at the very end of august a new question has been added did it really sell the terms of the deal were unprecedented it was bought by an unnamed investment firm with mr hirst retaining an undisclosed ownership stake in the artwork now many commentators question the reality of the transaction whether the sale was real or fictive we may never know indeed the general suspicion that those with a vested interest in a particular artist are prepared to either drive up the auction price or invent a nonexistent transaction for the sake of creating the perception of success is as old as the art market besides making headlines ever increasing auction prices have come to symbolize a supercharged multibillion dollar industry in fact art has emerged as a distinct asset class yet as this summers global credit crunch spilled across a whole range of asset classes many people wondered if the contemporary art market would be affected too and when however looking toward mr hirsts work as an indicator of the strength or weakness of the art market appears to be shortsighted a number of studies analyzing artworks long term patterns of price development suggest that an optimally diversified financial portfolio should include art most prominently a celebrated research paper "beautiful asset art as investment" by profs jianping mei and michael moses at new york university gave birth to the mei moses index which measures art prices from to according to messrs mei and moses art has on average outperformed year treasury bonds during that period in particular contemporary art has performed well as an asset class average annual returns range between and auction records during the past three years suggest returns probably closer to annually this compares favorably with the s&amp p indexs annual returns of in and in last month billionaire entrepreneur and art collector eli broad founder and former ceo of homebuilder kb home and the financial giant sunamerica warned that art prices will decline as a result of losses by hedge funds and other large contemporary art collectors who are having a difficult time after losing lots of money the coming auctions in london and new york this fall will certainly be followed as a first and important barometer of the correlation between art and financial markets the dollar amount of hard underwriting commitments that the auction houses continue to make to consigning clients in order to grow the marketplace would probably be a more insightful indicator for future price expectations if it were publicly available on a timely basis experience suggests that the art market follows the financial markets with a six month delay however the nature of capital that invests in art has changed substantially during the past decade this time the past may offer little insight into how the future will map out are certain artists heading for a correction most likely but as a whole the contemporary art market is unlikely to fall that is because there are structural forces in place today that secure strong demand for contemporary art for the foreseeable future in addition to the traditional art lovers more and more individuals are getting involved with art through collecting and patronage art becomes an important part of lifestyle a growing number of ultra wealthy hedge fund managers as well as entrepreneurs from emerging markets such as russia india and china have embraced the ownership of a high profile contemporary art collection as a symbol of success power and global status in addition the number of collectors private museums is not only on the rise but can sometimes pit one city against another this spring francois pinault owner of christies auction house and a majority shareholder of the ppr luxury goods group decided to house his contemporary art collection in venice after unsuccessfully wrestling with municipal authorities in paris for five years cash strapped public museums around the world are in stiff competition with each other for ultra wealthy benefactors who can either lend or gift their contemporary collections or become patrons in other ways most important however cities like singapore dubai abu dhabi and hong kong increasingly look toward art as a powerful branding medium perhaps the most high profile example of this trend is abu dhabis &# billion saadiyat island museum project which is expected to also include a branch of new yorks solomon r guggenheim museum featuring both modern and contemporary art a whole new financial sector is emerging with an increasingly structured approach to art investment leading financial firms such as citi deutsche bank and ubs have built art advisory functions within their wealth management or investment banking operations to advise clients on art buying in addition to the hedge funds opportunistically tapping into the arts market a number of investment funds solely dedicated to the arts have been set up in london lately while the supply of credit is tightening and the price of risk is going up the world still remains awash in abundant liquidity in the form of savings and massive current account surpluses therefore contracted credit conditions are unlikely to arrest the continuation of this unprecedented wealth creation set free by deregulation global trade and consequently the rise of new economic powerhouses in emerging markets during the past decade the growth of the contemporary art market is in its early stages indeed speculative capital is bound to increase and the current crisis in credit markets may offer a lesson when traditional lenders turn from principals into agents as risks are traded rather than owned the quality of belief in and long term commitment to the underlying asset are bound to be compromised and the increasing number of investment funds that enter the art market should keep that in mind in the long term there is no investment success in contemporary art unless one genuinely puts the artists their artworks and most important their careers at the very center of ones focus assuming the sale of mr hirsts work really is what it is presented to be then maybe that very opaque investment firm found a successful formula for the purchase of new artworks retain the artist as a stakeholder who then has a financial incentive to actively promote the artwork history is unlikely to record the sale of "for the love of god" as a symbol of a market that lost touch with reality on the contrary the transaction is consolidating arts position as both a financial as well as a media asset in fact it may indicate the dawn of the future securitization of individual artworks
