the singular question of human vs machine has a spiritual side you can tell a lot about people from what they worry about a few saturdays ago i spent the day in an auditorium full of fellow citizens concerned with "singularity " the word refers to the day when the intelligence of computers will exceed our own the auditorium was filled with people who listed many things that might occur with singularity such as a human machine synthesis into a new superintelligent life form the date has been projected as anytime from nine to years hence singularity believers say humanity urgently needs to begin preparing for this moment if only to make sure that humans dont become kabobs at the first post singularity tailgate party held by supersmart computers there is even a singularity institute bankrolled by silicon valley wealthoids the weekend session featured speeches panel discussions and informal chatting about people were on hand more frankly than i would have expected who but year old sci fi addicts still fret over malevolent superintelligent machines most of us living every day with computers appreciate how even the worlds most powerful one not only is incapable of an autonomous thought it cant even distinguish spam from real email to get to the singularity that we are supposed to be preparing for we are going to need agi or artificial general intelligence a topic the singularists go on about endlessly a computer with agi thinks and reasons the same way a human being does only much more quickly but dont singularity people know that ai researchers have been trying to make such machines since the s without much success it turns out there is a schism between the agi and the ai worlds the agi faction thinks ai researchers have sold out abandoning their early dreams of "general" intelligence to concentrate on more attainable and more lucrative projects theyre right the machines today that recognize speech or play chess are one trick wonders of course ai researchers defend that approach by saying their early dreams of general intelligence were naive the singularists though dont seem bothered by those earlier ai failures new approaches will bear fruit they insist they thus didnt think it a waste of either time or carbon offsets to be gathering at a conference to ask such questions as "if you made a superintelligent robot then forced it to work only for you would that be slavery " robots are just computers with moving parts of course but the public is still confused about them just like they used to be about computers themselves the great metallic hope of the robotics industry for example is currently a small round vacuum cleaner that ambles across the floor by itself a high tech wonder actually consumer reports said that even cheap vacuum cleaners did better than the first model a little more of this and no one will ever again worry about enslaving robots there is another way of thinking about the obsession with robots john huntington professor of english university of illinois has studied the genre and says sci fi authors especially the early ones who wrote about robots or aliens were working out their own unacknowledged anxieties about closer to home topics most commonly he said these anxieties involved women who were seen as becoming threatening as they gained social power racial and class tensions also were involved he added i have a supplemental theory that the discussion of singularity involves a sublimated spiritual yearning for some form of eternal life and an all powerful being but one articulated by way of technical secular discourse as it happens there is considerable overlap between the singularity and the "life extension" communities ray kurzweil the best known singularity writer also co wrote a lengthy guide to life extension he once told me he expects literally to live forever first by prolonging his life via a daily regimen that includes hundreds of pills and the nonstop consumption of green tea then once super powerful computers arrive by uploading his consciousness into one singularists also have an affinity for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or seti program which scans the skies looking for other civilizations isnt that a longing by some for an intergalactic messiah then consider a poem read at the singularity conference that described an aquarian age scene in which humans and other mammals frolicked in a "cybernetic meadow all watched over by machines of loving grace " those computer protectors sound a lot like the guardian angels my grade school nuns told us about years ago a friend and i spent an evening with arthur c clarke the creator in "" of hal the malevolent computer of every singularists nightmare he brought along slides showing himself with some astronauts and with the authors of the musical "hair " we talked about science and had our picture taken which i still have it proves that while i may have reached a different conclusion at least i studied with the master email me at lee gomes wsj com
