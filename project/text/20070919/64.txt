intels latest chip advances could lead to new rivals intel corp shared new evidence that it is picking up the pace of technology development and could take on new rivals besides advanced micro devices inc the big semiconductor maker used a technical conference in san francisco to describe an array of chip designs including an unusual offering called larrabee that could be used for complex scientific calculations as well as graphics operations that product not expected until combines at least of its standard microprocessors with specialized circuitry and could compete with high end graphics chips now sold by nvidia corp and amds ati unit intel also discussed plans by to combine tiny versions of its microprocessors along with specialized circuitry on chips for digital televisions tv set top boxes and other consumer devices chips designed to rival offerings from companies such as arm holdings plc the company is betting that the relative ease of programming chips used in pcs known by the designation x will prove attractive in those new markets said paul otellini intels chief executive during the intel developer forum in other developments the santa clara calif based company disclosed that it will introduce a chip code named penryn on nov that has circuitry measured at just nanometers or billionths of a meter ahead of other companies now using nanometer manufacturing processes mr otellini also showed off what may be the first working chip based on nanometer technology expected in commercial products in amd while lagging behind in production processes has led in design features such as a built in controller that helps fetch data from memory chips intel yesterday gave the first demonstration of a chip code named nehalem that has a memory controller and other advanced features pat gelsinger an intel senior vice president said it will initially offer two processor and four processor models of nehalem in the second half of and eight processor models in
