politics &amp economics democrats outline tax approach relief for middle earners would be offset by increases for wealthy eager to avoid being branded old style tax and spend liberals the democratic presidential candidates are starting to roll out detailed proposals to cut taxes for millions of americans but unlike the across the board cuts being floated in the republican field these are aimed only at lower and middle income households often crafted narrowly as credits for specific expenses like purchasing health insurance or buying a home and in a democratic white house any such tax cuts would be offset by big tax increases on upper income families investors and corporations according to the emerging plans "for decades weve seen a successful strategy to ride antitax sentiment in this country toward tax cuts that favor wealth not work " illinois sen barack obama said as he unveiled his own "middle class tax relief plan" yesterday "we shouldnt be distorting our tax code to benefit a few powerful special interests we should be insisting that everyone pays their fair share and when im president they will " former north carolina sen john edwards unveiled his tax cut plan in july democratic front runner hillary clinton has talked in general terms similar to mr obama in discussing changes shed make to the tax code although she hasnt yet released a full tax plan while their prescriptions vary in detail and scope the top three contenders are all looking to use the tax code to correct what they say are imbalances that exacerbate income disparities their efforts are aimed at wooing voters who are increasingly concerned about their economic security and worried about not being able to afford health care gas and retirement "people feel like theyre one loss of health insurance or job loss away from serious problems and the proposals are clearly playing to that " said william gale a democratic tax specialist at the brookings institution but the plans are drawing criticism from some who say the candidates are pandering to voters by advocating policies that waste tax dollars instead of using the money to confront serious fiscal problems such as shoring up social security and medicare which are forecast to run out of money once baby boomers retire "i have no problem with them trying to undo all or most of the bush tax cuts for the wealthy even if its only for a couple of years but there are so many huge fiscal problems that we should be very careful about proposing new trivial programs when theres so many real big programs we need to do something about " said bill mcintyre director of citizens for tax justice a left leaning washington think tank conservatives are attacking democrats for using targeted tax cuts to mask what they say are really big tax increases while democrats are united in saying theyd let at least some of president bushs tax cuts expire as currently scheduled in republican white house hopefuls are calling for an extension of the cuts as a starting point mitt romney the former massachusetts governor has given the most detailed republican tax plan so far he proposes to eliminate taxes on dividends capital gains and other investment income for families that make under &# a year for an estimated net reduction of &# billion per year mr obama unveiling his tax plan yesterday said his cut would equal &# billion to &# billion per year and would continue the trend intensified over the past two decades of removing millions more americans from the income tax rolls he said he would eliminate income taxes for seven million senior citizens earning less than &# per year another million workers would no longer have to pay income taxes because of a new &# per family tax credit which would offset the payroll tax on the first &# of earnings the tax credit would eliminate income taxes for those individuals whose income tax bill is smaller than the size of the credit and would also provide a tax break to another million americans according to the obama campaign the credit would phase out for workers making somewhere between &# to &# per year mr obama also proposed changing the tax code to make the mortgage interest deduction apply more broadly by turning it into a credit and allowing taxpayers to benefit even if they dont itemize the changes will be financed in part by raising the tax rate on capital gains and dividend income to as much as a level last seen in that is a higher amount than the campaign had endorsed earlier this year the obama campaign said it would raise those rates to earlier this year mr edwards said he too would raise the capital gains tax rate to from and boost income taxes on those making more than &# to finance tax cuts and other benefits for middle and lower income families the underlying message of the democratic candidates plans that wealthier people should pay higher taxes and lower and middle income people should pay less echoes the theme many democrats in congress have adopted house ways and means committee chairman charles rangel d n y is working on a tax bill that would reduce taxes for about million people by eliminating the individual alternative minimum tax expanding the earned income and child tax credits and increasing the standard deduction such changes would result in a revenue loss of about &# billion over years which mr rangel said he would offset in accordance with budget rules possibly by raising rates for upper income tax payers closing corporate "loopholes" and raising the taxes paid by the managers of private equity hedge and venture capital funds a large tax package is unlikely to become law this year as democrats on capitol hill have found little common ground with the bush administration still the house democrats effort could lay down markers for a longer term debate about overhauling and simplifying the tax code that would be resolved when a new president takes office tim farnam contributed to this article
