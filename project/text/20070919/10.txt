best of the law blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms law blog vegas judge has to take time out for o j simpson media frenzy nancy oesterle a las vegas judge was tending to her morning calendar monday when she received an urgent message fellow judge ann zimmerman had been assigned the o j simpson case and needed judge oesterle to answer media questions judge zimmerman put on judge oesterles black robe and took over her morning caseload with almost no time to prepare judge oesterle walked outside the courthouse to face a throng of television cameras and reporters "i barely had time to put lipstick on " she said mr simpson was arrested sunday and faces multiple felony charges tied to an alleged armed robbery of collectors involving the former football stars sports memorabilia a hearing in the case is scheduled for today in addition to the half hour press conference judge oesterle and her staff fielded more than media calls monday she says she also made appearances on a few national cable shows "the press conference was extremely hectic but it was a real adrenaline rush " she said the nevada courts have devised an unusual system judges handling high profile matters may assign colleagues to serve as media liaisons the role is a natural fit for judge oesterle who for years co hosted a local weekly tv show "the public has a right to know and its important for them to hear what a judge has to say " said douglas smith chief judge of the las vegas township justice court "nancy understands the system and her real strength is that she speaks to the public in plain english so they can understand whats going on " although she says the news conference and media appearances have gone well she expressed dismay that she was wearing a white pants suit underneath her robe "who would wear white on tv if they had any notice " she said "if i had any clue i was going to be on television i wouldve worn a st john knits in royal blue or cherry red " she added "but its still degrees here in las vegas and i wear white into october what could i do " tackling taxes the &# fine levied last week by the national football league on new england patriots head coach bill belichick for his teams using videotape to try to steal signals from the new york jets has shaken the sports world oddly enough it has also roiled the tax law world the taxprof blog posed this question can mr belichick deduct the fine a dozen law professors weighed in with a combined words on the matter including testy exchanges over arcane sections of the tax code most of them concluded the fine is deductible as a "trade or business expense " "because unfortunately in this day and age it probably is ordinary for coaches and players in professional sports to cheat and if caught to be fined by the league the fine levied on the patriots coach can be viewed as an ordinary and necessary business expense " wrote myron grauer of capital university law school but how could cheating be considered a business expense drawing a contrast perhaps only a lawyer could love mike mcintyre of wayne state university in detroit distinguished between cheating and violating rules "the fine was for violating a rule not for cheating " he wrote "the patriots were not accused of cheating by the commissioner and were not fined for cheating " he added "no professional football game is played without someone breaking the rules " law school nation the kerfuffle this month over the hiring rejecting and rehiring of liberal law professor erwin chemerinsky to be the first dean of a new law school at the university of california at irvine sparked debates about academic freedom and the role of law school administrators but here is another question why are so many law schools starting up since the american bar association has accredited law schools for a total of seven in the last two years that compares with three schools that received accreditation in the decade before experts say the increase can be traced to the settlement that year of an antitrust suit brought against the aba by the justice department which claimed the group was restricting accreditation attempts by for profit schools among others most states require bar exam takers to graduate from aba accredited schools the aba denied wrongdoing but agreed to change its practices before the deal "the whole point of aba accreditation was to limit the number of lawyers " says andrew morriss a law professor at the university of illinois "with the legal education cartel forced to back off part of the demand of aspiring law students was met " the aba said its "role is not to assess the reasons for founding a school but rather is to evaluate whether the school meets standards we have identified as appropriate and necessary " a total of four law schools have opened in virginia and the carolinas in the last few years leary davis founding dean of the law school started last year at elon university in greensboro n c says starting that school cost about &# million and would have cost more but it got a former library building as a gift another reason for the growth some universities think starting a law school gives them prestige plus theyre moneymakers in part because faculty costs are low compared with other disciplines and classrooms can be large says richard matasar dean of new york law school in manhattan
