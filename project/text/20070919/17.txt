business world a dream of air travel al "reinventing government" gore stood before a press conference at washington national airport on may and waved an ancient faa vacuum tube the vice president was there to unveil the clinton administrations proposed bill to "corporatize" the air traffic control system turn it into something resembling a private market driven enterprise "we mean business " mr gore said congresss pork barons would just have to step aside lo it came to pass the air traffic control system became a self funded government chartered corporation it would be run by a board of directors appointed by the president it would charge fees to aircraft operators and borrow money in the capital markets to fund its long term technology investments congressional log rolling had long been the old systems bane to seal its divorce from capitol hill the new operator now moved its headquarters miles away to the state of the art r w poole jr building in santa monica calif atc became a fast adopter of new technologies especially the power of networked computers the faas old army of controllers whose job was manually to keep planes from colliding soon was phased out in favor of computerized cockpits tied together by a powerful broadband network in the skies now thanks to ultra precise gps navigation every plane knew where every other plane was rather than the huge five or six mile safety buffers necessary when planes were manually juggled by controllers on the ground aircraft could safely remain less than a mile apart even in crowded airport skies instead of stair stepping down to a runway with a controller calling out instructions at each step along the way now they could descend smoothly "like beads on a string " as one ups pilot put it the savings in time fuel and passenger productivity were enormous in its day the faa had effectively used delays to suppress demand in line with the systems limited capacity looking back faa types now giggled embarrassedly at how they once would have discouraged airlines from shifting traffic to smaller "regional jets" because it would bring more planes into the system than the system could handle never mind that passengers clearly appreciated the lower fares more frequent departures and greater array of destinations the rjs made possible the same old timers chuckled ruefully to think how they might have squashed the emerging business of unmanned aerial vehicles because the old system had no way to accommodate them thousands now flitted safely through the same skies used by passenger traffic fishermen employed them to track schools of tuna government used them to fight forest fires and patrol the borders uavs in turn were a hothouse education in the possibilities of computer controlled flight the timing couldnt have been more serendipitous with traffic surging and the military no longer churning out enough pilots to keep the airlines staffed especially in india and china greater reliance on automated flight soon proved an economic necessity it also was proving a political necessity with pilot error responsible for anywhere from to of aviation accidents all agreed that a quantum leap in safety was needed to make sure crashes remained a rare news event amid a vast increase in flying boeing launched its first generation robolander under the old system experts said boeing might not have patented it until and who knows how long a project by onera the french aerospace lab to spec out the basic requirements for a fully robotic jetliner for the european union would have taken the new safety gadgets certainly helped reawaken the private aviation market for honda and other manufacturers just as they were rolling out their new "very light jets " who can even keep track of all the celebrity pilots who were saved by the "fly me home" buttons in their cessnas indeed the public was gobsmacked to discover just how capable the new system had become when helios flight a greek in which the pilots had become incapacitated was landed safely by computer then there was the time red faced terrorists tried to commandeer a bunch of airliners only to have the planes fly to the nearest military base and surrender boy were the hijackers surprised in prison one rethought his politics and wrote a successful series of self help books for the sexually confused muslim snap faa administrator marion c blakey dozing in a limousine in mid as she makes the round of farewell addresses wakes from a dream weve placed in her head except for al gore standing in front of the press saying "we mean business " none of it was true induced by too many hours of futile headbanging with congress and the private pilots lobby mr gores proposed legislation was never introduced the clinton white house caved to the congressional pork barons and agreed to let them write the bill so much for reform but at least it will be somebody elses headache when the system blows up in five or years air traffic is expected to reach a billion passengers by and theres no way to expand the systems current operational framework to meet the demand you cant go on subdividing the skies around busy airports into smaller and smaller sectors so a single controller wont be overtaxed by more planes than the human mind can handle the crisis when it comes will be ugly delays restrictions on the numbers of flights a wholesale withdrawal of air service to lower priority towns and cities forget about tapping the potential of uavs and light personal jets theres no place to put them meanwhile countries didnt boot the opportunity to move their atc systems into a quasi private business model if americans want to fly cheaply and efficiently thought ms blakey they can always move to germany or canada or new zealand see related letter "letters to the editor youre dreaming all right" wsj sept see related letter "letters to the editor atc modernization alone wont fix airport delays" wsj sept
