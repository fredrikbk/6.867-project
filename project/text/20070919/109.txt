seoul vies for developed status at some risk upgrade from emerging could mean more cash influx but lower index weightings seoul south korea south korean investors and market regulators are eagerly awaiting an answer to a high stakes question is the countrys stock market "developed" or "emerging" for years south koreas government and some of its major investors have argued that it should be considered a "developed" market it is the worlds th largest economy qualifies as a high income country under world bank guidelines possesses huge government reserves and its companies are global leaders in electronics steel autos and ships stock market indexes have classified south korea as an emerging market in recent years that has been useful to managers of mutual funds tied to emerging markets because as the country matured korean companies provided safety in what is usually risky and volatile investment territory even after south korea met developed market income qualifications in the firms that create indexes expressed concerns from market volatility to weak dividend payouts to the risk of trouble from neighboring north korea now the eyes of the country are on ftse group one of the leading managers of indexes as it concludes its annual review of national designations the index makers chief executive mark makepeace will join korea stock exchange officials at a news conference tomorrow an ftse spokeswoman said yesterday that executives havent made their decisions besides south korea seven markets are being considered for reclassification including taiwan and israel which may also be lifted from emerging to developed fund managers are watching the results because most rely on indexes to decide where to allocate money an even bigger index than the ftse is one managed by msci barra inc which also defines south korea as "emerging " a spokeswoman for msci barra had no comment for south korea taiwan and israel an upgrade in classification could make a lot more money available for investment in their markets investors usually allocate a much higher portion of their assets to developed markets than to emerging ones but a change also would make the markets small fish in the larger pool of funds available for developed markets that change would be especially pronounced for south korea which has about an weighting in emerging market indexes that would likely drop to between and in developed market indexes the result may be that managers of developed market funds wont pay as much attention to south korean companies as do the managers of emerging market funds that could prove detrimental to small and midcap companies which usually have the most difficulty raising capital terrence lim strategist at goldman sachs in seoul says the net inflow to the south korean market could be positive if it is reclassified as "developed " but the impact on individual stocks could be quite different "if i managed &# billion of global funds and was looking at a country with market weight i wouldnt look at more than five stocks in that country " he says meanwhile domestic individual investors have become a more influential and stabilizing force in the south korean stock market as foreign investors fled amid the global selloff of equities last month south korean individuals were net buyers and stabilized the local market japanese stocks drop
