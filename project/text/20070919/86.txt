palm bets big on new phone much of palm inc s fortunes rest upon a new smart phone it hopes will find its way into the hands of a younger hipper crowd yet it remains to be seen whether the tiny centro can leave a big impression given the competitive landscape the sunnyvale calif company has been in an innovation rut as of late relying on only slight tweaks to its aging treo platform its recent unveiling and subsequent scrapping of the foleo "companion device" only served to further illustrate its struggles with the centro palm wants to broaden its market and avoid getting stuck in the niche of serving only corporate customers "its always tough to introduce new devices " said miro kazakoff analyst for market research firm compete inc "more devices fail than succeed but i think palm has a good history theres a lot that can be taken and learned from that " palm pioneered the smart phone market with treo which sports a keyboard and can perform computer like tasks to this day it boasts a loyal fan base mostly made up of professionals but the company has let larger companies such as motorola inc and samsung electronics co shoulder their way into the market apple inc meanwhile has become the pound gorilla with the spotlight grabbing iphone palm holds of the market for smart phones slightly behind research in motion ltd s motorola and samsung follow while a variety of other makers combined make up a share according to compete the study doesnt include the recent iphone launch palm has a chance to recapture some buzz with the centro the device likely will come out with the full support of sprint nextel corp which itself is in need of attention grabbing devices the centro will be available in the fall and run on sprints third generation network it also features a tiny but full keyboard and a touch screen like its treo predecessor it is roughly the size of rims blackberry pearl "i think its certainly a bright spot in recent memory for the palm portfolio " said lisa pierce an analyst for forrester research who tried out the device "from my perspective i carry a very small purse whatever i use has to fit that lifestyle this certainly fits it " yet others remain skeptical lehman brothers holdings inc analyst jeffrey kvaal criticized palms lack of innovation "uninspired product launches suggest a weak new product engine and have reduced palms differentiation a strong brand based on ease of use " he said in a downgrade of the stock issued sept he said improvements wouldnt come for another months palm is emulating a model successfully executed by rim the waterloo ontario company which commands a legion of "crackberry" addicts with its habit forming blackberry email device successfully broke into the consumer market with the pearl using a slimmer design and a tiny spinning ball instead of the trademark scroll wheel it turned heads and won over a new customer segment "our hopes are well reach out to a much broader audience " said brodie keast who heads marketing for palm "most of the growth is in front of us we dont feel that any winners or losers have been defined yet " palm and rim are considered the two most comparable companies because they primarily focus on business class smart phones palm shares rose early in the year on speculation it would be acquired by either nokia corp or motorola private equity firm elevation partners eventually bought a stake in the company in june investors hope the influx of capital and former apple executives aligned with elevation partners will turn the company around at the d all things digital conference in may palm unveiled the foleo a device meant to work in tandem with its treo the device was seen as little more than a stripped down laptop and drew ridicule at the event "they have created a product for which there is little market " gartner analyst todd kort said shortly after it was unveiled "its on its way to becoming the most disappointing product of the year " the foleo which co founder jeff hawkins helped develop was an illustration of the companys inability to bring out buzz worthy products and its increasing dependence on its treo line recently chief executive ed colligan wrote in a company blog that he was canceling the launch of the foleo calling it a necessary move to allow it to focus on developing a new software platform for its devices "because we were nearly at the point for shipping foleo this was a very tough decision " he said adding the company will take a charge of &# million to scrap the product by contrast the iphone hit at&amp t inc and apple stores in late june with impressive opening weekend sales in july apples device became the top selling smart phone and equaled sales of the most popular feature phone lg electronics inc s chocolate according to market research firm isuppli the firm acknowledged that the real test will be in the coming months and attributed some of the strength to pent up demand following months of hype apples decision to cut the price of the iphone by &# earlier this month will likely keep pressure on palm and other smart phone makers possibly more important than the hardware packaging is the software powering the device palm has been known for its easy to use operating system while solid the company has relied on the system for a long time "the palm os is getting a little long in the tooth " competes mr kazakoff said "their big test is can they take all the things that made palm great and build upon it " as the iphone demonstrated with its touch screen interface nailing the user experience is vital to getting customer adoption palm devices using microsoft corp s clunkier windows mobile operating system were coolly received palm is working on a next generation operating system "we certainly intend to innovate " said mr keast of palm adding there isnt a time frame for when the software would become available "we do recognize that platform has limits " the centro likely will use the old palm operating system some urged patience in the company "remember its a journey " forresters ms pierce said
