the real bush record in his new book "the age of turbulence " my longtime friend alan greenspan argues that president bushs economic and budget policies have been fiscally irresponsible ive known and admired alan for years and i believe he was a great chairman of the federal reserve board but i think his assessment is off the mark alan tells of his first meeting with then president elect bush on dec at the madison hotel in washington i recall this breakfast meeting very well especially alans comments on the state of the economy the fed chairman told the president elect and our team that america faced the real possibility of a recession in the wake of the collapse of the late s technology sector bubble alans prediction proved correct in the final months of the clinton administration the nation began an economic slowdown that turned into a recession another crisis was looming though none of us knew it at the time less than eight months into our administration the nation came under terrorist attack the events of are the defining moment of the era from the standpoint of national security they were equally significant from an economic perspective aimed at our countrys financial sector the attacks were followed by the suspension of stock trading the closing of stores and shopping malls and the cancellation of thousands of flights in the three and a half months between and christmas nearly a million americans lost their jobs the combined effects of recession and national emergency could have been devastating for americas economy yet president bushs tax cuts following through on a promise he had made to the voters resulted in a shallower recession a faster recovery and a platform for growth that remains sturdy to this day the fact is that in a time of unprecedented challenge the united states has experienced nearly six years of uninterrupted economic growth and added more than eight million new jobs since august more than all other major industrialized nations combined the economic growth encouraged by the presidents tax cuts is now producing sharply increased federal tax receipts up by nearly in fiscal year alone nearly in fiscal year and projected to rise nearly in the fiscal year that will end this month that is the highest growth in tax receipts in consecutive years since as a result tax revenue as a percentage of our economy is now above the year historical average under the circumstances its pretty hard for anyone to argue that the american people are under taxed even at a lower rate of taxation the hard work and productivity of americans is generating more tax dollars than ever before on the spending side of the ledger i cant dispute alans general notion that the federal government is too big and spends too much money weve agreed on that point since we both worked in the ford administration more than years ago president bush feels the same way and thats why he has steadily reduced the annual rate of growth in non security discretionary spending in contrast the last budget enacted during the clinton gore administration increased that category of spending by a staggering president bush has pressed hard to keep that spending under control and this years increase will actually be lower than the rate of inflation for the third year in a row its worth noting as well that president bush has committed significant resources to rebuilding our military after the draw downs of the s in addition this new era has also demanded far larger support for intelligence law enforcement and homeland security our administration has met those urgent priorities yet weve also managed to bring this years projected deficit down to of gdp well below its historical average over the past four decades alan has long argued correctly that fiscal discipline is a long term obligation requiring honesty and a willingness to make tough choices here again we agree and on this measure president bushs record is superb he has proposed reforms in medicare and medicaid and has repeatedly asked congress to reform social security and place it on firm financial ground though congress has failed to act no other president has spent more time or political capital trying to avert a fiscal disaster that everyone knows is coming ive enjoyed alan greenspans company and benefited from his wisdom for most of my career for his part alan credits me in his book for my "intensity" and "sphinxlike calm" and its in a spirit of friendship that i offer him these gentle reminders of the bush record mr cheney is vice president of the united states
