the least developed nations are disregarded neglected it is unfortunate that bret stephens in his dec global view column "five easy fixes for the u n " makes references to the u n s office of the high representative for the least developed countries landlocked developing countries and small island developing states u n ohrlls without it seems the full knowledge and appreciation of the general assemblys mandate to the office in fact the office is the secretariats focus for of the most vulnerable and poorest countries of the world without enhanced attention given to these countries to highlight their issues among development partners international financial institutions civil society and other stakeholders the united nations charter to address the problems of the poorest may not receive the focus they deserve mr stephens makes a reference to the january international meeting for small island states held in mauritius the decision to hold the meeting in mauritius was on the basis of an invitation by the government of mauritius to host the event which the general assembly accepted the expenditures for servicing the conference by the u n was negotiated with the host country and financed by them om pradhan new york mr pradhan is chief policy development &amp coordination monitoring &amp reporting unit united nations office of the high representative for least developed countries landlocked developing countries and small island developing states it is hard to imagine how an "organization" that is not answerable to any real constituency can be fixed secretary general ban ki moons intentions may well be good but a parasitic bureaucracy that is inherently anti american virtually no american gets hired at the middle management and lower levels is sure to thwart him and good software as suggested by chris burnham does nothing for it either as someone has to read the reports of ineptitude and malfeasance and act on them the answer could lie in creating an alternative and competing body preferably of democracies that try to achieve some of the original intent behind the u n vijay dandapani new york mr stephenss column starkly portrays the utter disregard and neglect of the worlds poorest and most marginalized countries by the current world system but by suggesting the new secretary general "prioritize " he implies that the u n ohrills the worlds only office dedicated to the cause of these poorer group of countries should be considered the least priority as a representative of a least developed and landlocked country nepal i strongly urge that the office should be further strengthened with more resources and a stronger mandate i am confident that ban ki moon will understand the gravity of the matter and not be carried away by stray thoughts for such "easy fixes" for the u n madhu raman acharya permanent representative of nepal to the united nations new york
