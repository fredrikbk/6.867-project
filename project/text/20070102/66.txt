opinion pages the look of the opinion pages changes but the principles of free people and free markets remain when readers turn to the redesigned wall street journal opinion pages today they will see things both new and familiar the new is a layout that has moved some of the features to accommodate the narrower page width the familiar are the same editorial philosophy and news judgment that have long distinguished journal opinion the editorials remain where they have been for decades anchoring the left hand page under the review &amp outlook logo and keeping a steady commentary on the economic business and political news of the day they lack a specific byline or author because they represent the collective views of journal editors they are supervised by editorial page editor paul a gigot working with deputy editors daniel henninger and melanie kirkpatrick and the other men and women on the editorial board the journals guiding editorial philosophy is "free people and free markets " and that continues in this new era as it has for more than years some other features on the page are moving to new positions the journals regular columnists now appear to the right of the editorials at the top of the left hand page these include weekly columns by mr henninger bret stephens holman w jenkins jr and mary anastasia ogrady on the lower right corner of the left hand page readers will notice the return of the "pepper and salt" cartoon these witty commentaries from a variety of contributors continue to be solicited and selected by charles preston as they have been for years since the cartoon has run on the leisure &amp arts page three days a week and many readers have told us they missed it on the regular opinion pages it now returns to its former home on the editorial page as a daily feature monday saturday the rest of the opinion pages both under the column on the left hand page and on the entire righthand page above the masthead are devoted to our provocative and often news making op ed features these are sometimes written by members of the journal editorial staff but most are contributions from men and women who have special expertise or are prominent in public life over the years we have published nobel laureates including many by the late milton friedman prime ministers and presidents ceos and scholars making waves in the world of ideas these features may take a different point of view from the staff written editorials but like the editorials they are intended both to inform and to spark debate on the main controversies of our time the one regular opinion feature that has found an entirely new home is letters to the editor the letters move to the journal exchange page which will appear in the marketplace section monday friday and in the a section on saturday this change may seem jarring to some readers accustomed to seeing letters alongside the editorials and opinion features but moving them allows us more space to accommodate the many insightful letters we receive each day our readers are the most knowledgeable in the world and we want to make sure they have a place to be heard letters will continue to be edited by letters editor ned crabb all in all the number of column inches devoted to opinion are roughly the same as under the previous format our goal is to continue to be the leading forum for political and economic debate in america and around the world we hope you enjoy and grow comfortable with the new opinion pages mr gigot is the editor of the wall street journals editorial page
