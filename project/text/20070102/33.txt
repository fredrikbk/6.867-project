evolution not revolution is what most of these yanks had in mind americans in paris metropolitan museum of art through jan new york the first thing to notice about "americans in paris " at the metropolitan museum of art through jan are the dates in the title anyone expecting to see the effect of modernist vanguard art on venturesome american artists will be for the most part disappointed everyone interested in enlarging his or her understanding of the evolution of th century art will be fascinated the exhibition begins as the mets riveting "origins of impressionism" did a decade ago in the wake of the salon of when it became obvious that the time honored academic hierarchies of subject matter were eroding large plein air landscapes by the barbizon group were among the most impressive pictures in the salon not history paintings with high minded themes enacted by heroically scaled figures "origins of impressionism" traced how a handful of young french aesthetic hotheads including edouard manet paul cezanne claude monet and edgar degas ended up inventing modernism in response to the implications of shifting paradigms post "americans in paris" encompasses the glory years of impressionism from birth to dominance as an international style as well as the period when impressionisms descendants post impressionism and pointillism announced themselves but the great majority of american artists who flocked to paris in the later decades of the th century eager to polish their abilities acquire sophistication and establish their reputations were oblivious to modernism they painted paris streetscapes and interiors portraits of themselves and each other tackled important themes and exhibited at the expositions universelles and other "official" shows they learned a lot yet their aspirations remained conservative theres a lot of good painting in "americans in paris " but not a lot of good paintings there are exceptions including memorable works by such celebrated figures as john singer sargent thomas eakins james mcneill whistler winslow homer and mary cassatt the precocious sargent is a standout beginning with a zingy little view of an orchestra rehearsal all slashing strokes fluttering planes and fierce diagonals painted when he was he was a ripe newly returned from spain when he painted his and the shows masterpiece "the daughters of edward darley boit " four little girls and a couple of oversized blue and white ceramic vases in a shadowy interior filtered through memories of velazquezs "las meninas " he was still in his s when he painted the exhibitions notorious portrait of "madame x" mme pierre gautreau with her uncanny pallor daring decolletage and quirky profile and the informal portrait of his lifelong friend monet working out of doors the intimacy of this modest picture is startling as is sargents documented enthusiasm for monets art given the timidity of his own forays into impressionism mercifully absent here whistlers remarkably early "symphony in white no the white girl " the standing portrait of his red haired mistress joanna hiffernan announces him as a daring painter to be reckoned with but the only american to have fully participated in the impressionist movement was degass friend mary cassatt cassatt looks terrific here in a selection of major canvases that attest to her powers of structure and invention a portrait of her brother and his son fuses their black suits into an eloquent surprising silhouette while the blue armchairs of a crowded interior with a sprawling child become a japanese inflected complex two dimensional pattern cassatts domestic imagery plainly mattered to her but her compositions are also assured dialogues between shapes and the flat rectangle of the canvas other works suggest that most of cassatts compatriots in paris even the accomplished cecilia baux were cautious to the point of being reactionary surprisingly a bold confrontational self portrait by ellen day hale a fan of both manet and courbet suggests an openness to modernism if not a whole hearted commitment nothing however could be less modernist or more icky than elizabeth anne gardners "the shepherd david" c in which an adorable adolescent embraces an adorable lamb gestures heavenward and kneels on a dead lion get the symbolism the slippery finish demonstrates only too well how much gardner learned from her teacher and later husband william adolphe bouguereau on the plus side eakins looks powerful and straightforward like a dour american courbet although he turns out to have been improbably a devoted student of the arch academic jean leon gerome the african american expatriate henry ossawa tanner known for his visionary religious paintings adds another set of alternatives to the mix in the end modernism won out many painters coming to paris toward the close of the th century embraced impressionist methods as eagerly as their predecessors embraced academic values admittedly a bit late theodore robinson and john henry twachtman both used impressionism as the basis for a personal approach to the american landscape twachtmans pellucid "brook in winter" c with its shimmering all over whites was painted in greenwich conn but distills the lessons he learned in france still there were holdouts witness the portrait of rosa bonheur by her friend companion and admirer anna elizabeth klumpke the only thing not totally predictable about this pedestrian effort is its revealing that mlle bonheur looked like franz liszt who knew ms wilkin writes about art for
