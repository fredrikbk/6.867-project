business technology firms take a cue from youtube companies use online video to reduce costs communicate with staff last year monsanto co wanted to raise the visibility of some projects and go beyond statistics to make a case for bioengineered crops so the st louis agricultural products company took a page from youtubes playbook tom mcdermott a monsanto public relations manager sent camera crews to the philippines australia and other countries to film testimonials from farmers using monsanto products to grow genetically modified corn soybeans and other crops which are sometimes targeted for protests by environmentalists he then posted the clips on a monsanto web site hoping to attract attention from customers employees and policy makers today the site attracts more than visitors a month and monsanto is aiming to boost viewership to a month by late next year "when the people involved relate how their life has changed and you actually see it its far more compelling " mr mcdermott says

option to help cut costs and communicate " says colin dixon a research analyst for diffusion group a research firm "just from last year to this year theres been a significant jump " the rise partly reflects the work of small companies such as the feedroom inc reflect systems inc and vitalstream inc which offer services and technology that make it easier for companies to hop on the online video
