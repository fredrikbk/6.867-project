farmers cant be strong armed into giving up on growing poppies for heroin perhaps they can be persuaded to make something legal out of them such as codeine or morphine writing in the latest issue of washington quarterly political scientist peter van ham and jorrit kamminga an analyst for the senlis council a european think tank say a "poppies for peace" program could help stem the illegal trade in the war torn countrys poppy crops forced crop eradications have barely made a dent the harvest was nearly larger than the previous year and the practice might be driving disillusioned farmers to the taliban another approach encouraging farmers through subsidies to grow other crops or pursue other businesses entirely such as carpet weaving has had little success while subsidies can help strengthen the role of local governments it can take years to see any impact on drug cultivation a problem given afghanistans economic and political instability the authors suggest that afghan farmers expertise in poppy cultivation instead should be made the most of while persuading growers to leave the black market if afghanistans poppies turn out to be the appropriate kind for legitimate drugs mr van ham contends that there is enough demand in developing countries for opium based medicines to support a government licensed program for poppy cultivation similar to ones used in turkey india and france while afghanistan is unlikely to be able to completely cut off the flow of illegal poppies even a small shift would keep some illegal drugs off the market and away from warlords while raising

training is extremely popular but straightforward quotas still can have a much bigger impact the current issue of stanford social innovation review cites a university of california berkeley study of more than companies from to that showed that organizations with affirmative action programs boosted their employment of women and minorities far more than those that used mentoring and networking programs in fact diversity training which aims to eliminate systemic prejudice by teaching employees to identify their own biases proved to be the least effective method of increasing the representation of women and minorities diversity coaches focus on the hearts and minds of individuals sometimes blinds them to problems that range across an organization the studys authors say they found that setting quotas and charging internal committees with enforcing them companywide are far more likely to identify trends that can be missed by individuals or departments "i dont think that
