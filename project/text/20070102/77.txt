politics &amp economics calibrating a troop surge if more soldiers go to iraq how long should they stay washington for the bush administration deploying tens of thousands of additional troops to iraq may not be as tough a call as deciding when to bring them home white house officials say a troop "surge" almost certainly will be the centerpiece of mr bushs new strategy for iraq to be unveiled mid month but while administration officials have gone to great lengths to emphasize that the extra troops will be in iraq only temporarily there is no clear definition of how long that might be several democratic and republican lawmakers who endorsed the increase say they want the extra troops in iraq for just three to six months senior military commanders believe the extra forces can be sustained in iraq for only six to months before logistical and manpower strains become untenable gen peter schoomaker the armys chief of staff has told associates that months is needed to ensure a substantive effect echoing gen schoomakers concerns that iraqs militias would simply wait out a three or six month surge and then resume their violence a report by military historian frederick kagan argues that the troops should be in iraq for at least months the u s has about troops in iraq and the additional forces could total as many as the debate over how long the new forces should remain in iraq stems from tension between the political and military aspects of the emerging proposal mr bush has staked his presidency on iraq and several white house aides say they believe he would be inclined to leave the extra troops there until improvement is evident senior commanders by contrast have expressed concern that leaving extra troops too long risks lasting damage to the u s armed forces inside the white house officials are weighing an array of questions about the increase with a particular focus on how to integrate iraqi security forces into any expanded u s operations in troubled areas such as baghdad "there might be a need for an iraqi surge alongside an american one " national security adviser stephen hadley says in an interview cautioning that the administration hasnt yet decided to send new u s troops to iraq "were still working on the mix of options " the administrations high level deliberations about the size and duration of any potential surge have taken on added significance because both opponents and supporters of the war agree that u s influence in iraq is rapidly diminishing as iraq confronts a civil war and a faltering political process adding more u s forces could well be the administrations final real opportunity to stabilize the country "if we surge and it doesnt work its hard to imagine what we do after that " mr kagan says "but were already in a very bad spot and if we dont do anything defeat is imminent " still the militarys concerns run deep the long wars in iraq and afghanistan have already forced the army to play a shell game with troops and equipment to ensure that units in iraq are fully staffed and equipped the service has had to pull leadership and weaponry from returning units and rush them to units preparing to deploy while that has put units heading to iraq generally in good shape it has left large army brigades back home in disarray the shortages of leaders and equipment mean that the more troops the army sends to iraq now the fewer that will be available late this year or early in when the extra troops have to start returning home "the army says it can surge for somewhere on the order of a year " says daniel goure a defense analyst at the lexington institute who has been briefed by senior army officials on the services strains "but if that happens a year from now it wont be able to sustain even the current troop levels of " if violence worsens over the next year military commanders could face the task of stabilizing a chaotic country with far fewer troops than they have had during the past years of the conflict to mitigate this risk gen schoomaker has insisted that with a surge the army must be given more latitude to call up reservists for duty in iraq under current pentagon rules reservists can be called up only for months of cumulative service in iraq and afghanistan since the pentagon has burned through the vast majority of those part time soldiers gen schoomaker wants to be able to call up reservists for a second month tour even with wider access to the reserves army officials have said there will be a drop in the number of troops available for iraq duty in late and many reserve units which typically leave their equipment in iraq for those who are arriving are in an even worse state than the active forces some national guard units have only about of their equipment senior army officials say they estimate it could take as much as &# billion in additional spending over the next three years just to get those units back up to speed army officials also worry that if conditions in iraq dont improve they will face political pressure to keep the additional troops in the country longer than a standard one year deployment that could damage morale and make it far tougher to retain and recruit troops already the service missed its recruiting goals in and hit its numbers in only by lowering standards to meet its retention goals it shelled out more than &# million in additional bonuses army officials have warned that an exodus of experienced sergeants and officers already weary from multiple deployments could break the force gen richard cody the armys vice chief of staff has said the prospect of such an exodus is what "keeps him up at night "
