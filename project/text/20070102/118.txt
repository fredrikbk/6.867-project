mortgages loans and corporate bonds ended the year at compared with at the end of long term bond yields have been hovering below yields on short term treasury securities since mid july an unusual phenomenon because investors commonly require higher returns to compensate them for holding assets over a longer period this "inverted yield curve" and the fact that treasury yields are significantly below the benchmark federal funds rate of set by the federal reserve suggest that government bond investors expect the economy to slow markedly that could compel the fed to cut short term rates this

economists and fund managers "one of those signals has to be wrong and it makes me very nervous " says thomas atteberry a portfolio manager at first pacific advisors llc in los angeles the divergence in the debt markets can be traced to the feds decision last summer to halt its campaign of raising interest rates after increases that lifted its benchmark rate from in mid to in june in the second quarter a mixed bag of economic data and the feds fixation on inflationary pressures brought about by soaring energy and commodities prices raised fears among investors that further rate increases would end up choking expansion and corporate profits that sparked selloffs in the stock and corporate bond markets and sent long term yields which are the most sensitive to inflation rising to more

bond and loan issuance in the u s in "the credit markets are flush with cash and conditions are very good for another strong year " he says while the debt markets are likely to remain hospitable to borrowers the rising incidence of leveraged buyout deals and activities like stock buybacks that are financed with debt is souring some bond investors when a company issues more debt to pay for a buyout a share buyback or special dividend it raises its risk of default sending prices of its existing bonds lower and their yields higher many companies including tribune co and harrahs entertainment inc had their investment grade credit ratings slashed to junk last year because of such moves and more of these events are expected this year "its a negative for corporate bonds but the buyout trend will continue until there is a recession or defaults rise significantly and we dont see that happening in money is still very cheap " says gary rodmaker a bond fund manager at summit
