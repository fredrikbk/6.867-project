talk tech resolve to turn your ipod down if you are like most people your new years resolutions are along the lines of "lose weight" and "spend less time on the blackberry " but stefan heller has another one turn down the volume in your life dr heller is an expert on hearing at the stanford university school of medicine and will be speaking next month at a panel sponsored by the american association for the advancement of science called "hearing health the looming crisis and what can be done " much of that crisis it turns out is a result of the technology a lot of people spent time with on new years so what is the crisis there are three main causes of hearing loss one is that we get older another involves certain of the medicines we take the third involves sustained noises like from a walkman or an ipod these wear down the little cells in our ears cells that arent capable of regenerating themselves you have only in each ear and if one dies you have one less after a high impact noise sometimes they choose to die its called "apoptosis " and its a self defense mechanism to protect the body from things that go wrong can you actually kill some cells just from listening to a single cd on an ipod at top volume there probably are some people that can turn the volume of their ipods up to the limit and never have a problem but other people might do it once and wipe out their high frequencies and once that damage is done it will get progressively worse but you can only know which group you are in after youve lost your hearing there is a high frequency ring tone the kids use so that parents cant hear it i downloaded it at mosquitoringtones com and i cant hear it though my wife can we are the same age is there really an epidemic of hearing loss right now its anecdotal i know from my colleagues that a lot of rock musicians are in and out of the clinic its pretty clear that if you dont take care of your hearing youre going to have problems later on so should people give up mp players or loud home entertainment systems i like them too if you do it moderately its probably ok but if you really make it too loud its not healthy
