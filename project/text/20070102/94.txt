the afternoon report ford farewell washington and wall street put business aside for a day as the nation said its last farewell to president gerald ford who died last week at the age of with the government and financial markets shuttered for what president bush decreed a national day of mourning mr ford the nations th president was remembered with an elaborate memorial service at the washington national cathedral "in president ford the world saw the best of america and america found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nations history " mr bush said today mr ford served in the nations highest office only briefly taking the reins for just two and a half years after richard nixon resigned and ultimately losing the presidency to jimmy carter in in part because of voter outrage over his pardon of mr nixon but however abbreviated his tenure in the executive branch mr ford was a tireless civil servant who spent decades on capitol hill before assuming the vice presidency from another scandal tainted predecessor spiro agnew mr bush reflected that when mr ford became president "it was because america needed him not because he needed the office " indeed mr ford has often been credited with calming the nation and restoring the dignity of the presidency following the harrowing days of watergate tom brokaw the former nbc news anchorman praised mr ford for carrying "no demons no hidden agenda no hit list or acts of vengeance" to the oval office in a clear reference to the feeling of paranoia that pervaded the final days of the nixon administration but those who worked shoulder to shoulder with the late president reminded the thousands assembled in the national cathedral this morning that mr ford should be remembered for more than simply fixing a damaged office he should also be remembered for running it well former secretary of state henry kissinger hailed mr fords efforts to balance the nuclear arms race with the soviet union and to broker peace deals in the mideast "in his understated way he did his duty as a leader not as a performer playing to the gallery " mr kissinger said "gerald ford had the virtues of small town america " mr bushs father former president george h w bush also hailed mr fords small town aura calling him a "norman rockwell painting come to life " the senior mr bush also injected some levity into the somber proceedings by joking about the famous awfulness of mr fords golf game saying that mr ford knew it was getting better since he was pinging fewer spectators with his slices the service marked the final washington ceremony remembering mr ford his remains will be taken to michigan for a final public viewing and private memorial and be
