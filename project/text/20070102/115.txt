work therapy resolving a dispute with the bosss secretary special to the wall street journal editors note work therapy is an online feature that answers readers questions about managing workplace stress and anxiety send questions to worktherapy wsj com and please indicate whether you would like your name associated with the question q im pregnant and have been able to wear many of my nonmaternity clothes my bosss secretary sent me an email on workplace attire highlighting two sections on low cut shirts and undergarments she has regularly made comments to me about my clothing and weve had other issues that i have let slide i feel harassed what can i do a this problem has two parts one concerns your clothes and one concerns your relationship with the secretary both matter a lot if your clothes are inappropriate it might not be your bosss secretarys problem but it certainly is yours its important to dress appropriately for the workplace both because your companys policy might require it and because doing so helps keep people focused on your work not your clothes are there a couple of people you trust whom you can ask and who could give you an honest answer also ask your human resources department if there is a dress code once youve tackled this issue the next one is your relationship with your bosss secretary and really while the bosss secretary is critical of and overly interested in what youre wearing while youre pregnant if you take a step back the bigger problem with her is probably more about the repeated issues you two are having the ones as you wrote youve "let slide " "if you can get in the habit of dealing with things that bother you like this directly and immediately they wont sit there and fester " says stephen worchel a professor of psychology at the university of hawaii at hilo who specializes in conflicts at work "what i find happening to so many people at work is they say its so small im going to look petty if i say something and pretty soon theyre miserable the small problems have suddenly depreciated the quality of your work life " now after her repeated comments about your attire you have a problem that you cant dislodge from your head with a brisk walk around the building you have to deal with it and the way to do it is to talk to the secretary before you do however alert your boss that youre planning to approach the secretary about a memo she sent theres no need to be more specific than that the fewer people you involve the less likely the problem is to turn into an emotional office war between those who support you versus those who side with the secretary "that covers you so that the secretary doesnt go running to the boss saying i had this crazy conversation " says barbara bunker a psychologist and professor emeritus at university at buffalo the state university of new york though it may be hard to remain calm when talking to someone who has at least implied youre dressing inappropriately remember that the main reason you are having this conversation is to improve your relationship with the secretary youve said separately that your boss "believes her to be the most important person in the building " thats a strong reason to want to be able to work well with her dramatically accusing her of being against motherhood would depreciate your relationship even more when preparing to talk to someone who has been antagonistic say to yourself "this is probably an interesting person " says dr bunker "take an anthropologists stance be interested in what she says and thinks rather than be offended by her evaluation of you " go in prepared to talk about the letter beyond improving your relationship with the secretary there is also concrete information that needs to come out of this conversation by now you should have a good idea from other sources on where things stand with the clothing matter but you still want to clear the air with her "say i got your memo with parts of it highlighted " says dr bunker "since you highlighted them i assume that means theres a message you sent to me so ive come to be clear about it to find out what youre sending a message about " or as dr worchel suggests "i got this letter im surprised by it it certainly wasnt my aim to be provocative or inappropriate i want to be on the same team with you whats going on here " then step back and listen to what she has to say this does not mean that you have to start swathing yourself in high necked tent dresses every day hearing her opinions doesnt mean you have to change who you are some readers may be wondering why i did not suggest that you bypass a conversation with the secretary in favor of one with the human resources department why not forward her email to an hr manager who can take on the situation if you appeal to human resources before hearing what she has to say you may be making the problem better water cooler fodder than it has to be human resources is an option if you cannot salvage your relationship with the secretary by yourself and you may not be able to if after your conversation you are following the dress code and she keeps bothering you the problem needs to be mediated by a third party write to kayleen schaefer at worktherapy wsj com
