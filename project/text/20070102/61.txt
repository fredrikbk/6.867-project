net discrimination the two democrats on the federal communications commission finally let the at&amp t bellsouth merger proceed last week though not without some major political rent seeking at&amp t ceo edward whitacre had to agree to follow "net neutrality" mandates for two years after having once said that such a policy would be "nuts " he was right the first time but thats a matter between him and his shareholders and perhaps mr whitacre anticipates that after two years he will be able to return to charging market prices for the use of his broadband pipeline hed better hope that the policy precedent set by his merger concession doesnt become a battering ram for congress to make net neutrality permanent in the meantime he gets full control of cingular wireless which is where much of the telecom action now is the more important question in this episode is political have we been watching a return of the old democratic habit of using rhetoric about "equity" and "justice" as a front for carrying water for certain business interests over others net neutrality travels under the euphemism of "nondiscrimination " which sounds very nice but what it really means in practice is that the government dictates what at&amp t and other internet access companies can charge users of their pipelines so theres "discrimination " all right against the companies that have invested billions to lay that pipe the beneficiaries of this discrimination are google microsoft yahoo and other very rich web businesses which have loaded up on beltway lobbyists to have these mandates imposed democrats are taking the pac money and running interference the democratic commissioners jonathan adelstein and michael copps were able to extort this concession from at&amp t because one of the three gop commissioners recused himself from voting on the merger under pressure from democrats on capitol hill it was a nasty game of bad cop worse cop and it is probably a portent of things to come the one thing no one should be deceived about is that this ambush has anything to do with "consumers " internet users will benefit most from the rapid rollout of broadband which requires letting companies get a return on their investment net neutrality is all about imposing price controls that shake down one corporate player for the benefit of another see related letter "letters to the editor net neutrality a form of power to the people" wsj january
