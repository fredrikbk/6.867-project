investors riding the cash rapids plenty of money available much of it in riskier markets a world awash in cash helped drive share prices higher and fueled frenetic merger activity in but the river of money sloshing through the system is having other sometimes distorting effects in financial markets riskier assets such as emerging market debt are priced at only a small margin above much safer treasurys the same goes for junk rated corporate debt corporate debt defaults in the u s are at record lows just &# billion in one fifth the already low level of just one year ago according to standard &amp poors leveraged commentary &amp data the balm of cash has also quieted the stock market market volatility is exceedingly low emerging market stock markets are roaring up as a group from lows reached in according to data from hsbc plc the riskiest markets are leading the pack egyptian stocks are up fold since meanwhile money in alternative investments hedge funds private equity funds and the like now totals &# trillion according to data from j p morgan securities all that liquidity or cash available has pushed financial assets to heights world wide and driven investors into riskier corners of the market in search of better returns and even the most pessimistic economists and central bankers see little sign that the liquidity boom and the benign financial environment it has fostered will disappear soon barring some major shock to the system to have so much money moving around the globe is unusual at a time when global economic growth expectations are uneven and major central banks have raised short term interest rates "the most remarkable aspect of the contemporary economic recovery is the magnitude and persistence of liquidity " notes james paulsen in a report from wells fargos wells capital management in minneapolis "although the current recovery is seven years old the fed has been tightening for almost years and short term interest rates have increased times there is still very little evidence that liquidity has diminished " much of that confidence in the current environment stems from financial innovations and new financial players that have helped disperse risk more quickly and more broadly than ever before but even as market confidence grows some market participants express concern that the new financial technologies have not been substantially tested "there is a lower probability of a crisis " says dominic wilson director of global macro and markets research at goldman sachs group "but if a crisis were to happen it may be harder to sort out " in other words the very complacency about risk is rising to become a new risk itself central banks and the monetary policies they adopt play a big part in flooding markets with money it used to be that only a few central banks the fed the bank of japan and the european central bank really mattered now the peoples bank of china with &# trillion in reserves expected to double to &# trillion by and other asian central banks contribute to that flood of cash thrifty asians continue to keep their currencies tied to a weak dollar printing lots of yuan yen and other local currencies in the process to feed their export led growth they then save much of that surplus today their excess savings are joined by those of the oil exporters the cash reserves of oil producers in the middle east russia and norway which collectively produced a current account surplus of about &# billion this year also matter while asia gets a lot of attention the petrodollar surplus will be even bigger this year and half of it came just from the small countries of the gulf cooperation council according to data from ubs ag relatively low interest rates are one indication of how much money is around another is how easy it is to borrow money today it is arguably easier for the less creditworthy whether individuals companies or countries to borrow than ever before not that many need to american companies are no longer net savers as they have been for the past few years but u s companies still have enough net cash to "drive abnormally large stock buyback programs announce widespread dividend hikes and pursue cash heavy mergers and acquisitions " mr paulsen of wells fargo notes while the argument that things are different has always been dangerous many economists now subscribe to what goldmans mr wilson calls the brave new cycle or a cycle in which the ups and downs have become much more muted largely thanks to the stabilizing influence of new financial technology part of the reason there is such easy access to credit for troubled companies or cash strapped households is thanks to financial innovations for instance securitization takes lots of individual debt combines it and then chops it up into small manageable chunks that are then distributed far and wide so no single holder has significant exposures derivatives particularly in the oddly named credit default swap market which essentially insures the holders of debt against losses also play a big role in reducing the risk from lending money additionally there is a far more diverse universe of holders of debt now both at home and abroad banks matter less than they used to in the past banks tightening lending standards as their troubled loans increased often served to trigger a recession but now the biggest banks dont hold much debt having sold it on to others that leaves banks less likely to contribute to choking off the credit which drives economic growth as long as economic growth continues in the u s the prospect of market disruption is modest one area that persists as a concern however is the currency markets in particular the weakness of the dollar a surprising slowdown in the u s economy could lead the fed to cut interest rates undermining the value of holding dollars if other parts of the global economy continue to grow in the face of u s weakness and their central banks raise rates that could further damage the dollar the dollar also could fall victim to political pressures some market participants fret about rising protectionist sentiments in the u s something that could discourage foreign investors from holding dollars it is a slow burning issue but one that is giving rise to more concern "the time may well come when countries engage in capital transactions that divert flows away from financing the u s deficit " george magnus senior economic adviser for ubs notes in a recent report "this could occur not only as a result of rate of return considerations but as a result of policy decisions to shift asset composition away from us dollars " in the persian gulf countries sent only of their surplus abroad half the amount they sent in the past partly that is a reflection of more domestic investment opportunities but it is also partly due to such measures as the u s patriot act which acts as a disincentive to hold dollar assets according to ubs but for now the river of cash seems unlikely to suffer a dollar related drying up indeed it can be very hard to figure out what will end the flood of liquidity "what you really worry about is what you cant predict and therefore cant take measures to prevent " adds mr wilson in summary the issue financial markets have plenty of cash this "liquidity boom" has driven merger deals and benefited riskier investments whats next most experts see little hint that the cash will dry up soon bottom line the benign conditions will one day come undone but for now nobody can see how or why
