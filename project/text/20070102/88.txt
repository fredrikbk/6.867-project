profits likely to slow in for companies years of outsize growth may end new york for the past five years u s corporate profits have grown much faster than the overall economy one of several reasons why u s stock prices keep setting records but many economists believe that the days of outsize profit growth are nearing an end corporate profits as measured by the commerce department have risen more than a year since hitting a high of in in the third quarter of profit growth was running at an annualized rate of but the consensus forecast of economists polled by the wall street journal calls for those gains to slow to the single digits this year and next with pretax profits rising about that estimate is for profits across the entire economy from multinational conglomerates to mom and pop businesses by contrast profit figures tracked by wall street tend to focus mainly on large public companies but the trends are similar thomson financial for example expects growth in earnings per share for companies in the standard &amp poors stock index to slip below in if that forecast is on the mark it would be the first year of single digit growth for the s&amp p since "some of the hot air is coming out of corporate profits " says maria fiorini ramirez president of mfr inc in new york which is forecasting economywide profit growth of in "the better years are behind us and the leaner years are ahead of us " among s&amp p companies the energy sectors profit is estimated to have grown in but profits are expected to rise only in according to thomson which surveys wall street analysts and the profit growth forecast for the materials sector which includes metals and chemicals companies and whose profit growth for is estimated at has tumbled to for there are several reasons why economists expect profits to be leaner in the years ahead first and foremost they are expecting growth to slow in response to weakness in the manufacturing sector and in housing which will damp sales across the entire economy most economists are forecasting that the economy as measured by gross domestic product before adjustment for inflation will expand between and this year after growing in and in nominal growth in gdp for is expected to be about but even if gdp werent expected to slow economists would still be looking for profit growth to ease for the same reason that "trees dont grow to the sky " says jan hatzius an economist at goldman sachs group inc put another way profits cant continue to outpace the overall economy by such large measures for a sustained period historically annual growth rates for gdp and corporate profits have been about the same between and eventually say economists the relationship between gdp and profits should return to its historical norm "if corporate profits grew persistently faster than nominal gdp all of the income in the economy would eventually accrue to shareholders and none to workers however there are economic forces that ensure that this doesnt happen " says mr hatzius who forecasts corporate profit growth of in one of the lowest forecasts among the economists who participated in the wall street journals economic forecasting survey those forces include rising wage growth average hourly earnings after barely moving for years have rebounded in recent months and were up in november from a year earlier average weekly earnings were up benefits costs are also on the rise at the same time companies are finding it more difficult to raise prices to recoup their higher compensation costs in fact some companies are starting to reduce prices to keep consumers spending "price discounts are seen all across the retail space cars furniture electronics clothing and now have spillover to housing as well " says joseph carson chief economist at alliancebernstein such trends he says mean that "margin expansion is over " mr carson is forecasting profit growth of for there are other pressures on profit margins as well energy prices and prices for goods such as chemicals plastics and metals are likely to remain elevated amid healthy global demand taking a bigger bite out of proceeds from sales and slowing productivity gains in the u s could limit the ability of american companies to curb costs that all translates into less for the bottom line so far the stock markets performance doesnt hint of any slowing of profits the dow jones industrial average gained last year its best performance since of course growth in profits the consensus estimate for isnt so bad when compared with historical growth rates and in fact some economists believe that single digit profit growth still leaves room for stock prices to move higher gail fosler chief economist at the conference board a nonprofit business research group expects profit growth of just in nevertheless she expects stocks to continue to perform well in recent years foreign stock markets including those in europe and japan have recorded big gains that have outpaced the u s markets performance as a result she says u s stocks have become "a good value" relative to stocks of companies in other nations karen talley contributed to this article
