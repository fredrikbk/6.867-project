after big gains investors weigh stock strategies for coming year sentiment is mixed as concerns linger on economy inflation amid all the backslapping about last years bang up stock gains some investors and analysts are getting a little uncomfortable they note that almost all the markets rise came in the second half of the year and they worry that some of that surge may have come at the expense of this year if so they say investors could be in for a disappointing stock performance at the start of this year when trading resumes tomorrow stocks are closed today for the president ford day of mourning bonds trade but close early "it is quite possible that we have borrowed" some gains from says gordon fowler chief investment officer at philadelphia money management firm glenmede trust "it wouldnt be surprising to see the market cool off in the first quarter " there are two ways to look at this notion of "borrowed" stock returns figuratively and literally on the figurative side the repeated stock gains that sent the dow jones industrial average to a succession of record closes were based on a rosy view of the economic outlook that rosy expectation for low interest rates strong corporate profits and steady economic growth is built into stock prices now it will be hard for businesses and the economy to exceed those expectations and not difficult to fall short "it is hard to see the economic scenario getting any better from here " mr fowler says there is every risk that "something will happen that will put us off kilter" and send investor expectations back to earth on the literal side analysts point out that investors notably at sophisticated investment groups such as hedge funds boosted their borrowing in the second half of the year they used much of the borrowed money to buy stocks to keep up with unexpectedly strong market gains once the year ends the need to chase hot stocks in order to improve annual performance evaporates money managers will re evaluate their positions some in particular those who never fully believed in the rallys underpinnings may choose to cash in some profits shift their investments elsewhere and possibly reduce their borrowing this is particularly true of the many hedge fund and mutual fund managers who were trailing market performance in the fourth quarter they typically are compensated based on their yearly performance and a good number felt obliged to shift out of investment strategies they liked and chase market winners to avoid falling behind as the market took off many of them remain skeptical of the market gains and will be rethinking their positions "that will come back to the forefront of your mind come january " says stephen sachs director of trading at mutual fund group rydex investments in rockville md "you will say i firmly believe the market is overvalued and i am going to raise cash or i firmly believe that this company is undervalued and i am going to buy it again because i have a whole year now before i am going to have my performance figures checked " there is evidence that this kind of thing has happened in the past few years according to research by stock strategists at brokerage firm morgan stanley in the s january often was a big month for stock gains says morgan stanley stock strategist david mcnellis in part that reflected flows of retirement money into stocks but in the s the gains gradually began to shift toward the fourth quarter and in the current century the shift has accelerated while the fourth quarter averaged a gain from through the first quarter averaged a loss why the morgan stanley strategists believe it is partly because of hedge fund managers piling into the market in the fourth quarter trying to lift performance before the years end in addition companies and analysts have developed a tendency since the bear market of to low ball their profit forecasts at the start of each year back in the roaring s aggregate profits for all the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index almost always fell short of analysts january forecasts mr mcnellis says starting in they have come in above the january expectations in other words january guidance has a way of disappointing investors who then get happy surprises late in the year that would reinforce the tendency toward weaker stock performance in january and stronger gains at years end "we are definitely a bit cautious on the near term" stock outlook mr mcnellis says although he expects stocks to rise by year end many investors question this view thinking any stock problems will be minor "i wouldnt be surprised to see a fair amount of volatility in the first half of the year as peoples opinions become more solidified " says chris orndorff head of stock investment at los angeles investment management group payden &amp rygel but while economic growth will slow he says stocks arent overpriced compared with corporate profits "you can have a positive stock market for large companies even when the economy isnt roaring along " he says jason trennert managing partner of new york research firm strategas research partners says any early year selling could be short lived demand for stocks from cash rich private equity funds which buy publicly traded companies and take them private could outweigh any selling by hedge funds he says there is little doubt that some of the fourth quarter gains were fueled by borrowed money margin debt money borrowed from brokers to buy stocks was up from february through november according to data from ned davis research in venice fla it finished november at of gross domestic product the highest percentage level since november borrowing accelerated in the autumn at "long short" hedge funds those that buy some stocks and bet that others will decline by borrowing and selling them in hopes that they will be cheaper later according to data from dow jones hedge fund indexes those same funds shifted more than half their assets to "long" stock positions bets that stocks would rise by november the data showed "a lot of hedge funds have felt the need to get into the market " says analyst ed clissold at ned davis research
