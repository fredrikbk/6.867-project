to pop culture web site icv another boost for the industry has come from hollywood which has turned to comic books to create movies in recent years such as "spider man" and "superman " as well as some

china themed story co created by mr woo the director to buyers of cds or dvds at virgin megastores the project is the brainchild of mr devarajan of virgin comics and gotham chopra son of mr chopra the self help author mr devarajan had already been running another company gotham entertainment group llc which has been distributing u s comic books from marvel dc comics and the like to south asia since the two men concluded that indian mythology with its notions of spirituality destiny and reincarnation was rife with stories that could meet the recent appetite in the west for everything asian in they set up a studio of artists in bangalore in southern india to create these comics while india is increasingly creating computer animation for hollywood movies like "the chronicles of narnia " mr devarajan says theirs is an attempt to showcase original indian creativity their breakthrough came late in when mr branson agreed to invest in the bangalore studio and launch virgin comics the comics take traditional stories and try to make them contemporary and cross cultural for instance in "devi " the lead character tara looks nothing like the traditional sari wearing hindu goddess indeed she wears body hugging outfits hangs out at bars and is dating a big beefy guy and in "snake woman " which is based on an indian legend the eponymous lead character is a los angeles resident named jessica peterson who is also the adopted child of a british man her roommate jin wears a t shirt with a big chinese character on it indias shekhar kapur best known for directing the film "elizabeth" starring cate blanchett helped create the "snake woman" story line the company also hopes to develop online videogames mr devarajan says the company this year will start work on developing a multiplayer role playing game based on the epic ramayana which tells the story of a god who is banished from his kingdom and spends years fighting evil forces that can be played by hundreds of people at the same time "ramayana is like the lord of the rings " mr devarajan says
