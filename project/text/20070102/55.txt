leisure &amp arts a cultural conversation with william boyd a serious comic novelist at home in the world london in his new novel "restless" bloomsbury usa william boyd makes a departure into spy fiction still all the familiar touches are here his heroines a mother and the daughter to whom she divulges her secret past move easily between continents and times from pre war new york to s oxford as in his "an ice cream war " about a ridiculous military campaign in east africa on the margins of world war i the book sheds light on a forgotten corner of history a covert british effort to drag america into world war ii before pearl harbor written with a light touch the novel nonetheless declares its larger ambitions in the epigraph from proust on mortality the proust quotation is also a testament to the authors erudition so says the author himself with a smile mr boyd is a serious novelist without serious pretensions a standout from an impressive british generation that came of writing age some years ago his description of "the so called british character " made in the course of a conversation at his corner row house in londons chelsea neighborhood seems to apply best to him "i think we are ironic we dont like people who are pompous were very self deprecating " in his fiction mr boyd can seem restless as well setting his stories in post colonial africa the turn of the century philippines los angeles and new york of various eras the trenches of both sides of world war i s paris and berlin and in the french countryside which is now his second home he can do full bore comedy like his popular debut "a good man in africa " as well as historical sweep his last big critical success "any human heart" in is the diary of one logan mountstuart a small man who witnesses some of the crucial turns in the th century a recurring interest for mr boyd that also gives shape to "restless " "brazzaville beach " about a female primatologist in western africa delves deeply into biology and math his own slightly self mocking definition of a novel "its the sum of everything a novelist is interested in at the time of writing " mr boyd was born to scottish parents in ghana in and raised there and in nigeria before being packed off to one of "these strange institutions " a british boarding school at nine his father a doctor spent his entire career in africa making mr boyd "the last of a line" to fully experience that "british colonial thing " because he never had a good answer to the "where are you from " question "im from ghana but im not from ghana" he has been fascinated by identity and the role of pure chance in life eva delectorskaya the protagonist of "restless " is a russian emigre in france who finds herself spying for the british in america "i feel genuinely but not in a negative way deracinated " he says "i facetiously say im an afro scot which in a way separates me and defines me " though his early life was rootless mr boyd settled years ago in london with his wife susan to whom all his books are dedicated in this choice of exile he was true to his scottish blood he says in a paraphrase of dr johnson that "the fondest sight that ever greeted the scotsmans eye was the high road to london " in another small departure the action of the next novel will take place in london which was the setting for only one other novel "armadillo " a black comedy dressed up as a mystery thriller about the seamy underside of the city mr boyd says he was late to realize that london with its size and age and diversity is "as exotic a place as you could find it is a terrifying place too im interested in the idea of disappearing here were so surveyed the paper trail that we live is so phenomenally complex then i think you can go underground in london i want to investigate the lowest stratum of society hidden from us which is violent and vicious and feral " his hero will through bad luck lose literally everything any connection to todays terrorism scares or politics in the british capital would be incidental if that just as "restless " though calling into doubt churchills idea of a "special relationship" between the u s and britain isnt he insists meant as a commentary on the iraq war which took place long after the book was conceived he opposes the war but mr boyds stories are neither political nor especially moralistic in any case he works hard to make sure theyre hard to date with "a good man in africa " mr boyd declared himself a worthy successor to evelyn waugh and kingsley amis he has welcomed that comparison naturally while trying to stretch himself yet though he experiments with form in short stories and sarcasm is never far from the surface mr boyd has always stayed grounded in realism and clear of stylized prose in his novels some critics consider him an "old fashioned" storyteller a description he pushes back against "its like saying a figurative painter is an old style painter " he says "the tradition of realism the realistic novel is equivalent to figuration in painting you wouldnt say to lucian freud you see yourself as an old fashioned painter the posed human body has been there and will be there just as the realistic novel has been there and will be the dominant form because the great thing about the novel is it does the human condition better than any other art form if you think im going to be an abstract painter kind of novelist i think you sacrifice something fundamentally a novel is about story and character if you chuck them out you have to be a particular kind of genius to engage the reader "for me writing a novel is about liberating my imagination while for someone like philip roth it is exploring the life and times and mind of philip roth " id mentioned that roth for example takes a predominantly male point of view while mr boyd often gives leading roles to women often writing them in first person "to have changed sex if you like " he continues "is perhaps the ultimate liberation of the imagination the thing to do is to ignore gender to ignore sexuality and sexual politics and the perceived differences between men and women and concentrate exclusively on that persons character and nature " in the boydian universe life is not a tragedy but a chekhovian farcical tragicomedy which he supposes goes back to his upbringing and early influences including joseph hellers "catch " and another but largely forgotten american novel "the sophomore" by barry spacks "i think i am a serious comic novelist in that my world view my philosophy is comic that this is an absurd and farcical place or as nabokov said a good laugh is the best pesticide the comic spirit if you like is to puncture grandiosity and to diminish to expose folly and pretention and to see the world as it is living in africa maybe heightens that sense in a way theres no huffing and puffing and standing on your dignity life will get you in the end " ian mcewan once said that british writers were too busy trying to make a buck to aspire to the "great british novel " "the concept doesnt sit well " agrees mr boyd marveling that some american writers like the late william styron or thomas pynchon spend a decade or more between novels he writes one every three to four years and in between stays busy doing journalism making films and writing short stories he says dickens and trollope set a standard in british literary life through their sheer writing energy "youre writing an oeuvre " he says "the more you do the more interesting it is in a way its all these things not just one totemic work that sums everything up " still mr boyd keeps his distance from the london literary scene which he makes sound like an oxymoron "novelists are not gregarious as a group of people " he says "a roomful of novelists is fixing with tension and suspicion whereas a roomful of actors is fun " a contemporary of enfants terribles martin amis julian barnes and mr mcewan mr boyd keeps a lower nicer profile he didnt have a famous novelist father mr amis never got swept up in a plagiarism scandal mr mcewan twice and never fought a literary feud messrs amis and barnes or a divorce mr amis again out in public but he belongs in this company which revived british fiction before their arrival he notes the best british writers of the s and s harold pinter tom stoppard howard brenton wrote plays not novels writing opened the door to films and hollywood mr boyd claims not to have been seduced "compared with what you can do in a novel film is rudimentary fundamentally theres only one point of view the camera alone " he retreated to independent european cinema after a purge at universal ruined six months of work on a movie about the gunpowder plot which if it had been made "would have been a prescient film about terrorism " he says in guy fawkes and others conspired to bomb parliament to protest the oppression of catholics "hollywood pits writer against writer which is a terrible thing " he says as a result perhaps his europeans in america are seduced amazed pushed around sometimes outright brutalized by the place john james todd the filmmaker in "the new confessions " gets blacklisted in the s in "any human heart " the enraged father of a young girl that the aging mountstuart then living in new york just bedded cant think of a worse insult than "loser " for mr boyd the scene gives one small insight into the values gap that separates the two sides of the atlantic "to be called a loser is a real mark of cain in america but in europe it makes you quite an interesting person " he says in serious old age mountstuart finds serenity and peace in penury in a small french village with a vineyard and second home in bergerac mr boyd himself takes refuge in france which "more than any other country or people have got the business of quality of life sorted from the cup of coffee to the glass of wine to the place you consume them to the culture that surrounds them " he also admires its republicanism "why i like america as well " but isnt a blind francophile "its a wonderful american word attitude the french have more attitude than americans or the british theres a presentation of self that happens in france that sometimes is utterly preposterous and sometimes irritating theres a sort of self dramatization that doesnt happen here we seem less troubled with ourselves and so much the better " but "itd be a terrible world if we were all the same " mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
