forging a new market in india steelmakers see huge potential but development proves difficult new delhi steelmakers are betting that fast growing india with its low production costs and rich raw material reserves will be the next hot spot for making and selling their products many however are discovering that poor infrastructure and bureaucracy stand in the way of significant expansion south korean steel maker posco has been unable to reach parts of the construction site of a planned &# billion steel plant in the indian state of orissa because locals who are opposed to development by outsiders had blocked entrances meanwhile rotterdam based steel giant mittal steel co controlled by the family of india born lakshmi mittal is reconsidering plans to build a plant in the state of jharkand because of quibbling over iron ore leases last month it announced an agreement to construct a &# billion project instead in orissa the situation has set back mittals plans to start steel production in india the troubles underscore indias fundamental difference from china the growth engine that has helped the steel industry reach a third year of strong profits after a period of red ink and overcapacity the worlds steelmakers dont want to miss out on the next big surge from a massive developing country but they are discovering that india can be a tougher place for businesses than centralized development minded china india consumed million metric tons of steel last year compared with chinas million metric tons according to the international iron and steel institute in brussels but india has huge reserves of iron ore a key steelmaking ingredient and the nations half dozen major domestic steel companies are expanding production still steelmakers both local and international are running into roadblocks sometimes literally they face opposition in rural areas from local leaders armed leftist and villagers who dont want to give up land for economic development vinod garg executive director for marketing at ispat industries ltd in navi mumbai says it is easier to buy or expand production at existing plants than to build new ones as proposed by both posco and mittal "people have got emotional attachments to their land " mr garg says "it is taking a long time " to build steel plants in remote regions of india infrastructure is another issue ispat industries led by lakshmi mittals younger brothers primod mittal and vinod mittal says it costs &# to ship a metric ton of steel by land from mumbai to new delhi which is roughly the same to ship it from mumbai to new york or europe export policies and iron ore leasing rights also hurt steelmakers the state and federal governments in india dont allow foreign or domestic steel companies to export iron ore for a profit however iron ore miners and traders with rights to reserves are able to sell abroad which incenses the steel makers partly because of these obstacles and partly because they want to expand their global footprints some steel makers in india are going abroad tata steel ltd is attempting to buy british steel maker corus group plc and steel plants in other parts of asia essar steel ltd is building a steel plant in trinidad jindal steel &amp power ltd has a steel operation near houston and has purchased iron ore reserves in bolivia ispat has bought plants in nigeria bulgaria and

such as using steel for rural bridges and toilet blocks in rural areas as well as for apartment buildings in residential areas steelmakers are training architects and builders to use steel rather than concrete in constructing bridges houses and outhouses they are also building a prototype "bullock cart " a traditional cart used to haul fruits vegetables and other local goods to market out of steel instead of wood to show farmers in rural areas that steel is sturdier than wood mumbai based essar a growing unit of the essar group industrial company plans to open as many as home depot style retail stores to sell steel products to builders and do it yourselfers "an entire generation of architects and builders didnt learn to work with steel " says vikram amin marketing director for essar steel he
