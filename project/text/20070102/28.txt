where the company operates many eating disorder advocacy groups report that they regularly receive calls from patients and families who have exhausted their insurance coverage and have racked up thousands of dollars worth of bills marc lerro executive director of the washington d c based eating disorders coalition says he gets about nine calls a week from people seeking advice on how to pay for treatment "theyre spending down their savings mortgaging their homes cashing in their retirement accounts " he says now a growing number of families and patient advocates are fighting back encouraged by medical expert opinions that say eating disorders though a mental illness have a biological component dr thomas r insel the director of the governments national institute of mental health wrote in a recent letter to the national eating disorders association an advocacy group based in seattle that anorexia has "a biological core with genetic components " the letter is posted at

recommendations patients should ask their doctors for letters of support stating why a specific course of treatment is necessary and stressing the medical repercussions of the illness and mail these to their employer and the medical director of their insurance company while accurate data are hard to come by experts estimate about million people in the u s of whom are female suffer from either anorexia or bulimia and many millions more may suffer from binge eating disorder females with anorexia are times more likely to die than other women their age in the general population the most common causes of death are suicide or physical complications of the disorder such as cardiac arrest resulting from electrolyte imbalances many patients dont need hospitalization and can deal with their issues with a therapist or in outpatient treatment but those who do need inpatient care may require three to nine months or more in an eating disorder unit of a hospital or a private treatment facility typically this type of treatment can cost between &# and &# a day visits with therapists and nutritionists plus medicine for anxiety or depression can add tens of thousands of dollars to the total bill experts say only about half of the patients diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia fully recover and the earlier the diagnosis the better the chances many people struggle with these diseases for decades even some who have undergone treatment insurance coverage of the disorders isnt standardized and depends largely on both the insurance carrier and the health care plan an employer purchases when a patient is so sick she needs to be hospitalized to stabilize organ functions the care usually is covered as a biological illness but once doctors determine that a patients physical health is steady often when she reaches a certain percentage of her ideal body weight such as the disorder then is classified by the insurance company as a mental illness at this point though the underlying cause of the illness may not have been addressed most insurance plans place tighter limits on mental health benefits typically allowing for between days for an hmo and days for a ppo of psychiatric inpatient hospitalization per year some insurers cover less about states have so called mental health parity laws which prohibit insurers from discriminating between mental and physical illnesses many require insurance carriers to cover treatment for mental and emotional disorders that are biologically based such as depression or bipolar disorder yet only about a dozen of these laws specifically include eating disorders another problem unlike for many mental illnesses there are no drugs approved to treat eating disorders so a successful course of treatment is often individualized and hard to predict insurers say they follow the american psychiatric associations guidelines for treatment of eating disorders but that they are reluctant to pay for extended treatment because there is no research that shows that longer treatment produces better results "in todays environment the real question has to be what does the evidence show " says susan pisano spokeswoman for the health insurance association of america an industry group when insurance runs out the expense can be devastating to pay for his daughters care mr hall says he has charged about &# on credit cards and cashed
