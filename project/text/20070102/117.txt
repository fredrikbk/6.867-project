worst presidents economically lets reconsider for a minute your otherwise superb editorial obituary for my former boss gerald r ford was marred by your jejune comments on who the three worst presidents of the century about economic policy were in your opinion "president ford " dec you listed hoover as worst if you think he had a thing to do with causing the great depression you could not be more wrong his policies were far from perfect especially on trade but the great depression was caused by monetary mismanagement at the federal reserve as was thoroughly detailed by milton friedman and anna schwartz in their brilliant "a monetary history of the united states " you list nixon as second worst and here i am of course partisan because i worked for mr nixon as a speech writer and lawyer and my father your very very long time contributor was a member of his council of economic advisers and then chair and certainly mr nixon under great prodding from congress and from john connally did make the mistake of wage price controls in but he quickly abandoned them as unworkable and unsound you probably are angry at him because he cut the link of gold to the dollar a move that every single mainstream economist on the planet agrees with i know you think it was a mistake but you are now in a very small club in that regard its worth noting that hourly wages adjusted for inflation hit an all time high under mr nixon still not equaled mr nixon was also the last republican president to have a budget surplus i know you think thats meaningless but to those who have actually studied economics instead of reading about it on napkins its not as to your third choice for worst jimmy carter ill leave that for a democrat to refute i was a columnist for the journal in and also wrote editorials then as now the editorials were superb on every subject except economics an interesting situation for a journal about business never mind i would crawl through deserts to read the paper every day happy new year ben stein beverly hills calif mr steins father the late herb stein was chairman of richard nixons council of economic advisers and a long time contributor to the wall street journal see related letter "letters to the editor nixons successors left holding the bag" wsj jan
