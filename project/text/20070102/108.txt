the middle seat flying gets rough on regional airlines smaller affiliates of the major carriers are topping the lists for cancellations late arrivals and baggage mishaps operations at several big regional airlines the carriers that feed millions of passengers to mainline airlines deteriorated sharply last year with late flights lost baggage and cancellations soaring the slipping service at some regionals is the result of explosive growth and cost cutting some airlines have found themselves with schedules too tight to load and unload planes without delays and with no cushion to catch up since mainline airlines typically control the scheduling of their regional partners the small jet airlines have been whacked with flight cancellations at hub airports to make room for the mainline airlines bigger planes when bad weather or construction slow traffic over the past years as financially strapped big airlines have turned over more flying to cheaper partners and small jets have become a mainstay for travelers regional airlines have doubled in size making them an increasingly important part of travel in the u s many dont just fly to small towns they fill in airline schedules on routes as big as new york chicago and boston washington but they are increasingly dragging down the nations air travel "it never goes good they are useless " said traveler willy schmieder who arrived at the atlanta airport for a a m atlantic southeast flight to wisconsin to visit his parents at the holidays his flight was delayed multiple times by morning fog then canceled by a mechanical breakdown at p m he was told to come back the next day he did and his flight was only an hour late in the third quarter last year four of the six airlines with the worst on time records were regionals in october the most recent month reported by the department of transportation the six worst carriers in baggage were all regionals and six of the seven airlines that canceled flights most frequently were regionals comair owned by delta air lines inc dropped to on time from a year earlier american eagle owned by amr corp s american airlines canceled flights three times as frequently as its parent airline in october skywest inc s atlantic southeast airlines another delta feeder was the worst airline in on time performance in the third quarter with only of its flights arriving within minutes of schedule compared with a year earlier some problems have resulted from unexpected changes a faster passenger train at the dallas airport means passengers can now make connections faster than their bags resulting in more mishandled baggage for american eagle a spokesman said also higher passenger loads and longer flights in small jets mean baggage is more frequently left behind so the planes loaded with fuel arent overweight regional airlines say they are scrambling to fix the problems by spreading out schedules and increasing the weight small jets can carry though operations last year were worse than historical averages regional carriers say structural differences mean they are unlikely to perform as well as bigger airlines while bigger airlines fly across the country regionals are usually confined geographically operating out of one or two hubs when bad weather strikes the carriers entire operations can be affected in addition being subservient to a larger airline can hurt the major carrier can force cancellations at the regional to open takeoff and landing slots for bigger airplanes so the most passengers get moved the main airline can also force regional flights to wait for passengers in atlanta in october of delta flights arrived on time but only of atlantic southeast flights did in washington of ual corp s united airlines flights arrived on time but only of the flights of its partner mesa airlines inc did same for american in chicago where of mainline american flights arrived on time in october compared with only of eagle flights comair which historically has ranked well in dot standings says its problems began last summer with deltas major expansion at new yorks kennedy airport dropping lots of new comair flights into jfk an airport already jammed with jetblue airways corp a major american operation and the afternoon and evening rush of european flights meant the time airplanes spent taxiing in a conga line to takeoff increased said don stephens comairs vice president of system planning for now comair has convinced delta to space out regional flights more at jfk and add minutes to schedules to more accurately reflect trip times comair has also bulked up its crew base at jfk to have more pilots and flight attendants available atlantic southeast at the bottom of on time performance says it too is increasing staffing to try to improve it also says its making cockpit modifications that allow for landing in lower visibility expanding gate areas and investing in better hand held radios and clocks that make it clear how close a flight is to departure for ramp workers "we are starting to turn the corner " said anthony dinota vice president of atlantic southeasts atlanta operation american eagle says it tried to cram more flights into its schedule in so it could grow without buying new aircraft that meant flying planes more each day and turning them around more quickly between flights "in some cases we stretched too far " said spokesman dave jackson the airline also ran into a problem with its embraer jets which carry passengers the airplane one third of the eagle fleet often was overweight taking baggage off meant lots of mishandled bags for customers eagles mishandled baggage rate was up in october from a year earlier to help the airline has been modifying its e jets so they can carry an additional pounds mr jackson said turbulence regional airlines have been plagued by service troubles recently including an uptick in delays and lost luggage heres what you can do consider driving if youre within miles of your destination or connecting airport book longer connection times to make sure you and your bags make the next flight avoid regionals altogether and book mainline flights only
