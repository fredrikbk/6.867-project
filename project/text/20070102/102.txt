for the e mail here speaker to be nancy pelosi and fellow democrats have made a lot of promises about their first hours in control of congress and to assure their incoming majority doesnt go the way of napoleons days back in charge a judicious mix of partisan and bipartisan actions of somewhat limited ambition seems to be in the works ms pelosi is scheduled to take up her gavel on thursday and while democrats promised after their nov victory to allow republicans full participation in deliberations ms pelosi and incoming majority leader steny hoyer have decided to sideline the opposition from what the washington post calls the first burst of lawmaking in a strategy finalized over the holidays the democratic leadership plans to use house rules to keep the opposition from blocking speedy passage of their bills by offering alternative measures "the episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power the democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after years in the minority while honoring their pledge to make the th congress a civil era in which democrats and republicans work together to solve the nations problems " the post says "yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning reelection and expanding their majority the democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics republicans used the past several years " that said the democrats make no claim to starting a revolution a la newt gingrich and his band of newly installed republicans following the midterm election they dont intend to amend the constitution or eradicate federal agencies as the los angeles times notes but then the democrats offer a vision that adheres rather than radically opposes historical views of what governments should do they intend to break the "link between lobbyists and legislation" by addressing lobbyist gifts and legislative earmarks an aim likely to find some opposition from fellow democrats re establish the "pay as you go" rules long championed by alan greenspan in a bid to have "no new deficit spending " though these rules were often circumvented even when they were in effect implement recommendations from the commission including the screening of all imported cargo raise the minimum wage and lower medicare prescription drug rates by repealing a ban on government price negotiations with drug companies even some republicans are expected to give this program a warm reception the times reports but the agenda also includes proposals like an overturning of president bushs limits for research on the medical use of embryonic stem cells what the new york times describes as a return to some of the biggest washington battles of the last decade but as the l a times notes the countrys deeper problems like the looming fiscal problems of social security and the war in iraq a conflict americans want congress to take the lead on according to polls dont figure prominently among the new initiatives iraqi refugees gen casey hussein and maliki that doesnt mean iraq wont headline half a dozen high profile hearings in both the house and senate and beyond the obvious question of how to refashion u s strategy for the war at least one panel the senate subcommittee on immigration border security and refugees plans to look at how the u s is treating iraqis who were persecuted for helping americans sen edward kennedy the incoming chairman of that committee plans such a hearing at a time when advocates for refugees and even some u s officials say theres an urgent need to let more iraqis into the u s the new york times reports "until recently the bush administration had planned to resettle just iraqis this year a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month " the times says on a related front the times reports that gen george casey the top american commander in iraq now appears likely to leave that post in february or march rather than next summer as previously scheduled gen casey had long opposed the deployment of more u s troops to iraq arguing that would just delay the needed shift of responsibility to iraqi forces but last month he stopped opposing such a troop increase apparently in line with white house plans to augment the american contingent as part of president bushs latest revision of strategy the administrations failure to foresee the spread of sectarian violence in iraq is at least partly responsible for the collapse of previous strategies senior officials in washington and baghdad tell the times the expedited execution of saddam hussein over the weekend only seems to have fanned the flames of sunni shiite hatred and the iraqi government has ordered an inquiry into why guards were allowed to taunt and film the late dictators final moments before the hanging the times of london reports one big issue the hanging didnt resolve newsweek says is the u s s inability to find a way of replacing mr husseins "ruthless efficacy" with a different means of keeping iraq unified the wall street journal suggests the government of prime minister nouri al maliki hasnt provided such an alternative it was hoped that as the head of iraqs first elected parliamentary government mr maliki would rise above his shiite roots and close the "sectarian chasm" with sunnis as the journal notes "but as iraq moves closer to full scale civil war a look at mr malikis history of shiite activism suggests he is ill prepared to be a true unifying figure " the paper says "on his watch iraq has become further polarized along sectarian lines significantly complicating the u s efforts to reduce the violence " an ambitious agenda for the new at&amp t at&amp t plans to market new

internet clients the journal says at the same time a key concession on the bellsouth deal made to the federal communications commission may rein in some of at&amp ts other ambitions and those of its rivals at&amp t essentially capitulated on the issue of "net neutrality" rules that require telecom companies to give equal treatment to all internet traffic from the webs backbone to consumers computers supporters of those rules say the at&amp t accord sets out what the journal calls "a template for future legislation and may at least temporarily hinder hopes of other telecom and cable companies from monetizing their internet lines by charging companies such as google inc or amazon com inc to give their traffic priority and faster service " also of note associated press violence
