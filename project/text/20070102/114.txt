why clean up your desk delight in disorder instead a perfect mess by eric abrahamson and david freedman little brown &amp co pages &# one of my colleagues at the economist is famous for the state of his desk it is not just that the desk is piled high with a jumble of books papers magazines and notebooks that is par for the course in the journalistic world no he has achieved distinction with the array of extraneous objects that find their way into the jumble pairs of trousers pots of honey jars of marmalade all appear from time to time without rhyme or reason hang around for weeks or even months and then equally mysteriously disappear none of this jumble gets in the way of his doing his job his copy arrives on time his writing is smooth and winsome he puts the right facts in the right order the wheels of the economist whirr on regardless jars of marmalade or no jars of marmalade "a perfect mess" in its way a defense of my colleague is an engaging polemic against the neat police who hold so much sway over our lives for all too many people neatness is a virtue in and of itself the ceos who appear on the cover of business magazines inevitably gaze out at their conquered worlds from perfectly neat offices with perfectly tidy desks americans pay millions of dollars every year to neatness experts the national organization of business organizers boasts more than members general motors and united parcel service are among many u s companies with formal "clean desk" policies there is more than a touch of calvinist severity about office managers everywhere as they cast a cold eye of suspicion on the untidy workers in their charge eric abrahamson and david freedman note in "a perfect mess" that the costs of being neat and well organized frequently outweigh the benefits if this is true for mundane things like tidy desks it is even truer with big things like organizations businesses can become so focused on transforming their internal processes into studies in neatness setting crystal clear objectives strategic planning or removing organizational clutter re engineering that they forget to focus on their real business but messrs as it is especially pleasing to call them abrahamson and freedman go on to make a larger claim that mess actually has its uses most messy desks conceal an underlying order messy desk owners usually know how to lay their hands on important documents among the jumble mess can serve as an efficient filing system the least pressing documents can be shoved to the bottom of the pile and mess can also serve as a valuable time saver the sloppy desk liberates the desk owner to focus on more important things all that time spent straightening piles of paper or working your way diligently through memos messages and mailings could be better used to crunch numbers or to think of a shrewd way of marketing widget this indisputable truth sets our authors off on a hymn of praise to mess mess can be a catalyst of creativity they argue and neatness can be a symptom of sterility they observe that great creative thinkers like albert einstein reveled in mess "if a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind " the great man once said "of what then is an empty desk " they speculate that great cities like los angeles are exciting precisely because they avoid detailed planning the authors praise messy organizations for their ability to satisfy quirky customers or adapt to a dynamic environment the new england mobile book fair for instance a boston based bookshop has thrived despite not putting its books in any particular order people like the deep discounts and the chance to browse randomly the authors note that much modern art from james joyce to jasper johns seems to celebrate disorder and confusion which all becomes a little too much after a while the problem with "a perfect mess" is that it suffers from a bad dose of malcolm gladwell disease like the author of "the tipping point" and "blink " messrs abrahamson and freedman are not content to throw out an interesting observation they have to pump it up to hundreds of pages of pseudo scientific prose classifying mess into different varieties clutter mixture inconsistency blur roaming around the worlds of chaos theory and urbanology and above all regurgitating hundreds of examples we hear about clusty com a search engine that returns not just web pages that match your exact queries but other pages that might be useful about confusion a canadian restaurant that jumbles multiple cuisines and about arnold schwarzenegger who we are told does not have a schedule yet the more the authors belabor their point the more they provoke doubts isnt technology radically reducing the cost of order over the past few days i have transformed a messy cd collection into an impeccably cataloged music library with almost no effort courtesy of an ipod blackberrys have allowed even distracted managers to clean out their email backlog while riding on an elevator and doesnt everything depend on context nobody minds if an eccentric journalist has a chaotic desk but what about a banker or an accountant messrs abrahamson and freedman ignore one of the most obvious costs of messiness the way that small breaches of order such as a broken window can encourage much bigger breakdowns this insight has guided city governance most notably in new york under rudy giuliani and may apply as well to say the branch office of a printing firm the worker who loses a simple order form under a pile of junk may also be the one who lets a vital contract slip out of the companys hands "a perfect mess" is a godsend to anybody who has a cleanliness fanatic for a boss the authors claim that howell raines the former editor of the new york times once upbraided an employee for the state of his desk which is reason enough to celebrate his departure from that newspaper the book is also a godsend for anyone who is already finding it hard to keep a new years resolution about being tidier the only pity is that the authors have tried too hard to turn a clever insight into a tidy theory i would have preferred a shorter book and a messier one mr wooldridge is washington bureau chief of the economist and the author with john micklethwait of "the right nation conservative power in america" penguin press
