the new design the relevance of good design eight key principles guide the new look for journal retain depth completeness good newspaper design has always been a combination of utility and aesthetics but never has getting that mix right been more important todays readers are inundated with information hours a day many of them come to their newspaper already knowing the main headlines looking for interpretation and understanding of events or for "discovery" news things they didnt already know but are glad to learn they want both substance and efficiency the wall street journal that premieres today delivers those basic elements and far more over months the journal has meticulously rethought and redesigned the paper to highlight what readers value most and innovate in ways that will serve them better we were guided in the redesign by these eight principles  make it easier for readers to navigate the journal the journal long has been a pioneer in this area with its famous "whats news" columns on page one pointing to key stories inside the paper but we have introduced new more visual guideposts at the top of each section front and labeling on every page  create a hierarchy of stories so readers know the relative importance of news the size of headlines and the placement of stories within the architecture of a page should make it clear to readers what stories matter most to help them prioritize their reading  maintain the best visual traditions of the journal readers of the wall street journal like the papers traditions the year old "whats news" columns the serendipity of an offbeat feature on the front page the hand drawn stipple portraits readers should recognize their journal  remember that journal readers come to read not to look we wanted to steer readers to the strong content inside with new display pages inside the newspaper to showcase the authoritative long form journalism that people expect of the journal  innovate graphically where improvements can be made todays journal features a new custom typeface that is easier to read we have introduced more art elements throughout the paper we use color more to emphasize areas of importance but we stuck to a limited palette of mostly pastel hues  dont skimp on good journalism in an era when information is often truncated for fast digestion the journals trademark page one stories are refreshing for their authority depth and completeness we underscored the importance of those stories by creating a new daily space for their continuations and graphics just before the opinion pages  balance long form stories with secondary readings and quick story summaries you will see new "in brief" columns on some pages as well as what were calling "summary boxes " to amplify and highlight the main news events and points of longer stories  guide readers to the online journal but dont overdo it a large number of the journals print readers also read the journal online but they dont want to feel they have to go online to get "the rest" of a story so we have limited the use of navigational "send me" devices to instances where the online edition offers something the print journal cant a full gallery of photos animated graphics or video designing a text driven newspaper for is a fascinating challenge unlike a general interest newspaper where a designer begins the creative process knowing that there will be large photographs and graphics to create visual impact a text driven paper like the journal relies on typography headlines and text to create a visual symphony on the page but i trust you will agree that we have succeeded in modernizing and tailoring to the digital age one of americas greatest newspapers dr garcia is the chief executive officer and founder of garcia media of tampa fla and has guided more than newspaper design projects over the last years
