with her two children ages and the workout ms bettis never felt confident in the gym she would visit sporadically but felt intimidated by the weights and machines "i would go to the gym and have no structure no plan and never really felt like i knew what i was doing " she says a couple of years ago she became fed up with the stubborn post pregnancy pounds she could never seem to lose and decided to start working with personal trainer at a gym five minutes from her office ms bettis says it took about six to eight weeks for her to break through and feel comfortable and confident putting on gym clothes and working out but once she got past the initial hump she really began to enjoy fitness "you really gain a self confidence having someone explain the movements to you " says ms bettis "you dont have to worry about getting hurt and you can really see your results and improvements " ms bettis meets with her trainer rod connolly twice a week for hour long sessions she shares the sessions with a friend and co worker an approach that she says saves money and also makes the workouts fun the friends frequently golf clap each other after completing a difficult set and push each other in friendly camaraderie the sessions are strength focused but also incorporate yoga flexibility and cardio one day is lower body oriented and the second upper body oriented they work on improving things like posture speed and motor skills through functional training exercises that use many muscles simultaneously "when i first started i thought i could zip in work out skip showering and go back to the office " says ms bettis "but rod has us interval training on the treadmill running at eight or nine miles per hour and im dripping wet with sweat by the end " as her body adapts to a program mr connolly changes things to keep her muscles challenged part of ms bettiss program includes testing to look at numbers like her resting metabolic rate and body fat composition these data provide a baseline for her and her trainer to measure gains and set goals "its really great to be able to be specific and say im giving myself two months to lose five pounds of fat " says ms bettis "its really inspiring also to know what your body is made up of " since the training she has gone down a size and a half in her clothing and says her strength has easily doubled after ms bettis accomplished her first goal of shedding ten pounds she began to set new goals and try new activities on her own in addition to her sessions she now takes two hour to hour and a half long yoga sessions at the gym as

minutes she also competes in k and k snow shoe races in beaver creek thinking ahead to goals for the new year she says she hopes to lose more body fat but hasnt decided on a set number yet she also hopes to take what shes learned in cycling class outdoors on a road bike "im a bit nervous about the tire width " she admits "but a winter of cycling class should build my confidence " the diet ms bettis has improved her diet since working with her trainer and describes it as "well rounded " a typical day might look like this a pre workout cup of coffee in the morning within minutes of completing a workout ms bettis will drink a protein carbohydrate mixture to help her body recover she has a mid morning snack like a half apple with hummus and a salad or chicken wrap for lunch another snack in the afternoon may be a hard boiled egg pretzels or string cheese dinner might be a big salad and soup pasta with grilled chicken or ahi tuna and maybe a glass of wine her favorite splurge is nachos and a margarita ms bettis loves that her healthy eating habits have rubbed off on her children "im certainly not against having a chocolate chip cookie " she says "but we really have healthy snacks at home and eat healthy dinners and i hear no complaints i think this gives my kids a good base for the rest of their lives " the cost ms bettis spends &# per hour long session which is &# less than shed pay if she were taking the session on her own she pays an additional &# a month for her gym membership which gives her access to all of the facilitys classes she also bought a polar heart rate monitor for approximately &# "the heart rate monitor is a must " she says "ive used it ever since i started training with rod and it lets me know that im working out in the proper zone " the effort ms bettis admits she has a very competitive edge but mr connolly challenges it in positive ways at the gym "my session with rod could be the toughest thing i do all day so once its over it makes the rest of the day seem easier " she says ms bettis travels about five weeks out of the year for work and will try to exercise in a hotel gym or run outside when her work schedule conflicts with her training sessions she usually tries to flip flop sessions with other clients so she can still get her workout in but she emphasizes that exercise should not be an added stress "this does not take up my life in many ways its added more balance with my career and children " the benefit "i feel like ive transformed into a much healthier stronger self confident person " she says "im so much more comfortable in my own skin and i feel so strong " she says ms bettis notes that when shes on the mountain with clients she doesnt worry about getting hurt since she now has strong core muscles
