annual letter from the publisher a report to our readers dear reader this letter continues a custom begun years ago of reporting the progress of the wall street journal to our readers in the first issue of the journal in founders charles dow and edward jones wrote that "we appreciate the confidence reposed in our work we mean to make it better " its in this spirit that i brief you on our efforts to make the journal better change and tradition are twin themes of this update trends reflectingboth the journal and the broad business world we cover at first glance the newspaper you hold in your hands has changed more than perhaps on any day in the journals history there are new features and new ways to find and consume the news these innovations are meant to establish the journal as the first newspaper rethought for how readers increasingly now get their news often in real time from many sources all day long a separate section "readers guide " details the newspaper of tomorrow that begins today what hasnt changed is the journals central tradition our commitment to delivering the highest quality journalism this means authoritative accurate and fair reporting as well as providing exclusive analysis context and perspective designed for our community of readers indeed at the journal we embrace both change and tradition significant as todays changes are they are part of a constant evolution the original journal of the th century was a narrow markets focused newspaper for the countrys then fewer than shareholders the second major evolution of the journal occurred in the s when visionary editors reconceived what a newspaper could be they changed the journal to become the agenda setting focal point for a new community of interest made up of national now global business leaders and other professionals todays third evolution of the journal internally we call it "journal " builds on this heritage and on the large influential and engaged readership that makes up the journal community your print journal will now focus even more on "what the news means " beyond simply what happened yesterday even as journal reporters focus on forward looking journalism weve added new features to ensure that you dont miss anything of importance from the previous day the wall street journal online is the place to go for "whats happening right now" news on the web through mobile devices and across online video and audio today we also launch the online markets data center a free area of wsj com which has prices on more than stocks and funds performance data and investing tools we continue to launch new online features including new regularly updated blogs on personal wealth and on balancing work and family whatever the look and feel or the medium in which you read we know that what matters most is the journalism this past year has been notable by any standard its a time of change not just for media but also for business generally and for other key institutions such as governments as information flows more freely activities that were once hidden became headlines among hundreds of journal market moving scoops in reporters charles forelle and james bandler broke the years biggest business story on the backdating of stock options they sifted through thousands of securities filings to identify firms with unusual patterns of option grants mr forelle a recent yale math major used a custom built algorithm to assess the odds of especially lucrative timing of option grants diverting dow jones corporate computer servers in our princeton offices to crunch the numbers in one instance the analysis found that the odds of a company awarding stock options as it did were billion to one against more than companies have since come under federal investigation more than officials at different companies have forfeited their jobs and there are criminal charges against five people the journal also broke the story of how hewlett packard executives took a media leak investigation so far that they used private phone records including those of our pui wing tam who first reported a split on the h p board a page one profile of former chairman patricia dunn put a human struggle at the center of the story our editorial page had a busy year in its mission of "free markets free people " editorials defended our fragile rule of law by exposing the fraud behind so much of the silicosis and asbestos litigation campaigning against post enron regulatory excesses and observing that many of the high profile cases brought by new york attorney general now governor eliot spitzer ended up as prosecutorial defeats no one who read our editorials on the republican congresss failures on spending immigration and ethics was surprised when the party lost the november elections this journalism is possible thanks to the dedication of thousands of people across departments including circulation advertising marketing technology operations printing and distribution more than journal colleagues gave up much of their december weekends to ensure that our production systems would operate effectively at todays new page size producing two million copies a day at our presses the journal is also a business so some comments on our performance may be of interest this is an era of great financial pressure on many news companies as business models change bringing new challenges especially for more established media outlets such as newspapers i sometimes feel like the last person in the country with "newspaper publisher" in his title who nonetheless is an optimist this reflects the journals appeal to the unique community of which you are a member more people pay to subscribe to the journal than to any other newspaper in the country and more people pay to subscribe to wsj com just under than to any other news site on the entire web in we increased by the number of individuals who subscribe to the print journal as we retained our overall print circulation of about million this increase in the "individually paid" category of circulation bucked the declining trend of almost all large newspapers and reflected our largest percentage gain since one reason is that we now offer the print and online journal in a single package more and more readers understand that the way to derive the greatest value from the journal is to consume it across media print online and other digital products throughout the day accessing each version for what it delivers best we also aim to serve our advertisers well and better than any other media company in advertising revenues in the journal increased more than in any of the other more than newspapers and magazines in the country tracked by cmr the leading print advertising researcher this reflects the addition of weekend edition and increases in our share of advertising in many categories from financial services to luxury goods for were moving to standard advertising units and revenue contracts covering print and online which will make the journal an easier place for advertisers to do business at a time when many other print publications are reducing their investments were adding more pages of color capacity by under a &# million capital program aimed at further modernizing and brightening the newspaper and in an age where many print publishers are cutting back on their newsrooms in an attempt to recover a portion of lost profitability were focused on continuing to grow our revenues and on finding ways for our journalists to apply even more of their talents to truly differentiated coverage our greatest source of pride is the confidence our readers place in us this is especially so in this age of rapid technological change global complexity economic uncertainty scandal and doubt public faith in institutions including in many media outlets is routinely tested these days the pew research center over the summer updated its study most recently conducted in which focuses on the relative reputations among the leading news organizations we were delighted that the pew research found that the journal remains the countrys most trusted and most non partisan publication our trust was also recognized overseas in the journal reported that saudi arabia was monitoring bank accounts to ensure that no funds finance terrorism we were sued for defamation in london the highest court in england ruled that the media can defend against libel if the article is in the public interest and if it reflected serious and responsible journalism the ruling said the journal article was "a serious contribution in measured tone to a subject of very considerable importance " one opinion said "we need more such serious journalism in this country and our defamation law should encourage rather than discourage it " and so in an era of change we embrace our traditions focusing on what the news means to our readers reinforcing our commitment to fairness and accuracy in our reporting and bringing values of integrity and transparency to our business dealings as we recommit ourselves to the high standards you expect from us my colleagues across the journal join me in wishing you a healthy and
