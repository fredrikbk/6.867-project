franchise freedom and speaking of the fcc we think it deserves full marks for its ruling last month that will make it easier for phone companies to enter the cable television business the usual suspects are crying foul but this is a decision that really will help millions of consumers who are currently paying cable rates dictated by anticompetitive video franchise agreements for decades the incumbent cable tv providers enjoyed a virtual monopoly in most markets of late the bells have been attempting to crash this party with their own video offerings but theyre facing all kinds of barriers to entry at the behest of the cable industry county commissions city governments and other so called local franchising authorities have slow rolled approval or made unrelated demands such as the construction of a public swimming pool parking garage or in kind cash payments a condition for allowing phone companies to offer cable with some local communities out there for the bells to win over all this nickel and diming adds up so do all the delays verizon reports that of its franchise negotiations currently pending more than half have been ongoing for at least months and more than have lasted at least a year the fccs action is an attempt to streamline this process and eliminate the shake downs that municipalities have been using to circumvent the franchise fee cap under the new rules states and local authorities must complete negotiations within days they also wont be allowed to impose "unreasonable" build out requirements such as demanding that phone companies offer their services everywhere that cable firms do within months of being granted a franchise agreement wed just as soon see such requirements scrapped altogether after all the bells are entering a competitive market with no guarantee of success but this is a step in the right direction in places where traditional cable providers do face competition from phone companies rates are falling according to fcc chairman kevin martin studies by his agency as well as the government accounting office have "concluded that the average monthly cable rate is significantly lower only in areas with another wire based competitor " in the wake of the fccs party line ruling in which the agencys two democrats dissented the cable lobby is complaining that phone companies are receiving preferential treatment democratic commissioner jonathan adelstein told reporters that the decision "undermines" local authority by which he means poaching by thousands of local politicians in fact its the local franchising authorities who have been undermining competition by protecting incumbents and the cable industrys complaints are unpersuasive at best cable companies have marched right into the telephony market making it more competitive without facing the regulatory hurdles they want kept in place to prevent video competition from the bells far from playing favorites the new fcc rules aim to make the telecom playing field more level they were long overdue see related editorial "net discrimination" wsj january see related letter "letters to the editor video franchise rules foster discrimination" wsj jan see related letter "letters to the editor market realities of cable vs bells" wsj january
