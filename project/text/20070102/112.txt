updated disney com offers networking for kids web sites strategic revamp encourages more interaction but parents will be in charge like many year old girls lulu shamberg is a big fan of new disney channel shows like "hannah montana " when her parents gave her an ipod for christmas one of the first things she did was download the shows album but when she sits down in front of her computer in santa monica calif its not disney com she usually turns to instead she logs on to an online game called club penguin where she has her own character chats with friends and plays games in a virtual world "you can do much more there " she says that view and others like it have cut to the heart of walt disney co impelling the company to address the shortcomings of its internet offerings later this month it is launching a revamped version of disney com offering a labyrinth of chat rooms games and personalized pages that will target kids and their parents the new disney com which disney chief executive bob iger plans to unveil at the consumer electronics show in las vegas next monday is disneys take on social networking for mainstream america in it kids can chat while watching video clips listening to music and playing a game all at the same time parents meanwhile can control their kids use of the site at risk of being left behind in the internet world as kids swarm to everything from club penguin and neopets to myspace disney has spent much of the past year working feverishly on the new site the company had a lot of work to do the current version is clunky outdated and has not fully capitalized on disneys new sizzling shows and characters like "hannah montana" and "high school musical " mr iger says the new disney com is "the single most important companywide strategy disney is currently implementing " disneys internet chief steve wadsworth refers to it as the new "front door" to disneys sprawling world of television shows movies toys videogames and theme parks having made his mark so far as disneys ceo by pushing an aggressive vision for the digital world mr iger sees the new site as a central hub for disney programming while he wont go as far as to say that disney com will replace existing forms of distribution such as cable television and dvds it is clear the site is heading in that direction in the meantime it will offer "great opportunities for advertising direct sales and commerce " he says but as it moves into the world of social networking its doing so with limitations that in some ways conflict with the self expressive nature of such online communities at least initially for example users will be more or less trapped in disneys online world unable to import non disney music or video clips to fill out their online profiles making disney relevant to web crawling kids is one of the tougher tasks mr iger has faced since taking over as chief executive just over a year ago facing increasingly fierce competition from myspace video sharing site youtube and other whiz bang rivals the new site needed to be cool enough to lure an increasingly sophisticated audience but not so cool that it threatened disneys wholesome image it also needed to integrate a broad range of businesses its not the first time disney had faced such a problem in the late s it started shedding teens who saw the brand as boring and babyish disneys effort to win back that audience resulted in such properties as "hannah montana " but disney com got left behind in the makeover while entertainment rivals were busy snapping up hot internet properties mr iger had another strategy in mind to largely go it alone based on the strength of the disney brand "i dont feel its necessary for us to do a deal to succeed on this platform " he says disney executive paul yanover was put to work to come up with something new having previously worked on disneys theme park web sites he spent day after day researching how kids interact with the internet and conducted multiple focus groups to see how they would respond to new features among the things he discovered while almost all kids went to disneys old site to play games they want to multitask for the redesign mr yanover says his team wanted to create something that combined "ipod cool with disney magic " they turned to sites like myspace and xbox live arcade games for inspiration just as walt disney did with the entrance to the theme parks mr iger says they wanted to create a "wow factor" when users first enter the site another focus group finding the importance of parental control with kids being exposed to increasing risks online disney included a way for parents to control access to the site including the chat rooms at its most strict that control includes chatting with preset phrases such as "cool" and "cheetahlicious " and engaging only with preselected friends personalization was another big focus by breaking down its audience disney felt it could better address the issue of being cool enough for all ages of would be myspacers as well as easier to navigate for parents mr yanovers team organized the home page by subject for adults and by character for kids they also created six categories covering preschool boys girls older kids and teens families and older disney fans clicking on the girls category for instance brings up a page populated with disney channels "kim possible " "the cheetah girls" and "hannah montana" as well as images of tinkerbell and a design your own fairy game a more advanced level of personalization was created with disney xtreme digital xd a broadband offering with more sophisticated functions xd gives kids more latitude to multitask create their own pages and share them with others they can do intricate things like mash ups taking clips from different disney shows and snippets of disney music and mixing them up it also offers more challenging gaming in its first iteration disney com will lock its audience inside the disney world kids wont be able to bring in anything from outside the site mr iger accepts that the policy is restrictive and says "were looking at ways to change that" but only if contact outside the site can be policed mr yanover says the site is a "work in progress " of course a closed universe has advantages beyond parental control mr yanover says there are many more advertising opportunities on the new site including display ads video ads and sponsorships disney will also charge for subscriptions to more advanced games and also plans to offer things like special powers in a game for a one off charge and it will sell dvds merchandise travel packages and tickets to its parks directly to the public the question is whether disney is too late rivals like viacom inc have been moving aggressively into the kids and parents space for some time mr yanover argues the relaunch captures the sweet spot of trends like the adoption of broadband and an understanding of social networking "were right on time for mainstream america " he says
