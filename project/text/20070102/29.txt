economy poised for rebound forecasters say weakness in housing manufacturing is likely to take a lighter toll the u s economy is poised to shake off the housing slump and regain momentum by the end of this year and the credit goes to techies bankers chefs and shoppers according to a wall street journal survey of economists the panel of economists who participated in the journals latest semiannual economic forecasting survey offered an optimistic outlook for the service sector should keep humming along as the recent weakness in housing and manufacturing abates and the federal reserve begins to reduce interest rates that would allow the economy to expand at a rate fast enough to keep investors happy but slow enough to keep inflation at bay even so economists havent stopped worrying about what could happen if the current slowdowns in housing and manufacturing spread further a pattern that has characterized previous recessions in another potentially ominous sign they increasingly differ about the economys trajectory on average the economists predict that inflation adjusted gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity will grow at an annualized rate of in the first half of and in the second half thats up from a sluggish in the third quarter of but still far below the robust annual growth rates of for and for early "as long as you dont think the labor market is going to collapse or financial conditions are going to change then youre starting to have the conditions for better growth down the road " says bruce kasman head of economic research at j p morgan chase &amp co in new york the rapid expansion of technology companies such as google inc and the huge bonuses lavished on new york investment bankers are just a couple of signs of the service sectors strength across the country restaurants hospitals software makers and consulting firms are growing and hiring all told service businesses which make up about of the nations economy added million jobs from may through november "weve been extremely busy " says anthony kolton president and chief executive of logical information machines a chicago company that provides research software to hedge funds trading firms and investment banks "theres a lot of money out there and people have to put it to work " the upbeat attitude in services contrasts sharply with the recent pain in the housing and manufacturing sectors builders have been slashing prices and production as they attempt to get rid of a large backlog of unsold homes despite a rise in november new home construction was down from its january peak housing related industries shed jobs from may though november according to zoltan pozsar an economist at moodys economy com falling home values have also left people with less power to extract cash from their homes through home equity loans and refinancings a factor that many economists expect to take a bite out of consumer spending along with slumping auto sales the drop in housing activity has affected all kinds of manufacturers from drywall factories to furniture makers the institute for supply management a purchasing managers trade group said that its index of manufacturing activity for november fell to the lowest point since april any number below indicates contraction by contrast the isms index of service sector activity for the same month rose "its really two very different economies depending on whether youre looking at the goods or service industries " says j p morgans mr kasman the bottom line is that the strength in services will help to keep the job market relatively healthy in the consensus scenario nonfarm businesses will add about jobs a month in that should be strong enough to slowly lift wages but not to keep the unemployment rate from creeping up to from in november the economists surveyed expect year to year inflation to decline to in may from in november as a result they expect the fed to shift its focus from fighting inflation to helping the economy grow lowering short term interest rates to by the end of from the current thats a big change from six months ago when forecasters saw the feds battle with inflation as the greatest challenge facing the economy "the fed was hoping to slow the economy down enough to take the wind out of inflation without triggering a recession " says nariman behravesh chief economist at consulting firm global insight in waltham mass "so far it looks like it has succeeded " most forecasters expect to be a good not great year for the economy while six in said they think the worst of the housing downturns impact on the broader economy had passed they still see a deeper housing slump as the biggest risk looming over the economy that concern was reflected in the odds they placed on a recession in the next months which rose to from in june more so than in recent surveys forecasters differ on the economic outlook one measure of their disagreement the standard deviation of their forecasts for inflation adjusted gdp for the coming half year widened to about percentage point in december up from a year low of percentage point in june each of the past two recessions have been preceded by sharp increases in the deviation measure to levels greater than one ian shepherdson chief u s economist at consulting firm high frequency economics and one of the surveys most pessimistic forecasters places the odds of a recession at one in two he believes that home construction still has a long way to fall before it levels off with demand and that the feds rate increases which helped push corporate borrowing costs upward by about a full percentage point between fall and spring have yet to take their full toll on business activity mr shepherdson expects real gdp to grow at an annual rate of in the first half of and in the second half "its going to be worse than the consensus expects " he says "my guess is that well probably avoid a recession but by the skin of our teeth " most other forecasters believe the economy will prove more resilient for one stronger growth abroad should help boost u s exports more than three out of four forecasters pointed to asia as the biggest contributor to global growth in beyond that money remains easy to borrow despite the feds efforts to raise interest rates global investors appetite for u s bonds has helped fuel a boom in mergers and acquisitions and low long term interest rates have kept mortgages accessible for potential home buyers even people with shaky credit whose tendency to default has proved greater than many investors expected still have access to money "weve had a remarkably benign credit environment " says richard berner chief u s economist at morgan stanley in new york "thats partly a tribute to our flexible and resilient capital markets but i think its also just plain good luck " to some extent the hit u s manufacturing has taken in recent years has made the sectors outlook less consequential today because there just arent as many american manufacturing jobs left to lose says ed leamer head of the forecasting center at the university of californias anderson school of management manufacturing has been shedding jobs since the recession of "theres no fat to trim " says mr leamer "and without the trimming of fat in manufacturing you just cant get the job loss that can add up to a recession "
