year end review of markets &amp finance stocks take a walk in the clouds amid record assault skeptics fret over economy inflation investors are approaching with a high degree of optimism perhaps too high some skeptics worry a year ago with stocks stagnating the widespread expectation was that the dow jones industrial average would struggle to rise more than or in as it often does the market surprised the pundits the dow industrials jumped to less than points from the record hit dec from the start of october to year end the average set records indexes of small and midsize stocks also climbed to records including the russell index of small stocks the broad standard &amp poors stock index of large stocks rose to and the nasdaq composite index dominated by technology stocks rose to neither finished near the records reached during the technology stock mania of but both did better than many pundits predicted investors now see a much rosier outlook a year ago their focus was the risk of slower economic growth inflation and more federal reserve interest rate increases none of that turned out to be a problem today with the fed seemingly done raising rates with the latest reports on consumer inflation showing little or no overall price increases for november and with the economy so far staying out of recession hopes are high "as the year goes on i think people will see that the economy is doing pretty well " said henry herrmann chief executive at mutual fund group waddell &amp reed financial inc in overland park kan a year ago he worried corporate profits could be softer than they turned out to be and that inflation could rear its head he has put those worries aside "inflation shouldnt come roaring back unless there is some middle east problem that pushes up oil prices" again he said although corporate profit growth is likely to slow from the third quarters unexpectedly strong for stocks in the s&amp p it still should be in the high single digits he said perhaps even which would be slightly above the longer term average if all that holds true he said stock increases in the new year could easily be in double digits as they were in skeptics think the bullishness has gone too far "we are ending the year with great optimism and i think vulnerability because of that " said phil roth chief technical market analyst at new york brokerage house miller tabak + co "it seems that people are prepared for only a favorable outcome at this point " a big reason for optimism is the markets increasing faith in the fed in some ways the markets seem to have more faith in the fed than the fed has in itself investors now widely use the word "goldilocks" to describe the economy not too hot not too cold which they think is the perfect environment for stocks they believe fed chairman ben bernanke has stopped raising rates at just the right time stifling inflation without sending the economy into recession mr bernanke himself seems less sanguine about his prowess core inflation excluding volatile energy and food prices has been easing but it lingers above the rate he considers the upper limit of the tolerable mr bernanke has said repeatedly he hopes the core inflation rate will continue to moderate falling back below but he continues to worry at least in public about the risk of more persistent inflation which would force him to raise rates again investors especially bond investors consider that kind of warning to be pro forma the bond market right now is worried about a different threat a recession that fear helped push the yield of the year treasury note to higher than the at which it began the year but well below the it hit in late june long term government bonds now yield less than short term ones that makes many investors nervous because it historically has at times been a sign of coming recession lower long term yields suggest investors expect rates to fall and rates generally fall when the economy is weakening all this makes some stock investors nervous too in year end forecasts prepared at a variety of big trust companies and other money management institutions evaluations of the risk of recession have been rising in some cases to as high as some of the money managers tend to downplay the recession risk they point out as does the fed that heavy foreign demand for longer term u s treasury bonds together with an exceptionally low world wide inflation rate has kept u s bond yields lower than normal as long as low yields dont presage recession they can be good for stocks low yields hold down other market interest rates such as fixed mortgage rates they encourage consumers and businesses alike to borrow spend and invest which supports corporate profits and stock prices some investors have been dragged into the bullish camp despite lingering uncertainty they worry that recent stock advances have been based on expectations of a near perfect world with steady growth low inflation and low interest rates and without any serious world instability they fear the world wont stay that pretty richard bernstein merrill lynch &amp co s chief u s investment strategist and a longtime stock skeptic has become downright bullish forecasting a rise of for the s&amp p this year mr bernstein said he thinks the index will finish the year at about which would mark its first record since it finished at during the euphoria of march before stocks reach those heights mr bernstein said they could suffer some growing pains "i just dont think everything is going to play out according to the perfect goldilocks scenario that so many people expect " he said "people are overly optimistic even the average guy is putting money into emerging market funds " miller tabaks mr roth said he fears the economy and inflation could surprise investors with their strength which would send interest rates up not down and upset everyones optimistic scenarios mr roth acknowledged he had expected the stock market to head down by now and it has proved more resilient than he thought one reason for that which makes him and others nervous was hedge funds many investment pros notably at big hedge funds were overly skeptical during the summer and fall refusing to believe the market could keep rising to avoid being left behind and suffer weak performance numbers compared with the overall market they grudgingly shifted money into stocks in the fall they never were true believers and the fear is that they could shift out of stocks again if the outlook clouds over to deal with these conflicting expectations that stocks will rise but that they could fall first some money managers are focusing on big stable stocks that they think will hold up better in a less robust economy in the year just ended smaller more speculative stocks held up better than many had expected some money managers who were trailing the market and hungry for some late pop bought them and pushed their prices even higher late in the year for now people forecasting trouble ahead are in the distinct minority "the underlying fundamentals are good they are really solid whether you are talking about inflation interest rates earnings or the outlook for federal reserve interest rate policy " said leo grohowski chief investment officer at money management firm u s trust co mr grohowskis forecast includes a to risk of recession with economic growth slowing to and corporate profit growth falling back to the long term average rate of about as long as the economy escapes recession " looks like a good year " he said he forecasts a rise of in the s&amp p to the risks capital spending by businesses is showing signs of slowing as is hiring the housing market may not have bottomed and if it weakens further that could weigh on the economy and the stock market mr grohowski is one of many investors who expect economic growth to be stronger abroad than at home he sees the best stock prospects not in developing asia which was hot in but in japan and continental europe chris orndorff head of stock investment at los angeles investment management group payden &amp rygel said he "wouldnt be surprised to see a fair amount of volatility in the first half of the year as peoples opinions become more solidified " "while the economy is going to slow i dont think we are going to have an actual recession " he said adding that he is "pretty confident" stocks will return at least this year including dividends and there could be an upside surprise with a return as high as
