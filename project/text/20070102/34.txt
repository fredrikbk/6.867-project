eye exams detect early signs of ms doctors are successfully detecting early signs of multiple sclerosis by studying patients eyes at the houston based multiple sclerosis eye center for analysis research and education or ms eye care doctors are using four different eye examinations to look for abnormalities in the retina and damage to optic nerve fibers a number of doctors agree that in more than half of patients the potentially devastating neurological disorder first attacks the eyes causing spotty or blurry vision and temporary or permanent loss of sight multiple sclerosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks myelin the protective layer that surrounds nerve fibers the disease affects million people world wide and nearly americans have been diagnosed according to the national multiple sclerosis society symptoms are considered unpredictable and vary widely but many people experience loss of muscle coordination tremors and vision problems the texas center with a team of ms experts optometrists ophthalmologists professors and doctoral students is the result of a collaboration between the national multiple sclerosis society and university eye institute at the university of houston the center uses four different tests to detect signs of ms visual evoked potential multifocal vep optical coherence tomography and visual field tests while a number of ms facilities use similar machines the centers partnership with an eye institute and efforts to teach optometry students how to spot multiple sclerosis makes the service unusual by focusing on catching the disorder when it first strikes in the eyes "the center is helping patients identify irregularities and referring them for treatments that may slow the disorders progression " says rosa tang co director at ms eye care since the houston center opened early last year doctors have examined nearly patients many travel from as far away as south america mexico and the middle east a large number of the international patients are referred by doctors while others find the facility on the web at www neuroeye com mseyecare htm last year physicians at the center learned that one third of its patients believed to have ms were actually misdiagnosed many of those patients were warned to seek additional consultation at neurological centers to reconfirm the optic nerve analysis for becky kistenmacher years old the test results provided an answer to why she endured years of blurred vision the houston resident who was diagnosed with ms in the early s noticed her hazy vision occurred when it was hot outside or while she was exercising tests by her eye doctor revealed corrective eyeglasses would solve those complications instead the problem continued analysis at the ms eye care center found the sporadic inflammation of ms kistenmachers optic nerve lessened her eyes ability to contrast objects examiners suggested yellow and amber tinted glasses to partially clear her vision "by the end of the exam i felt like any and everything was checked " says ms kistenmacher no single test can either diagnose ms or rule out the disorder several tests such as an mri scan or a spinal tap are needed to give a thorough diagnosis currently mri scans are the primary tests available to show images of damaged myelin in the brain the cost of an mri scan ranges from &# to &# ms eye cares optical coherence tomography is priced from &# to &# the center also offers a subsidized program which covers to of the bill for patients unable to pay the full cost the focus on detecting the disorder before severe damage and at a lower price has led a number of doctors to push for more centers modeled after ms eye care "theyre really on the forefront of developing new ways of viewing the structure of the eye and optic nerve in very non invasive ways " says jerry wolinsky interim dean of the university of texas medical school at houston
