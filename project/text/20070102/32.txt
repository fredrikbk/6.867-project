europe wary of sakhalin loan moscow a potential about face by the former communist blocs biggest single investor over a massive russian energy project comes amid rising western concern about increasing state control of that nations energy sector the european bank for reconstruction and development is likely to abandon a loan to sakhalin ii the huge energy project in the far east of russia after royal dutch shell plc and its two partners were forced to sell a stake in the venture to russian natural gas giant oao gazprom the european development bank set up in by western governments to support the private sector in former communist states making the transition to a free market economy had planned to lend sakhalin ii about &# million many observers saw gazproms entry into sakhalin ii as tantamount to nationalization the mandate of the european bank known as ebrd would probably preclude it from lending to a project now dominated by a state run company like gazprom "it doesnt invest in projects that have just been nationalized " said a banker familiar with ebrds work a decision not to approve the loan likely wont jeopardize the &# billion project furthermore it likely wont threaten overall funding for big russian energy projects as western investors remain interested in russia in general and its vast natural resources in particular but the banks potential change of heart shows the repercussions in the west over increasing state control in the russian oil and gas industry and the kremlins treatment of foreign investors the emergence of gazprom as a shareholder was "a new development and it makes things more difficult " said anthony williams a spokesman for the ebrd "it might mean the bank is less needed now " he added he said no decision on the loan had yet been taken last month gazprom announced it was paying shell and its two japanese partners mitsui &amp co and mitsubishi corp &# billion to take a stake of just over in sakhalin ii the move came after nearly a year of sustained attacks on the project by russian regulators regarding cost overruns and alleged environmental violations a few days after the deal was announced it emerged that the three foreign shareholders would have to pay for a third of sakhalins cost overrun by themselves shell mitsui and mitsubishi will be required to absorb &# billion of the additional costs and will have to give the russian government a share of sakhalins production earlier than they had hoped the deal reflected kremlin frustration over the fact that the ballooning cost of sakhalin ii meant the government would have to wait much longer for tax and royalty payments shell announced last march that it was hoping for funding of up to &# billion for sakhalin ii from international financial organizations including the ebrd the japan bank for international cooperation and the export import bank of the u s but the banks delayed disbursal of the funds after a barrage of complaints about shell from environmental groups they worried about sakhalin iis impact on the feeding grounds of the endangered gray whale and the wild salmon population of sakhalin island those complaints grew more serious last fall when russian regulators stepped into the fray warning they might withdraw key permits from sakhalin ii and even threatening criminal investigations over alleged environmental damage the ebrd had expected to take a decision on whether to approve its loan to the sakhalin consortium last september but put it on hold as shells regulatory problems piled up analysts say an about face by the bank would have little impact on the financing of sakhalin russias biggest foreign investment the loan was seen as an important stamp of approval by a bank that requires borrowers to meet strict environmental standards but president vladimir putin presiding over the deal last month that brought gazprom into the sakhalin consortium said the projects regulatory problems were now resolved "that means commercial banks will be queuing up to lend to sakhalin ii " said one moscow banker
