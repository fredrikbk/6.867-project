publishers letter embracing change to build on a tradition of excellence our mission since reporting news that is essential to business for over a century the wall street journal has been an icon in business markets and journalism in a time of change those of us entrusted with icons face a dilemma do we preserve the icon as it has been rejecting change as too risky or do we try to add to the qualities that created the icon in the first place taking care not to change simply for the sake of change we embrace the latter approach driven by the knowledge that your needs are constantly changing and that the journal has constantly evolved each time emerging more vital to more readers this readers guide highlights why weve changed what weve changed and that what doesnt change is at least as important as what does the impetus is the great change in recent years in how you get news and information you now get updated throughout the day from many different sources print and online readers told us that the journal could better tailor its efforts to how when and where you access news weve rethought the role of a newspaper as well as what you seek online your expectations of media have shifted making this an era when you expect us to embrace change were confident that our approach will make the journal more essential to you than ever we started planning for the journal you hold in your hands more than a year ago but todays journal reflects an approach to serving readers followed since charles dow and edward jones founded the journal in our readers require the most authoritative accurate and fair reporting on business and financial news this has been the foundation of our journalism but not the entirety of it we also deliver only in the journal analysis context and perspective that helps make clear what the news means to our readers beyond simply reporting what happened the day before todays always on information overload of data makes the journal indispensable for the real knowledge and understanding that we try to help you achieve thats why in todays journal youll see new content features new ways to navigate the newspaper and innovations in aligning the print journal and the wall street journal online to make the journal your essential source throughout the day this readers guide provides details on new features such as "todays agenda " which tells you what the news means even before its reported "the informed reader " which tells you the news you need even from other sources beyond the journal and "in brief" columns throughout the newspaper that like the "whats news " column on page one help you get the news of the day quickly so that you can focus more attention on what the news truly means many of the changes today are very noticeable weve reduced the width of the newspaper the almost unanimous reaction among readers in focus groups was that this would make the newspaper more convenient and literally handier also wed rather invest in newspeople than in newsprint i hope youll agree that our new typeface is more readable and that page one is still very much our own unique page one were proud of the elegant appearance of the journal but as our design consultant mario garcia points out journal readers loyalty is because they come to read and not to look the biggest change is the one managing editor paul steiger describes below the journals news department is increasing the proportion of articles that are exclusive telling you about facts trends ideas and analysis you wont see anywhere else a little over half of the journal in recent times has been this kind of unique coverage more than any other newspaper which is one reason the number of people subscribing to the journal is up by this year when most newspapers have many fewer such subscribers still this means that almost half of our news was available to readers the previous day often online we now aim to make of your journal what it means journalism devoting the other to ensuring that you havent missed anything of importance from the previous day this approach reflects our vision of a journal you can use throughout your day with the print journal focused on what the news means to you and the wall street journal online focused on whats happening right now in this effort reporters and editors are building on the unique traditions of the journal in the s bernard kilgore transformed a narrow financial newspaper serving new york into a broader business and financial newspaper serving the nation and now the world he knew the journals reading community was united by common interests challenges and opportunities not as for most newspapers by simple geography "it doesnt have to have happened today to be news " kilgore said instead our knowledgeable reporters tell you what todays news and trends mean for tomorrow in the month since i invited your feedback on these changes several thousand of you have contacted me most encouraged the new approach others cautioned us not to cross the line between helpful forward looking interpretation versus personal or political opinion in our news columns and we certainly wont and some urged us to keep evolving to be sure we go far enough in making your newspaper as accessible as possible most of all you reminded us how deeply loyal so many people are to the journal with high expectations for the future i hope you find this readers guide helpful in getting to know the changes to your journal i also hope you find that the essential qualities of this icon have been strengthened with the journal remaining true to what has always set it apart mr crovitz is publisher of the wall street journal
