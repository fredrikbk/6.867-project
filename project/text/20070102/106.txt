the wealth report a billionaire divorce and not a lawyer in sight tim and edra blixseth try a diy split with dignity theyll share the three jets tim and edra blixseth spent years building a &# billion life together when they decided to divorce they spent a single afternoon in the beverly hills hotel dividing it all up with just two notebooks and a bottle of wine the blixseths california real estate tycoons and founders of the famed yellowstone club finished the job in a matter of hours no attorneys no accountants no judges she kept their acre estate he got the house in mexico he kept his land businesses she kept the dogs they each got a rolls royce and they will share their three private jets "we have always tried to live our lives with dignity and respect " tim says "we wanted to do the same in divorce " at a time when most billionaire breakups follow a predictable pattern the torn pre nup the flying wedgwood china the army of lawyers the incriminating photos and finally the exasperated judge the blixseths have come up with a refreshing alternative call it the do it yourself divorce billionaire style rather than fighting over every piece of silver the blixseths decided to keep whats most important to each of them and split the difference lifes too short they figured and why give the lawyers all the money if you can work it out yourselves their peaceable parting marks a triumph of hope over history and reason over money most wealthy spouses follow the greed principle the more stuff you have the more there is to fight over from supermarket maven ron burkle whose bitter divorce has just been unsealed to former beatle paul mccartney whos trading daily insults with ex model heather mills the rich almost never split amicably and money is usually at the center of the acrimony wealth as the saying goes is a magnifier especially in divorce "when you get to this level of wealth the greed element usually sets in " says bill zabel the new york attorney who mediated george soross split from his wife in and represented jane beasely welch in her divorce from former ge chief jack welch the blixseths both in their s tried a different path during their marriage tim and edra rose to the top of the business world and to the heights of high society tim a tanned land baron who never wears a suit grew up on welfare and made his first fortune in the timber trade edra a former hotel executive had her own career as a designer and entrepreneur in the late s the couple teamed up to form the yellowstone club one the countrys first private golf and ski communities the club became a popular playground for the super rich counting bill gates and other billionaires as members running yellowstone the blixseths became the merry innkeepers to the new money crowd hosting power dinners for corporate chiefs hedge funders and media stars they threw legendary parties at their estate near palm springs equipped with an auditorium called "the party pad " where pop stars like eric benet sang songs often written by tim aside from trading in timberland tim has written a few hits including "coyote ugly" and "heart of america " they also have given generously to charity chipping in millions to the post katrina relief effort in tim made his debut on the forbes list with an estimated net worth of &# billion though the couple estimates their assets are currently worth between &# billion and &# billion a couple of months ago they decided to separate or divorce their four kids all from previous marriages were grown "our lives and interests were growing apart " edra says "there was no scandal or affair or event it happened over time " neither wanted to place their fate in the hands of a judge so they hatched a plan for their own deal they each made a list of their assets and their estimated worth they ranked each by order of personal importance then they met at the beverly hills hotel to compare their notepads "we sat down and i joked ill show you mine if you show me yours " edra recalls surprisingly the lists were relatively compatible though theyre still wrestling over a few assets and valuations and they had to be interviewed separately they started with their estate called porcupine creek a square foot mansion with a hole golf course and eight cottages and casitas realtors say its one of the most expensive homes in the country with an estimated sale price of &# million or more though its not on the market edra grew attached to the home where she raised her kids while tim says he is more of a "nomad " they put porcupine creek on edras side of the ledger the rest of the couples properties fell into easy "his" and "her" categories edra kept the condo in seattle since its close to one of her start up companies tim got the condo in boise idaho near his timber operations she got the beach house in cabo san lucas mexico while he kept the villa just down the coast in tamarindo they will each keep their own businesses and will remain partners in the companies they operate together including yellowstone they agreed to share their three jets and for now edra gets the dogs a golden retriever named andy and a shi tzu named g as in gulfstream "for me the businesses were the most important " tim says "this is what i do for a living its exciting i love doing it and it has a very bright future and a lot of upside i can always build another porcupine creek " granted tim and edra would have had to divide their fortune in half anyway californias community property laws require couples without pre nups to equally split assets acquired during their marriage unless they came from inheritance or gifts and tim and edra both had lawyers sign off on the deal before they filed the divorce in court of course theres a chance that the deal wont last "this is not to say that the whole thing wont blow up in court " edra says "but unless one of us does something out of character i dont think it will " if their agreement holds up the
