year old mr zafirovski is an intense competitor who has completed the grueling ironman triathlon and eight marathons a fan of a ge bosss mantra of "forceful optimism " he is doggedly upbeat still the incessant demands and exhausting schedule of a rookie ceo take their toll "i have been stretched beyond what i thought i was capable of " he observes since joining nortel mr zafirovski has largely

nortel shares are down since he arrived closing friday at &# on the new york stock exchange the market for one of nortels cornerstone businesses a wireless technology called cdma is stagnating as developing countries embrace a more popular rival technology the companys unit that makes business communications systems is under siege and nortel has made little progress breaking into markets for new products generally the month mr zafirovski was selected for the nortel post big swedish telecom supplier telefon ab l m ericsson announced it was buying marconi corp s telephone network equipment business for &# billion since then many large global telecom equipment companies have joined forces to compete for contracts from fewer customers as telecom carriers themselves have merged during most of mr zafirovskis inaugural year nortel has been left out of the merger dance and now must face much bigger competitors "the industry is at a key inflection point that plays in nortels favor " retorts ann fuller a nortel spokeswoman "in nortel completed the heavy lifting on the foundational changes that will re establish nortel as a great company " a native of macedonia mr zafirovski moved to cleveland because his father fell in love with the country during a visit his parents now dead worked in u s factories mr zafirovski who didnt know a word of english when he arrived at won a

fall that december motorola directors chose an outsider as ceo mr zafirovski quit the motorola presidency in january he unsuccessfully vied for the highest spot at hewlett packard co and m co people familiar with the two searches say mr zafirovski declines to comment on those two jobs then nortel came calling harry j pearce the former vice chairman of general motors corp who is chairman of nortels board heard good things about mr zafirovski from ex ge chairman jack welch and motorola directors he and two other board members flew to chicago to meet mr zafirovski and two other possible candidates in mid september the three directors interviewed mr zafirovski for several hours in a windowless conference room at the ritz carlton mr pearce says he immediately liked the foot inch executives intelligence warmth directness and energy mr zafirovskis extensive business background was impressive as well "knowing mike now he probably was nervous but he wasnt showing it " mr pearce says at the interview mr zafirovski expressed his optimism about nortels prospects pointing to its global reach and intellectual property portfolio "i dont care if youre a miracle worker " mr pearce cautioned at one point a turnaround would take "two to three years " nortels board selected mr zafirovski in october his initial pay package included &# million annual salary a potential annual bonus ranging from &# million to &# million five million stock options and restricted stock units valued at &# million he started work a month later confident he could re create a great company "ive never left anything in worse shape than i found it " he says mr zafirovski who likes to spend half of his time with customers traveled nonstop for weeks he talked himself hoarse in meetings not only with nortels customers but also of its staffers on four continents he suggested slashing the companys bureaucracy hoping to reduce its management layers to seven and to streamline an order entry system mr zafirovski also presented the nortel board with his broad turnaround strategy which eventually included chopping administrative expenses and curbing spending on research and development then came an unexpected detour two class action lawsuits seeking at least &# billion in damages from the accounting scandal threatened to drive nortel into bankruptcy court settlement talks started before mr zafirovski arrived were moving more slowly than expected so in an unconventional move the ceo invited key plaintiffs to meet him and five other senior officials on feb in a new york courtroom of a court appointed mediator after shaking hands with each plaintiff mr zafirovski apologized for nortels past mistakes that had destroyed more than &# billion of market capitalization "we let you down " he said but he urged the shareholders not to "kill the company" because "you would receive absolutely nothing " "we were all very impressed by him " says max w berger a new york attorney who represents a lead plaintiff a pension fund for teachers in ontario that night the two sides hammered out an accord announced the next day it required nortel to pay about &# billion in cash and stock a month later the bomb hit nortel needed to revise financial results since the errors involved accounting flubs rather than fraud but reflected poor internal controls the company said at the time some senior executives favored limiting disclosure until they knew more mr zafirovski insisted on disclosing everything the company knew right away mr pearce says the board was supportive of the ceo "he repeatedly said if this company is going to have the integrity were talking about we have to deal with it " he says the announcement plunged mr zafirovski into crisis mode he spent much of the following week reassuring about major nortel customers by phone he made another round of calls during april to quell rumors circulated by rivals that nortel might not survive the restatement also rattled nortels demoralized staff in early september of staffers were highly satisfied with their jobs an internal survey found by april that number had fallen to "i was coming to the realization that the positive momentum we had just put in place would be lost " mr zafirovski says it was a tense month the restatement forced nortel to delay filing its annual report until april in the crush of last minute details nortel wasnt able to electronically transmit the report until p m just minutes shy of the deadline and at first computer glitches at the securities and exchange commission made it impossible to tell whether the agency had received the document mr zafirovski fretted all weekend checking email about times from his lake forest home only on monday did he learn that the report had arrived in time although he had always worked very hard mr zafirovski was now toiling into the wee hours often dispatching emails long past midnight and waking before a m for his morning run in bed he sometimes had trouble sleeping "am i making the right decisions " he asked himself "are people telling me what i need to hear am i being naively optimistic and ignoring warning signs " the restatement crisis had barely faded when mr zafirovski faced another challenge persuading investors to lend nortel &# billion it needed to repay a line of credit and cover the cash portion of the class action settlement among other things so mr zafirovski was back on the road in june hitting seven u s cities in a week to sell dubious investors "i could see the skepticism on their faces " he recollects "it was pretty tough " investors grilled him about whether nortel could generate cash for the first time since and regain profitability nortel ultimately raised the full sum but at considerable cost it had to offer interest rates as high as a jolt to an ex ge man accustomed to an employer with top credit ratings by contrast nortels credit rating was just three levels above the lowest possible grade in late june two days before his first annual meeting mr zafirovski announced the companys third round of layoffs since he eliminated positions altered pensions and curbed retiree health coverage once topping nortels ranks now stand at about nortels annual meeting held june at the cavernous toronto congress centre was his next big test mr zafirovski had an inkling of what was coming the prior years annual meeting had lasted a grueling six and a half hours during a portion of the next three hours unhappy investors pelted mr zafirovski and his colleagues with questions "where has my money gone " asked a man who indicated he had lost &# on nortel stock mr zafirovski who usually shuns formal business attire looked nervous at times in his white dress shirt and red tie his trademark machine gun patter failed more than once causing him to stumble over a few words but he told the investors that he and nortels senior management were "betting their careers on bringing nortel back " later mr zafirovski admitted he felt nervous but said jitters over confronting shareholders paled in comparison to prior moments in his life such as his early days as an immigrant "you dont expect standing ovations" when a company has problems he said distracted by the unforeseen crises mr zafirovski didnt finish assembling his senior management team until june two months longer than he anticipated once he had wooed seven outsiders to his member team lieutenants anonymous reviews of his performance made him realize nortel veterans resented the amount of attention he paid the newcomers in reaction mr zafirovski sought to be more evenhanded while privately worrying about the gulf between the two groups mr zafirovskis travel schedule kept him from quickly forging personal ties with the executives only three of whom he knew before nortel "were still pretty much strangers " he conceded in early september "many of us have different work habits " heading to dallas later that month for a meeting of nortels highest ranked managers mr zafirovski doubted his lieutenants would appear unified he was wrong lauren flaherty the recently hired chief marketing officer says some attendees told her that the senior executives appeared "to enjoy being together " concurs mr zafirovski "that was a defining moment for us " still he was downcast when he gave nortel directors a mixed report card on his tenure during a mid october breakfast at washington d c s willard hotel "we are behind where we want to be " mr zafirovski said among other things he had forecast an improved operating profit margin in but the margin declined during the first nine months reflecting intensified pricing pressures and stiff competition he pledged to move "with greater urgency " mr zafirovski says he plans more cost cuts and to narrow nortels focus to fewer product areas the ceos harsh assessment muted directors reaction the board "found it reassuring that mike was not satisfied with the progress the company had made " mr pearce observes still the board "would like to see progress sooner than later " the nortel chairman continues "were not shy about giving him feedback " nortels latest financial results make clear its need for further progress the company reported a third quarter loss of &# million its seventh loss in the past nine quarters on a increase in revenue to &# billion mr zafirovski who says he hopes to lead nortel for at least a decade has a full slate of challenges to confront as he looks ahead for the moment at least the board supports mr zafirovski "he moved more quickly than i thought possible" during his inaugural year says mr pearce the new ceo "exceeded my expectations " nearing his first year anniversary last november mr zafirovski found his lack of sleep was catching up to him "i was dragging at the end of the day " he says admitting hes almost dozed off during a few meetings he began forcing himself to get a nightly minimum of five hours of sleep as has been the case for much of his life mr zafirovski finds much needed stress relief in intense exercise wearing out a pair of running shoes every other month he makes himself bike run or row up to minutes every day and never allows himself to exercise for fewer minutes a day than the number of years hes been alive "i always try to add a minute" each birthday he says "its tougher as i get older " wsj com reporter
