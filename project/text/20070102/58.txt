iraqi leaders past of shiite activism undermines pledge to heal rifts baghdad iraq his only son was getting married on friday but the iraqi prime minister couldnt stay long at the wedding nouri al maliki greeted the guests and then quickly left to make sure that when the sun rose over baghdad again his arch nemesis saddam hussein would be dead mr maliki wanted to leave nothing to chance his mind raced through several scenarios however improbable that might have derailed the execution says a close adviser who spoke with him what if the americans struck a secret deal sparing mr husseins life in exchange for a halt to attacks against u s troops what if the former dictators lawyers succeeded in blocking his hanging through u s courts and finally what if insurgents abducted a group of schoolchildren and threatened to kill them unless the hanging was canceled mr maliki hurriedly gathered final signatures for the execution to proceed dismissing u s suggestions that he delay it for days by the time mr maliki awoke for dawn prayers on saturday mr hussein was dead his disfigured corpse displayed on television with rope marks on the neck for the year old mr maliki it was a crowning moment in a career defined by uncompromising hatred of everything mr hussein had stood for now mr maliki is supposed to rise above the sectarian chasm that has pitted iraqs sunni minority against his own shiite branch of islam but as iraq moves closer to full scale civil war a look at mr malikis history of shiite activism suggests he is ill prepared to be a true unifying figure on his watch iraq has become further polarized along sectarian lines significantly complicating the u s efforts to reduce the violence things here started spinning out of control long before mr maliki took office and fissures have been hardening among political factions with narrow sectarian interests sharply limiting mr malikis room to maneuver "hes got the worlds most difficult job " says zalmay khalilzad the u s ambassador to iraq in a dec interview mr maliki admitted hes exhausted and would much rather serve his country without holding high office "i wish i could be done with it " he says as the violence rages on mr maliki feels frustrated by his failings and by the gulf of mistrust that has opened between him and ordinary iraqis say his associates and colleagues when his heavily armed convoy moves through baghdad disrupting traffic mr maliki gets annoyed because it reminds him of mr husseins old motorcades born near babylon mr maliki studied religion and arabic poetry in the s he joined the dawa party a moderate shiite islamist group whose members were targeted for torture and executions by mr husseins regime like many of his party colleagues mr maliki changed his first name from nouri to jawad in his case to make it harder for authorities to identify him and his family mr maliki briefly lived in the marshes of southern iraq hiding in crude shacks made of reeds and organizing resistance says hassan al sunaid a longtime friend of the prime minister once a dawa camp came under attack by government forces one member was killed and four were wounded when mr maliki arrived on the scene and was briefed on the casualties he told supporters not to be depressed because all five could have perished "we just gained four people " mr sunaid recalls mr maliki as saying in mr maliki moved to syria where he coordinated iraqi opposition meetings and published a dawa newspaper in dawa helped organize a botched assassination attempt against mr hussein who responded by executing some shiite civilians that massacre earned the former dictator his death penalty following the u s led invasion mr maliki returned to baghdad and became one of the most enthusiastic enforcers of washingtons sweeping program to purge iraqs institutions of baath party members many though not all were sunnis that decision is now widely viewed as a mistake because it antagonized many sunnis particularly in the military and pushed them into the insurgency mr malikis zeal for the program surprised even those who shared his distaste for the baath party mithal al alusi a former sunni exile who worked under mr maliki on the de baathification commission says he once wanted to clear the names of some low level baathists who were forced to join the party under saddam to keep their jobs facing objections from mr maliki and some others mr alusi says he leaked the list to an iraqi newspaper after which the commissions hand was forced and the names were cleared "maliki was very upset about it " recalls mr alusi "hes allergic to baathists " mr maliki was concerned that these baathists hadnt submitted proper applications for clearance says sami al askari his friend and adviser mr maliki and his close associates believe the shiites finally assumed the rightful positions of leadership in iraq after decades under repressive sunni rule "the problem is that our sunni brothers ruled iraq for centuries because there was no democracy no elections " mr maliki said in the interview "therefore they feel that a right has been taken away from them " the sunni shia split dates to the battles at the dawn of islam over who should succeed the prophet muhammed as the leader of the muslim world eventually the sunnis gained the upper hand throughout most of the middle east with the notable exception of iraqs neighbor iran preserving the new iraq as a shia controlled state is an indispensable ideological consideration for the latest crop of shiite leaders who still recall a missed opportunity back in after an armed uprising against the british colonial rule back then shiite sheiks withdrew from politics and paved the way for the ascendancy of the sunni minority that lasted until "the current leaders learned that lesson very well " says sadiq al rikabi the prime ministers political adviser mr maliki has a personal connection to the events of his grandfather was a cleric who took part in the uprising wrote national liberation poetry and was detained by the british several times mr maliki went on to write his masters thesis on his forebear whose verses he can recite from memory after the sunnis themselves withdrew from politics and allowed the shiites and kurds to form a government without them security forces took on a shiite tint and sunnis began to complain of sectarian death squads allegedly operating with the complicity of the interior ministry from his seat in parliament mr maliki was lobbying for more shiite influence in the relatively nonsectarian iraqi army in he approached the sunni minister of defense with a request to hire more senior shiite officers a move that many sunnis now cast as sectarian meddling in the end the defense minister ignored the request according to people familiar with the episode the sunnis ended their boycott of politics in december and won seats in the new parliament though the shiites still maintained a majority banding together with ethnic kurds the sunnis engineered the ouster of the shiite prime minister ibrahim al jaafari whom they viewed as inefficient as a senior dawa official mr maliki emerged as the shiite coalitions second choice for prime minister though most iraqis didnt know anything about him mr maliki never coveted the post and decided to take it only after his shiite colleagues spent days persuading him to step in he and others involved in the selection say "that decision for me was heavier than a mountain " mr maliki recalls stooping his shoulders under its imaginary weight upon taking office mr maliki surrounded himself with trusted shiite advisers most of whom hail from the same exile underground that shaped him then he pledged to reach out to the sunni insurgent groups and former baathists the very people he worked hard to isolate before becoming prime minister "yes he was very tough against baathists but now hes ready for dialogue with some of them " says mr al askari "some people were surprised by this " even ansar al sunna one of the toughest insurgent groups in the country has been approached and has sent in a list of "requirements for negotiation " says mowaffak al rubaie the prime ministers national security adviser yet there are no signs that reconciliation is working in early december ansar al sunna plastered several baghdad universities with leaflets attacking mr malikis government and blaming it for killing sunnis "this reconciliation came very late three years late or at least two " says mahmoud othman a veteran kurdish politician the kurds most of whom live in their peaceful northern region have largely sat out the conflict between iraqs sunni and shiite arabs the prime minister says reconciliation is still possible "it is not only about slogans it is a matter of will " he says adding that hes working on establishing a retirement plan for some former baathists and senior officers of the old army another huge challenge facing mr maliki is the rising power of moqtada al sadr a shiite strongman whose parliamentary votes were critical for his nomination as prime minister mr sadrs militia the mehdi army is accused of conducting sectarian attacks against sunnis and driving them out of mixed neighborhoods in baghdad mr sadrs advisers deny this in february three months before mr maliki ascended to iraqs top post sunni insurgents destroyed a landmark shiite shrine in samarra and the mehdi army quickly emerged as a vigilante shiite self defense force and one of the most intractable players in the escalating violence mr maliki promised to tackle militias but instead he has chosen to seek a political accommodation with mr sadr fearful that direct military action would alienate him in october mr maliki told the u s military to remove roadblocks surrounding sadr city a massive shiite district of baghdad that serves as a base of operations for the mehdi army the checkpoints had gone up just a week earlier to facilitate the search for a kidnapped american soldier of iraqi descent who was reportedly held somewhere in the sprawling slum of some two million residents shiites "thought it was a big victory " says lt col steve miska a u s army officer stationed in baghdad "the prime minister forced the coalition to stand down " the sunnis were baffled by the decision interpreting it as mr malikis coddling of the mehdi army "the roadblocks were put in to destroy the gangsters " says saleem abdullah of the iraqi islamic party one of the biggest sunni political organizations "when they were lifted that plan was ruined " mr maliki thought the roadblocks were simply ineffective snarling traffic and disrupting daily lives of the mostly poor sadr city residents "he felt that people are suffocating there " says mr rubaie his national security adviser "and these are the same measures saddam used against the shia in that slum " mr maliki has also blocked some american efforts to arrest mehdi army operatives once he was given a list of people whom the u s military wanted to detain in sadr city the prime minister vetoed arresting one person because that would be politically sensitive mr rubaie recalls mr maliki he adds is committed to wiping out the rogue mehdi army forces who are involved in sectarian attacks but he wants to engage moderate elements in dialogue mr maliki says the rise of the shiite militias was a natural defensive reaction to the samarra shrine bombing but they have since become a danger to the integrity of the state "we will continue confronting them with force and well work on winning over some militiamen to our side " he says many sunni leaders though suspect a conspiracy "maliki knows that the mehdi army can destroy sunnis thats why he doesnt disarm them " says adnan al dulaimi a hard line sunni member of parliament last year a guard on mr dulaimis private security detail was detained by the americans on suspicion of plotting bombing attacks though mr dulaimi himself wasnt implicated the shiites pounced on the arrest as a sign of some sunni politicians complicity in terrorism that underlies a broader shiite perception that the decision to share power with the sunnis after elections may have been a mistake because the sunni insurgency has only grown stronger in late november several car bombs killed more than shiites inside sadr city the bloodiest attack since the u s led invasion when mr maliki recently went for a visit there his convoy was pelted with rocks his allies and some opponents describe him as a man with a common touch and none of the haughtiness that often comes with high office his days begin at the crack of dawn when he wakes up to pray and they often last past midnight to unwind he reads arabic poetry and can recite many verses from memory including his own grandfathers work he writes his own poems but these days he says "only very little because i dont have time " hes been known to personally grab and wipe a dusty chair for a visitor and hes vetoed government appointments at the slightest hint of corruption in a candidate in the recent interview mr maliki sat under a huge iraqi flag and reminisced about his life shaped by the fight against mr hussein "im still fighting baathists " he said quickly adding "but not all baathists only those who have the attitude of saddam " in summary the issue prime minister malikis history complicates his push to heal iraqs sectarian divisions the background he has a track record of seeking to rid iraq of any remnants of husseins sunni dominated regime what it means iraqs polarization is hurting u s efforts to reduce the violence
