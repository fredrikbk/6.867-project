pursuits books five best british critic and polymath clive james on his favorite books of poetry  the tower by w b yeats macmillan every collection of william butler yeatss poems from "responsibilities" onward is tremendous but "the tower" is my favorite "that is no country for old men the young in one anothers arms " not a bad start i wouldnt fancy even the most determined enthusiasts chances of finding the book second hand today it can be found easily though in the "collected poems " where the groupings of the original individual volumes are sensibly preserved to avoid getting caught up in the celtic fairyland of the great mans winsome early days cut straight to the poems of "the tower" and youre in the middle of yeatss full blown achievement with the masterpieces arriving one after the other "sailing to byzantium " "nineteen hundred and nineteen " "leda and the swan" and "among school children " the last poem in the book is "all souls night " one of the greatest poems written in the th century not a bad ending  collected poems by robert frost henry holt robert frosts individual collections are nice to have but in his case the full "collected poems" is the book that matters because his masterpieces which were seldom of more than medium length at most are scattered evenly throughout his long and fruitful career familiarity breeds reverence never dodge a frost lyric just because it is famous "stopping by woods on a snowy evening" isnt any the less of a lulu just because it has been recited so often in portentous tones at commencement ceremonies a public life is one of the things frost wanted for his poetry he sets out to get his lines into your head and with a gem like "the silken tent" he can get a whole poem into your head even though because of the intricacy of its construction readers will find almost impossible to memorize what they can never quite forget  look stranger by w h auden already a giant in his lifetime w h auden has been treated after his death to the monumental splendors of a pharaonic entombment it would be churlish to begrudge all this scholarly effort but the original slim volumes are the form he should be read in if you can find them the light but weighty "look stranger " published in the u s by random house in with the title "on this island " from another part of the title poems first line reminds us that a few individual poems are where a reputation starts there are other auden volumes that yield even richer rewards but only "look stranger " has poem "no ix" in a fit of pseudo asceticism the rebel angel was avoiding verbal titles in that period and only poem "no ix" starts with the mind bending line "the earth turns over our side feels the cold " it seems so effortless and so it was but only for him  poems by richard wilbur if i had to pick my favorite book of american poetry since robert frost a collection of richard wilburs poetry published in britain "poems " would have to be the one the awkward truth about wilbur is that his postwar impact was so big that eventually it had to be critically played down if the race of poets was to survive anyone who doubts this contention should open wilburs book at "a baroque wall fountain in the villa sciarra" and note once again the elegant swagger with which a gi could come home from europe with a whole cultural heritage in his pocket wilburs imitators were legion but his brand of conscious artistry could be sustained only by his instinct for a phrase the impulse "that flings the dancer kneeling on nothing into the wings " perfect  the whitsun weddings by philip larkin random house of philip larkins three mature volumes the second one "the whitsun weddings " would be my pick from colloquial punch to high flying sonority it has everything including a title poem whose last line about an arrow shower "sent out of sight somewhere becoming rain" became a call sign for a generation it even has the portents of death that mark the third volume "high windows " and the volume beyond the one never completed that would have contained the blood chillingly desolate "aubade " there might not at first blush seem to be much joy in larkin but he gets the whole truth of lifes transience into unforgettably beautiful poetry and it is hard to think of a greater source of joy than that mr james is the author of many books of poetry criticism fiction and autobiography his latest work "cultural amnesia " will be published by norton in march he has a multimedia web site at clivejames com
