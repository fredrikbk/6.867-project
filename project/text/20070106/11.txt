dont shoot the actuarial messengers as a life long actuary i take great exception to george gilders jan editorial page commentary "economics is not for actuaries " first the headline is a swipe at our profession and a gratuitous one at that again further down in the article he refers to "actuarial trumpery" without giving any examples of what he is talking about id like to remind him that the last time an actuary made the front page headlines was when one of our own stood up to his boss and refused to release numbers that in the actuarys opinion understated the potential costs of the medicare part d program egregious example of "trumpery" there id also like to remind mr gilder that actuaries have been doing responsible actuarial valuations of the social security system for decades and the projections have been pretty good ones at that its not our fault if congress doesnt act on our recommendations you can lead a horse to water finally in the last paragraph mr gilder concludes "let the democratic accountant economists grouse about " who even knows what this means does he equate accountant economists with actuaries by locating this sentence in his closing statement by implication tying back into the title of his article in reference to actuaries does he perhaps not know the difference between accountants and actuaries is he accustomed to people even thinking about his statements if so youd think he would choose his words so as to have some actual meaning the thing thats most galling about this piece is that the actuaries are the only ones without an ax to grind in this whole debate we report the numbers according to our training i studied for more than years to receive my professional credentials our skills and our integrity whether the numbers paint a picture of systemic collapse of fully funded benefits or of points in between is left for the politicians and whatever mr gilder calls himself to decide lou filliger fellow society of actuaries chatsworth calif mr gilder would like us "to stop driving aged workers out of employment " two actions may help first allow the deferral of taking social security benefits beyond the age of while increasing future benefits to account for a shorter expected payment time second allow the deferral of taking distributions from traditional iras beyond the age of currently as workers suddenly start getting significant streams of income as they reach the age of which they cannot effectively defer they have both fiscal and psychological incentives to retire and if the treasury is counting on taxing such streams at age then perhaps the proposed deferrals should only be allowed for those that have employment income beyond some threshold income which they will have and on which they can be taxed if they are not encouraged to retire zvi m kedem new york mr gilder may not need an actuary but he needs a mathematician if he agrees with ken fischers claim that americans get a yield on our &# trillion asset base then how does he explain the fact that our federal government gets "only" &# trillion in tax revenues thats a rate either he cant live with extremely low effective federal tax rates even lower than just germanys vat of or his yield calculations are off it cant be both gdp has a cost associated with it a business gets a return on its assets that is decreased by the cost of managing those assets revenues are not "yield " net profits are what you end up with at the end of the day not gross profits john dittmar chicago
