pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink often soft never silly "i am buffalo bills horse " thus begins mark twains "a horses tale " and though it is an opening of ishmael like import the book itself proves to be considerably shorter than melvilles tale of a whale one of twains last stories the book wasnt exactly his most biting work a sentimental plea for animal rights it might not have fared well at the hands of a snarky reviewer but j b kerfoot was not of that breed struggling to say something nice about twains book in the dec issue of life magazine kerfoot latched on to an odd extended metaphor likening "a horses tale" to a drink called a horses neck the horses neck was the shirley temple of its day a fancy nonalcoholic highball it is made by cutting the peel of a lemon into a long unbroken spiral the peel goes into a tall glass with one end draped over the rim rather like a horses head leaning over a stable door toss in a few ice cubes and fill with ginger ale the horses neck "dashes the fun of effervescent ginger with the pathos of lemon peel " kerfoot wrote laying it on rather thick like the drink twains story was "soft but deliciously gingery and if it surprises one into a pleasant tear or two why honi soit qui mal y pense" shamed be the person who thinks evil of it i much prefer the horses neck to the shirley temple years ago my high school french teacher took our class to a bistro she was about to order herself a glass of wine and then thinking better of drinking on duty said "oh just bring me something nonalcoholic " ive never forgotten the look of disgust on her face when the sly garcon presented her with a shirley temple pink packed with iridescent maraschinos and topped with a dainty umbrella by name and appearance the shirley temple is a childish thing but once upon a time bartenders could do better they knew how to dress up a soft drink without creating an embarrassment the horses neck is described in a book by rupert hughes an immensely popular and astonishingly prolific novelist playwright biographer and silent film director who is now remembered if at all as a footnote in the life of his wacky nephew howard in his novel "what will people say " hughes described the drink as "that most innocent of beverages which masquerades ginger ale and a section of lemon peel under the ferocious name the bloodthirsty and viking like title of a horses neck " if hughes thought the name "horses neck" suggested a ferocious bloodthirst then it is no wonder that his prose has become so scarce but at least the name was one that could be spoken by an adult the drink was a staple at drugstores as british travel writer ethel alec tweedie discovered nearly a hundred years ago when she found refuge in a pharmacy during a rainstorm "now be it understood a drug store is not like ours in england " alec tweedie writes in "america as i saw it or america revisited " published in "while one counter is given up to drugs the other sells soft drinks " she suggests that americans "drink too many iced concoctions on the one side and require physic on the other " looking for someone to call her a hackney alec tweedie steps up to the "iced drinks counter" and asks if she could get a "hansom cab " "no maam " says the druggist "but i can mix you a horses neck " after first assuming she had been the victim of some inexplicable rudeness alec tweedie realizes that "the man thought my hansom cab was a drink " presented with a horses neck instead she mellows declaring it to be "extremely good " though usually made with lemon peel any rind would do in a pinch jack london wrote fondly of the horses neck in his regretful "alcoholic memoir" of hard drinking "john barleycorn " london explained that at first his "drinking was wholly a matter of companionship " with people who were drinking whiskey he drank whiskey among teetotalers he was happy dry "alcohol " london said "was an utterly negligible question so far as i was concerned " he gives as an example a youthful atlantic crossing "i chummed with an english cable operator and a younger member of a spanish shipping firm now the only thing they drank was horses neck a long soft cool drink with an apple peel or an orange peel floating in it " london wrote "and for that whole voyage i drank horses necks with my two companions " london wished he had stuck with horses necks but h l mencken in best curmudgeonly fashion argued that the "fearsome" drinking that was thought to have killed london was also what "made him " in a letter to upton sinclair mencken declared "london sober would have written nothing worth reading " well into the s the horses neck was a favorite of young ladies looking to appear sophisticated on dates without losing their wits and perhaps more to liquor but by then the drink was as often as not served "with a kick " the kick was usually a jigger or two of whiskey gin or brandy were also common the drink soft or hard ultimately fell out of favor i think because bartenders found it to be too much trouble "if a newspaperman at the national press club called for a pink lady or a horses neck " united press correspondent harmon w nichols wrote in the clubs bartender frank matera "would yank off his glasses and say meet me in the hall sir " matera wasnt about to carve a long peel of lemon and arrange it in a glass just so "frank who has been dishing out straight ones with water on the side for many years doesnt cotton to fancy stuff " well i think its worth the bother it takes the peel of an entire lemon to cut the overpowering sweetness of todays ginger ale whether with bourbon or without and no umbrellas please email me at eric felten wsj com horses neck  oz bourbon or brandy or gin or no liquor at all lemon peel ginger ale carve the peel of a lemon so that it is one long unbroken spiral arrange it in a highball glass so that one end touches the bottom of the glass and the other end is draped over the rim toss a few ice cubes down inside the spiral of lemon peel pour in the liquor or dont fill with ginger ale
