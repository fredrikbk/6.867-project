pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings fine art of distinctions the line between creative performance and actual authorship blurs new york what is intellectual property who owns it and who deserves to get paid for it playgoers and music lovers dont often have occasion to ask such rarefied questions but theyve lately become important to the producers of a broadway musical and the members of a british rock group in november the director choreographer and designers of the broadway production of "urinetown" publicly accused the carousel dinner theatre of akron ohio and the mercury theater of chicago of copying their work without permission and demanded royalty payments in return the akron and chicago companies denied the charges and sued the broadway production team for defamation last month a london judge awarded of the copyright of procol harums "a whiter shade of pale" to matthew fisher the groups ex organist mr fisher who had asked for doesnt claim to have written the song but he did write the bach like organ countermelody heard on the groups recording of "a whiter shade of pale " which sold million copies judge william blackburne called the countermelody "a distinctive and significant contribution to the overall composition and quite obviously the product of skill and labor on the part of the person who created it " at first glance these two cases may appear unrelated but i wouldnt be surprised if they both become landmarks in the evolution of copyright law time was when the "authorship" of a work of art was usually if not always a clear cut matter nobody wonders who wrote "david copperfield" or painted "guernica " even in the performing arts its long been taken for granted that the mere act of performance creates no enforceable property right on the part of the performer not even in the case of such unforgettable interpretations as say marlon brandos stanley kowalski or arturo toscaninis "otello " a recent case in point is erin mckeowns new album "sing you sinners" nettwerk ms mckeown one of the freshest singer songwriters of her generation has chosen this time around to cut an album of standards what sets it apart from the superficially similar efforts of such aging rock stars as linda ronstadt and rod stewart is that ms mckeown isnt recycling the smooth sounds of yesteryear instead she sings "somethings gotta give" and "just one of those things" as if shed written them herself performing them in the casual slightly rough hewn style of her previous albums "we will become like birds" and "grand " the effect is both arrestingly personal and utterly contemporary yet the songs remain recognizable as the work of johnny mercer and cole porter and it would never occur to anyone least of all ms mckeown to claim that the versions heard on "sing you sinners" are original compositions in any sense of the phrase legal or otherwise but what about "performance arts" like jazz and postmodern theater in which the acts of composition and performance can be all but impossible to disentangle who for instance is the true "author" of charlie parkers recording of "embraceable you " in which george gershwins familiar melody is never heard historically a directors staging of a play has had the same legal status as a singers interpretation of a song but john rando the director of "urinetown " thinks it should be protected by copyright and subject to royalty whether or not the directors of the akron and chicago productions of "urinetown" stole his ideas this claim is clearly defensible as is judge blackburnes ruling in the "whiter shade of pale" case mr rando is one of new yorks best stage directors and i have no doubt that his work on "urinetown" constituted "a distinctive and significant contribution to the overall composition " as for "a whiter shade of pale " anyone familiar with procol harums recording would be likely to agree that mr fishers countermelody is an integral part of the song heres the problem where do you draw the line separating creative performance from actual authorship yes phil woodss coruscating alto saxophone solo on billy joels "just the way you are" is one of that songs most memorable features but does that fact entitle mr woods to a share of the royalties that are paid to mr joel for having written the song such vexing questions are being asked against the backdrop of a furious copyright related battle that has been triggered by the emergence of the internet on one side are the technogeeks who believe in stewart brands popular catchphrase that "information wants to be free" and that the web has made all traditional definitions of intellectual property rights obsolete on the other are the copyright happy bean counters determined to make you pay for permission to quote two lines from a song lyric on your blog no doubt the legislators and judges who drag copyright law into the st century will split the difference between these unworkable extremes mr rando and his colleagues like mr fisher will presumably end up somewhere in the middle but where ive no idea though i know this much the lawyers will make out like bandits they always do mr teachout the
