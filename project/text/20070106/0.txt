a buyout duo reads potential in newspaper avista likes quality of star tribune brand thoughts of rebound leveraged buyout firms such as kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co texas pacific group and blackstone group have been making news for their ambitious takeover deals but few of the headline grabbing buyouts have been as gutsy as the &# million planned purchase by avista capital partners of mcclatchy co s star tribune newspaper announced in late december the deal for the nations th largest newspaper by circulation comes amid a slump in the business the star tribune is especially challenged it has been the worst performing paper in terms of revenue for mcclatchy which paid &# billion for the minneapolis paper in the star tribunes ad revenue dropped about last year on a circulation decline of about despite the ugly writing on the wall for the industry the prospective purchase is the third largest for new york based avista a previously little known private equity firm that still is raising its first buyout fund and whose executives have never bought any newspaper properties avista mightnt be a household name but its founders thompson dean and steven webster have been well known in the buyout community for more than a decade they ran a group that generated returns of about from buyout investments for donaldson lufkin &amp jenrette which was acquired by credit suisse in the pair left credit suisse months ago to start avista which they hope will manage &# billion the year old mr dean who is the son of a career foreign service officer was born in taiwan and grew up in asia says they already have spent &# million to make buyout purchases focusing on energy media and health care mr webster is an energy specialist who had founded falcon drilling so what do they see with the star tribune deal that others in the buyout world missed a very cheap price times the papers cash flow a respected brand and an industry that may be bottoming out and poised for a rebound avista passed on bidding for the philadelphia inquirer which mr dean says doesnt have comparable cash flow as the star tribune "we got a premium paper in a healthy market and we paid a very attractive price " says mr dean "there is meaningful franchise value for top papers the risk is that readership continues its steady decline " the avista team which left credit suisse when the bank became wary of competing with its clients for large buyouts is comfortable making contrarian bets "newspapers are poised to stabilize their revenue base and advertising rates are stabilizing " mr dean says "people will continue to read newspapers " mr dean wouldnt address whether avista will slash costs or lay off employees "newspapers have to recognize that they are operating in a different environment with different pressures declining readership and advertising pressures " he says "we have to get additional revenue growth and do things more efficiently but that may not be about staff cuts " while public investors penalize newspaper companies for their lack of growth private equity investors generally are more concerned with steady cash flows and newspapers usually dont have steep capital expenditures that soak up cash so if the star tribunes circulation stops declining and avista can generate some growth for the papers web site the firm might avoid significant cost cutting "to generate an acceptable return we only need modest growth because of the papers impressive high free cash flow " and the low purchase price that avista paid mr dean says avista hasnt said how much of its funds own cash it will use for the purchase price and how much of it will come from debt it will pile on the paper avistas executives dont have any newspaper experience but they are used to betting on overlooked media sectors in the early s the avista team scored by buying the argyle television group which turned out to be a profitable investment at a time "people said no one will watch network tv " mr dean recalls they also scored on radio purchases in may of last year while the cable television business was in wall streets doghouse avista bought wideopenwest the th largest cable company in the u s the funds first buyout wideopenwest which focuses on cities like detroit and chicago was grappling with savage competition and was sold by two buyout firms with broad media experience but cable stocks have taken off since the avista purchase wideopenwests cash flow is up almost and people in the private equity world describe the deal as a home run at least so far although avista hasnt made previous newspaper acquisitions it placed chris harte a former knight ridder executive whose family is among the owners of san antonio based direct marketing firm and publisher harte hanks inc as the chairman of star tribunes holding company "if you analyze the performance of avistas team over time you see consistent strong investments with low volatility " says daniel cahill who manages u s private equity investments for scotlands standard life investments one of avistas first investors but mr cahill notes that "spinning off from credit suisse will cause some distractions" for the group as they continue to expand
