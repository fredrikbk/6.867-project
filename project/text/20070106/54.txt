pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state rating the ratings q when i shop for wine one retail outlet offers "ratings" from wine spectator a second from the wine advocate and a third from wine enthusiast i read these and am sometimes motivated to try the wine being touted however i wonder are these ratings really independent and credible assessments mark j schneider travelers rest s c a thats such a good question that its just about impossible for us to answer it without stepping into potholes because people feel really strongly about these ratings both pro and con what we would say and have always said is this it can never hurt to gather information and opinions on any subject and writers who get you excited about trying new wines are great but dont get obsessed with anyones specific ratings including ours no matter how independent and well meaning any wine rating may be it is simply a reflection of that raters taste and opinion your taste may be different and in the long run the only rating that matters is your own personally if we were looking for guidance on a specific bottle wed much rather hear from the wine merchant at the store because we like to look into the eyes of the person who has to stand behind a recommendation lifting labels q occasionally i find a wine that i like enough that id like to find it again i have tried removing the labels but the adhesives make it almost impossible im lucky if i get a pile of tiny scraps of the label each time any suggestions chad croft gibsonia pa a this is one of our most asked questions and were happy about that because were glad so many people are drinking wines they want to remember we have been saving labels for more than years so weve removed thousands for many years we put the empty uncorked bottles into boiling water most labels especially on german wines floated right off more recently we have found that more labels are easier to remove with the oven method for that put the empty uncorked bottles into the oven and heat the oven to degrees until the bottles are hot maybe minutes or so remove very very carefully and the labels especially australian labels will peel right off put the labels on wax paper be very careful with those hot bottles if the label doesnt peel right off wait until the bottle cools and try boiling if all else fails many wine stores sell label removers that are essentially big pieces of adhesive that rip the label right off crystal gazing q crystallization on cork what does it mean to the wine and how does it get there peter kellogg new york a these are harmless tartrate deposits that occur naturally winemakers generally avoid these in various ways including filtration because they know they bother consumers or as the oxford companion to wine which has an extensive entry on this explains delicately "the modern wine industry has in the main decided that tartrate stabilization is preferable to consumer education "
