hot topic can bushs tax cuts survive president bush called on the new democrat led congress last week to permanently extend the tax cuts that are the centerpiece of his domestic policy program those tax cuts totaled nearly &# trillion over ten years most are set to expire at the end of after mr bush leaves office extending those tax cuts will be critical to mr bushs long term economic legacy but achieving the presidents goal will be difficult many members of congress including some republicans argue that extending the tax cuts could exacerbate the budget deficit some complain the cuts favor the affluent theres no sign that the democratic leaders of congress have any intention of addressing this issue in the coming year house democrats approved legislation friday to restore "pay as you go" spending if enacted it could jeopardize any extension of the tax cuts because it requires new tax cut or entitlement legislation to be offset by increased revenue or decreased spending meantime the white house hopes to convince congress that it can both bring down the budget deficit and deal with the projected costs of medicare and social security so that tax cuts can be made permanent without harming the nations fiscal health the presidents budget plan for fiscal is due next month heres a look at some of the key issues surrounding the tax cuts why do the presidents tax cuts expire under complicated congressional budget rules the president would have needed of votes in the senate to enact permanent tax cuts back in but he only needed a simple majority to enact tax cuts that expired within ten years the white house calculated that it couldnt get votes for the ambitious tax cuts it wanted at the time many politicians figured extension of the tax cuts would be automatic but as the date of expiration gets closer its increasingly clear it wont be largely because of the high cost to the budget an extension of the tax cuts would cost an estimated &# trillion through according to white house figures do some tax cuts have more support in congress than others yes democrats have said they would keep any cuts that help middle and working class families including increased child tax credits some marriage penalty relief provisions and the new income tax bracket theres less support particularly among democrats for tax cuts that are seen as benefitting the most affluent that includes tax cuts on capital gains and dividends and the cut in the top two tax brackets all of which would cost an estimated &# billion through less the amount of taxes people would save by reducing their capital gains realizations and other tax avoidance efforts according to the tax policy center a joint project of the brookings institution and the urban institute can congress balance the budget if it keeps the tax cuts in the short term maybe but it wont be easy white house forecasts show a &# billion shortfall in making the tax cuts permanent while balancing the budget will require sharp spending cuts which likely will cause even many congressional republicans to balk president bushs efforts to constrain spending in the past have had little effect in part because of the costs of homeland security and the wars in afghanistan and iraq and in part because of resistance from congress now that democrats are in control the resistance from congress is likely to be greater in the long term the task gets even more difficult due to baby boomers retiring and the resulting explosion in social security and medicare costs social security and medicare trustees estimate the social security fund will go into deficit in and its trust fund will run out of money by medicare ran a deficit in but not in due to a surge in tax revenue and estimates show its trust fund will be depleted by are there other tax cuts or tax increases being considered on the tax cut front both parties have expressed support for permanent changes to repair the alternative minimum tax it was designed to prevent the wealthy from evading taxes but increasingly has snared middle class taxpayers because it was never indexed for inflation the amt is projected to bring in &# trillion over the next decade and yesterdays passage of "pay go" legislation could add an extra hurdle by requiring congress to make up that revenue without adding to the deficit as for tax increases democrats have proposed eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and more aggressive measures to crack down on tax evasion nick timiraos points of view now is not the time to raise taxes on the american people "
