hot topic bushs tax legacy in his op ed column on these pages this week president bush made some news by underscoring his opposition to raising taxes we were certainly glad to hear it and to publish it because by our lights the tax cuts and economic growth that has followed are his most notable domestic achievements give or take a supreme court justice that growth was underscored again with yesterdays buoyant jobs and income report for december job growth exceeding expectations at and the jobless rate held at a very low despite a slowdown in manufacturing and construction since the bush tax cuts on dividends and capital gains passed in mid the economy has created million new jobs according to the survey of business establishments and an additional million in the more variable household survey as for the inevitable political complaints that these new jobs are all lousy average hourly non supervisory wages have now climbed over the past months or twice the official rate of inflation with flat or falling energy prices and a tight labor market real wages are also starting to show impressive gains meanwhile tax revenues continue to roll into the treasury and state coffers federal receipts rose by in fiscal another in and kept rising by in this years first two months despite slower gdp growth the budget deficit in turn has fallen by &# billion in two years and including state surpluses is now down to about of gdp which as an economic matter is negligible tax revenues as a share of the economy are also back above which is their modern historical norm this record is so impressive that liberal critics have been forced to ignore it and focus on other alleged outrages such as "inequality " or ceo pay or some vague prediction of future doom and yes the future is unpredictable but in the field of economics there are few more definitive tests than the results from the tax cuts of critics predicted disaster supporters the opposite and the supporters can point to more than three years of prosperity as vindication despite &# oil and &# gasoline and lately despite the worst housing slowdown in years however those lower tax rates are set to expire at the end of and the democrats who now control congress want them repealed the "pay as you go" rules that the house just passed would make their extension all but impossible what this means is that if congress merely fails to act the tax cuts expire and the economy will be hit with one of the largest tax increases in history in the dividend rate would snap back to from the capital gains rate to from and the top marginal income tax rate to from marginal and average tax rates for the middle class would also increase returning to the clinton era levies that had driven taxes as a share of gdp to a postwar high of now in the minority on capitol hill republicans cant do much about this but it certainly poses a dilemma for democrats all the more so because they must also cope with the rising burden of the alternative minimum tax the amt created by democrats in to capture a few millionaires will engulf some million taxpayers this year without a change in law this week the new democratic chairman of the senate finance committee montanas max baucus called the amt a "monster in the tax code" and introduced a bill to repeal it the only catch under congresss wacky "static revenue" analysis of calculating the impact of tax cuts amt repeal would "cost" the treasury as much as &# trillion over years maybe they can find that much in congressman william jeffersons freezer our guess is that democrats will try to finesse all this in the near term with president bush now saying hell oppose a tax increase theyll be wary of voting for one that would be vetoed and provide republicans with an issue in so perhaps theyll try a one or two year amt fix to get them past while waiting for their presidential nominee to advance a more detailed tax proposal most likely that would involve a pledge to keep the lower bush rates for the "middle class " while raising rates on "the rich " bill clinton played that tune all the way to the oval office only to raise taxes on everybody once he got there itll be fascinating to see if voters give his wife senator hillary rodham clinton the same leave if shes the democratic nominee in any event what we seem headed for is a two year national donnybrook over taxes and income that will be decided by the voters in november
