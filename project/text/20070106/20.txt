how do you repay a heros sacrifice three years ago a fellow marine gave his life to save kelly miller it has been a hard road since two mothers join forces eureka calif kelly miller has the dream once or twice a week hes on patrol in iraq searching a white toyota land cruiser the driver lunges out and grabs cpl millers squad leader jason dunham around the neck the iraqi and cpl dunham tumble to the ground in a ferocious hand to hand struggle cpl miller beats the insurgent with a police baton another marine races over to help the iraqi drops a hand grenade the force of the explosion lifts cpl dunham into the air his back arching before he falls back toward the brown dirt road cpl miller wakes up almost three years have passed since that grenade exploded for real but the images are never far from his mind the insurgent the explosion and the friend who intentionally took the brunt of a live grenade and gave his own life to save cpl millers the adrenalin of combat the pain of hot shrapnel the guilt of making it home alive at the white house on thursday president bush will present cpl dunhams parents with the medal of honor the nations highest award for military valor the first such award for a marine since vietnam the ceremony will enshrine jason dunham for posterity as one who loved his brothers more than himself in the audience will sit cpl miller a year old still struggling with what it means to receive that much love when american forces rolled into baghdad in april kelly miller was living with his parents in eureka in their modest shingled home within sight of the smoky columns rising from the local paper mill his mom linda was an energetic doctors office manager with practical short hair his dad charlie was a quiet man who delivered mail for years then retired to care for his grandchildren kelly miller sandy brown haired and six foot one spent his days with friends fishing for crabs and racing his car by the beach on weekends he managed the night crew at the local supermarket but the news from iraq made him wonder about his own courage how would he perform in combat one morning after his shift ended he walked into the marine recruiters office at the strip mall and enlisted in the infantry so just after noon on april he found himself a grunt in the fourth platoon of kilo co third battalion seventh marines and cpl dunhams point man on a patrol through a trash strewn iraqi neighborhood near karabilah on the syrian border he was stillwhat the marines called a boot a private first class fresh out of boot camp many senior enlisted men made life miserable for the boots but cpl dunham was different when the boots had to fill sand bags in the hot sun cpl dunham filled sand bags beside them cpl miller and other boots loved him for it the insurgents had already gotten the jump on the patrol that day firing a rocket propelled grenade at the squads humvees the grenade had missed its mark and cpl dunhams men climbed out of the vehicles to hunt down the shooter as point man it was cpl millers job to spot roadside bombs and ambushes before it was too late the responsibility weighed on him as he moved carefully past stone walls and silent half built homes he worried that any mistake would get his friends killed the patrol stopped to search a line of vehicles that seemed to be fleeing cpl miller and cpl dunham approached the white land cruiser where cpl miller saw a rifle poking out from under the rear floor mat he looked up just in time to see the driver attack cpl dunham the insurgents hand grenade sprayed cpl miller and cpl bill hampton the other marine who rushed to cpl dunhams aid with jagged pieces of metal cpl miller heard a ringing in his head the echoes of a burst ear drum his face flushed hot and his mouth tasted of blood a red stream dripped off his left hand and he was confused to find that he couldnt pick up his rifle pieces of shrapnel burned in his face and arms "my mom is going to be pissed " he told another marine as he wandered away from the scene according to both men despite the shrapnel that peppered cpl hampton he too was able to stagger away but cpl dunham lay still a fragment embedded deep in his brain he would die eight days later at a naval hospital in bethesda md with his parents at his bedside cpl dunhams commanders soon figured out that he had placed his helmet over the grenade to protect his friends an act of bravery described in a front page story in the wall street journal on may the marines sent cpl miller to recuperate in eureka where he became withdrawn and quick to anger he couldnt get it out of his head that as point man he was supposed to protect the marines behind him he was the first one to get to cpl dunhams side but instead of saving jason jason saved him he had a tattoo artist ink a helmet and rifle memorial honoring cpl dunham on his right arm with the words remember the fallen when he was well enough to play softball cpl miller taped his wrist to give him strength to swing the bat and wrote "cpl j d usmc" on the wrap "mom goddammit " he told mrs miller after a couple of beers one night "i should have done more to save jason " mrs miller now became long distance friends with cpl dunhams mom deb a year old with shoulder length red hair mrs dunham taught home economics at the only school in tiny scio n y patiently coaching students in such survival skills as child care and bachelors cooking at home she baked pies made fudge and did battle with three dogs when she first dated dan dunham a farmhand the locals thought them an unlikely pair she was a self described good girl he took pride in being a hard drinking bad boy who gave the local police headaches he had already been married once and was raising two young boys jason and justin on his own on &# a month she fell in love as much with the boys as she did with dan and ever after raised them as her own the dunhams had two more children together for years mrs dunham couldnt rest until she knew all four children were safe in their beds mrs dunham wasnt surprised that jason had given his own life for his friends she would have been surprised if he had done anything else under the circumstances in a letter to cpl hamptons mother mrs dunham wrote "when you next get a chance to hug your son please give him one from me he does not need to know it is from me but i would appreciate if you would do that for me " far from begrudging cpls miller and hampton their survival mrs dunham felt that their lives added meaning to her own sons death soon deb dunham and linda miller began referring to cpl miller as "our son " "we believe that kelly and william are both very special " mrs dunham wrote to mrs miller "i do not know what is in their futures but i we firmly believe that jason did what he had to do and they have some important purpose here and he has his to do in heaven " but for months cpl miller couldnt get himself to talk to jasons parents when they finally met at the marines desert base in twentynine palms calif cpl miller spoke with them for awkward minutes unsure whether to thank them or apologize as he regained strength and sensation in his arms cpl miller returned to twentynine palms obsessed with trying to rejoin his old platoon mates before they shipped out for their next tour of iraq in the second half of it troubled him that his friends had finished their full seven months in the combat zone while he had not cpl millers commander allowed him to resume light duty as kilo co s clerk but even in iraq that would be a rear echelon job without the camaraderie of the front lines so several times a day cpl miller pestered the captain to allow him to rejoin fourth platoon as a rifleman doing five quick pull ups outside the office for emphasis the captain would allow cpl miller back into a rifle platoon only with permission from his surgeon his physical therapist the battalion medical officer and his mother cpl miller collected the letters including one from a very reluctant mrs miller in march the captain cleared him to rejoin fourth platoon and cpl miller traveled home to eureka to break the news mrs miller was in her room folding clothes on the bed when he told her that he would soon return to iraq "why do you feel you need to go back " she asked him "you dont have to " "i have to finish something i started the first time " cpl miller told her he left the room returning a few minutes later "i have to go and finish what dunham started and bring my guys home " he said soon enough cpl miller found himself in ramadi the most hostile city in the sunni triangle for what proved to be months of grueling cat and mouse games with the insurgents the marines of kilo co hid in abandoned buildings to ambush bomb makers they manned an isolated bomb gutted outpost that was a frequent target for mortar and rocket attacks they watched as iraqis in civilian clothes casually dropped explosives on the main road through the city on three occasions cpl miller called home from iraq to report that he had been hurt once he injured his ankle playing basketball on base another time he stepped into a hole while on patrol and another his humvee was destroyed by a roadside bomb each time he called mrs miller would report back to mrs dunham and they would fret together after he returned from ramadi cpl miller decided he had had enough of the marine corps and on his web page he put a clock that counted down to the end of his enlistment in june when the clock hit zero he hoped to join his older brother as a sheriffs deputy back home in eureka he liked the idea of uniformed service but without the long overseas deployments that made it hard to raise a family as a marine over the years cpl miller grew more comfortable around the dunhams and made a habit of calling mrs dunham on holidays such as christmas and mothers day when he knew that jason would have called theyd chat about his dating life and the doings of the dunham family he had long talks with jasons younger brother and sister mrs dunham noticed the brotherly teasing tone of their conversations as if kelly were trying to fill the gap left by jason he talked to kyle then about the pros and cons of enlisting in the marines reminding him that going to college first would give him more options in life enlisting meant a four year contract one night last summer mrs dunham hit a low spot home alone and desperate to talk to jason in tears she phoned cpl miller he had friends over but kept her talking until she was laughing again on his web page cpl miller wrote "who id like to meet the most honorable man i have ever had the privilege of meeting cpl jason dunham to have a chance to talk to him one more time would be priceless " at the same time mrs miller felt that her sons personality had darkened her kelly had been such a happy go lucky kid now he seemed at ease only with other marines or with two eureka friends who served in the army his voice mail message was a droning monotone "youve reached kelly whatever " on his web page he posted a photo of himself in ramadi aiming a rifle at the photographer he described his nissan sports car and wrote "i love to pitch it sideways or scream through a windy mountain pass " one weekend last september cpl miller left base and drove to eureka to see his girlfriend kellyn griffin a year old junior at humboldt state university on saturday night they went to the apartment of one of his army buddies to play a movie trivia game ms griffin drank rum and cokes cpl miller drank makers mark bourbon they left just after midnight cpl miller made it about a mile before he lost control of the nissan and flipped it over at a "high rate of speed " according to the police report the car took to the air sheared off a wooden utility pole feet above the street and came to a rest on the drivers side crunched up like a paper napkin after a dinner party ms griffin was found in a pool of blood fifty feet away from the nissan with a broken arm a lacerated liver and a concussion that dulled her thinking for days police found cpl miller walking in circles in a nearby parking lot when a state trooper interviewed him the corporal volunteered that he " messed up and am screwed for drunk driving" and said he had to take responsibility for his mistake according to the police report the officer arrested him at a m after a test that police say revealed a blood alcohol level above the legal limit the crash broke cpl millers nose a front tooth and his left shoulder blade and socket at the hospital cpl miller was frantic for news of ms griffin blood still covering his face he found her hospital bed felt his head spin and stumbled out of the room cpl miller was released a few hours later that night mrs miller called cpl dunhams mom "well our boy did it " mrs miller said a few days later mrs dunham called back and laid into cpl miller "you need to stop kelly " she recalls saying "you need to learn to like yourself because jason gave you a gift your mom and i cant lose anybody else " "i know " he said "im sorry " "whether you do something spectacular or not you still havent completed your purpose in this life " she continued "whether its you or your child or your great great grandchild who does something phenomenal you have a purpose here and your destiny isnt done yet " cpl miller was on heavy painkillers at the time and soon forgot the details of the conversation but later he remembered how angry jasons mother had been and how ashamed he had felt the police charged cpl miller with two drunk driving felonies that carry a maximum combined penalty of six years in prison a felony conviction would kill any chance of joining the sheriffs department shortly after doctors removed the staples closing the wound on her back ms griffin and cpl miller lay in bed in his childhood room "i feel really bad because in essence someone gave his life for me and then i turned around and instead of making use of it i quite possibly put it to waste " he told her near the bed was a photo of cpl miller in his dress blues and purple heart medal a reminder of cpl dunhams sacrifice "i have to do good by more people and live up to the potential of both of us " cpl miller told her the corporals fellow grunts have rallied to his side when maj trent gibson commander of kilo co when cpl dunham was killed heard about the car accident he felt he had let cpl miller down even though the major had changed jobs in the marine corps he knew that kelly had been having nightmares about the grenade attack he knew kelly had been getting reckless he wished he had said something earlier now he emailed his men kilo brothers for those of you who havent heard cpl miller had another near death experience this last sunday hes goddamned lucky lets all give him a phone call or shoot him an email and let him know that we care about him and that hes got to keep his head on straight if hes going to make good on the gift that cpl dunham gave him semper kilo marines who had served under cpl miller in ramadi sent letters and emails to the judge who would hear his case "this marine has only to begin his life " wrote lcpl robert b bullard "to rob him of what he has done for me my platoon and country would not only be morally incorrect but a criminal act against a mistake " mrs dunham wrote a lengthy letter telling the judge how cpl miller had rushed to her sons side that day in iraq she described how he had since stepped in as a surrogate brother to her youngest children she also described how kelly "has been chasing his personal demons" since jason sacrificed himself "i wish you would consider that kelly is an honorable young man who volunteered to serve and protect those weaker than himself " she wrote on nov at the opening of the marine corps museum in quantico va president bush announced his decision to award cpl dunham the medal of honor leaving the ceremony mrs dunham talked about the legacy of her sons death "im worried about kelly " she said "its a gift strings arent attached to it guilt shouldnt be attached to it they should just do the best they can with their lives " the dunhams have invited dozens of kilo co marines to thursdays medal of honor presentation in the east room of the white house the award they say isnt just for their son its for all of the young men who served beside him two weeks later cpl miller is due back in court his lawyer is trying to persuade the judge and prosecutor to reduce the felony charges to misdemeanors which would probably allow the corporal to avoid prison if they agree and he keeps his record clean for a few years he could still apply to be a sheriffs deputy on his web page cpl miller writes "i cant wait for the time to come for a new chapter in my life "
