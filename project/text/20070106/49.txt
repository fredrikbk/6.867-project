pursuits books the slide of the sedgwicks in my blood by john sedgwick harpercollins pages &# the "sedgwick pie" is the informal name for the family graveyard in stockbridge mass where generations of sedgwicks lie buried in concentric circles around the tomb of theodore sedgwick the founder of the familys fortunes as john sedgwick relates in "in my blood " his ingenious family memoir some sedgwicks become apprehensive when they approach the sedgwick pie no wonder "in my blood" is not an aristocratic lament after the fashion of evelyn waugh or giuseppe lampedusa the principal theme is one of gothic horror ever since theodore sedgwick rode into stockbridge in to build his mansion the history of the family has been little more than a record of frustrated ambition madness and despair it culminated in with the sacrifice of one time "it girl" edie sedgwick on andy warhols altars theodore sedgwick a prosperous lawyer and judge was a man of immense constructive power a federalist potentate who rose to be speaker of the house he had little time for anguish whether collaborating with hamilton feuding with madison or dining with washington he was helping to build a republic the "city on a hill" that his ancestors had crossed the ocean to create but already in theodore an important element of the original inspiration had faded he had lost the puritan faith of his fathers theodores children though rich lacked purpose the republic had been built and a more democratic country had little need for a federalist family that plumed itself on its aristocratic superiority succeeding generations of sedgwicks finding no scope for their energy turned inward with grim results during the course of mr sedgwicks narrative some half a dozen sedgwicks commit suicide more are sent to asylums the first to take her life pamela was the wife whom theodore neglected in order to lay the foundations of federalism similar stories have been told before most memorably by henry adams but where "the education of henry adams" omits the gory details the drunks and suicides of fallen patriciandom mr sedgwick retails them skillfully what emerges is a lurid inversion of the american dream for mr sedgwicks burdened scions america is a land not of opportunity but of mocking ancestral ghosts when the author himself in arrives as a new boy at groton school an institution that his relations the peabodys founded in in order to breathe life into the decaying gentility the school seems to him in spite of its "ruskinian beauty " a "mausoleum " mr sedgwick tells his tale partly from the perspective of modern psychology he describes his own struggles with manic depression and he speculates that the same affliction may explain the crash and burn mania of some of his forebears what is more intriguing however is the romantic modeling of the narrative theodore sedgwick was a neo classical th century man committed to reason and order his children by contrast were products of the romantic age their macabre propensities give mr sedgwicks tale the haunting qualities of a romantic period piece here are the living types that hawthorne and poe turned into literature catharine sedgwick theodores daughter was one of the foremost female writers of the american romantic school but it is mr sedgwick himself who by chronicling the furies that goaded the family supplies the story with a suitably morbid coda he shows how many of his relations having grown too self absorbed to act constructively in the world passively took their places in the kind of overheated domestic drama that faulkner has accustomed us to think of as exclusively a southern possession edie sedgwicks father francis was the least attractive victim of what mr sedgwick calls the family "viper" of mental instability it is a paradox of the sedgwicks that they long championed equality even as they cherished an aristocratic conceit theodore himself an arch federalist who scorned the common man helped to liberate a black female slave mumbet from another new england family she afterward went to work for him and held his family together while he went off to fight daniel shays and thomas jefferson francis sedgwick however openly rebelled against the equalitarian ideal his mania took the form of an overt racism and he feuded bitterly with groton after the school admitted a black student in he was "afraid that blacks might make off with his own daughters " mr sedgwick writes edie "bore the brunt of some of her fathers fiercer delusions " edie emerges in mr sedgwicks telling as a s version of the cornered heroines of gothic romance when she crossed the threshold of andy warhols factory his loft on east th street she entered a modern castle of horrors it is dramatically fitting that warhol the novus homo the new man the "pale faced hollow hearted immigrants kid" from a steel town should have been the one who "destroyed her " as mr sedgwick writes edie who died of a drug overdose was the last of the sedgwicks to hold "the nation in thrall " "in my blood" offers the traditional satisfactions of tragedy pride and punishment but it also makes a larger point about the selfprotective mechanisms of american democracy america permits talented families to rise high but it exacts from them a fearful tribute in the name of its democratic culture mr beran is the author of studies of robert kennedy and thomas jefferson
