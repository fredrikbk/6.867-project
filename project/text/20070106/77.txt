the villains of currency investors excitement allows fraudsters to get even the savvy cashing in on the volatile world of buying and selling currencies just became riskier scam artists are increasingly using currency trading schemes to ensnare even experienced investors regulators say the scams take many forms soliciting individuals over the telephone or wooing them at hotel presentations one widespread scheme promises investors fat profits if they jump in on a time sensitive opportunity to trade currencies the money then disappears or gets eaten up in unprofitable trades such frauds exploit a growing awareness among the investing public that the global foreign exchange market worth roughly &# trillion a day is an important financial arena they also benefit from a legal loophole not all of the people who solicit investors to trade currencies are regulated making them difficult to monitor schemes like these are "the fraud du jour " says michael dunn a commissioner at the commodity futures trading commission the government body responsible for regulating a portion of currency trading in recent years foreign exchange fraud cases have expanded to take up of the bodys current litigation "this is a real problem out there " says mr dunn over the past five years more than investors have been burned by these frauds which employ a variety of tactics to lure individuals some firms set up booths at investor fairs or rely on printed brochures or pitches over the telephone other schemes target particular ethnic groups or spread by word of mouth thats how vicki myers learned about white pine trust corp a san diego foreign currency fund before deciding whether to invest ms myers visited the companys office the firm had trading screens glossy brochures and it claimed an outstanding track record impressed ms myers and her husband invested &# in retirement funds and other savings after the funds web site stopped working and no one returned her calls she drove back to the office in only to find it abandoned the money was likely gone she realized the funds founder is now in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud "it made me sick " recalls the year old who is a marketing director at a residence for the elderly she estimates that about half of her husbands retirement savings disappeared in the fraud the scams tap into an increasing curiosity among individuals about the world of currencies long the domain of banks companies and other institutions "the strength and weakness in the dollar is being talked about in the headlines on a daily basis " says muhammad rasoul chief operating officer of global forex trading a registered foreign exchange firm based in michigan that caters to individual customers "youre going to have people trying to take advantage of those who arent as familiar" with currencies to combat such practices mr rasoul advocates closing the loopholes that allow some currency market players to escape regulation and help unscrupulous operators to thrive knowing how to identify legitimate foreign exchange players is particularly important since the number of firms catering to individual investors has exploded in recent years increasing numbers of small investors are trying their hand at buying and selling actual money thanks to electronic trading platforms that require low minimum investments its a risky proposition that features unpredictable swings in prices that can wipe out gains the scams rarely mention such hazards they target not only financial novices and the elderly but also investors with an advanced grasp of how markets work a good example is the con that ensnared ms myers which managed to solicit more than &# million from investors the funds founder richard matthews jr pleaded guilty to wire fraud in in federal court in san diego and is in prison while a receiver liquidates the ill gotten gains from the scam which included a acre island in belize property in california and a yacht investors in the scheme may recover approximately of their original investment according to the receiver the frauds themselves differ in type and scope a garden variety scam might work like this fraudsters rent a telemarketing "boiler room" complete with phones and cubicles and start cold calling numbers from a list of leads available for purchase they promise large guaranteed returns hail their track record and ask that a minimum investment be wired to a particular bank if an investor bites the calls continue saying more money is needed to take advantage of an urgent trading opportunity when the investor asks for the money back the response is that the market has shifted then a month or two later the company closes "the next day theyre up and running under a new name " says mr dunn of the cftc florida is a particular hotspot for such schemes he says another tactic is to target members of a particular community in san francisco for example a firm placed a classified ad in a local chinese language newspaper promising well paid work with health insurance people who responded to the ad were given a minimal amount of training in how to trade currencies then they were asked to invest &# of their own money and to encourage friends and relatives to open accounts nearly all of the &# million invested by at least people was lost one fact that helps to explain the prevalence of such currency scams is that they sometimes slip through the regulatory cracks the cftc has the authority to crack down on fraud in futures contracts which are agreements to buy or sell a given commodity or in this case a particular currency on specific dates futures contracts are a basic way to speculate on currencies in a recent foreign exchange case cftc v zelener in the th u s circuit court of appeals in chicago the judges ruled that although customers were defrauded the contracts involved werent explicitly futures as a result the judges said the carefully worded contracts in the case put the wrongdoers beyond the mandate of the cftc "in effect it gave a blueprint for fraudsters on how to escape our jurisdiction " says mr dunn of the cftc last year congress examined ways to close the zelener loophole and is expected to reconsider the issue soon another issue exploited by fraudsters relates to how currency contracts get sold to the average investor the current law provides a fair degree of latitude for companies selling over the counter currency futures for example they dont have to register with a regulatory body as long as theyre affiliated with a company that has done so their employees can also escape regulatory scrutiny the result at times is high pressure sales tactics by people who were previously involved in other forms of commodity fraud says daniel roth president of the national futures association a self regulating body for the industry "essentially you have a completely unregulated sales force that is in some cases preying on retail customers " says mr roth "i cant believe thats what congress intended " some registered firms take steps to protect themselves mr rasoul of global forex trading says his firm wont take customer referrals from unregulated agents who may be using questionable practices to bring in business "were not interested in dealing with people who dont have some kind of responsibility over them " he says
