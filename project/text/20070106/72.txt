remembrances garry betty at the epicenter of the internets coming of age garry betty never gave up when rapid technological and regulatory changes threatened to doom earthlink inc in the business of connecting personal computers to the internet as the atlanta based companys chief executive mr betty cut costs orchestrated alliances and ultimately decided to transform the dial up internet service provider into a full service telecommunications company that would lead the way in rigging entire cities with wi fi wireless connection technology mr bettys death on jan at age from cancer cut short his quest but his ideas for keeping pace in a fast moving world stood out much like his earlier innovations made earthlink one of the hottest albeit not very profitable internet service companies "twenty years ago long before most people were even aware of the concept of the internet garry was at the epicenter " steve case co founder of aol now a unit of time warner inc wrote in an email "his contributions helped to make interactive services a part of everyday life " an intense competitor in business and his personal life mr betty seemed inexhaustible says close friend ron stewart who competed with him in running skiing and fishing in sky dayton a year old entrepreneur who a year earlier founded earthlink was looking for an experienced ceo and went after mr betty who had been an international business machines corp executive and ceo of digital communications associates inc an alpharetta ga based technology company while on a california ski trip together mr dayton recalls "almost falling off the lift" when they discussed compensation mr betty told him he made &# a year in his last job mr dayton then paid &# a year says he finally agreed to pay mr betty &# plus stock the internet then "was wildfire and he got infected by that " mr betty made earthlink the first internet service provider to switch to fixed rate pricing of &# a month breaking with an early model where users were charged by the minute it was a risky move but mr betty realized the price of internet connections would likely plummet recalls mike lunsford earthlinks interim ceo aol and the rest of the industry soon followed still even though earthlinks customer base grew rapidly the company was hemorrhaging money mr betty put earthlink on a sounder financial footing with a series of acquisitions and alliances that helped it grow to million subscribers in from customers in today it has more than five million subscribers in he formed an alliance with sprint corp now sprint nextel corp that merged the two companies internet access services in a &# billion deal in that doubled the number of its subscribers earthlink merged with mindspring enterprises inc and moved its headquarters to atlanta mindsprings home from southern california but the rise of high speed internet service known as broadband increasingly threatened earthlinks internet business model u s government regulations required the phone companies to allow isps such as earthlink to offer dial up services on their lines but no such regulations compelled cable companies to provide access to their lines with the growing popularity of broadband the lack of access to cable lines was one reason that aol bought time warner in again mr betty grasped at a chance to reposition earthlink when regulators approving the aol time warner deal worried that the merged company would promote aol at the expense of other internet service providers mr betty inserted himself into the merger negotiations and managed to win earthlink the chance to offer broadband service over time warner cable lines earthlink finally turned a profit in but in the supreme court overturned a federal court decision that would have forced cable companies to share their infrastructure with internet service providers such as earthlink in the federal communications commission ruled that phone companies arent required to provide access to their digital subscriber lines or dsl lines to companies such as earthlink shut out of broadband offered by cable and phone companies mr betty decided to focus on wireless internet that customers could access from anywhere he won agreements for earthlink to build wireless networks for entire cities starting with philadelphia he also cut a deal with korea based sk telecom co to start helio a specialized cellphone internet service mr betty believed that "you may have lost the broadband war but you might win the ubiquity war " says mr lunsford the interim ceo with wi fi broadband service up and running in new orleans anaheim and milpitas calif and parts of philadelphia it looked like earthlink might have a chance to turn things around when mr betty was stricken with cancer and took a leave of absence as ceo in november analysts say it is too early to say whether the wi fi initiative will pay off as intended until days before his death mr betty was rallying the troops at the earthlink christmas party "he put on a tux and came out for a night to make all of us feel better " wrote mr lunsford in a web posting "and he succeeded " stephen miller

including campbell soup and burger king mr mercer who worked for more than two decades at ad agency batten barton durstine &amp osborn now omnicom group inc s bbdo worked with campbell as it tried to appeal to middle class and blue collar audiences the result was its "manhandler" campaign which sought to give its thickest soups some guy appeal "the whole thing was based on talking to males about soups for them " says john bergen a bbdo colleague of mr mercers in the ads singer frankie laine sang the tagline "how do you handle a hungry man " the manhandler soups evolved into campbells popular chunky line mr mercer also helped create burger kings "have it your way" ad campaign in the mid s mr mercer wrote the phrase in inspired by research showing that consumers often had to wait for a mcdonalds hamburger if they had a special request the ad jingle still tickles memories today "hold the pickles hold the lettuce special orders dont upset us all we ask is that you let us have it your way " mr mercer said in a interview with the rutgers oral history archives of world war ii the client changed only a few words of his original idea a graduate of rutgers university mr mercer said good
