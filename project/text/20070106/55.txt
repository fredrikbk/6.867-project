pursuits golf journal crazy drivers the clubs about to shake up golf bizarre new designs could improve players shots and many in the game worry thats a bad thing you might as well get used to it when they go on sale next month big wacky square headed drivers like the one pictured at right will be top of the line models for callaway and nike and similarly unconventional clubs from other manufacturers will follow soon titleist that most traditional of clubmakers has already put a strange triangle shaped driver into the hands of some of its tour pros theres even talk in the industry of a possible new bullet shaped club no one has to use these new clubs just as no one had to switch to metal woods from persimmon headed drivers over the last two decades but these days spotting a wooden headed club on the golf course is as rare as getting a business letter composed on a typewriter and for the same reason the new stuff works a lot better the main performance improvement of the new clubs is that balls that are hit away from the center of the clubface lose less distance there comes a point however at which the new stuff may work too well thats the argument made by golf traditionalists many of whom contend that the combination of super duper clubs and balls that go too far and too straight has already compromised the game and rendered some of the great old courses obsolete for the pros for everyday players of course the notion of hitting a golf ball too far and too straight is absurd nevertheless one of the u s golf associations chief mandates is to keep the game from becoming too easy to "protect the challenge " in the words of the usgas senior technical director dick rugge golf clubs and balls in this country must pass muster with the usga manufacturers submit prototypes of new products for approval and not infrequently get them back stamped "rejected " the result is a cat and mouse game that has intensified dramatically in recent years on one side are the manufacturers with their multimillion dollar research and development laboratories many in the carlsbad area north of san diego and often staffed by engineering refugees from the aerospace industry the companies obvious goal is to sell as many clubs as possible especially drivers which golfers upgrade more often than irons and which often sell for &# to &# sometimes more pitted against them is the usgas small but sophisticated equipment testing department in far hills n j until about years ago getting a club approved was usually a benign gentlemanly affair because the technology wasnt rapidly evolving but then advances in metallurgy manufacturing processes and computer aided design techniques began allowing manufacturers to spin out much bigger clubheads improving forgiveness on off center hits with much springier clubfaces creating a kind of trampoline effect that propelled the ball farther and cleverer designs that moved the clubheads center of gravity around improving both distance and forgiveness coupled with equally ingenious improvements in golf balls these changes helped to dramatically boost driving distances on the pga tour the test ground and bellwether for new equipment and consequently triggered a storm of criticism of the usga for failing to rein in the advances playing catch up the usga by had imposed three new limitations on drivers on the amount of spring like effect in the clubface on total clubhead volume cc and on shaft length inches these rules seem to have had the intended effect since driving distances on the pga tour have been flat but this only motivated manufacturers to probe deeper in the regulations for other weaknesses to exploit taylor made for instance came up with a cost effective way for consumers to alter the trajectories of balls that involves moving small weight cartridges around in the head of a driver its r series approved in became a big seller but much of the recent emphasis has been on improving forgiveness quantified by a measurement called moment of inertia or moi the less a clubhead twists or deflects when it makes contact with the ball out near the edges of the clubface the more energy it is able to transfer to the ball and the less distance the shot loses also the less the clubface twists open or shut at impact the less the ball will slice or hook this time however the usga was ready for the manufacturers in late the association proposed a limit on moi of grams per centimeter squared if you must know but at least one company nike had a driver design in the works the sasquatch sumo with an moi higher than that of about during the usual period that the usga allows for manufacturers to comment on proposed regulations nike and other companies argued for a higher limit and the usga finally agreed last april to top out moi at "our research agreed with what the manufacturers said that this was a reasonable balanced place to set the limit " mr rugge said callaway whose square shaped entry is the ft i was also affected by the decision if history is any guide we golfers will end up embracing the new designs but we pay for our indulgence they cost more to produce and this contributes to the general price escalation in the industry compounding the problem are the nontrivial additional costs of building and maintaining roomier courses to accommodate the new balls and clubs other technology battles now being waged involve the grooves in irons clubmakers have learned to fine tune them in ways that traditionalists feel makes hitting out of the rough especially around the green with a wedge too easy and as always balls these controversies only directly affect the top tour players but what happens with the pros impacts us one way is that the pro game becomes less fun to watch tiger woods is among the pros who have publicly bemoaned the diminishing importance of shot making at the elite level the threat is that golf will go the way of mens tennis which composite rackets have reduced mostly to a display of serving prowess instead of the way of major league baseball which wisely preserved the wooden bat instead of allowing aluminum one obvious solution would be for the pros to use a different shorter ball than the rest of us or play with other restrictions the honchos at augusta national golf club which runs the masters have hinted that they may resort to this tactic if technology continues to improve apace last year the ohio state golf association became the first to mandate a limited flight ball in its high level amateur competitions and mr rugges division at the usga is conducting tests with similar balls in general however the manufacturers ferociously oppose this development sometimes called bifurcation they discovered long ago that the best way to sell more clubs and balls is for customers to identify with pros who use the same products i have to admit that as much as i theoretically favor something like bifurcation i would hate to lose that linkage it keeps the illusion alive that im playing the same game as tiger woods no word yet by the way on whether mr woods who endorses nike products will be playing the sumo when he returns to action in a few weeks somehow i would hate to think so email me at golfjournal wsj com our test driver it takes a tad longer to get used to the nike sasquatch sumo than most drivers but only because of its huge size and square shape in two sessions with the club i never quite got over those added corners at the rear but i quickly lost any fear that the clubheads shape would affect my swing the sumo felt like the drivers i am familiar with although the gunshot sound is distractingly loud and on a few shots i definitely noticed a difference in my ball flight im all too familiar with my most common mishit the pull hook with this club those shots started out as always woefully to the left and i braced for the insult to injury hook that would follow it came but noticeably less than usual dont expect miracles though i still managed to hit a few doozie slices and hooks with the sumo my seat of the pants guess is that at best the club would marginally improve my position something on the order of one or two times out of swings but thats nothing to sniff at john paul newport heads of the class some of the big innovations in golf drivers macgregor m this classic pear shaped persimmon wood driver with a retail price of &# in was used by many big name golfers of that era callaway big bertha named after a wwi cannon the big bertha made its debut in with a clubhead bigger than
