cabin fever runway bound a holiday flight becomes ugly fetid toilets crying and diaper shortages the cost of cutting after hours of sitting on the runway the toilets on the american airlines jet were overflowing there was no water to be found and no food except for a box of pretzel bags a pregnant woman sat crying an unaccompanied teen sobbed the captain walked up and down the aisle of the md trying to calm angry passengers at one point families with children lined up to be bused to the terminal but a bus never came flight a san francisco dallas run had been diverted to austin texas because of thunderstorms it was the friday before new years day and the jet was parked on the tarmac beside other stray flights planes came and went but flight was left waiting american confirms after more than eight hours on the ground and hours after the plane had left san francisco the captain told passengers he was going to an empty gate even though he didnt have permission "he said enough is enough i should have done this a long time ago " recalls passenger cindy welch who was trying to get home to missouri american wont identify the captain flight was one of flights american diverted from dallas fort worth international airport that day some turned into true travel nightmares the likes of which havent been seen since january when passengers on a northwest airlines flight were trapped for seven hours on a parked plane that had landed nearly a day late americans flight from oklahoma city to dallas pushed back at p m on dec then waited eight hours and two minutes before canceling and going back to the terminal according to data compiled by flightstats inc flight from zurich switzerland to dallas was diverted to tulsa okla where it sat for hours pilots couldnt take off because they reached federal limits on duty time american says tulsa doesnt have a customs and immigration facility so no one could get off by the time the plane reached dallas landing at a m according to federal aviation administration data passengers had been on board more hours how does this happen after years of cutting staff carriers are less capable of handling crises from not having enough telephone reservationists to handle calls or extra bodies to empty toilet tanks or spare pilots and flight attendants to help out when delays stack up congestion in the air and at airports exacerbates the messes caused when storms hit delays have increased steadily over the past five years approaching levels not seen since and the rate of mishandled bags is higher than in that year was a recent low and consumer complaints have increased in each of the past four years amr corp s american the worlds biggest airline says it was reluctant to cancel flights on dec because planes were packed with holiday travelers instead when storms were forecast at its dallas hub it opted to delay flights as it happens dallas got whacked with by an unseasonably strong thunderstorm that didnt move out of the area for hours landings slowed to a crawl and lightning forced ground workers indoors several times planes on the ground waited thinking skies would clear but they didnt the carrier says it is re evaluating its flight diversion strategy it is also is studying whether it should adopt a harder time limit on how long planes can sit and wait in the case of flight according to interviews with four passengers plus officials at american the problems were compounded by a lack of staff the result of cost cutting and holiday vacations and some bad decisions americans austin operations were overwhelmed when planes landed unexpectedly american says the airline delivered some snacks and drinks to airplanes but quickly ran out a worker tried to service toilets when he could get time but was held back by lightning american tried to call in more staff with little success due to the holiday weekend "we got caught short handed " says american spokesman john hotard american also made a pivotal decision according to airline officials austin managers decided to focus on handling regular flights to other cities such as chicago and st louis hoping they could stay on schedule they let the diverted dallas planes sit and sit flight was snake bit from the start the plane was an hour late leaving san francisco because of mechanical problems that forced a switch of airplanes the flight left the gate at a m instead of its scheduled departure and the delay proved critical an on time arrival would have beaten the bad weather when flight reached west texas storms were moving in american says the pilot was told to divert to austin where he could refuel and wait for a break in the weather for the short hop to dallas after landing american allowed about local austin and san antonio passengers to get off rather than wait to fly to dallas only to hop on a connection back to austin their luggage however remained on board say passengers and american american expected the storms to hit between p m and p m and then move out of the area instead they started earlier and lingered into the night for hours the crew thought theyd ultimately be able to fly to dallas only to have hopes dashed worse the storm had moved into austin too whether to keep waiting or give up is one of the most difficult decisions for airlines taxing both operations and finances often travelers and airlines prefer to wait as long as possible for the chance to reach their destinations moving a plane to a gate for a bathroom break could cost a flight its place in line among the hundreds trying to leave it could also mean the crew might run into federal time limits that regulate the work day unless new pilots and flight attendants are available continuing the trip would have to wait until the next day "if we take you to the gate and its a holiday period we may not get you out of there for three days " says mr hotard for flight conditions in the foot wide md cabin quickly deteriorated toilets overflowed families ran out of baby diapers one man exclaimed he was down to his last piece of nicorette gum passengers recall "it was pathetic the toilets had gone from gas station to a carlos santana concert " said andy welch husband of cindy welch american says a worker did empty toilet tanks on flight but not until the plane had been on the ground for five hours or more even then the stench typically lingers on an aircraft that isnt moving one airline official says the captain told passengers he was calling everyone he could think of to get permission to use a gate he told them he talked to two american chief pilots as well as the manager of the austin operations the airline confirms the austin manager was in contact with the pilots many people at american were aware of flight a mother whose son was on the plane called a company spokesman one passenger called a dallas television station another called a friend who was a freelance writer who wrote a story that day for the dallas morning news instead of opening a gate for flight americans four gates were used to operate the airlines regular schedule including a few flights to dallas that did depart "the pilot kept telling us they would not give us a gate " says katie dickson who was trying to get to belize with her husband and five year old daughter "at one point he said i am so embarrassed for american airlines " several passengers got increasingly angry and yelled at the crew but the captain mrs dickson recalls kept calm "it was a little scary to have that many people in such a closed space " she says passengers rallied some mothers digging out granola bars for a young man who was famished some people translating for a couple who didnt speak english a few passengers were allowed down the staircase in the planes tail to the tarmac to walk dogs that had been in the cargo hold mrs dickson says she found the ordeal "unbelievable just mind boggling " at p m flight s passengers finally got inside the austin terminal where they couldnt find anyone from american to help them with flights or hotels passengers say the scene was chaotic only about half the luggage made it off the flight american says its baggage system in austin was overwhelmed by the volume the dicksons rented a car and drove to dallas and were able to get a flight to belize the next day for their shortened vacation the welches waited in a line at the ticket counter which was staffed by just two employees they recall they stood in line three hours when they reached the counter mrs welch asked for a hotel voucher the agent declined mrs welch says saying the problem was caused by weather and american wasnt responsible mrs welch began crying she argued that the flight wouldnt have been in austin if not for the original delay in san francisco the ticket agent relented and gave her a voucher for a hotel stay and breakfast "the most maddening thing was no one from american airlines ever approached us and apologized " she says adds mrs dickson "i still dont understand what happened if i had an explanation from american id feel better " americans mr hotard says the airline is truly sorry for the mess he says one reason the airline may not have contacted customers to apologize is that its fort worth headquarters where customer service specialists work was closed for four days over new years see related letters "letters to the editor american airlines excuses really stink" wsj jan
