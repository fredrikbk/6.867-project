pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece a la mode once again hector guimards castel beranger shows art nouveau architectures futuristic side anatomy of a classic historians have never quite decided what to make of art nouveau was it a "progressive" movement did its cast of eccentric illustrators architects and furniture designers "shed the clothing of an old culture " as le corbusier once suggested were its restless whiplash forms a harbinger of modernism or was its flowery language and exquisite handcrafted aesthetic the last gasp of a neurasthenic elite fated to be crushed under the tank treads of the great war and made quaintly irrelevant by the efficiencies of mass production the consumer society and the international style the castel beranger by hector guimard is a building that embodies this tension and ambivalence when it went up between and in auteuil a district of paris known for leafy streets and bourgeois comfort it looked radical nicknamed the "castel derange" mad castle it stands wrapped in an eclectic array of materials that stop and start every few feet from freestone to masonry to red brick as if guimard kept changing his mind about what he wanted to say the fenestration within the courtyard which turns away from the street has a stepped pattern like notes on a scale asymmetric idiosyncrasies run through the interior as well with each of the apartments having its own layout on completion the place became a demonstration piece for the year old architect who promoted it with a monograph and public lectures gaudi studied the plans of the courtyard fountain as he began to design his equally audacious casa battlo in barcelona without the acclaim and controversy attendant on the castel beranger guimard would likely not have been awarded the commission for which he is best known the above ground kiosks and entrances for the new paris metro stations between and when more than of these ornate iron and glass pavilions were constructed did ordinary commuters ever have it so good as in the first decade of the th century guimard was the most visible architect in paris but almost as quickly as his fortunes had risen they were reversed clients soured on his hucksterish personality his most ambitious building the humbert de romans concert hall legendary among musicians for its extraordinary acoustics was willfully destroyed only four years after it was finished in authorities rejected his elaborate plan for the metro at the opera in an attempt to mass produce designs he advertised as "le style guimard" was a conspicuous failure against the smooth continuities of stark modernism outlined by the likes of adolf loos and le corbusier the castel beranger began to age badly looking fussy passe compromised guimard fell from grace so precipitously that between and all but one of the edicules for his metro stations were demolished when he died in new york in having left france in with his jewish american wife he was broke and forgotten today the castel beranger again looks a la mode even futuristic especially from the street the parade of wrought iron creatures climbing the upper stories of the facade were intended to be stylized sea horses but guimards gargoyles no longer appear so fancifully benign perhaps its their open mouthed scaly backed kinship with the reptilian monster in ridley scotts "alien" that gives them a predatory menace cinematic art direction has also altered guimards orchidaceous lamps for the metro their long necks now seem less a tribute to oscar wilde and more like the spaceships in "war of the worlds " this new perspective on his work isnt altogether accidental art nouveau coincided with the birth of science fiction both jules verne and hector guimard aspired to be popular artists and saw fantasy as a sinuous pathway into the subconscious with its medieval name and fortress like structure the castel beranger glances back toward the somber historicism of guimards first master eugene viollet le duc the stone colonettes at the front entrance at rue la fontaine are typical neo romanesque quotes from the late th century at the same time the wrought iron gate between these pillars in sea green rather than black and bursting with lyrical swaying energy announces a new design sensibility that enjoys extravagant and breezy ornamentation guimard had visited brussels in and been astonished by victor hortas tassel house the first building in a ripened art nouveau style during the three years that he revised the castel beranger guimard sought to open up the block with the natural light that distinguishes the tassel house he imagined everything for the interior from wallpaper and carpets to stained glass and door handles the contradictions in the buildings style which historians once held against it now seem more prescient of contemporary practice its split has brought it into line with the current taste for impure and anxious architecture serenely located now across from the conservatoire francis poulenc it straddles a crack in history with so much of guimards oeuvre leveled and viewable only in photographs the french have since the s tried to redress their shabby treatment of him and their own art nouveau heritage plaques adorn many of his buildings in the th arrondissement the best neighborhood to offer a comprehensive view of his ideas down the street from the castel beranger is the square agar site of some later apartment houses while in the other direction at rue la fontaine is his hotel mezzara open to the public site of exhibitions
