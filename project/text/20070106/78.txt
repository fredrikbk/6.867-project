the week ahead our take on coming events apple computer might macworld divert attention from options by nick wingfield when he hops onto the stage to kick off the macworld conference in san francisco tuesday apple computer inc chief executive officer steve jobs will seek to return the spotlight to innovative gadgets and away from a stock option backdating mess at the company that has nabbed headlines for months the macworld show where apple is expected to unveil products it has on deck for comes just as an internal company investigation last month cleared current management including mr jobs of wrongdoing in improper granting of favorable option dates for apple stock options the options matter is now being examined by federal investigators from the u s department of justice and the securities and exchange commission at macworld apples biggest challenge will be to deliver a worthy encore to the ipod nearly million of which have been sold since apple introduced the digital music player five years ago analysts estimate apple had another big quarter with the ipod over the holidays selling between million and million of the devices the growth rate for the product though is slowing as the number of music fans apple hasnt already reached with the ipod dwindles apple next reports quarterly earnings jan topping analysts list of products expected next week from mr jobs is a cellphone that combines some of the styling and entertainment functions of the ipod such a product could give apple entry into a huge new market as well as an opportunity to leverage its leadership in online song and video sales into the mobile arena ignoring the business is perilous for apple analysts believe as more traditional handset makers add music and video functions to their devices apple is also expected to talk further about an interactive television product code named itv which it previously promised to begin selling for &# in the first quarter of this year an apple spokesman declined to say what mr jobs will announce next week anticipation among analysts is so high that if apple doesnt come through with one of these products next week at macworld investors could be sorely disappointed in other words if apple doesnt make big news next week that in itself could be big news but no matter how slick its new offerings they still arent likely to totally overshadow the options backdating matter the companys investigation blames two unnamed former officers people familiar with the matter say the pair are former finance chief fred anderson and former general counsel nancy heinen who could face scrutiny from federal investigators attorneys for the two former apple executives say their clients did nothing wrong mr jobs himself isnt necessarily in the clear yet even though apple cleared its ceo of misconduct it has said mr jobs recommended some "favorable" option grant dates technology battle for the living room by peter grant while apple computer inc holds its exclusive conclave next week the rest of the industry will descend on the consumer electronics show in las vegas which is expected to draw exhibitors and more than attendees the show will be spread out over an area the size of football fields and include an orgy of tv sets computers games cellphones and every other type of gadgetry but the common theme will be this the battle to control the living room for years technology and consumer electronics companies have been promising a future in which music videos and photos could be zapped seamlessly throughout the house among computers tv sets cellphones and the internet while companies like microsoft corp intel corp hewlett packard co and sony corp havent delivered fully on this vision yet they havent been in sleep mode the progress they have been making on integrating devices will be in evidence at the show front and center will be the wide range of computers gaming consoles set top boxes televisions cellphones and other devices that make it easier to move content primarily videos off the internet to television sets while similar devices were displayed at previous shows interest has become much more intense following a year in which google inc acquired youtube for &# billion and walt disney co s abc began making prime time shows available free on abc com for years so called home networking products have been technically able to move videos photos music and other content around the house but they have been so difficult to use that they have appealed only to the technologically savvy what is different about the new crop of devices this year is that some are getting easy enough to use for the mass market for example consumers can now download movies or tv programs to their televisions off the web with just a few clicks of their xbox s tivos or some of the other devices that will be on display at the show all will be keeping an eye on the macworld conference as well because apple plans to unveil its own device designed to move films tv programs and other video files to tv sets apple is hoping that it will be able to do to tv what its ipod did to the music business the multibillion dollar television industry could be turned upside down if apple and these other technology companies are successful if movies and tv programs could be delivered over the internet to tv sets many households might opt against sending monthly payments to cable and satellite operators for television service one of the big questions hanging over las vegas will be whether hollywood studios and other owners of programming will be willing to use these new technologies to pipe their content to tv sets over the internet significantly more media types will be showing up this year one of the keynote addresses will be by robert iger chief executive at disney who has been a leader in making prime time tv shows available on ipods and the web stem cell research test for bush new congress by gerald f seib for all the bluster over iraq taxes and budgets the first direct confrontation between the republican president and the new democratic congress may come on an entirely different subject that has gotten relatively little attention recently stem cell research that reality will become more clear this coming week when the house has pledged to take up a bill expanding federal support for embryonic stem cell research the issue sensitive because many social conservatives and religious leaders believe it is morally wrong to destroy human embryos to extract stem cells has prompted the one and only veto president bush has issued in his term house leaders now propose to pass the same measure the president killed with that veto last year backers of stem cell funding appear to have the votes to pass the measure in the house and later in the senate but they dont have enough votes it takes a two thirds majority of each house to override another presidential veto so the road is clear for a collision over an exquisitely difficult political issue on one hand there is consistent evidence that a majority of americans want the federal government to fund more stem cell research last summer the wall street journal nbc news poll asked respondents whether they favored or opposed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research almost seven in favored funding while opposed the rest didnt offer an opinion on the other hand the splits felt on the issue are very real and the result of strongly held views views cut across party lines on this issue many prominent republicans including some who will run for president in support the research yet the differences in opinion still have a distinct partisan tinge when citizens of missouri voted last fall on a constitutional amendment endorsing stem cell research exit polls showed the measure was endorsed by of democrats and opposed by an identical of republicans the missouri amendment squeaked by with approval but an effort already is under way to repeal it all this makes the issue a difficult one to finesse the measure to be voted on in the house is disarmingly simple in its construct it merely instructs the government to fund research using embryonic stem cells provided the cells come from surplus embryos donated by in vitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise be discarded behind those simple words lies a powerful moral and political debate that is far from resolved whether president bush can resist the push toward expanding research may depend on how well he can argue that alternatives such as research using adult stem cells can work social conservatives a cornerstone of his embattled political constituency will be watching closely auto makers glitzy show worry galore by joseph b white leaders of the worlds auto makers converge on detroit this weekend for the big north american international auto show a three ring circus designed to start the year with a bang of hype for shiny new cars and slick new corporate strategies but as they divert the public with glitzy displays gee whiz cars of the future and celebrity drive bys many auto industry executives have good reason to worry that wont be much fun the u s market the worlds richest ended on a down note and forecasts are that this year could be one of the weakest in more than a decade some analysts are forecasting u s car and light truck sales of million vehicles down from about million in u s sales at that level arent enough to support profitably all the factories dedicated to producing vehicles for the market demand in western europe and japan looks to be flat as well industry leaders love to talk about the rapid growth in emerging markets such as india china or eastern europe but those markets are still relatively small and in the case of china increasingly competitive it would help if car makers could count on big drops in prices for the commodities used to produce their wares but that seems doubtful oil prices are volatile and still substantially above levels of the late s boom years the steel industry which has taken a lot of the harsh restructuring medicine that the big u s auto makers are trying to avoid now has the power to raise prices for many products essential to car making looked at one way this is all bad news for detroits unionized auto giants general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group which are struggling to turn around deep losses in their u s market operations toyota motor corp the japanese juggernaut appears determined to overtake gm this year as the worlds largest auto maker and could announce soon that it plans to build its eighth north american assembly plant in the southern u s gm and ford meanwhile are closing down dozens of factories and ushering off their payrolls a combined total of more than u s factory workers still there is a bright side experts in corporate turnarounds say a sense of crisis is essential to persuade people in a large organization to accept the sacrifices required to save the company a u s market slump could create just that feeling this summer gm ford and chrysler start negotiating new multiyear contracts with the united auto workers leaders at all three companies want the uaw to agree to substantial concessions such as the effective end of contract clauses that force the manufacturers to pay uaw workers even when they have no work to do and further curbs on expensive health plans more red ink could come in handy when management is trying to make the case that uaw leaders should bargain away more of their members
