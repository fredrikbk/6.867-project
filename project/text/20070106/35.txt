new etfs offer riskier bets retirement strategies add variety and danger thanks to a rash of new exchange traded funds retirement account investors are getting easier access to a fistful of riskier strategies from short selling stocks to betting on currency and commodity movements friday deutsche bank ag and powershares capital management a unit of amvescap plc launched seven new commodity based exchange traded funds that track price movements in everything from gold and silver to base metals some additional etfs are currently in registration some of which will allow investors to bet that individual dow jones industrial sectors will fall in price or that the japanese yen will rise the new funds which will essentially double the number of etfs that trade on wall street are providing savers with strategies that can help to better diversify retirement accounts or hedge against a bear market yet some financial pros caution that the potential for wreaking havoc on your portfolio could be magnified the dangers are especially great when the etfs are shorting stocks that is betting their prices will fall and even more so when theyre using leverage or borrowed money to do so "shorting is a strategy you probably want to stay away from " says matthew murphy a fee only financial adviser in buckeye ariz who uses etfs extensively in his clients accounts "most of the time investors dont realize the ramifications " thats because when you buy a stock its value can never fall below zero limiting your loss to the original investment however the price of stocks sold short can rise ever higher and a short sellers potential losses can be greater than the amount invested leverage can further magnify any losses some of those risks diminish with etfs to be sure since your losses are limited to the amount invested in the fund though a relatively small number of traditional mutual funds do exist that pursue some of these alternative strategies theyre not always available through retirement accounts or if they are theyre often costlier to own or not as pure a play on a particular asset shorting a stock directly for example or using leverage are prohibited inside retirement accounts yet you can use funds to accomplish the same goals and individual retirement accounts or iras and k plans that offer brokerage account access generally allow savers to trade whatever is listed on stock exchanges including etfs first introduced in the early s etfs resemble index tracking mutual funds but trade throughout the day like stocks they were originally built

quarters the number of etfs that investors can now trade many of the new etfs that have emerged in recent months as well as several currently in registration are narrowing their scope last month for

description of the fund proshare advisors llc based in bethesda md over the summer launched etfs that short the market some of which use a "double down strategy " so that each one point fall in the nasdaq the dow or the s&amp p equates to a two point gain for the ultrashort proshares etfs that follow those indexes proshare advisors plans soon to unveil scores of new etfs including ones that will short individual dow sectors through rydex investments investors now can trade seven major currencies with an eighth the yen on the way meanwhile barclays plcs ishares unit launched an etf last summer shadowing the goldman sachs commodity index others see benefit in certain strategic etfs for sophisticated investors or those who leave the planning to advisers oliver tutt managing director at randall financial group in providence r i says the new commodities etfs in particular "are on the top of our agenda i wouldnt be surprised if we added one this year to our client accounts " the reason for investors who follow asset allocation models etfs that track commodities currencies and other alternative asset classes and investment styles "can be a good way to execute more technical strategies " particularly those that are challenging to implement inside retirement accounts and ira and k investors could have benefited from the ability to short the nasdaq stock market in says david fry publisher of etf digest an independent online investment newsletter "you would have had a nice stash of money in your retirement plan to come back into the market with" when the bear market ended he says the use of etfs that go beyond traditional stock and bond indexes can be a good way to better structure investments inside retirement accounts says mr fry so long as investors practice moderation with these new etfs he says "you have to stay balanced and disciplined "
