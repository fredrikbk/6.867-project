marketwatch weekend investor the path to making executive pay a nonissue in three simple steps its time once and for all to put the executive pay issue out to pasture and i think i know how its not that there arent plenty of good ideas for instance gadfly nell minow of corporate library a research outfit has argued that shareholders should have a bigger voice in such matters as ceo pay proxy votes and even states of incorporation then theres my way the greenberg method which is designed to simplify the process in three easy steps step one do away with employment contracts or if you must have one do away with excessive downside protection and before those of you who have contracts start rolling your eyes shaking your heads and muttering something about another stupid idea from yet another clueless reporter have a look at general electrics proxy it says that for the most part it doesnt enter into employment agreements with its top officers including ceo jeff immelt who "serve at the will of the board " thats easy for those of us who serve at the will of our bosses to understand i thought that the no contract idea was another brilliant example of good things coming to life at ge on the corporate governance front and still do full disclosure i am a contributor to cnbc which is owned by ge imagine my surprise when ms minow who for years has been railing against egregious executive pay disagreed she says she used to think contracts should be eliminated but has since modified her stance because she believes without a contract there is no limit on what can be paid "there is no ceiling if there is no contract " she says by the same token she believes if there is a contract it should spell out what the word "cause" means as a reason for being fired when an executive isnt fired for cause they can reap hefty severance payments in most contracts she says "cause is defined into nothingness " with the category "termination for cause" having become "so microscopic that it barely exists anymore " the best solution to the hazy "cause" issue ms minow would like "poor performance" added as cause furthermore she says there simply shouldnt be any downside protection in the form of big severance packages beyond what is normal and customary for most executives elsewhere something like two or three years in salary step no get rid of the big severance packages this should be a no brainer many of these executives can probably afford not to work this step also includes everything plus the kitchen sink signing bonuses while i have no problem with token signing bonuses sometimes theyre important for something as simple as getting a spouse to make a big move theres an inherent problem with multimillion dollar deals that supposedly give ceos what they wouldve earned if they stayed at their prior employer "if it had been earned it would be going with them " says paul hodgson senior research associate at corporate library and author of "board perspectives building value through compensation " theres no guarantee after all the person wouldve ever earned it no dont tie compensation to the stock price especially as a qualifier to earn a bonus while the counter argument might very well be that doing so would better align executive interests with shareholder as was the case at home depot which was generous with options its not the same as an executive buying the stock in the open market or getting them as a founder if nothing else dont forget that no matter how hard they may try executives cant control what happens to their companys stock their actions and strategies if all goes well will eventually influence its direction lets face it even with his companys floundering stock home depots bob nardelli might still have a job if he hadnt been paid so much the stock which arguably was overpriced when he took the job merely became the symbol of all that was wrong and before we leave this subject memo to the sec how about making it easier for investors to find employment contracts by creating a separate form companies must file for initial and amended contracts right now theyre exhibits tucked at the tail end of any number of documents no wonder nobody save the likes of ms minow complains about them until its too late herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal
