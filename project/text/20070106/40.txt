outdated and inefficient in congress created the securities and exchange commission and employed an ingenious approach a partnership between government and the private sector the sec was given pervasive authority to proscribe and pursue fraudulent deceptive or manipulative conduct as an extra measure of investor protection the securities industry was charged with defining and disciplining those who engaged in unethical and unacceptable business practices even if those practices didnt rise to the level of illegality although this system worked well eventually the evolution of markets advance of technology and concept of for profit securities markets made manifest that this system was outmoded and highlighted the critical need to restructure and revitalize our system of securities industry self regulation as theodore roosevelt noted people are destined to be regulated and their choices are either to regulate themselves or sit back and wait for the government to do it for and to them we think the nasd and the new york stock exchange deserve strong support for their recently announced sensible and much needed plan to improve securities industry self regulation its the first significant change in the self regulatory regime in this country in more than years reform is due and the plan is timely well thought out and comprehensive despite governments increasing role there remains an important need for securities industry self regulation given some of the lapses weve seen over the last several years the need for high ethical standards and business practices is more important than ever and yet under the current outmoded system there are conflicting standards inefficiencies and waste almost firms are regulated by both organizations as well as the sec under the current system theyre subject to dual but not always consistent rulebooks examinations investigations sweeps and enforcement actions much of that burden is passed on to thousands of smaller securities firms through their clearing firms the system is redundant and inefficient and in that context doesnt benefit either investors or the industry the proposed merger of the nasd and nyse regulatory regimes put forward last month is in the best traditions of the government private sector partnership congress envisioned when it enacted the federal securities laws both of us during our tenures at the sec were concerned about eliminating the overlap duplication and excessive costs of self regulation while strengthening the industrys commitment to leading the way in developing best in class standards the proposal put forth by the nyse and nasd is an important step forward in achieving these objectives by establishing a single independent self regulatory organization sro to oversee securities firms the plan would eliminate complexity and confusion that doesnt increase investor protection and that after all is the ultimate goal of regulation and the plan should reduce the cost of effective regulation across the board helping firms of all sizes more than merely eliminating redundancy and attendant costs the new sro structure will make meaningful contributions to enhanced regulation the significant knowledge experience and expertise of broker dealer regulation that now resides in two separate organizations will be consolidated and housed in one rule writing examination and enforcement will be enhanced and information sharing which is an important factor in effective regulation will be improved the plan also addresses the important issue of governance a majority of the new organizations board of governors will be from outside the industry a check and balance critical to ensuring that investors interests will be protected at the same time the governance structure of the new sro also promises fair and balanced industry participation thus assuring that the boards decisions will be informed by the views and insights of all segments of the industry under the plan firms of all sizes will have the opportunity to voice their opinions and make their concerns known the dual regulation that exists today isnt well suited to a world in which there is keen and growing competition among strong capital market centers around the globe the self regulatory status quo does not work the secs agenda is to ensure that self regulation becomes even more effective and efficient in order to enhance investor protection while enhancing the competitiveness of our capital markets the nasd nyse plan is a good one on its own merits and it offers the industry an important and perhaps its only opportunity to shape its own future the sec cant allow the current self regulatory system to continue as is with the sros and the industry taking the lead the need for a governmental solution is eliminated and thats always a preferable course we look forward to the completion of this important initiative and commend not only the self regulators who have initiated it but also the members of the industry who we are certain will hasten to make this proposal a reality messrs donaldson and pitt are former chairmen of the sec
