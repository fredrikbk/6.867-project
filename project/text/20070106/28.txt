indias elite covet security guards flashing lights nation tries to rein in a new status symbol vip versus very vip mumbai on a street not far from the arabian sea a high wall surrounds the residence of an indian film legend reddish gold blossoms from a mayflower tree poke through the barbed wire two guards dressed in dark uniforms stand sentry at the gate but alls not well with amitabh bachchans security detail in september the year old bollywood megastar suffered a blow to his status as one of indias officially designated very important persons or vips last september his government security category was reduced a notch to "x" from "y " the demotion triggered the departure of nine government paid police guards leaving only two plainclothes officers to shadow the man popularly known as "big b " although big b still retains more than two dozen private security guards the governments move sparked demonstrations by his fans protesting the public slight "out of the craze of love from fans he needs protection " explains amar singh a politician and friend whose new delhi office features a huge oil painting of the grey goateed film star india offers many ways to define ones place in society there are colonial era clubs expensive cars and choice seats at cricket matches but unlike its traditional caste system which defines people at birth india also extends an official security rating to some upper crust civilians who have distinguished themselves with money or fame the rating grants vips a phalanx of police escorts at taxpayer expense but as indias economy grows so do the number of vips there are now police and paramilitary troops in india dedicated solely to protecting them not just political bigwigs and bollywood personalities but newly minted billionaires star athletes retired judges and an assortment of other celebrities the resulting burden is partly why the home ministry in june commissioned a confidential study on how to revamp and possibly shrink state security forces in mumbai the state government is now charging to protect those who dont meet a certain threat level and has started disclosing the names of those who dont pay up the central government which also provides security is considering a similar arrangement meanwhile anti vip activists have scored recent victories in court shedding fresh light on a secretive security system for the nations privileged many of indias rich and powerful can afford their own private security but the status conscious know that authentic police escorts can distinguish them from the run of the mill famous cocktail chatter about a persons rating x y z and z+ adds a whiff of mystique to the whole process heightened by the fact that the government remains reticent to disclose who receives what grade of security and why the home ministry which supervises security says it assesses danger to individuals "from militants or terrorists groups and organized criminal mafia " the number of guards per level can vary from state to state those with x level security like mr bachchan typically get two armed constables ys receive and zs get the highest rating z+ comes with guards bristling with weapons and a fleet of escort vehicles indresh batra vice chairman of jindal united steel corp a unit of one of indias biggest steel producers doesnt have an official security ranking "by any truthful threat perception of these people wouldnt have security " says mr batra who employs private guards outside his new delhi house of course most countries take extraordinary steps to protect their leaders during indias six decades of independence assassinations have been a recurring tragedy today indias top leaders are in a category of their own these so called vvips are guarded by an unspecified number of elite commandos known as the "special protection group " one step down sorting out who is and isnt a legitimate vip can be a serious matter in december a band of islamic militants succeeded in penetrating the parliamentary complex in new delhi using a siren and a fake home ministry sticker the attack left dead including nine police officers after that the government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to shore up parliamentary security yet scofflaws still slip by in new delhi rules distinguish vips who can have a car with a red flashing light from those who are allowed red lights but arent allowed to flash them but those rules are often ignored many members of parliament have installed illegal "flashers" on their vehicles as have more lesser officials a zookeeper in nearby uttar pradesh state recently had his unauthorized car siren confiscated last september year old lawyer m p vashi in a court case forced maharashtra state where mumbai is to make public a detailed report on the its security system in an affidavit the state government responded that people were offered police protection at cost in october the state government named people who were delinquent on police bills for protection totaling about &# the maharashtra government also began tidying up other vip security matters convening a high level panel to review the security grades of local vips among other things that panel made the decision to trim the detail for mr bachchan the movie star mr bachchan didnt respond to questions about his security mumbai police commissioner a n roy who was on the panel declines to discuss big bs case or any others but notes that several government officials were also downgraded when some status conscious ministers later stormed his office to
