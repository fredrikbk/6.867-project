pursuits books ancient greece with a cheeky guide some talk of alexander by frederic raphael thames &amp hudson pages &# carved above the entrance to the temple that housed the delphic oracle was the motto meden agan "nothing in excess" advice that frederic raphael gleefully ignores in this sprawling relentlessly clever love letter to ancient greece mr raphael a british novelist and screenwriter casts himself as a "flaneur without formal scheme or specialty " an "enthusiastic amateur" without "academic affectations " but he did receive a decade of classical education before abandoning the subject while an undergraduate at cambridge for fear he says of ending up an also ran in a field of brilliant contemporaries in the intervening half century mr raphael has read widely in the classics and "some talk of alexander" draws on a broad range of scholarship the book makes a roughly chronological tour of greek civilization but it unspools like a marathon free associative monologue whipping back and forth in time as mr raphael touches not only on the delphic oracle "the call center for information about apollos take on things" but also on robert de niro odysseus byron freud aeschylus mozart jayne mansfield aristophanes and churchill thus mr raphael detects in one of aesops fables a note of "jeevesian contempt" and refers to the delian league a fifth century b c alliance led by athens as the "eastern mediterranean treaty organization " typical of his punning conversational style is mr raphaels quip that the poet pindars "tailored odes had something in common with the green blazer" awarded to the winner of the masters golf tournament it is a provocative comparison although a debatable one pindar was the pre eminent composer of "epinician" odes celebratory songs commissioned by athletes who were victorious at any of the various panhellenic games of which the original olympian games were one set epinician "relating to victory" odes incorporated solemn prayer and stories to glorify the athletes exploits in the broader context of greek history and morality in short they elevated the athletes achievements beyond the realm of mere sport the natty green masters jacket by contrast does just the opposite donning it identifies the wearer merely so to speak as the member of an exclusive athletic fraternity of golfers the long winter at valley forge doesnt really come into it as mr raphael himself says in a different context "everything is something like everything else if you defy euclid and stretch a point " this is only a minor quibble of course but it points to the larger question of whom exactly mr raphael had in mind when writing this book readers who are familiar with pindars work will appreciate the witty pivot from ode to blazer but those who arent will be at a loss mr raphael admittedly never claims to be writing a primer on greek culture in his self deprecating introduction he summarizes "some talk of alexander" as a "rambling catalogue only slightly raisonne of my version of andre malrauxs musee imaginaire " after a while it begins to feel like a parlor game for a particularly learned salon where mr raphaels talents are best displayed is in his treatment of myth he can be a marvelous storyteller quick with a pithy epithet hercules is the "super odd job man" of the greek world and his restless fragmented style is better suited to reproducing the "layered density" of myth than to chronicling straight history which needs a stiffer narrative spine from his scrutiny of individual myths he produces some acute observations on myths in general a myth endures he notes in proportion to its adaptability because "the more it could be stretched into variant or entertaining versions the more likely its use in either drama or art " fittingly mr raphael does well by daedalus the archetypal craftsman whose name was a byword for clever invention the adjective daidalos means "cunningly wrought" in ancient greek arguing that daedaluss "genius lay in mutability " mr raphael deftly sketches the inventors varied career including his creation of the waxen wings that melted when icarus "contrary to pre flight safety instructions " flew too near the sun just west of where icarus fell lie the cyclades islands where mr raphael lived for a time in the s punctuating his musings on the ancient greeks are vividly drawn scenes from his life among their successors the "cowed orderliness" enforced by the oppressive greek military regime in the late s reminds him of the "climate of terror" surrounding clytemnestra in aeschyluss "agamemnon " he captures the islands stark beauty with a mix of the lyrical and the playfully allusive evoking the "bare and bony" hills of epirus or in a nod to homers "wine dark sea " the "guinness dark water" of the aegean by night for all his gushing about the culture of the ancients mr raphael is glad we dont have more of it in an oddly ambivalent coda he worries that we might spend our entire lives "on our knees in homage to the greek genius" had all of its works survived the gaps in our cultural inheritance he says provide breathing room for our own creations despite its abundant wit this overpacked book may leave readers wishing that mr raphael himself had retained less mr farrington is on the editorial staff of the new yorker
