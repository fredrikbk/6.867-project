motorola profit warning generates unease over ceo zanders strategy a profit warning from motorola inc set off a sharp sell off of its shares and underscored problems with the strategy that has made its highly touted razr the fastest selling phone in history the disappointing forecast likely will put intense pressure on chief executive ed zander to get customers to pay a premium for his companys line of fashionable phones more broadly it demonstrates the difficulty of making money for all manufacturers of mobile handsets which are fast evolving into commoditized products the warning late thursday came after motorola sold more than million of its sleek razr cellphones world wide over a two year period with a palette ranging from pink to gold the razr changed the handset industry sending competitors scrambling to fit features like video and music into ultra thin phones but motorola appears to have failed to turn the blockbuster into high profit margins one key reason some investors and analysts say the schaumburg ill telecommunications equipment maker used the popularity of its razr to take market share allowing the handsets price to drop quickly in a quest to become the worlds leading handset maker the strategy knocked the wind out of small rivals which struggled to close motorolas design and engineering lead but many have caught up producing cheap yet elegant phones some even slimmer than motorolas the profit warning attributable to the companys mobile device unit came as the division beat unit sales estimates shipping million units more than in the year earlier quarter the news which sent shares down nearly to &# on the new york stock exchange is a blow to mr zander who believed successor phones would more than make up for the declining price of the razr in the developed world and that motorola could sell enough low end discounted phones to generate large profits in developing nations meanwhile american depositary receipts for finlands nokia corp the worlds largest handset maker and motorolas chief competitor plunged more than friday to &# reflecting sector wide concerns mr zander scheduled to give a keynote address at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on monday said in a statement that he was "disappointed" by the results but said the company wouldnt change its long term targets the company declined to comment further motorolas struggles go beyond the razr and show just how hard it is to sustain profits in the capricious commoditized handset industry consumers in developed markets such as the u s and europe are increasingly demanding low cost slim phones packed with an array of features such as music downloads and video when manufacturers land a hit like the razr competitors are quick to copy ideas that have worked to gain market share motorola and many other handset makers cut prices in the u s that means selling devices at a discount to service providers who control distribution in high growth emerging markets where consumers want cheaper phones with fewer features its tougher to make a profit the razr was designed before mr zander arrived three years ago but the handset was launched under his wing in the fourth quarter of at a retail price of &# it quickly became a style icon appearing on hollywood runways in chic bars and in the pockets of style conscious executives edward e whitacre jr the chairman and chief executive of at&amp t inc had a razr with his name engraved in the casing as its average price dropped and it became available online free with a two year service plan the razr became accessible to the mass market and motorolas main tool to gain market share cingular wireless the nations largest cellular operator was the first to offer the phone in november promoting it through a barrage of marketing and tv ads many analysts say the phone helped cingular jump start subscriber additions when it sorely needed them verizon wireless began offering the razr the following year hoping to capitalize on its popularity all in all motorola increased its share of the global handset market to in the third quarter of from in the fourth quarter of according to research firm gartner inc when investors questioned what could follow the razr mr zander was unequivocal "more razrs " motorola launched a music phone called the rokr a rounded phone called the pebl and the slvr a candy bar shaped phone to meet demand outside the u s for a nonflip phone it entered the market for handheld email gadgets with the ultrathin wireless email device "q " but with these new launches came signs that motorola hadnt fixed its historical troubles with production delays the pebl pronounced "pebble" and the slvr pronounced "sliver" were launched too late in to meet the bulk of christmas demand rokr pronounced "rocker" sales were weak and the company soon launched a new version and the price of the "q" was quickly lowered amid a slew of competing offerings verizon wireless first offered the q at &# but slashed the price in half a few months ago with motorola eating most of the cost a person familiar with the matter said although the razr sold tens of millions more phones that the company had anticipated the operating margins of its handset division grew slowly and lagged behind those of nokia motorolas launch of yet another phone the krzr pronounced "crazer" forced down the razrs price drastically over the quarter that just ended as customers viewed it as they would last years car model and demanded even steeper discounts albert lin an analyst with the independent american technology research estimates the razrs price to operators fell to &# from &# over the quarter and that they came to expect motorola would quickly lower the price of the krzr shareholders dont think it is worth sacrificing high margins to capture more volume "i see it as a strategic mistake of the company in launching a similar handset that they believed would be as successful as the razr " said robert sellar head of north american equities for scotlands aberdeen asset management inc which held million motorola shares at the end of september while motorola pioneered the thin category with its razr other players notably south koreas samsung electronics co were quick to jump on the bandwagon nokia has lagged behind in tapping into the thin trend and now is focusing on catching up overhauling its phone making process to introduce slimmer models across its portfolio of handsets in november the company unveiled a slim midrange model the and announced plans to launch a thin low end phone aimed primarily at emerging markets and more thin models are on their way in one development that could cause wider ripples in mobile entertainment people familiar with the matter say apple computer inc is developing a cellphone with the music functions of its hugely popular ipod the new product could be unveiled as early as tuesday by apple ceo steve jobs at the macworld conference in san francisco some industry insiders say lower sales of some high end phones in the u s may have contributed to motorolas compressed overall margins motorola has been the sole vendor of "walkie talkie" handsets for the ailing nextel division of sprint nextel corp which has had trouble retaining and adding subscribers in recent months as motorola placed its bets on a limited range of razr inspired handsets nokia continued to deliver a very broad portfolio of handsets hitting the widest range of styles and price points motorola also lost its edge in some mature markets such as hong kong and singapore because of limited numbers of next generation models according to analysts at gartner and it lost ground in western europe where its market share fell to in the third quarter of last year from the previous quarter according to gartner motorola decided to reinvest profits from the razr in emerging markets such as india where mobile phone usage is surging and expected to continue growing for years motorola raised its market share in india to last year double that of by aggressively promoting low priced phones but nokia still commands the largest market share there li
