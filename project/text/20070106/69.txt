pursuits travel china gambling with a rich culture time is running out for old macau how to explore beyond the casinos macau china inside the st francis xavier chapel hangs a remarkable painting of the madonna styled as a chinese goddess carrying baby jesus with his hair in a topknot all over macau once the oldest european enclave in china influences from portugal china and southeast asia meld into a hybrid culture that you wont find anywhere else in the world but you might not find it here for long next to the st francis xavier in coloane village the once bustling market street rua dos negociantes is now lined with shut shops at the nearby nga tim cafe diners still sip portuguese vinho verde and chomp into crusty bread stuffed with chinese pork chops but there are plenty of empty tables at lunchtime macau is riding a wave of attention for its ambitions to become a modern gambling center to rival las vegas but that push is increasingly eroding old macaus unique culture just a few miles away from where moguls like sheldon aldelson raise towering casinos rents are skyrocketing land is being reclaimed and locals are being lured away from traditional businesses by the promise of better pay in asias boomtowns development is creating opportunities and lifting millions out of poverty but in macau the pace of change is extreme macau has been remade in just a handful of years threatening the slow pace and small town atmosphere the macanese cuisine one of the worlds earliest fusion foods is also endangered partly because the new casinos are designed to keep tourists inside their walls as a reporter for the wall street journal ive been based in hong kong since covering the region for the past few years ive regularly taken day trips to macau to escape the skyscrapers of modern asia apart from the food there are great stores to buy antiques which are up to a third off hong kong prices macau is not a big city so youre never too far from your hotel or a bus unlike hong kong it can present a challenge to find a cab and the winding lanes make getting lost easy but friendly locals many of whom speak at least a little bit of english can help you find your way for my own adventure i skip the casinos and go on a treasure hunt for slices of macaus old hybrid european and chinese life the distinct small town feeling about much of macau beyond the main gambling strips means its worth taking time to chat with a shop or restaurant owner which can often lead to a great suggestion on where to visit next despite all the development theres some good news macau has done a great job of protecting the architecture of many of its ancient buildings the portuguese ruled from the th century until when macau was handed to china macau has managed to hold on to one third of its original historic area on the main macau peninsula so far forcing casino developers to build mostly on reclaimed land on the edges of town the government has been actively encouraging casino development and heritage preservation officials see the casinos as a good thing for the city their budgets have doubled since because of casino tax revenue the government has tried to preserve the original function of some old buildings like community centers and even a pawn shop still protecting macaus old architecture hasnt always helped preserve its old cultural life one of the best ways to see the old town should be walking along sites granted unesco "world heritage" status in but when i took that tour last month i came across so many shuttered local shops that i asked a convenience store clerk whether i had come on a public holiday i hadnt most businesses had all just moved on she said because rents were cheaper further away from the unesco sites macaus hybrid local culture still lives but its getting harder to find instead of wandering the gentrified senado square which now has a starbucks and shops in front of the ruins of st paul i grab a map and poke around a few blocks to the west in this neighborhood wood carvers and merchants still work and live in a style of shop house that was common in china during the th century characterized by a back courtyard narrow rooms and high ceilings with living quarters above among these youll find dusty antiques shops that look as if they havent sold anything in years but thats a good thing if youre on the lookout for chinese wood carvings or stained glass macanese food went through a bit of a renaissance about years ago but these days many of these restaurants are sterile imitations of a home style cuisine like american soul food macanese food was the historical product of necessity portuguese cooking techniques combined with chinese and southeast asian ingredients like shrimp paste and cheap foods like salted cod that could be carried on ships while some restaurants like the upscale litoral serve modernized versions of these dishes year old chef ida jesus has for more than years kept watch over original macanese dishes at her local canteen called riquexo dishes here defy familiar tastes my favorite called minchi combines minced pork with fried potatoes soy sauce onions and egg ms jesus doesnt mind giving visitors a culinary history lesson but come soon because it might not last without her her daughter is in her s and her son moved to shanghai to open a restaurant "my daughter wants to close the shop " ms jesus says "as long as im around i wont let her " shes not the only one who wont go down without a fight "theres a slow movement in the works and im a part of it " says eileen stow who runs lord stows bakery in coloane village "this is a neighborhood with tradition that is very family oriented " coloanes star attraction is the bakery particularly its egg tarts which feature a flaky crust and caramelized top these are a modified version of european tarts also familiar to chinese as the dim sum dan tat now ms stowe is wrestling with the idea of providing egg tarts for one of the new casinos shes not keen on shifting her tart production into over drive but also figures it would be a shame for a whole new generation of visitors to macau to end up locked inside a casino
