pursuits books a long estranged trip once in the s vanguard an unsentimental survivor looks back prime green by robert stone ecco pages &# if tom wolfes "the electric kool aid acid test" was a birth announcement for the s counterculture "prime green" is its obituary unlike the drug shunning mr wolfe novelist robert stone was literally and figuratively on the bus he was a close friend of ken kesey the musclebound maypole around whom the mischievous goblins of the s danced mr stones elegant regret served in small but powerful doses makes his first memoir an enticing journey whose only flaw is its brevity if hemingway had lived through the s he might have written this book perhaps calling it "a moveable famine " because mr stone the national book award winning author of "dog soldiers" and "outerbridge reach " now finds little sustenance in the excesses of which he proudly partook both mr wolfe who is "extremely accurate with facts " according to "prime green" and mr stone who pops up in mr wolfes book write about a typically loopy scene in a mexican bar in a dim cop who called himself "agent numero uno" was chatting up kesey the charismatic author of "one flew over the cuckoos nest" and a fugitive from pot charges in california who had moved his psychedelic traveling show south of the border while lawyers pleaded his case back home mr wolfe apparently relied on mr stone as his source for the episode in his book which mr wolfe splashes with comedy the cop who tells a story about "thees beeg maricon " is described as "a cross between zorro and nero " in mr stones hands though the scene is a portent he but not mr wolfe points out that the seemingly bungling federale was also asking insinuating questions perhaps in an effort to ensnare kesey again at a time when possession of small amounts of marijuana was not a minor crime mr stone writes with well earned fear and an ache for receding beauty though comedy does not elude him "we should have seen the deadly future he represented " mr stone writes of agent numero uno "my own thoughts began to congeal around the prospect of waking up to breakfast in a mexican jail " the moody kesey "who didnt seem to be writing much " had taken to brooding on the beach "it was impossible to tell if we were witnessing a stage of literary development a personal gethsemane or an apotheosis " mr stone does not need to add that keseys output of important writing had already ended before he turned keseys lieutenant neal cassady the inspiration for the dean moriarty character in jack kerouacs "on the road " was "extending his career as a literary character in other peoples work " writes mr stone "this persistent calling forth and reinventing his existence was an exhausting process even for such an extraordinary mortal as neal maybe it has earned him the immortality he yearned for it certainly seems to have shortened his life " cassady would be dead in less than two years keseys increasingly woozy crew "a cross between a stanford fraternity party and an underfunded libertarian writers conference" would rise to greet dawn over mexicos manzanillo bay "the slopes and valleys of the rain forest would explode in green light erupting inside a silence that seemed barely to contain it all of us stoned or otherwise caught in the vortex of dawn would freeze in our tracks and stand to squinting in the pain of the light sweating grinning we called that light prime green it was primal primary primo " the image seems to sum up for him an earnest memory of the mission behind the shenanigans a quest for vivid uncommercialized experience in blooming nature amid gentle companions p j orourke a dedicated hippie at the time and a fan of mr wolfes recently told me that his first reaction to "electric kool aid" was "im not sure he gets it " mr stone got it prayed to it paid for it in a horrific yet funny scene mr stone goes to a hospital with what he thinks is an "errant eyelash" inscribing his field of vision only to learn that he has a possibly drug induced malady that will require the drilling of two holes into his skull under local anesthesia "the procedure " mr stone writes with admirable understatement "promised a long day some risks and possible surprises " then came the surgery "as promised the noise and the vibration suggested dentistry on a monster with your head as the tooth " from early in the book mr stone spots the leaky buckets of the age of aquarius on a visit to apartheid choked south africa he attempts a gesture against racism by giving an unwanted rickshaw ride to a zulu man in the fellows own vehicle "by far it was the zulu bearer himself who was least amused by this reversal he clung to the side of the rickshaw and shouted things like bollocks " he seems most disheartened by squabbles within the left as he flies back from a tour as an antiwar correspondent in vietnam a snippy woman beside him says "i hope you had nothing to do with the war " "very little " replies mr stone who "cut her dead for the rest of the trip " on another flight over france he tells the pilot that he was moving his family back to the states after several years in england "her reaction was so intense that for a moment i thought something had gone wrong with the aircrafts engine there was nothing wrong only that she felt strongly that we should not take our children to america where they would become americans " unlike many of his friends mr stone lived to see his children and his own literary promise grow into maturity he doesnt renounce the s as an ideal and he is proud of some of the changes that stuck "my generation left the country better in some ways not least by destroying the letter of the laws of racism and sexual discrimination " but he now speaks with the wisdom of an honorably wounded veteran of a long cruel culture war "we wanted it all sometimes we confused self destructiveness with virtue and talent obliteration with ecstasy heedlessness with courage we wanted to die well every single day to be a cool guy and a good looking corpse how absurd because nothing is free " mr smith is the author of the novel "a christmas caroline "
