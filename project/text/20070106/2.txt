ask encore focus on retirement how to undo an overly taxing roth conversion can you help me sort out the taxes on a roth ira conversion i converted about &# of my traditional ira to an existing roth ira my intention was to pay the taxes involved with other funds but my adviser had taxes taken out of the regular ira so the conversion cost us more than &# that should have gone into the roth account this conversion took place on dec i just learned about the tax issue this morning on jan and asked the adviser to pull the taxes back into the roth account and let me pay the taxes as i had intended i am being told that the financial institution will not do this because the year has ended i am years old i know that one can undo a roth conversion but can one also get this tax issue undone bob lotts kingsport tenn youre in luck you automatically get days to finish converting assets from a traditional individual retirement account to a roth ira that gives you two ways to fix your problem and youre smart to pay the taxes on a roth conversion with money outside your ira the advantage of a roth ira of course is that you never have to take a required distribution and withdrawals after you turn and have held the account for five years are free of taxes so when converting assets to a roth in order to get the maximum benefits from that roth down the road its advisable to convert the entire withdrawal from your traditional ira rather than using part of the money to pay taxes the government gives you days to move the money from the original ira to the roth in between "you can do anything you want with it " says ed slott a rockville centre n y accountant who specializes in iras and is author of "your complete retirement planning road map " the end of the calendar year doesnt matter in terms of your conversion but it does matter to ira custodians he adds "once they seal the year for withholding taxes it would be extremely difficult to get them to undo it " but you can fix this problem on your own simply by taking the &# plus you had intended to use to pay the taxes and depositing it into the roth account to complete the rollover and the conversion would still be treated as having been completed in which means you reach the five year deadline for tax free withdrawals on jan rather than jan you could also undo all or part of the conversion "recharacterizing" the roth as a traditional ira any time up until oct you might choose to recharacterize &# of the conversion which means you could still pay the taxes out of pocket and simply have a roth worth &# instead of &# or you could undo the whole thing thats good to know in case your converted roth plummets in value after you have paid taxes on an amount its no longer worth in that event you could recharacterize the ira file an amended tax return to get your taxes back and convert to a roth again later if you wish paying less in taxes "its like getting to bet on a horse after the race is over " mr slott says
