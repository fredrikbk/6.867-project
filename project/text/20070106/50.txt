pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies a symbiosis of screens hdtv sets are amazing but they need a steady supply of great new films in the past few weeks hordes of american consumers including yours truly have consummated a national love affair with big hi def flat panel tvs why we did so is obvious these elegantly svelte super gizmos display breathtaking pictures exactly as advertised they represent a dramatic leap over tube technology and perhaps most lovably have become relatively affordable in recent months now those of us who own them are owned by them we sit agog and agape on our couches without a twinge of buyers remorse in my case while visions of highly defined sugar plums dance across our vast screens but whats the meaning of it all for the future of movies does the flat panel revolution the sudden transformation of a sci fi standby into a domestic appliance signal the imminent demise of movie theaters and how will this proliferation of plasma and liquid crystal change the experience of watching dvds in the comfort of homes suddenly transformed into monoplexes minus the sticky floors and overpriced popcorn before i start to gush about my own experience and gush i will let me report the experience of a couple i know both the husband and wife are screen writers and therefore recipients of the dvd screeners that the studios and distributors send out each year in hopes of winning end of the season awards for their films last weekend my friends told me they fired up their new inch flat screen beauty to watch a recently released movie i wont tell you which one except to say it was a particularly grim drama that i reviewed at the end of last month but they walked out after minutes where did you go i asked the front lawn "no just out of the room " the husband said "a while later we tried to watch some more but we couldnt stand it so we walked out again " in other words an off putting movie can put you off whether youre watching it on the splendid expanse of a screen in a studio screening room as i had watched that one or on a less expansive but still splendid screen hung like a sideways mona lisa on a media room wall my new plasma screen a incher that will probably shrink to the status of modest in the coming year isnt hung on a wall it sits on one of those component concealing cabinets that pretends to be a piece of reputable furniture the picture is still pretty imposing though since the machines arrival two days after christmas ive barely been able to tear myself away from staring at the damned thing dvds i thought i knew well are revealing hitherto unseen details in ravishing colors and i havent even sprung for a high def player because of the foolish replay of the vhs beta war that forces us to choose between two competing expensive systems "star wars" looks sensational "oliver" and "singin in the rain" are sublime "the double life of veronique" is doubly sumptuous and quadruply mysterious while "the incredibles" is yes you guessed it an almost too good to be credible example of a pure digital signal the movie was born as bits and bytes in the service of astonishing images and a brilliant story theres only one downside at the moment in addition to worrying about burnout a concern for anyone who sees hundreds of movies each year i must now worry about burn in a misfortune occurring though i gather the danger has been overstated when a static image is displayed for such a long time that it burns a ghost of its former self on the plasma screen otherwise my big flat screen tv has brought me pleasure that amounts to a genuinely new experience a sort of cataract removal without the inconvenience of having cataracts or surgery if other movie lovers respond as i do and i cant imagine why they wouldnt dvds or whatever delivery system succeeds them will continue to enjoy a vital future as a source of entertainment and an expandable archive of movie history but home theaters alone wont put the movie theaters out of business only bad movies will do that movies that simply arent worth the ever soaring price of admission or the ever more unpleasant experience of coping with rude audiences shameless commercials and tedious trailers the truth is that theaters and home theaters depend on each other its all very well for funny little videos to be discovered on youtube but movies of substance need the validation that can only be conferred by theatrical openings and public acceptance otherwise they never make it to dvd though its thrilling to be able to watch beloved films at home on cutting edge displays that honor every nuance while reproducing every blemish the supply of exciting new movies has grown sporadic and undependable without a revitalized system of production and theatrical distribution home theaters will become private museums and those small special films we treasure will become the cinematic equivalents of literary novels eloquent stories writ large on glowing glass panels morgensterns picks flat screen favorites "big" was a good movie but a small one "ishtar" was a big movie but a bad one big is as big does in feature films the trick is to combine visual grandeur with drama and performances of equivalent scale these three spectacles will fill the largest flat panel screen spartacus this is a thinking mans or womans epic by now the films story is ancient history not just the revolt that the slave spartacus mounted against the roman empire but the decision by kirk douglas in his capacity as producer as well as star to fire his director anthony mann after shooting had begun and replace him with stanley kubrick yet the film is still notable for its intelligence and the excellence of a cast that includes laurence olivier jean simmons peter ustinov and charles laughton and for nondigital battle scenes that look sensational on lcd or plasma mad max a violent but visionary tale of marauding bikers and a cops revenge this film provokes thought too the movie that made mel gibson an international star became a template for a whole new genre of dystopian prophecy though a film by stanley kubrick "a clockwork orange " must have influenced the people who made mr gibsons gleefully grungy vehicle they include the director george miller who recently produced of all things "happy feet" the cinematographer david eggby and the art director jon dowding the thief of bagdad the dvd comes in a plain cardboard box forget about special editions with supplementary material like a bottle containing a genie however the little silver disc releases an action adventure shot in colors that only the original three strip technicolor process could capture and preserve and that only the new plasma or liquid crystal panels can reproduce in home video this arabian nights fantasy with sabu as the spunky thief of the title won three oscars for cinematography art direction and special effects which include a genie in and suddenly out of a bottle
