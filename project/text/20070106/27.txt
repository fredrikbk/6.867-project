houses pay go rule makes amt relief harder washington the drive in congress to protect more middle class americans from the individual alternative minimum tax just got a whole lot tougher the house friday passed a new "pay go" budget rule that aims to rein in the countrys surging deficit by prohibiting the chamber from considering any tax cut or entitlement legislation if the cost isnt offset by increased revenue or spending trims for now at least house democrats say they intend to abide by the rule even when it comes to "fixing" the amt a proposition that would require them to replace vast amounts of tax revenue the amt was designed to prevent upper income people from avoiding paying taxes altogether but it wasnt indexed for inflation without a change to the system that would over time require a growing number of middle class families to pay higher taxes congress has passed temporary patches to prevent this but without a change in law more than million taxpayers would be subject to the tax in according to the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution doing away with the amt as some democrats are proposing would reduce tax revenue by about &# trillion over the next decade an amount that would be challenging and politically painful to offset it is possible that congress could pass a shorter term remedy in either case coming up with offsetting revenue would be tough passage of the pay go rule in the house "means its going to be with great difficulty that we find &# trillion " said charles b rangel d n y chairman of the house ways and means committee who has made reducing the amts impact on the middle class a top priority "its not good for me to have pay go but its good for the country " in the senate too a bipartisan push to repeal the amt is on a collision course with a plan to strengthen pay go requirements on thursday senate finance chairman max baucus d mont along with the panels ranking member iowa republican sen charles grassley proposed repealing the amt mr baucus said he wants to do so in a "fiscally responsible way " but has not provided any specific plans meanwhile a proposal by senate budget chairman kent conrad d n d for tightening pay go rules would require revenue losses from repeal of the amt to be offset or if offsets werent found senators would have to approve the amt changes with the emphasis on fiscal restraint mr rangel said he is taking a broad look at possible changes to the tax code that could be used to offset the loss in revenue from any changes to the amt certain tax breaks such as deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions wouldnt be touched mr rangel said as for others "im having them all added up " he said mr rangel acknowledged that democrats have to tread carefully or risk political backlash "at the end of the day we have to have an equitable package where nobody can say democrats raised taxes " republicans criticized the new house pay go rules as too weak in particular because they dont apply to all spending
