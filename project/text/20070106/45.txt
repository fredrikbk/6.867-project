pursuits books democracys cautious fan alexis de tocqueville by joseph epstein eminent lives pages &# count alexis de tocquevilles life and works appear to offer evidence for the theory that powerful ideas have their origin in lived experience as joseph epstein notes in this wonderfully succinct volume it was a very near thing that the great observer of democracy was born at all both his father and mother escaped the guillotine years before his birth only by the happy timing of robespierres fall from power a grandfather uncles aunts and cousins were less fortunate and the excesses of the french revolution would haunt his whole life inspiring his famous journey to america where a different kind of revolution seemed to offer the world a way forward although tocquevilles most celebrated work "democracy in america " focused on the fledgling republic mr epstein says that the book is "only secondarily about america " tocquevilles real subject is "to show the perils of thoughtless democracy and its most beneficent possibilities " mr epstein does offer a few demurrals tocquevilles lack of serious attention to education and to the rise of industrial technology e g the railroad weakens "democracy in america " other critics he notes have lamented tocquevilles failure to offer empirical support for pithy generalizations in passages such as "in democratic ages men rarely sacrifice themselves for another but they show a general compassion for all the human race " but in the end quite properly mr epstein portrays his subject as a towering figure tocqueville saw the world "steadily and whole " and he did so mr epstein observes "without forgoing his own profound passion to steer the world clear of disaster to help men and women live unencumbered by servitude and with the freedom to achieve their own best dreams " one challenge of achieving such freedom as tocqueville saw so clearly is finding the proper balance between liberty and equality drawing on "democracy in america" as well as "the old regime and the revolution" mr epstein is led to meditate on the difficulty of this balancing act it plays a role in taxes and trade obviously and in the demands placed upon the individual and his government on this score the democracies of europe and america have defined themselves very differently in the century and a half since tocquevilles death in mr epstein also remarks on tocquevilles revisionist view of the age of enlightenment and of the activist philosophers such as voltaire and diderot who did so much to herald and legitimize revolution in france the philosophers wholesale assault on religion tocqueville argued was both damaging and decisive "without doubt the universal discredit into which all religious beliefs fell at the end of the last century exercised the greatest influence on the whole of our revolution it marked its character nothing did more to give its features that terrible expression which we have seen " whatever tocquevilles own religious convictions there is no question in mr epsteins mind that a powerful sense of mans fallen state if not original sin animated the frenchmans passion for getting democracy right and his fear of what might happen if democracy went wrong in this tocqueville bears a striking resemblance to americas founders mr willcox is a writer in ridgefield conn
