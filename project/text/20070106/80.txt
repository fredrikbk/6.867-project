the weekend interview with p j orourke jokers to the right washington whos funnier on the whole liberals or conservatives its an old question but a terrible one even to inquire after it reduces the whole curve of human comedy to politics and besides sad to contemplate perhaps the most accurate answer is that theyre both humorless on the liberal side of the register you can hardly be funny if youre constantly feeling guilty about things many conservatives meanwhile believe that everything is going to pieces and theres nothing funny about that p j orourke the political satirist neither hesitates nor hedges "conservatives generally tend to be funnier in their private lives " he explains "because of the hypocrisy factor i am of course a big fan of hypocrisy because hypocrites at least know the difference between right and wrong at any rate know enough to lie about what theyre doing liberals are not nearly as hypocritical as conservatives because they dont know the difference between right and wrong but anyways the personal lives of conservatives tend to be funnier theyve always got the embarrassing gay daughter and so on " in public policy mr orourke claims "liberals are always much more hilarious liberals are always proposing perfectly insane ideas laws that will make everybody happy laws that will make everything right make us live forever and all be rich conservatives are never that stupid having conservatives in government is like having a stern talk with your dad in the den about what your allowance will be of course the republicans always end up giving in you know giving you more money than you should have in your pocket and the keys to the car and then also a bottle of whiskey " so clowns to the left jokers to the right not an uninteresting answer to the "whos funnier " question mainly because it presupposes politics as the object of satire and not its wellspring the circumstance for mr orourke runs in the other direction he is one of the foremost comic writers in the anglophone world and his mirth derives as much as anything from his politics over the last several decades mr orourke has crowded his c v as the scourge of fashionable causes at home and also abroad serving as foreign correspondent to "the absolute flat out goddamn worst places in the world " as he puts it his proof journalism is savage profane relentlessly irreverent throwing in various breaches of decorum and moral trespasses for good measure and usually vertiginously caustically hilarious when i meet him he looks well marinated cured even as though hed be great company for steaks and stiff drinks with several orders of first and second hand smoke on the side in fact he is mr orourke divides his time between d c where i join him for lunch and a country place in new hampshire his views are firmly of the live free or die variety though he is unsparing in his commentary on the last election in which all but one of the new england republicans were dispatched in favor of "some left wing gals and other complete nonentities " "i think it was all about the war and about george bush " he says "they just hate bush in new england even in new hampshire and i dont know why it is that they seem to loathe him more than everybody else is it because hes a traitor to the new england tradition of transcendento liberalism bush went to groton and then he goes to yale then harvard and at the very worst he should have emerged boring like his old man instead he comes out this southern borderline evangelical hard right conservative " hold one beat "except as a hard right conservative myself " he continues "bush has been a pretty miserable failure on that front its called failure bush and the republicans are offering a newer deal a greater society where the hell did this come from and theres no other word for it but failure failure to control spending failure domestically and failure in iraq " mr orourke is particularly cutting on the situation in the persian gulf which he covered most recently during the war proper and also in and intermittently thereafter "i was very much in favor of the iraq invasion " he says "what were the questions is saddam hussein a bad man is he doing bad things does he have the oil money to do more bad things is he likely to do more bad things if these were the questions was the answer more cooperation with france " in the aftermath he expected "a great spontaneous return to order " much like he says what he saw after the iraqis were expelled from "devastated" kuwait "after they got chased out of there the kuwaitis totally took control and it was as though somebody had been chased out of i dont know dayton everything was working again within days civil society came to the fore hayekian social forces it was amazing we thought i know i thought knowing a fair number of sophisticated intelligent iraqis that this would happen in iraq you remove the oppressor and there would be these self organizing forces well nooo " he says drawing out the word "instead what you got was yugoslavia triple yugoslavia you might call it the really violent bosnia "i have no idea if some societies anthropologically speaking arent really suited for democracy i dont think thats true but there certainly are societies that just love to fight northern ireland for instance you couldnt stop that problem because they were having fun they were really really enjoying themselves it would still be going on full force today if the sons of bitches hadnt accidentally gotten rich what happened was more and more people started getting cars and television sets and got some vacation time down in spain and it wasnt that they wanted to stop fighting and killing each other and being lunatics but they got busy and forgot "so our job " he says "is to make the iraqis get busy and forget you know i meant to kill all those other people but well jeez i had to get the kids off to school the car was filthy and i had to take it down to the car wash the dog got sick on the rug killing all those shiites is still on my to do list " mr orourke argues we are well on our way to creating "weimar iraq" a grave phrase and concludes mordantly "im so glad the problem is above my pay grade " when mr orourke set out into the world after a youthful maoist phase it was after all the s there was an element of novelty to his insouciance and his beliefs like the larger movement of which he was a part constituted their own kind of insurgency now all that was fresh and scandalous then has become the stock in trade of every other pundit blogger and radio show bore while the right has also made its own establishment and correctness of any kind cripples humor "well im almost " says mr orourke "itd be a damn shame if i was the avant garde " but he allows "i dont think thered probably be a place any more for the kind of stuff i was writing " and says "there is a power to seeing things for the first time with fresh eyes that you cant duplicate " there does in truth seem to be a seriousness increasingly smuggled into mr orourkes work if still impertinently expressed humor he argues comes from "distance not disengagement " and humor that "stands for nothing means nothing " consider his latest book "on the wealth of nations " a foray into adam smiths masterwork mr orourke argues we cant understand smith as a "personality" "in the th century the neo ptolemaic view of the cosmos hadnt come into fashion the self had not yet taken the earths place" but we can understand his ideas "my book is defiantly middlebrow the poor neglected middlebrow " says mr orourke "youre never going to read the wealth of nations and you shouldnt really its pages i wanted to a give people a sense of some of the things smith was getting at and b give normal people a kind of michelin guide to what they might like to read and i also hope c to send some people back to the theory of moral sentiments which can actually be read through from left to right in its entirety " "moral sentiments" was published years before "wealth of nations " and mr orourke sees it as central to smiths thought noting that smith wasnt an economist but a moral philosopher who argued for the fundamental morality of the unfettered market as a form of social organization and the lodestone for prosperity its a bit odd to hear p j orourke who is always calling attention to the fraudulence of earnestness and its siamese twin sanctimony talk about morality but his is almost no morality at all a non morality in that it demands nothing the only basic human right he says is "the right to do as you damn well please" and take the consequences he is not however a true libertarian theyre "too logical " he says "its a failed but admirable mission they keep making these suicide attacks on principle kamikaze raids on the aircraft carrier of government libertarians suffer the same problem that smith runs into in the last book of wealth of nations which was a pretty considerable failure he tries to make proscriptions for government that fit his rationalist philosophical and moral logic everything comes apart hes self evidently wrong wrong by his own reasoning the problem with politics is that philosophy and morality are never really options "the important thing " he continues "is negative rights freedom from but politics is all about positive rights whatre you going to give me in a democracy its always vibrating back and forth people want the government to do everything for them then when they see that it sucks they want the government to let them take charge and when that doesnt work they want the government to come back and fix all the problems that they themselves caused when they took charge " theres a kind of separation of church and state mr orourke contends "you simply cannot put your ideas into action " mr orourkes cynicism is finely ground but its also the foundation for his humor he revels in the untidiness and chaos of the world things are funny to mr orourke precisely because theyre already in pieces and theres nothing that can be done you may as well have a good laugh about it mr orourke says he is adjusting well to middle age or he prefers "very late youth" "i cant complain well i can complain its a f ing nightmare " "im still getting out enough as much as i like " he permits "i spent about a month in china recently i was over in kyrgyzstan but i cant do it like i used to its a matter of age appropriate again a lot of the fun of seeing the third world is first impressions i covered my first war in lebanon about years ago everybody just gets exasperated twenty years ago we were all very interested in what was making these people fight each other and who was right and who was wrong and after a while you say sit down and shut up go to hell " mr rago is an assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal
