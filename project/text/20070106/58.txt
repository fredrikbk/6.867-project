pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations an ode to ceremony the first instant message of came up on my screen just after midnight it said "noony there is much love in the world " i immediately thought this must be a lovely drunken person but it was from a journalist broadcasting the festivities in times square hed been watching a live feed in his studio and the sight of all the young people massed before the camera "beautiful full of joy full of hope" suddenly brought tears to his eyes and he was taken aback as i read tears came to mine why do they mass in times square and count the new year in there are no symposiums on this question but i believe the answer is to gather and mark something big beginning to share a sense of expectation if you had a bad year its over change is on the way "five four three two" and if you had a good year youre on a roll "one " they do it to start out on the right foot with a cheer its not just an event its a ceremony a few days later the great state funeral of gerald ford i didnt plan to watch it but every time i saw it i couldnt stop why do we do this dust off the pomp and circumstance and haul out the ruffles and flourishes its not only to mark a death even of so respected and highly charged a figure as a former president why do network television chiefs and newspaper editors decide not to leave the story until its over even when from day one it seems stale because its not stale were renewing the marines snap their salutes and bear the flag draped coffin up the marble steps and we hear the old hymns "going home " "a mighty fortress is our god " "the navy hymn" "oh hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea " we dont hear these songs much in modern life only at formal occasions like this we lock them in a closet until a state funeral and then they come out and we realize how much they meant and how much we miss them the ministers speak of gods grace and ask him to welcome his humble servant home which suggests and in a formal state occasion that there is a god a home a soul the eulogists speak of the wonders of the human personality and of a specific and particular life in the long continuum they praised fords honesty his modesty his patience they said he always put himself second they said he loved his country in doing so they reminded us that effort is rewarded patriotism is praised we do all this to remind ourselves who we are we do it to remind ourselves what we honor and what we believe as a nation and a people we do it to remind ourselves that america yields greatness that here a seemingly average man raised in decidedly average circumstances can become someone whose passing deserves four days of a great nations praise praising these things reminds the old of what it is we should be aiming for each day and instructs the young on the elements of a life well lived we do it to make the picture broader for a moment and free ourselves of our cynicism and we do it finally to enact what so many feel and rarely say not only because its corny but because if you mean it its beyond words fords was the most human of presidential funerals maybe because the fords wanted so little done so insisted on modesty all that was done was genuine and sincere and perfect the ford kids now middle aged seem to be genuinely close and love their mother the old guard those soft old faces with soft gray hair looked genuinely moved and jimmy carters remarks were wonderful he and gerald ford spent beating each others brains in it was a sharp and personal campaign and here he was speaking of "the intense personal friendship that bound us together " as rosalyn carter wept in her pew good for them good for all of them such affection and dignity isnt only about them it continues the long and very human line of old political enemies who came to see each others humanity and then see beyond that "jefferson still survives " it is a tricky thing no one likes the buddy buddyness of the elites but we are all moved to see that foes who fought bitterly but meant well can in some way find common ground at the end at the gravesite in michigan a military officer in accord with old tradition folded the flag and marched it softly to the vice president who then walked it over to betty bloomer ford who took it in her hands and quietly brought it to her lips oh it was beautiful a friend who wasnt much impressed by ford or the ceremonies emailed me "im bawling " she said time moves life moves we grow older together and now a new era begins and with another great ceremony as i write a new democratic speaker of the house is about to be sworn in the great hall of the house is full and teeming members have brought their children in brightly colored dresses and little jackets and ties nancy pelosi in a russet suit and pearls is standing laughing and holding a grandchild now a clerk with a high voice is reading "therefore the congresswoman nancy pelosi is duly elected " and the house has erupted in cheers she is escorted to the back of the chamber and now the first woman to lead the house of representatives is being handed the gavel by john boehner the leader of the opposition he kisses her she holds it high and now she speaks "i accept this gavel in a spirit of partnership for the good of the american people " "in this house" she says "we may be different parties but we serve one country " and so again we remind ourselves who we are we "show an affirming flame " we are a great republic and a great democracy we are a great nation and a great people we peacefully gracefully pass power from one group to another and we start this new time on the right foot with a cheer
