pursuits books in pursuit of the memorable made to stick by chip heath and dan heath random house pages &# it can be more than a little frustrating not to say embarrassing to forget nearly everything from the bosss important presentation last week but to recall minute details from an episode of "law &amp order" that aired a month ago but of course such selective amnesia or rather selective memory is more than a personal quirk it is a social one crazy urban legends spread wildly through the culture while perfectly sensible truths fall into sudden oblivion wouldnt it be great to know how to harness the gripping power of memory to figure out why certain ideas stick brothers chip and dan heath respectively a professor of organizational behavior at stanford and the co founder of a textbook company think they do know why in "made to stick " they examine what makes an idea image or event memorable each can be made "stickier " they say through clever and purposeful presentation "made to stick" casts a wide net cataloging advertising campaigns political slogans and stories told round the office coffee machine that have somehow gained traction in the urban legend category there is for example the tale of the man who was drugged and woke up in a strange room in a tub of ice water only to discover that one of his kidneys had been harvested by organ thieves a lot of us have heard about this poor fellow although he almost certainly does not exist his story the authors say is sticky because it bears striking imagery and a message potent with warning fact based ideas sometimes become sticky too almost literally remember when news emerged in the early s that buttered movie popcorn was astonishingly unhealthy a nutrition education group found grams of saturated fat in a medium size bag of buttered popcorn while the recommended daily total for one person was merely grams the researchers were appalled but they also knew that the public unsure whether grams of saturated fat was "bad bad like cigarettes or normal bad like a cookie or a milk shake " would be properly aghast then the group hit on a way to make the point they laid out a bacon and eggs breakfast a big mac and fries and a steak dinner and then announced that buttered popcorn contained more saturated fat than all of them combined here was a comparison that everyone could understand sales of popcorn plunged and movie chains switched to a healthier type of oil for their "butter " jared fogle the subway restaurants pitchman became a compelling cultural icon through his successful self invented sandwich diet the authors note that his testimonials made him entirely credible as an ordinary guy a customer who thanks to subways leaner cuisine and to regular exercise managed to lose a lot of weight people identified with mr fogle associating subway with healthy food and weight loss in the year the jared ads debuted subways sales jumped by constrast pitches without such startling images or storylines resonate less as common sense would suggest a charity group wanted to show that the u s spends proportionately less on foreign aid than any other industrialized nation but the group didnt come out and say so in an online essay it used a bunch of statistics to make the point the authors trim and reorder the essay to put the big idea up front take out some congressional budget office statistics and insert a few nuggets like this "if everyone in the united states gave up one movie a year we could double our current aid to africa and asia " the groups message is thus effectively transformed "made to stick" might have followed its own advice a bit more the analytical point of all those sticky ideas almost gets lost in the welter of anecdotes its hard to recall all or even most of the books many bullet points even the inevitable acronym for creating a successful idea success simple unexpected concrete credentialed emotional story is missing something aside from a proper ending the sort of compelling presentation that would make the authors theorizing as memorable as the stories they recount ms ossinger is a journal copy editor
