boston shops for new look around filenes building boston to many bostonians the former filenes department store evokes memories of tailors piecing together mens pinstripe suits on the seventh floor elegant women sipping tea on the eighth or children petting rabbits on the rooftop zoo filenes was one of several traditional department stores once clustered between the financial district and the back bay bostons two most important business centers most of those institutions are gone and the area known as downtown crossing has been described by boston mayor thomas menino as "really tired right now " now john b hynes iii the grandson of a former mayor wants to resuscitate the area with a &# million redevelopment project including a story office and condominium tower one of several large development projects planned for boston over the next several years that could greatly alter the citys skyline but to pull it off mr hynes and other developers must overcome skepticism from those who warn it could damage part of the citys historic character and charm a battle thats been fought in other cities across the u s including philadelphia charleston s c and san francisco walking the line between development and preservation is a challenge confronting the roughly historic districts in u s cities and towns says james glass director of the center for historic preservation at ball state university in muncie ind done right he says new designs can showcase contrasting historic buildings done wrong modern buildings can mar the nearby older structures "i wouldnt want to come to boston to see a floor building that i could see in atlanta or that i could see in miami but i would come there to see its early american architecture " says florida a&amp m university history professor titus brown who serves on the florida historical commission mr hynes argues that his project will be a boon to an area that could use a boost intended to be an outdoor pedestrian mall bostons downtown crossing is littered with fast food chains and inexpensive jewelry stores in the day it feels grimy at night it looks grim despite a transportation hub that people pass daily many commuters go home without stopping there in march however the massachusetts historical commission ruled that the story glass office tower planned as part of the downtown crossing project would have an "adverse effect" on the filenes building and another nearby historic structure built in known as the jones mcduffee and stratton co building the commission was also concerned about the effects of shadows and vibrations on the nearby old south meeting house site of the protests that led to the boston tea party mr hynes chief executive of new york based gale international says hes willing to be flexible but in a meeting with the commission he also expressed the opinion that "the city of boston is a vibrant growing place its not a museum " its a lament often sounded by developers working in historic areas the filenes building with its ornamental architecture evoking classical greece and rome is listed on the national register of historic places and dates back to it was the last major building designed by chicago architect daniel burnham whose work includes union station in washington d c filenes was part of may department stores co which was bought by federated department stores inc in last year federated began to phase out the filenes brand and vacated the downtown crossing store shortly after the holiday shopping season the boston flagship building is currently empty save for the retailer filenes basement a separate company filenes basement will move out temporarily and then return to the basement and the first floor mr hynes mixed use plan includes million square feet of offices retail and condominiums the developers vornado realty trust along with gale international paid about &# million for the filenes building which will be converted into retail space on the lower floors and a hotel above mack cali realty corp and jp morgan provided additional financing the architects on the filenes project elkus manfredi of boston say the modern tower is inspired by mr burnhams historic filenes building while still clearly defining whats old and whats new david manfredi the architectural firms founding partner says the massachusetts historical commissions concerns are more with the size of the tower than with its look the developers of the project called one franklin street say they have experience in marrying existing buildings with modern development "if there is a city where we have seen this kind of thing work over and over again we have seen it in boston " says sandeep mathrani executive vice president of vornado a new york based real estate investment trust boston has been successful in a number of preservation efforts one example faneuil hall a meeting house from the th century that was once listed for demolition was rescued in converted into a marketplace and became a model for urban renewal projects and as an example of the citys progressive views on architecture boston is considering whether to give landmark status to city hall a precast concrete building from the s thats an example of the controversial "brutalist modern" movement of architecture which emphasizes rough blocky forms "preservation as a topic is a really hot issue it always is in boston because we have so much historic fabric " sarah kelly executive director of boston preservation alliance a non profit advocacy organization "its just critical to find the right balance " the city has also been a hot market for real estate investment over the past months last year it set a high for total sales volume at &# billion and is on pace to shatter that record other projects planned for boston include a skyscraper at winthrop square in the heart of the financial district that at up to stories would be the citys tallest building currently that distinction belongs to the john hancock tower at stories the filenes project is just one of several real estate opportunities that investors have been grabbing after the consolidation of the retail industry over the past decade in pittsburgh for example mccormick &amp schmicks seafood restaurant moved into the former lazarus macys store on fifth avenue and the rest of the building was converted into offices and condominiums in portland part of the former meier &amp frank is going through a &# million conversion into a hotel the massachusetts historical commission must sign off on the downtown crossing project for it to receive final permits the architects have worked with boston preservation advocates to come up with modifications to the buildings exterior that they believe will alleviate the commissions concerns mayor menino says if all sides are willing to work together the project could prove a catalyst for the revitalization of the area "when you have a city like boston that really pays attention to its history we will always have those little conflicts sometimes as mayor of this city i dont want to change the historic nature of boston but i know that we have to have growth and to have growth sometimes you have to have a compromise "
