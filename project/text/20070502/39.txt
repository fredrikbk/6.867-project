dow jones the premium question murdochs lofty offer could deter rivals buffett unlikely to bid dow jones long has traded at a premium relative to other newspaper companies the question after rupert murdochs audacious bid for the parent of the wall street journal is how much is a buyer willing to pay for what now is viewed as one of the media worlds high profile prizes news corp the international media conglomerate controlled by mr murdoch made an unsolicited &# billion buyout offer for dow jones sending shares of the new york media company up &# or to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange and lifting the stocks of other newspaper companies news corp said the offer was "friendly " calling the journal "one of the worlds great newspapers " but the bancroft family dow joness controlling shareholders told the board they would vote shares constituting slightly more than of the voting power outstanding against the &# a share offer the offer represented a lofty multiple equal to nearly times the media companys projected earnings higher than googles forward price to earnings multiple of even before the offer dow jones traded at a to premium above other newspapers the offer is above the close of dow jones shares monday and more than above its week low reached in september the stock closed at its highest level in five years yesterday on its biggest share volume day in at least years the shares are still more than &# below their record close in june the offers premium raises the question of whether mr murdoch views dow jones as a trophy property that would cap decades of media deal making if so the deal would be more akin to high price acquisitions of sports teams and skyscrapers that would also mean few other bidders might challenge him leaving the bancroft family as his only hurdle but even if mr murdoch views dow jones as a trophy there are strategic reasons for him to do the deal dow joness content and brands could help him build a global business brand which would include the soon to be launched fox business news channel which could benefit from an alliance with the wall street journal the journal currently has an alliance with cnbc mr murdoch could also sell the companys content through his media empire "he has a history of identifying assets that he really likes and that make strategic sense and paying what is necessary to win " says mark gallogly founding partner of centerbridge partners lp whose background is in media businesses if on the other hand other potential buyers can see ways to justify the price either through synergies cost cutting or the view that dow jones is worth roughly double what stock investors were willing to pay the day before the offer then a bidding war could ensue the emergence of wealthy bidders such as sam zell and david geffen for tribune co shows the appeal of newspapers to wealthy individuals shares of dow jones generally have traded at higher multiples than peers in recent years in part because the company has less exposure to newspapers than some rivals do about of dow joness revenue this year is expected to come from print publications according to analysts new york times co is expected to see more than of its revenue from print after recently selling its broadcast television unit at the same time the wall street journal is holding up better than many other papers has a coveted demographic high advertising rates a respected brand and a growing online franchise that charges for subscribers unlike most others the journal itself has bucked the declining circulation trends that have hurt other newspapers for the six months ended march the journals circulation was up slightly versus a decline for newspapers overall the journals web site the largest subscription news site on the internet has grown strongly with paid subscriptions rising in the first quarter to analysts expect dow jones to earn &# a share this year and &# next year up from &# in "the company has become far more oriented toward improving profitability without sacrificing the editorial integrity " says david wallack a portfolio manager at t rowe price associates which is the largest outside shareholder of dow jones stock with million shares according to lionshares he says dow jones is "a highly cash generative company its balance sheet is in good shape and its a unique property " news corp s move could spark competing offers from media titans such as washington post co new york times and bloomberg lp some analysts suggest the companys flagship wall street journal is the second largest u s daily after gannett co s usa today the journals circulation is million other newspaper companies have recently spurred bidding wars when they put themselves up for sale amid pressure from shareholders tribune co agreed to be taken private in an &# billion buyout backed by real estate investor mr zell at a multiple of roughly times its projected earnings before taxes interest and depreciation knight ridder inc was bought by mcclatchy co in a recent transaction despite the bancrofts initial opposition to the offer analysts argue it will be tough for the family to resist such a high premium "while we do not believe the family was looking to sell the company and does have concerns about maintaining journalistic integrity this offer may be hard to refuse " says alexia quadrani an analyst at bear stearns who has a "peer perform" rating on the stock the equivalent of a hold "this is such a rich valuation " one sign that the market thinks the deal could go through news corp shares fell &# or to &# on the nyse yesterday when companies make expensive acquisitions their shares typically fall as investors worry that earnings will be affected news corp shares have climbed sharply in the past year in part because the company has resisted expensive acquisitions and focused on its growing global assets the unsolicited proposal from news corp was in cash or a combination of cash and shares another sign of the eagerness of mr murdoch to make the deal happen now the question is whether mr murdoch has managed to chase away competing bidders with his high bid even some private equity players say the bid is too high for their taste "it would surprise me if private equity came in on its own " says norman pearlstine a former managing editor of the wall street journal and now a senior adviser at carlyle group a large private equity firm typically private equity firms pay a premium for a public company that is anywhere from to but mr murdochs bid at a premium is way beyond normal territory whether other media buyers will be dissuaded by the high bid is unclear washington post has been rumored to be a potential buyer ever since the publication of a article in the new yorker magazine in which william cox iii one of the bancroft family members said the family would be open to a deal with the post particularly given its ties to billionaire investor warren buffett of berkshire hathaway inc a longtime post shareholder and a director on its board rima calderon a spokeswoman for the post declined to comment catherine mathis a spokeswoman for new york times co declined to comment but people familiar with the companys thinking said it would be unlikely to make an overture to dow jones given its battle with its own shareholders at bloomberg "there are no current or pending talks " said judith czelusniak spokeswoman for the private financial news firm founded by new york city mayor michael bloomberg mr bloomberg approached dow jones in the mid s to combine the two companies but was rebuffed by the board if dow jones were sold reuters group plc would be interested in buying some of the companys assets a person familiar with the matter said these would include dow jones newswires and dow jones indexes which calculates the dow jones industrial average and many other market indicators mr buffett is an unlikely bidder given the richness of the bid also mr buffetts experience with the washington post board and the buffalo news a berkshire subsidiary provides him with a dim outlook on the industry in his march annual
