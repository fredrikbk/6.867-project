state open source bills get microsofts attention ed homan an orthopedic surgeon representing a central florida district in the state legislature thought an amendment calling for open source document formats he tucked into a page bill wouldnt draw much attention but within an hour of the proposed bills reading in late march dr homan said he was greeted in his office by three lobbyists representing microsoft corp "they were here lickety split " he said "i had no idea it was going to get that kind of reaction " state by state skirmishes over open source document formats represent the latest showdown in a long running and so far unsuccessful campaign to topple microsofts sheer dominance of the desktop software application market four other states since january have seen language similar to dr homans included in proposed bills document formats serve as an underlying digital container controlling access to files like spreadsheets and the ability to share them efforts like dr homans could lead to broader use by states of opendocument format or odf an open source technology promoted by microsofts competitors odf analysts say could undercut one of microsofts most essential businesses by opening the door to alternatives to excel and word and other popular productivity applications owned by the worlds biggest software company characteristically as lawmakers like dr homan have learned microsoft is hardly taking a passive position the redmond wash company has mounted an intensive campaign for open xml an open format designed to counter odf microsoft argues odf is a limited technology that cant read microsoft files well and says open xml ensures compatibility with microsofts full office suite of products according to dr homan his open source amendment has been pulled from the florida bill because other legislators "didnt want to go to the mat on one paragraph " but if similar bills are passed elsewhere a spreading odf format could prove a gateway to its compatible open source applications whereas bureaucracies and most computer users have relied to date on microsoft office suite products such as word "file formats for years have been whats really locked people into microsoft office " said michael silver an industry analyst with gartner inc office in turn has thrived microsofts business division more than of which is made up of office products contributed one third of the companys &# billion in sales from january through march soon after introducing an open document format bill in the texas state legislature in february rep marc veasey said it was clear microsoft was going to commit considerable time and effort to influencing the outcome "immediately we heard from microsoft and their lobbyist here in austin and we knew wed be up against a tough battle " he is co sponsoring the open document format bill which is being read by committees in both chambers of the legislature other states recently weighing calls to adopt open document formats are california minnesota and oregon massachusetts was an early adherent of open document format technology it began moving certain state agencies to the use of odf earlier this year based on a mandate lawmakers in other states havent necessarily recommended odf over open xml but microsoft clearly sees the spread of odf as a potential result of their proposals in a document microsoft lobbyists left with dr homan the company played down the "minority of voices" arguing specifically for odf open xml it argued is a "more robust" option according to mr veasey in the proposed texas bill "we really wanted to stay away from choosing one format over the other we went out of the way to bring microsoft in to seek their input in drafting this legislation " ultimately however "they said they thought it was favoring odf" and declined to lend their support he said mr veasey said he would gladly support adoption of microsofts open xml if the texas department of information resources decides it meets his bills definition of "open " the impetus for the texas bill was similar to that in other states a desire to ensure access to archived and current documents regardless of which companys application is used to open them and lower costs "if the state could have these companies compete against each other it would save taxpayers millions of dollars " mr veasey said dr homan said he first became interested in the open document format issue when floridas department of health requested renewal of a three year software agreement with microsoft at a cost of &# million "i thought man thats a lot of money and that comes up every three years " dr homan said florida and other states could save money with genuinely open formats because they are designed to work with other conceivably lower cost document applications than what microsoft offers such as the open source technology openoffice the idea is that not only state workers but also constituents could use such cheaper options "microsoft sees whats coming things like word and excel are sort of like a drug now getting ready to go generic " dr homan said open xmls broad recognition as a standard could aid microsofts lobbying efforts odf was ratified as a standard by the international organization for standardization last year microsoft too is now seeking to have open xml ratified as an open standard by iso and expects a decision in september open xml was ratified in december by another standards body ecma international open xml will also have to fit states specific definitions of openness however in the proposed texas bill that means being "controlled by an open industry organization " tom robertson microsofts general manager of interoperability and standards said open xml like odf is the result of genuine collaboration "even competitors to microsoft were part of this thing " including apple inc he said gartners mr silver said that while other companies do support open xml "in reality microsoft is of course the biggest gorilla in that group and cares the most about this " mr robertson said efforts to educate legislators on open xmls benefits continue "we have been very excited to talk to governments in states about the benefits of this new generation of technology and we are going to continue to do that " odf proponents are no strangers to the lobbying game the odf alliance a group organized for this purpose counts members including such microsoft rivals as international business machines corp sun microsystems inc and google inc sun and ibm actively support odf and the compatible openoffice technology while sun offers an odf compatible product called staroffice mr veasey said the odf alliance ibm and sun have all actively lobbied in texas "they basically said it doesnt have to be odf it could be another format but lets get going on this " mr silver said ibm sun and other microsoft rivals have good reason to be aggressive "they know that support of documents has been key to microsofts success so anything they can do to level the playing field is a good thing for them " according to market research firm npd group inc microsofts office had a share of the u s productivity suite retail market in odf alliances managing director marino marcich said not just microsoft rivals support the odf standard as the alliance has more than members he said many recent state level proposals including floridas occurred without the alliances knowledge microsofts mr robertson said open xml is a better alternative and a landmark attempt by his company at openness more broadly open document format technology is only one part of a broad ranging effort by microsoft to grapple with the growing open source market earlier this month the company said it will offer a &# software suite to students in developing countries which will help position microsoft against cheaper open source products available there microsoft also signed a partnership with novell inc late last year enabling microsoft customers to run open source novell products alongside microsoft products in the same computer server and vice versa mr robertson disputes the notion that open xmls appeal lies mainly in ensuring use of microsoft products in the future for example he said microsoft recently began developing "translators" that enable users of odf to seamlessly open and share documents created by microsoft products alongside those created by other products "its not legitimate at all" to view open xml as a microsoft only product he said whether microsoft will succeed in convincing legislators of this remains to be seen
