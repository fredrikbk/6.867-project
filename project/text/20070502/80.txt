more law firms charge fixed fees for routine jobs before cisco systems inc announced plans to buy webex communications inc in march ciscos outside lawyers spent several days working around the clock to draw up the papers for the &# billion deal but the attorneys didnt see the kind of big pay day that often follows work on mergers and acquisitions they were toiling for a fixed fee when it comes to buying legal services corporations mostly pay lawyers by the hour but critics say that approach encourages lawyers to be inefficient leading to wasted time and bloated unpredictable bills now thanks in part to improved technology for tracking the costs of legal work companies are increasingly finding ways to avoid the oft dreaded billable hour "typically large numbers of associates go off and write memos that get tucked into the lower right hand side of someones drawer " says gordon davidson chairman of fenwick &amp west llp of mountain view calif the firm that represented cisco systems in its webex purchase using a monthly fixed fee arrangement he says fenwick lawyers have cut down "on stuff that we were doing that was interesting but not that useful " cisco a leader in the area of so called alternative billing now farms out to of its annual legal budget estimated at &# million under fixed fee arrangements it mostly uses two firms fenwick for securities and corporate work like the webex deal and morgan lewis &amp bockius llp for litigation other large companies like advanced micro devices inc and tyco international ltd have tried alternative billing on a smaller scale general counsels in charge of their companies legal matters and budgets are perpetually under pressure to trim and better manage expenses but it hasnt been easy to move away from the familiar billable hour system in part because neither companies nor law firms typically have a good sense of what a piece of legal work will end up costing now new tools are helping both sides estimate costs up front giving general counsels more confidence to move ahead with arrangements like fixed fees and "value based billing " in which the payment a firm gets depends in part on the results it achieves the boosts have mostly come from off the shelf electronic billing and "matter management" software programs over time as data accumulate general counsels offices are able to organize cost information on everything from a group of patent filings to a large single task like reviewing three million document pages about two years ago pitney bowes inc arranged for its "procurement" department to work with the legal department on managing costs anita gulati a director of strategic sourcing says that after spending a lot of time with the companys matter management system she "has a much better sense how long it takes us to do something and therefore how much it will cost " pitney bowes is now using fixed fee arrangements for employment matters small m&amp a deals and real estate work "the savings are real " she says estimating the company saves up to on fixed fee matters while a growing trend alternative billing has yet to catch on in a big way especially with the nations top law firms which are generally hugely profitable using the billable hours system for most of their work according to a soon to be released study by the general counsel roundtable which is made up of general counsel at large companies of about respondents said they have used fixed fees "once in a while " up from in a study done in even companies that use alternative billing tend to avoid it for big ticket items like a high stakes merger or a bet the company antitrust case "right now fixed fees are most suitable to routine recurring matters where you have a good estimate of what a piece of work should cost " says craig glidden the general counsel at chevron phillips chemical co among small firms a handful have worked primarily outside the billable hour structure for over a decade now some regional and boutique firms are using alternative billing as a way to get a toe hold with blue chip clients butler rubin saltarelli &amp boyd llp a lawyer litigation boutique in chicago was a traditional hourly rate firm until about four years ago says partner patrick lamb instead of raising its rates the firm decided to pitch an alternative approach to clients the firm approached houston based fmc technologies inc whose general counsel jeffrey carr was a fan of unusual arrangements under which for example he would pay outside counsel a minimum of of its billable rate but add a premium over the firms full rate if it achieved a good result at first mr carr told the firm he didnt have a need for chicago based counsel but mr lamb was persistent and mr carr ultimately asked him to submit a proposal for the companys mass tort work butler rubin beat out the three other contestants "had they not been persistent and been amenable to an alternative arrangement its safe to say they wouldnt have won the bid " says mr carr who calls the relationship which is ongoing "very successful " cisco general counsel mark chandler brought fixed fee payments to litigation and corporate work in an effort to bring the law department more financial predictability he says that in five years the percentage of total revenue spent on legal matters has dropped in he went ahead with two year fixed fee deals with fenwick and morgan lewis neither cisco nor the firms will divulge the fee amounts for morgan lewis the first two years were a learning exercise in early when mr chandler sat down with the firms litigation heads to discuss renewing the contract they told him the firm was making less on the deal than it would have under its normal billable hour approach mr chandler encouraged the firm to rebid at the same price and the firm thought hard about it morgan lewis ultimately decided to sign another two year deal says jami mckeon the head of the firms commercial litigation practice but cisco agreed to hold frequent meetings with the firm to in ms mckeons words "look ahead of the curve figure out if theres a problem we can head off at the pass " both ms mckeon and mr davidson at fenwick say the cisco arrangements are now profitable though not hugely so "you dont want your law firm making a huge profit " says ms mckeon "but you dont want your law firm taking a hit either theyre not going to give you the same level of service "
