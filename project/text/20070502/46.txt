for a change opera is using technology to bring us together the th top grossing movie of the past weekend was long disjointed and in italian the audience for it seemed sedate bordering on comatose in one theater the picture went out for a few minutes and the crowd sat there in uncomplaining silence the show was "il trittico " a trio of one act operas by puccini it was broadcast saturday live via satellite from the metropolitan opera house at lincoln center to roughly often sold out theaters in north america and europe the presentation was the last of six operas the met broadcast this season as part of an estimable technological experiment that successfully bucked a number of digital trends lately when technology has been paired with entertainment the result has been a marriage of convenience with social isolation web videos ipods and the rest the met though has been using an emerging national network of satellite linked digital cinemas to bring big crowds together in a darkened movie house just like old times when the met announced the satellite season in december no one knew what to expect beyond a lot of popcorn jokes the season though has been a smash hit theaters sold out as quickly as the met would add them next year the met plans to nearly triple the number of cinemas and to present eight operas instead of six other impresarios have taken note and broadway shows could be next peter gelb the mets new general manager says the success of the program is tribute to the human desire to experience spectacles be they opera or sports in a group he talks with enthusiasm about other new technologies for the met streaming videos podcasts even ringtones actually the company has a long history as a tech innovator it was using radio and television before either medium had a commercial network the met even broadcast live opera in a network of theaters in the early s using the black and white equipment of the time the series fizzled out after three years probably because of poor picture quality said mark schubin chief engineer at the met mr gelb is in his first year as head of the met and has for a mandate doing everything he can to increase opera awareness short of adding "mamma mia" to the repertoire he thus quickly took to the idea for live broadcasts floated by julie borchard young a colleague from his former gig at sony music ms borchard young also now at the met had used the satellite network to promote a david bowie album and saw it as a natural for opera still rare in the u s these live shows are more common in canada where they are also used for wrestling that other crowd pleaser technical credit for the u s transmissions belongs to national cinemedia a distribution company founded by the big american theater chains the company earns its keep by satelliting to participating theaters a show about minutes long called "first look " it runs before the movie starts and mixes coming attractions with unfortunately commercials the satellite network will eventually be used to show the actual feature presentation hollywood too is in the process of going digital the projector involved is a suitcase size version of the portable units that sit on conference tables and cycle through powerpoint presentations screen resolution is hd tv quality and most viewers gush about the beautiful picture coming generations of digital projectors will get even better with increased screen resolution and a richer palette of colors the theaters equipped with the satellite dishes and digital projectors necessary for the met broadcast tend to be new multiplexes in suburban malls because there is a huge opera constituency in cities the met is also working on being a technology evangelist helping smaller older urban cinemas become "rheingold" ready despite the success of the live satellite shows no one at the met has any illusions about the endeavor bringing opera to the saturday movie going masses with teens coming for "" but staying for "parsifal " most of those attending the shows are already loyal opera fans trending past years of age the sort who have tuned in for decades to the mets famed saturday radio broadcasts while theater tickets were sold this year compared with at lincoln center mr gelb said the project didnt make money because of high start up costs that should change next year he said so what was it like it rivals being there in person unlike tv you get the big screen filling your field of vision but with a proximity to the stage and singers that even live front row seats cant top and you cant beat the price &# compared with orchestra seats in new york that approach &# my only quibble is that we didnt get a live shot of the met ritual of its crystal chandeliers a gift from austria being raised into the ceiling before the houselights dim otherwise it was sublime my audience clapped for the big arias and for the curtain calls so transported was the crowd that no one minded a technical glitch that for a few minutes knocked out the picture during "il tabarro " the first of tritticos three operas why complain what could be better than sitting comfortably in the dark listening to soprano maria guleghina sing of love email me at lee gomes wsj com
