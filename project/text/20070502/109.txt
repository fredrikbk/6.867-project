scandal crises hasten exit for british icon bp chiefs tenure was increasingly rocky then he lied to court hiding an escort service the career of john browne one of modern britains most celebrated business leaders has unraveled in a personal scandal but the story of the bp plc executives demise has deeper roots and a more traditional moral that of a legendary executive who allowed his company to lose its way in the autumn of his tenure lord browne who was awarded his title after turning a sleepy oil company into a global titan yesterday resigned after britains highest legal body triggered the release of court documents detailing his relationship with a former lover since january the year old lord browne has been battling in court to prevent a london tabloid from printing the story while planning to resign later this year the documents detail lord brownes life with jeff chevalier including that their relationship began on the web site of an escort agency lord browne initially lied to the court in a statement about how he met mr chevalier and that lie led to the documents release the papers also contain statements from mr chevalier that he sold to the london tabloid the mail on sunday the relationship had ended early last year and mr chevalier decided he had little prospect of money or career mr chevalier told the paper about lord brownes dinner parties including one with british prime minister tony blair in which mr blair talked about life after politics mr chevalier claimed bp staff had helped him set up his own business which ultimately failed a bp investigation found that any help lord browne or bp staff provided mr chevalier in setting up his own business was inconsequential lord browne lied about how he met mr chevalier in a witness statement in january when his lawyers were seeking the injunction just after he and bp board members had battled about how long he would stay in his ceo post he said he met mr chevalier when they were exercising in londons battersea park in fact according to a person familiar with the matter they met on a web site called "suited &amp booted " which touts itself as londons premier male escort agency two weeks later just before a hearing on jan lord browne admitted he had lied and apologized saying he wanted to set the record straight as a matter of conscience but the judge in the case david eady castigated lord browne over the issue in his final judgment "i am not prepared to make allowances for a white lie told to the court in circumstances such as these " he ruled according to the court documents the house of lords declined to take up lord brownes appeal news of that decision and document release yesterday was swiftly followed by word of lord brownes resignation and then capped by a wrenching apology from the oil baron who had kept his private life carefully out of public view throughout his career "my initial witness statements contained an untruthful account about how i first met jeff " lord browne said in a statement "this account prompted by my embarrassment and shock at the revelations is a matter of deep regret it was retracted and corrected i have apologized unreservedly and do so again today " britains tabloids have a long history of taking down establishment figures over sex scandals but lord brownes case was unusual the head of the nations largest company he was venerated in business circles and the british press had never before delved into his private life the mail on sunday which is owned by daily mail &amp general trust plc says it had intended to publish the article in early january because it involved an important business figure and suggested improper use of bp resources bp yesterday put into play the succession plan it originally unveiled in january when lord browne announced he would be stepping down this july that date was already about months earlier than he had once planned bp said tony hayward anointed by the board in january as lord brownes successor has taken over as ceo a career bp executive mr hayward isnt expected to quickly change bps strategy but has said he will put a new emphasis on safety amid a series of image pummeling operational problems over the past two years bp faces challenges recovering from regulatory and safety problems including a refinery explosion in texas that killed workers oil spills in alaska and an energy trading scandal in u s markets along with the rest of the industry bp also is struggling to get access to fresh reserves of crude as oil producing nations in the middle east and elsewhere seek to capture more of their resource wealth for themselves because of his long and successful track record lord browne until recently had a secure grip on bps board but that began to weaken in the last two years in the wake of problems in the past few months mr browne misplayed his hand ultimately losing the support of board members he had once dazzled last year the ceo made comments that led several board members to wonder whether he was lobbying to stay on beyond late when he would hit the mandatory retirement age of then in january bp and the board learned about the mail on sunday article some bp officials say the planned story didnt force the january announcement that he would retire in july but people familiar with the situation said the story was obviously weighing on lord brownes mind the board wasnt dismayed by the pending revelations of lord brownes personal life people familiar with the situation say rather they say it was his admission that he had lied to a court that triggered his hasty departure yesterday lord browne had long presented a tony public image as an art collector and opera buff in sharp contrast to the rough hewn american oil barons who dominated the industry for most of the past century he lived for many years with his mother a holocaust survivor from hungary who accompanied him to bp events before she died in queen elizabeth ii knighted him in and in the government gave him a life peerage with the title lord browne of madingley his fall caps a four decade career lord browne joined the company as a university apprentice in during which time he studied physics at cambridge soon after graduating the company sent him to alaska at a time when big discoveries there helped the west weather the oil shocks of the s and s bp was founded by an englishman who struck oil in iran in by the time lord browne took over in the company which for a time was state owned was limping along over a decade lord browne transformed the oil icon from an also ran into a global powerhouse at one point it was the worlds largest publicly traded oil company by market capitalization behind exxon mobil corp and remains in the top handful when oil prices hovered close to &# a barrel in the late s lord browne convinced his board that acquisitions and cost cutting were the only way to survive in he forged a merger with amoco corp setting off a rash of copycat deals more recently critics have blamed the big spending cuts that accompanied the industrys consolidation for curtailing supply and contributing to todays super high oil prices lord browne also buffed bps environmental image years before the corporate green movement caught hold in other boardrooms in he warned that global warming was real and later came up with the slogan "beyond petroleum" for bp the company was long known as british petroleum almost until the end lord browne and his executive team were thinking about the next big deal in recent years say two people familiar with the matter they even considered a tie up with anglo dutch rival royal dutch shell plc that idea never made it to the board for consideration but was part of a series of scenarios that executives tossed around in brainstorming sessions said one person familiar with the situation but lord brownes cost cutting strategy came back to haunt the company in march when an explosion ripped through its giant texas city texas refinery killing workers and triggering a series of investigations by the time of the explosion the cost cutting was taking a serious toll on the companys operations according to regulators and internal bp documents the blast capped a series of deadly accidents at the texas plant which bp acquired in the merger with amoco regulators and bp employees alleged that deep cost cutting worsened plant safety and contributed to the accident a charge bp denies in a review conducted by bp executives paul maslin a vice president for refining technology said he thought the plants problems were "significantly aggravated" by cost reductions of ordered after the merger that report hasnt been made public but notes from interviews conducted for it have been reviewed by the wall street journal an independent panel commissioned by bp and led by former secretary of state james a baker iii found amoco cut maintenance spending by from to after bp bought the plant bp headquarters ordered an additional cut in total costs across its u s refinery operations at texas city and whiting ind near chicago plant managers cut staff and hired cheaper contractors for things like maintenance in texas hourly maintenance and operations staff fell by an additional between and according to the company meanwhile lord brownes top deputies overlooked looming problems john manzoni bps head of refining and a member of lord brownes inner circle of executives in london told bp executives during the internal review that he didnt pick up on difficulties while touring the texas plant he had heard reports that "everything was fantastic" at texas city he said in a july interview mr manzoni has declined requests to comment bp has said it quickly ramped spending back up and lord browne has defended his consolidation strategy "integration never finishes " he said in response to a reporters question at his last news conference as ceo in london early this year he added "there is always more work to be done " but "the pace of acquisitions was not too rapid " he said texas city was just one problem lord browne was wrestling with in alaska the company suffered two oil spills last year because of corrosion problems at its prudhoe bay oil field the countrys largest in august bp partially shuttered the field triggering a temporary oil price increase and congressional hearings outside attorneys hired by bp traced part of the corrosion problems to a botched integration effort between the alaska operations of bp and atlantic richfield co which lord browne snapped up in meanwhile an aggressive trading room mentality in the u s led to a string of tangles with u s regulators when the new york mercantile exchange doled out a record fine to bp in settling allegations of improper crude oil trading bp agreed to boost compliance at its u s energy trading business but last summer regulators alleged that houston based bp traders strategized to manipulate propane markets as recently as bp denies it manipulated markets but late last year disclosed that regulators also were investigating a series of its other energy trades amid the problems lord brownes view toward his coming retirement started puzzling some board members according to people familiar with the situation at a speech earlier last year he blasted statutory retirement limits newspaper articles mentioned the idea of an extended tenure directors started wondering if lord browne or his allies were floating trial balloons according to people familiar with the situation these suspicions crystallized after the release of a research report in july by merrill lynch analyst mark iannotti he wrote that lord brownes retirement was a "medium term risk" for investors and suggested shareholders write to the board to keep him on another "reasonable option " he wrote would be moving lord browne into the chairmans slot replacing chairman peter sutherland directors had no first hand knowledge that lord browne or his allies were behind any of these ideas according to people familiar with the situation but they grew increasingly confused about his intentions mr iannotti declined to discuss his research report on the friday that report was released mr sutherland an irish politician and banker who ran the predecessor to the world trade organization called lord browne into his office at bp headquarters near londons piccadilly circus he told the chief executive to end speculation that he would stay on according to people familiar with the situation starting that weekend details of the meeting leaked out in the british press in one case describing mr sutherland as "bullying " independent directors were livid at the leak according to people familiar with the situation while directors had already laid the groundwork for a succession search they quickened their hunt through the summer and fall by december a search group had interviewed leading internal candidates including mr hayward head of exploration mr manzoni and bob dudley chief executive of bps russian joint venture they decided on mr hayward and planned to announce the decision early this year then just before christmas came an email to the ceo from mr chevalier "i do not want to embarrass you in any way but i am becoming concerned by your lack of a response to my myriad attempts at communication " the court papers note that mr chevalier denied this was a thinly veiled threat on friday jan roddy kennedy bps top spokesman learned that the mail on sunday planned to publish a story about mr brownes relationship according to a person familiar with the situation inside bp the relationship wasnt a surprise though lord browne is intensely private several top bp executives and associates had met mr chevalier at social functions the next day mr sutherland the bp chairman began reaching out to other bp directors to discuss the matter but the communications immediately came to a halt saturday evening because mr browne succeeded in getting a court injunction against the story running the next day mr sutherland and others soon were told that they now were forbidden from discussing the matter it was to remain a secret and court papers wouldnt be made available lord browne told mr sutherland that he had a robust defense according to a person familiar with the case lord browne has said that his decision to move his departure up to july had already been made before bp learned of the tabloid story but he didnt inform the board of his decision until early january after returning from a vacation in barbados in a news conference in mid january lord browne said he had made up his mind in early december to go "sooner rather than later " but had kept that decision to himself this march lord browne informed mr sutherland that the court case had uncovered allegations that lord browne may have improperly allowed mr chevalier to use company resources in yesterdays release of documents mr chevalier alleges that bp personnel assisted in helping him set up a mobile phone ring tone business mr sutherland directed that bps chief counsel open an inquiry but mr sutherland couldnt discuss the case with the board on march the chief counsels report said that the internal use of company property was immaterial according to a person familiar with the situation lord brownes explanation for the lie about how he met mr chevalier which became the key issue for the courts was that he was embarrassed to be confronted by the allegations the reference to battersea park had been the agreed upon story between the two men when he introduced mr chevalier at social events according to a person familiar with the situation according to court papers lord browne gave mr chevalier gifts and money during their relationship including prada clothing mr chevalier accompanied the bp chief on business trips and they stayed in five star hotels and flew in private jets the breakup left mr chevalier facing "hunger and homelessness" in toronto mr chevalier told his former partner and he sent the pre christmas email to ask lord browne for money according to court documents days later mr chevalier got in touch with a friend who worked at the mail on sunday the editor peter wright agreed to pay for the story deciding the homosexual relationship was an important background fact that should be included it wouldnt breach lord brownes privacy he reasoned because the relationship was well known to business cognoscenti in the u k "chevalier accompanied him browne like a wife at the management functions " says mr wright "it was hardly a secret " mr wright says the paper paid a "modest" amount for the story much less than &#
