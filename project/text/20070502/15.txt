business bookshelf telling a big story in a few words  mission statements from top companies by jeffrey abrahams ten speed pages &# alcoa is a big company they make some of the best aluminum on earth once upon a time they made all of the aluminum but that is another story our story is about vision what is alcoas vision "at alcoa our vision is to be the best company in the world " what hershey is a less big company they make some of the best chocolate on earth hershey has a word mission it includes "undisputed marketplace leadership" and "top tier value creation" from a "portfolio of brands " not one of the words is "chocolate " huh gillette used to be yet another leading corporation it once said that its vision was to "build total brand value by innovating to deliver consumer value " its vision did not seem to include anything about shaving perhaps a mistake today gillette is a part of procter &amp gamble jeffrey abrahams an advertising copywriter by trade has written edited might be a better word since the original material here ends on page a little book on a big subject corporate mission statements he reproduces of them and even gives you in his early comment and advice section some easy steps toward crafting your own his book is amusing in parts although it was probably not intended that way the fun begins in the first paragraph when mr abrahams tries to define his subject the book he says is about that great modern creation the "company positioning statement known generally as a mission statement " the next paragraph refers to a "mission vision or other type of company statement " the second page refers to a "mission" being something similar to "reason for being purpose focus goal " soon we read that "whenever and wherever men and women have endeavored to achieve something purposefully a statement of mission or purpose is pronounced " as mr abrahams says elsewhere "writing can be hard work " all this tautology and repetition would just be a godsend for a dilbert cartoon if mission statements however defined werent taken so seriously in much of corporate america someone actually wrote that line about alcoa more likely some group of people crafted it over the course of several hours or several days perhaps they were following the directive of the mens wearhouse mission "striving toward becoming self actualized people " mr abrahams lists the "key words" that can be used to express missions or visions they include "quality" and "empower" and "team" and "unique " in fact a certain kind of mission statement well phrased and properly promulgated can inspire companies and the people who work in them it can help managers remember what theyre trying to accomplish and whats beyond the scope of their enterprise it can guide a companys decisions about allocating capital but to do so it must have content and most of the samples on display in " mission statements" dont a few pass the test though johnson &amp johnsons adherence to its "credo" saved the company from disaster its pledge of "first responsibility" to "doctors nurses and patients to mothers and fathers" was cited in as the reason for the famous recall of tylenol one of j&amp js products ben &amp jerrys sells not just fine ice cream but "euphoric concoctions " true enough the coca cola co s flagship product is so iconic that the company can allude to its own historic advertising when defining its ambition "to benefit and refresh everyone it touches " achieving such clarity does not require that companies operate in an especially exciting line of work progressive insurances vision is prosaic but compelling "to reduce the human trauma and economic costs associated with automobile accidents " as always a sense of humor can make a difference what defines the identity of a particular breakfast food manufacturer not the key words "excellence" or "shareholders" or even "unique " instead the kellogg co says of itself "we build gr r reat brands and make the world a little happier by bringing our best to you " when you get it right you can even leave out the word "cereal " mr tofel has written mission statements for nonprofit and for profit corporations
