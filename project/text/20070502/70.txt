in an unlikely place saudi arabia saudi authorities who traditionally have dealt with violent jihadists by locking them away a few years ago decided that keeping militants off the streets isnt enough

linked to al qaeda launched a series of attacks in the kingdom initially against foreigners but eventually hitting at saudis directly in and terrorist attacks killed civilians in saudi arabia and wounded many more the upsurge in violence sparked a backlash against al qaeda among saudi citizens a shift in sentiment that the government used to its advantage to bolster its intelligence and hunt down militants at the same time authorities decided that to protect the kingdom against future attacks it would need to fight al qaedas rhetoric for the "hearts and minds" of muslims it is difficult
