ask personal journal q what do i do with old credit cards that havent been used in years but are still listed in my credit history a you may want to leave them alone especially if those cards were in good standing one factor that goes into calculating your credit score is a lengthy credit using history so keeping old accounts open can help your score keeping otherwise dormant accounts active can also help your score since the credit limits on those cards are factored into your "credit utilization" level which measures what percentage of available credit is being used typically the lower that level the better for your score in general old accounts can appear on your credit report for years as long as they dont contain any negative information closed accounts with black marks such as late payments are usually dropped after seven years
