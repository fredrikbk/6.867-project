deals speed up hybrid savings if you have been toying with the idea of buying a hybrid car the cost equation is tilting in your favor until recently buying a hybrid meant you were willing to shell out for a pricier car because you believe in helping the environment or because you like to own the latest high tech gadget auto research firms found it could take up to years depending on the model of gas pump savings to offset hybrids higher sticker prices but now it is taking less time to break even thanks to car makers new deals on hybrids right now the average incentive for all hybrid models is about &# according to edmunds com "up until maybe a year or so ago we were paying over sticker prices for hybrids " said philip reed consumer advice editor with edmunds com but now "there are hybrids on car lots and theyre being discounted thats unusual and its also at a time when gas prices are high so people are going to want these cars " mr reed said those incentives are helping to shorten the number of years it takes to recoup a hybrids higher sticker price about a year ago edmunds com found that it would take a bit more than two years to break even on buying a toyota prius when compared with buying a gas powered toyota camry le today that break even period has dropped to less than a year assuming you drive miles a year gasoline prices play a big part in those comparisons "obviously hybrids are much more fuel efficient with gas prices back up again and probably going to stay higher through the summer months it tends to make it a little more attractive proposition " said rob gentile director of consumer reports auto price service incentives on hybrids may not be your typical deals mr reed said with the prius toyota motor corp "wanted to reduce the price so they could sell more of them but they didnt want to put an incentive on it because they didnt want to devalue the brand so they began to discount the options its a car that has a lot of options on it if you cut the price on the options effectively youre dropping the price of the car rather significantly " meanwhile ford motor co s ford escape and mercury mariner hybrids come with a &# cash back deal plus an additional &# in dealer cash that is money that the dealer can use to reduce the price of the car if the consumer is smart enough to negotiate note that incentives often vary by region also low interest financing may be available to consumers with good credit you wont find incentives on all hybrids for instance theres no special offer on honda motor co s honda civic hybrid or the lexus rxh hybrid now mr reed said there are plenty of variables that go into figuring out how much a hybrid will cost you compared with a gasoline powered car theres sticker price including any incentives then theres how much you drive per year the more miles you average the quicker a hybrid will pay off for example if you drive miles per year on average it will take you a little over one year to offset the higher sticker price of the four door sedan camry hybrid vs a similar gasoline powered camry according to edmunds com data but if you drive miles a year it will take you a full two years that is assuming gasoline is &# a gallon the current national average and current sticker prices incentives and tax credit amounts are in effect still when you compare hybrids to the most fuel efficient gasoline powered cars the break even point remains fairly long for instance it takes more than nine years to break even with the honda accord hybrid a four door sedan compared with a similar gasoline powered honda accord according to the edmunds com data assuming miles driven per year and gasoline at &# gallon but the higher gasoline prices go the better hybrids look the break even point between those two hondas drops to years if gasoline is at &# a gallon with current sticker prices but assuming gasoline costs &# a gallon the lexus gsh four door sedan hybrid breaks even right away with the similar gasoline powered lexus gs sedan assuming miles driven per year that particular comparison is aided by the tax credit that is currently available on the lexus hybrid that is another consideration the tax credits worth as much as &# to consumers who buy new hybrids they usually arent available to taxpayers who pay the alternative minimum tax those credits phase out once a car maker sells hybrid vehicles thus far toyota is the only car maker to surpass that milestone so the credits available on all toyota hybrids are slowly phasing out for instance last year a prius buyer could enjoy a &# tax credit but if you buy that car now the credit is just &# and there is no tax credit on that car if purchased after september go to irs gov and search for "tax credit for hybrid vehicles" for more information on the specific amount available on each model another cost consideration is maintenance and repair there is good news for hybrids on that front mr reed said "people are really worried about the batteries and its proven to be much less of a problem than anybody ever thought " mr reed said "plus nearly all the manufacturers have very long and strong warranties to protect you " he said as long as eight years and miles or even years and miles for the hybrid components plus brake repair costs may be less than on a standard car because of hybrids braking systems "you dont have to do brake jobs as often " he said "thats a savings that a lot of people dont consider " dont forget insurance costs mr gentile warned adding that some insurers may charge more to insure a hybrid while others offer discounts still hybrids have proved popular among plenty of car buyers even before incentives started appearing thats because cost isnt the only driver when it comes to choosing a car "its an emotional decision in several ways " mr reed said for one concern with global warming is becoming widespread among consumers he said plus "people have very emotional feelings about gas prices people do not work out the dollars and cents of increases in gas it doesnt hit the ordinary consumer nearly as much as they think it does they just dont like it "
