substantially understated for that reason people need to maintain records of their cost basis in stocks or bonds not only until the investment is sold but for at least three years after the return reporting the gain or loss is filed says anne christensen accounting professor at montana state university likewise bank and credit card statements or canceled checks that might substantiate deductions like charitable donations should be kept for several years after the return claiming the tax deduction is filed and documents showing contributions to an individual retirement account
