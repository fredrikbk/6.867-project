the mossberg solution an ipod rival with an edge music player uses wi fi connection no search on device since its introduction in apple inc s ipod has taken over the portable music player industry gaining steam each year and rolling over competitors one after the other its simple interface navigational scroll wheel and itunes software program make it a pleasure to use and impossible for other companies to beat to stay fresh apple regularly introduces ipods with thinner builds lighter weights longer battery lives brighter screens and new functions but despite improvements on the original ipod none has enabled interaction with other players or wireless internet connectivity two features that competitors are eager to offer so as to chip away at ipods huge market share microsoft corp s zune music player for example was shipped with built in wi fi enabling song sharing albeit limited with nearby zunes apple is about to bring out its own wireless music player in the iphone which combines a full ipod with wi fi and cellphone connectivity but so far its unclear whether youll be able to use the iphone to download or share music this week i tested san disks &# sansa connect player a collaborative effort from sandisk corp yahoo inc s yahoo music and zing systems inc that comes with built in wi fi for more than just limited sharing with other players unlike the ipod which must be plugged into a computer to load new music sansa connect can play and download content on the player whenever a wi fi network is available including photos internet radio songs from yahoos music store or recommendations from friends the sansa connect isnt without flaws downloading music on the go requires a subscription plan that costs &# a year or &# monthly so you never outright own this content the player also relies on a wi fi connection for much of its functionality and you may not always be within wi fi range another problem is that yahoos music store doesnt sell videos and offers fewer songs than apples itunes roughly two million versus five million lastly the sansa connect doesnt enable searching the store for specific music instead youre limited to internet radio or play lists suggested by yahoo a caveat that can be maddening if you want to find a certain title or artist but overall i really liked the sansa connect it forced me to look at my portable player as an evolving untethered device that introduced me to lots of songs when it wasnt connected to wi fi i was disappointed to not be downloading new songs my ipod suddenly seemed old fashioned the four gigabyte black sansa connect isnt as handsome as the ipod and has a stubby wi fi antenna protruding from its top edge it measures about a half an inch wider than and two and a half times as thick as the comparably priced ipod nano which has twice as much memory eight gigabytes rather than four the sansa connect has a microsd card slot for expanding its capacity but doesnt come with such a card the sansa has a movable scroll wheel similar to that found on the original ipod this wheel aids navigation tremendously as does its smart interface a colorful inch display showed seven menus in a fan formation at the bottom of the screen and i flipped through each by turning the wheel a tiny speaker is built onto the back of the device which came in handy more often than i anticipated i cut right to the chase when i opened my sansa connect testing its wi fi capabilities by playing an internet radio station through the device the player detected my wi fi network i entered my yahoo username and password and seconds later was listening to a new carrie underwood song on one of pop stations even without a paid subscription to yahoo music unlimited to go owners of the sansa connect can access about internet radio stations subscribers get twice as many each player comes with a free day subscription you can also view uploaded digital photos without a subscription the sansa connect links to yahoos free photo sharing site flickr com so you can see your images as well as the top photos flickr labels as todays most interesting but you cant view friends albums these photos looked good on my sansa connect screen automatically adjusting to fit the screen in landscape or portrait views depending on the image with a subscription the sansa connects wi fi connection becomes more useful while a song is playing you can press a button to download it or the whole album to your player i tried this with mat kearneys "nothing left to lose " opting first to download just that song but then deciding to get the entire album one by one the songs downloaded averaging about seconds each at best until they were loaded in the players my music section finding exact songs artists or albums using the sansa connect is complete hit or miss rather than gaining access to yahoos entire store on your player youre limited to choosing from general genres via the internet radio section top songs on yahoo music or yahoos recommendations for what youll like so if you want to hear a certain band youll have to guess which category the band falls under in internet radio hope to see one of its songs and then download as the song plays though this lack of a search process is frustrating at times it also might force you to discover music that you havent yet heard this is a different way of thinking for ipodders so it may not catch on as easily as the sansa players creators hoped but remember the sansa connect is wi fi capable so it can receive software updates wirelessly adding new features to the player at any time its developers say search on the device is something theyre looking at for the future if youre desperate to load your player with familiar tunes you can always plug it into your computer and sync it with music in your yahoo music jukebox its version of itunes you can download songs with your subscription or just buy them each costs cents with a subscription or cents without any regular mps that you have stored on your computer will transfer over to the player as expected which i did easily you can also create play lists in your yahoo music jukebox on a pc and these will be wirelessly sent to your player ready for downloading whenever you choose i did this with a few different playlists to get some specific songs that i wanted the final component of the sansa connect works through yahoo messenger using the player itself you can log onto messenger to send or receive song recommendations to or from friends who are logged onto messenger at a pc or on another sansa connect player but they must have a subscription to listen to your recommendations and vice versa wi fi is a real battery sapper and the company estimates that continuous wi fi usages will cut the sansas estimated hour battery life by half but youll rarely have wi fi on continuously and the player smartly shuts wi fi off the instant youre not using it to conserve battery power even though the sansa connect requires a wi fi connection for most of its magic this player is refreshingly fun to use when it works im never completely surprised by the next tune that plays on my ipod and must rely on the radio or friends suggestions to hear new music the sansa connect solves that problem by giving your portable player new life mossbergsolution wsj com
