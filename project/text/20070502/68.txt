is it time to return the truly mentally ill to psychiatric hospitals jonathan kellerman argues in his april editorial page essay "bedlam revisited" that cho seung huis rampage might have been prevented had he been "locked up for careful observation in a humane mental hospital " as a backdrop for his argument dr kellerman recounts the s movement to close mental asylums in this country the flawed assumption behind this attempt to make mental health treatment more humane was that the mentally ill would voluntarily report to mental health clinics for treatment because this movement instead resulted in a flood of homeless schizophrenics dr kellerman argues that commitment of potentially violent people should be easier he then moves to cho writing "when the level of threat rises to college freshmen and faculty prophesying accurately perhaps we should err on the side of public safety rather than protect individual liberty at all costs " the hole in dr kellermans statement is that we dont know ahead of time if people are "prophesying accurately " in the same issue of the journal carol hymowitz argues that companies need to increase awareness and vigilance among employees to prevent workplace violence she states "employees tend to recognize the earliest onset of problems and have little patience for them " and implies college students should do likewise ive watched the growing movement toward corporate and social groupthink for the past five years and i wonder if in our panic to make all aspects of public intercourse perfectly safe and litigation free we wont find it all too easy to smear good people whose social style doesnt fit convention will it be harder and harder to find people willing to overlook quirky or odd personalities and see creativity or passion do we really want to make it easier to run people out of companies and society altogether based on speculation about what they might do in our zeal to make sure very rare atrocities like columbine and virginia tech never get close to happening who will file the "minority reports " david tyler glendale ariz dr kellerman vastly understates the power of mental illness if he actually believes that commitment of cho seung hui for an undefined period might even have made him more "polite " the mental health system in its modern day manifestation did fail cho but civil liberties arent the only reason cho went voluntarily to the police at the time of his brief commitment after being reported suicidal perhaps he even craved relief from the demons that plagued him many ill people do what we have offered in place of warehouse style institutions is simply too little quick fix hospitalization paid for with inadequate insurance patchy community care without case management or in home support miserable housing and on and on build a better system and the sick people might even come not all of them maybe not the chos but many more than currently do mary beth pfeiffer stone ridge n y ms pfeiffer is author of "crazy in america the hidden tragedy of our criminalized mentally ill " should we as a society attempt re institutionalization of the mentally ill the two practical considerations are would it really work can we afford it a larger question is about individual freedom and personal rights but unless it is a practical solution to the problems brought about by closing all those mental hospitals why even discuss it since the mid s there have been many advances in treatment techniques and pharmaceuticals for the mentally ill keeping psychotics in controlled environments under state of the art treatment has a far better chance of succeeding now than ever just taking the mentally ill out of the prison systems and redirecting the money spent on them there would pay a meaningful portion of the costs we must reverse this "de institutional" mistake we can afford it and it would work at least a whole lot better than what we have now surely our public officials have their personal liberty instincts honed by current challenges enough to write effective safeguards willis duff tijeras n m t s eliot certainly anticipated the liberationists and libertarians of the s and beyond to this day when he opined "half the harm that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important they dont mean to do harm but the harm does not interest them or they do not see it or they justify it because they are absorbed in the endless struggle to think well of themselves " and a pity it is how quickly and thoughtlessly so many slavishly succumb to the siren song of the self anointed do gooders jack lochrie farmington hills mich
