gordon lightfoots surprised to be here new york in the last week and a half john corcoran an otherwise completely normal seeming middle aged guy turned up at nine out of gordon lightfoot concerts the owner of an oil and gas business in traverse city mich mr corcoran beamed as the toronto troubadour performed classic fare like "beautiful " "rainy day people " "carefree highway" and his signature "if you could read my mind" in torrington conn easton harrisburg glenside and wilkes barre pa sparta and red bank n j peekskill n y and here in a sold out gig at the seat town hall mr corcorans wife peggy is tolerant "she knows gordon is and hes not going to be touring much longer so she says its not heroin booze or another woman " his three children are bemused his friends derisive "i get unrelenting abuse from them they call me a lighthead " confided mr corcoran who as an year old became acquainted with the baritone voice and sugared folk melodies of mr lightfoot and has seen him in concert some times "im a little nuts im a lot nuts " he amended as he stood outside town hall in a fever of anticipation "all i know is that in the midst of the madness of this world its my therapy the music touches my heartstrings " the gray mustachioed object of mr corcorans curious devotion is reed thin with a singing voice to match the result perhaps of a near fatal abdominal aneurysm in "it took two years to recover and for a while it was touch and go " said mr lightfoot a few hours before the town hall performance "then for a year i wondered if id be able to sing because everything was thoroughly messed up but i have a pretty strong constitution and everything is all right now " mr lightfoot has reached a point in his career where like it or not hes frequently dealt with in numerical terms the five grammy nominations the nearly two dozen albums that went gold platinum or double platinum in canada and the u s the million plus albums sold the juno awards the canadian version of the grammys including seven for best folksinger five for best male singer and two for composer of the year despite those impressive stats copping to a deep fondness for mr lightfoot has never been the best way to establish ones hipster bona fides indeed one embarrassed ticket holder standing outside town hall refused to give his name and expressed concern that hed already divulged too much by identifying himself as a year old lawyer from long island "people dont look at a gordon lightfoot fan as being cool and manly " he said puffing a compensatory marlboro cool or not so he and hundreds of others were in their seats waiting eagerly for the first strum of mr lightfoots acoustic guitar precisely as audiences have been doing for some years it was a sentimental journey of sorts for the singer songwriter he was the opening act here his first concert hall engagement for paul butterfield and his band in the late s mr lightfoot and his band have "always been a presence " he said "weve always toured and worked weve just kept on and its come up to this point in time that im quite surprised im still around were not setting the world on fire on the music charts but weve got a desire and passion " mr lightfoot is savoring the freedom of a man who has nothing left to prove and no recording obligations to fulfill "i signed with warner bros twice and i probably could have signed again but i really wanted that pressure to be off of me at this point "i was under contract for years and when youre like that youre always under the gun to produce you tend to ignore certain things and to become isolated and you dont spend enough time thinking about other things like the business end and the family and even the live performances now i can concentrate on my shows which is great because thats what i like best anyway " what the fans like best during those shows is the old stuff tunes like "sundown " "rainy day people" and "if you could read my mind" that made mr lightfoot rich famous a plot point on episodes of "rd rock from the sun" and "seinfeld " and the focus of a tribute album by artists like the cowboy junkies and maria muldaur "i know what i really love and i know what they love i wind up settling on material that bears repetition i can always pull the emotions out thats not a problem i believe in the songs " the younger of two children mr lightfoot grew up in orillia ontario where as a boy soprano he worked the wedding circuit "o promise me" and "the lords prayer" were specialties performed in a church choir a barbershop quartet and a dance band "my parents were very supportive " he recalled "my mother talked to me about bing crosby she told me one day very casually bing makes a living as a singer i was years old and a little light went on in my head " after a few semesters at music school in los angeles mr lightfoot came back to canada where he played the guitar and sang in coffee houses and plugged away at his own compositions "thats what i tell young performers who come to me asking for advice write a bag of songs because thats what you have to do you dont just grab it right off the bat like that " said mr lightfoot his own particular bag of songs attracted the interest of peter paul and mary who made a hit out of "for lovin me " "that song was written early on in my first marriage it was troubled right off " mr lightfoot said anne murray judy collins richie havens and mr lightfoots idol bob dylan also did well with his material success the songwriter would share when he began recording his own tunes along the way there was a fair amount of triumph "the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald " mr lightfoots sonorous account of the disaster on lake superior "sundown" and "if you could read my mind" had pleasant stays at the top of the charts a fair amount of drinking though mr lightfoot says hes been sober since the early s and a fair amount of attitude "i might have been difficult during the s when we were flying a little bit higher in the pecking order " mr lightfoot conceded "but i never trashed any hotel rooms or set any fires or anything like that " there was also a fair amount of messing around mr lightfoot whos been married twice hes separated from wife number two has six children by four women "ive always had women interested in me " he conceded "id be honored if they were interested now but i cant go for it because i dont want to change my estate people who read the wall street journal will know exactly what im talking about " and he certainly doesnt want to change his schedule there are concerts on this years itinerary "im coasting into my end game " said mr lightfoot "but ill do it as long as audiences come im sure ill be able to tell when its time to stop itll probably be when im lying on the floor " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
