meuron recipients of the pritzker architecture prize the &# million structure scheduled for completion in will have a roof that crests and falls several stories at a time and an all glass facade that ripples like water struck by the sun its backers hope that the acoustics within will put the concert hall on par with the sydney opera house the metropolitan in new york the vienna state opera and los

germanys largest port solidly on the cultural a list this is "not a building for the elite " explained mr herzog at a press conference in new york in early april instead the architects note in their
