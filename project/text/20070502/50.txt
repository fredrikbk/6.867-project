gamestops used market plays well with buyers jim esposito is the ideal customer for gamestop corp the year old lawrenceville n j gamer scours its retail store for previously played videogames eschewing the pricier new ones on the shelves unless theres "a lot of hype surrounding the game " or if its one he will play again and again gamestop is thriving with a stake of the &# billion u s videogame market strengthened by its acquisition last year of rival eb games the specialty retailer now has more than stores in the u s and abroad used videogames comprise a little more than of that market analyst colin sebastian of lazard capital markets said but preplayed games have a to profit margin compared with new games margin of about to with a full schedule of coming releases of new games and new consoles such as nintendo co s wii used game sales rise as an increasing number of gamers look for new titles "the used game market is a fairly substantial business on its own and for a specialty retailer like gamestop which has limited margins on new products used products dramatically increase margin profile " mr sebastian said gamestop aggressively promotes its used game buyback program knowing some gamers are ready to unload certain titles in a matter of days or weeks while others wont spend &# or more on new games the company guarantees itself more sales by offering up to a &# credit not cash for each used game it buys for resale gamestop also offers buyers a guarantee if the used game doesnt work you can bring it back cost is a factor as well new games often cost &# to &# while used games typically dont cost more than &# and in some cases can be cheaper than &# "the price point for new titles is simply too much since i may play through the game only once " said tom kline of woolwich township n j messrs esposito and kline fall into the core gaming group men to years old according to a study by nielsen co of men ages to and of men to have access to a videogame console in their home as of the fourth quarter of thats up from and respectively two years earlier the most prolific buyers of used games besides value oriented customers fall between the hard core gamers who play an average of five hours a day and the casual gamers who play on average a few hours a week gamers can buy preplayed games through such web sites as ebay inc or in other retail stores such as circuit city stores inc or blockbuster inc but mr sebastian said "we really havent seen any of these broader consumer electronic retailers execute this business well if a company like circuit city rival best buy hasnt broadly expanded that probably says something about the difficulty of the investment of putting this together " mr esposito said he "would never think to shop for used games at any of those places and my first concern would be if they can offer prices competitive to gamestop and eb games " circuit city is testing the sale of used videogames on its web site and in a handful of stores according to a blockbuster spokeswoman the company has plans to focus more on the trade in business "we havent been aggressively going after that portion of business and we think theres a customer base out there for this product we want to make sure we can offer customers previously used games " she said best buy co didnt return calls for comment gamestop declined to comment for this article citing the competitive nature of the used game market some analysts believe gamestops growth could be stymied by lower than expected sales of next generation products and more aggressive competition from big box retailers but competition for the used game market is unlikely because gamestop has "near total dominance in the preplayed category " edward williams of bmo capital markets said in a research note after fiscal profit climbed gamestop said it expects first quarter earnings per share to more than double gamestop also plans to pay down most of its debt on expectations that u s hardware sales will increase more than in and that a strong game lineup will drive software sales up to during the next two years analysts agree the preplayed game market will continue to gain strength especially since the new generation of consoles the wii sony corp s playstation and microsoft corp s xbox all have the ability to play games from the previous generation of consoles the launches of the wii and playstation late last year also helped lead to a packed videogame release calendar this year more new games on the market means the cycle will continue gamers will continue to sell back games once they finish them increasing the number of preplayed games on the market despite the hype and popularity surrounding the newly launched wii and playstation older game consoles are still popular for example playstation outsold all other game consoles except the wii in january and february and bested all game consoles in march according to market research firm npd group that performance has given the older model the largest user base to date with million units in the u s the console also has the largest library of games according to a research note from bmo capitals williams gamestop will continue to generate "significant revenue cash flow and eps growth" and gain market share due to the strong preplayed business knowledgeable sales staff and first to market advantage gamestop has a "market position as the only meaningful specialty retail destination in the industry "
