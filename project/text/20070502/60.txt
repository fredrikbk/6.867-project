how veto strains the republicans bushs iraq policy risks driving away moderates new pressure for progress washington president bush can rely on strong republican support in his veto of an iraq war funding bill but the strain of the war risks creating splits in his party and producing major defections by this fall republican moderates such as former senate armed services committee chairman john warner of virginia are already demanding a greater voice in the second round of talks on war funding rep ray lahood r ill who has been loyal to the president said he and other republican lawmakers will have to reassess their support if military commander gen david petraeus and the government of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki dont show more progress by september "republicans are going to give bush an opportunity but if it isnt working in september a lot of members will be very nervous " mr lahood said "i think the big benchmark is september " "if things dont improve " mr lahood said "the leadership is going to come under pressure from members to go down and tell the president if you are not willing to pivot to make some dramatic changes you are on your own " septembers importance is twofold gen petraeus last week promised lawmakers that he will be able to give a fuller assessment then on his success in curbing sectarian violence in baghdad it is also the last month of the fiscal year when congress will have to deal with another &# billion funding request by the president to help pay for the war into that second bill in september may ultimately be the more decisive legislative vehicle for influencing u s policy but the immediate challenge for the white house and congress is to patch together an interim spending measure to replace the supplemental vetoed by mr bush the &# billion bill funded the pentagons requests through sept but required u s combat brigades to begin to withdraw from iraq by oct democrats will have their own political problems on the left if they drop this timetable to find a compromise but mr bush also needs a resolution given the long term risk of erosion in his party the date is a "prescription for chaos " mr bush said in a televised speech house speaker nancy pelosi d calif snapped back "the president wants a blank check the congress is not going to give it to him " but behind the scenes both sides were trying to tone down the rhetoric ahead of talks beginning this afternoon at the white house "if you are going to negotiate youve got to have somebody on the other side of the table whos doing something besides turning blue " said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis mr bush has sufficient republican support to sustain his veto in the house today but public opinion shows unhappiness in his party the most recent wall street journal nbc news poll found that of all potential republican primary voters now disapprove of his handling of the iraq war the same survey and a second by the pew research center found that the party appears divided over whether it wants a candidate in with the same iraq policies as mr bush or one taking a different approach for example the journal nbc poll found that of republican primary voters want the next president to take a different approach among nonconservative republican primary voters almost favored a different approach the pew survey found that among republican and republican leaning registered voters a narrow majority of those polled want a different approach only said they would prefer a presidential candidate who will continue mr bushs iraq policies "i dont see a pronounced defined split developing yet " said sen chuck hagel r neb a critic of the war "but if things dont change in the next few months we will have a split " the conventional wisdom remains that the partys base supports mr bush on the war and neil newhouse the republican pollster who conducts the wsj nbc survey with democratic counterpart peter hart said the dynamics are akin to when democrats felt compelled to defend president clinton against impeachment charges in the s andrew smith who oversees the university of new hampshires polling operations said he sees a distinction between the "team" identity among republicans on iraq and when broader questions are asked such as choices about candidates "the feeling is were republicans bush is a republican we are supporting the team the veto is one for the team " mr smith said "but the republicans are drifting away from it the war is seen more as bushs problem they support it conceptually but have a really sour taste about the handling of it "
