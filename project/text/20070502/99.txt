politics &amp economics u s to plug border security gap interpols passport data to be used after lengthy delay washington the department of homeland security will soon start using a database of stolen passports maintained by interpol a move that will help fix a glaring weakness in u s border security but it comes nearly two years after the international police organization made the information available to washington for years washington has worried about the dangers represented by lost and stolen passports stolen passports especially blank ones that can be filled in with false information are of particular concern because they cant easily be detected by immigration officers since the attacks of sept stolen blank passports have been called the "terrorists golden ticket" because they facilitate unhindered travel recently such documents have been used by iraqis attempting to gain illegal entry to the southwestern u s border according to interpol homeland security and mexican authorities earlier this year several groups of iraqis none of them known to be terrorists were caught in europe and mexico en route to the u s according to interpol some were traveling on passports that had been reported stolen from cyprus four years ago "lost and stolen passports represent a huge vulnerability to this country " said clark ervin homeland securitys first inspector general "the loss of any time let alone two years on something as crucial as this is inexcusable " in february homeland security secretary michael chertoff decided to give u s customs and immigration officers access to the interpols database at points of entry around the country by the end of the year the decision is expected to be unveiled at a senate hearing today on terrorist travel "procurements of technology are already under way " said department spokesman russ knocke "its going to be an added tool for front line personnel and an important contribution to their decision making about who they let into the country and who they send back " he said the time it took to get the database approved didnt represent an untoward delay u s agencies often resist adopting outsiders programs such as interpols because officials dont want to be responsible for a program they didnt invent or help design to this can be added dhs officials mistrust of multilateral bodies such as interpol and dependence on contractors who create systems that cant easily incorporate new ideas "you cannot underestimate the role that the not invented here culture played in creating resistance to the interpol database " said one senior dhs official dhss reluctance to use the system known as the stolen and lost travel document database is one example of how the government has seemingly ignored readily available security fixes in the coast guard pressed ahead with its own ship tracking system to make sure vessels headed to the u s dont make unscheduled stops it still isnt up and running even though existing commercial communications satellites could perform a similar function interpols computerized collection of stolen passports was the brainchild of ron noble a former u s undersecretary of the treasury who became secretary general of interpol in at the time interpol the worlds largest international police organization with member countries was increasingly viewed as bloated and inefficient then came sept "after no one in the u s or anywhere not a single agency anywhere in the world said interpol we need your help " mr noble said "we were irrelevant i was looking for a way to make us relevant " mr noble hit upon the idea of collecting stolen travel document data when he learned that the first world trade center attacker ramzi yousef had used stolen passports to enter the u s in interpol had information on fewer than documents from fewer than a dozen countries through intense international lobbying mr noble built a database that contains information on nearly million lost and stolen travel documents collected from countries by may the u s state department had endorsed the database and was encouraging other countries to contribute information despite this support officials inside dhs and u s customs and border protection didnt like the idea they complained the database was slow and that the u s had access to better information through a series of bilateral agreements and its own terrorist watch lists also interpol often didnt have officers readily available to help u s officials drill down for information beyond a passports number country of issue date reported missing and whether it was blank when stolen there were holes in some of the u s data of the million stolen passports in interpols computers homeland security has access to only million through bilateral arrangements without interpols data the u s is blind to million stolen passports "how many times does " the number of hijackers "go into million " mr noble asks the question nagged mr chertoff who as homeland security secretary has often said it was a mistake to design security systems "to let the perfect be the enemy of the good " evidence was mounting that the interpol system seemed to work four major u s police departments new york los angeles chicago and houston used the database in investigations each month more than swiss police officers check out more than entrants according to interpol france uses the system at charles de gaulle airport barbados uncovered users of bogus documents during the recent cricket world cup including wanted criminals interpol said last year the police agency said the u s tapped into the database only times a month on average "nothing is perfect " said t j bonner president of the national border patrol council the union that represents border patrol agents "no database is complete but its better than nothing which is what we have " mr bonner said although officers receive training in identifying counterfeit documents it is hard to spot the nongenuine article unless they receive a tip the interpol database isnt currently available for use by front line u s border agents in a test of the interpol system using data on million visitors to the u s last spring it turned up who may have entered on stolen passports dhs officials said it was then that mr chertoff decided to use the database u s customs and border protection however is still protesting "we want to use interpols data but heres the deal its not consistent and there is no background information or data history we can go back and look at its just not there yet " said spokeswoman kelly klundt
