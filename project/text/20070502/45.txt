fiscally fit hey wheres the party terri and gerry weigh the cost of celebrating at home or away online edition big party at home or at a restaurant which costs more thats the question my husband gerry and i debated earlier this year when we began preparing to celebrate our son geralds first holy communion ceremony the first communion is an important event in the roman catholic church one our families would traditionally celebrate with lavish parties i vividly recall my communion party in my white satin party dress frilly anklet socks small floral bouquet and veil my parents invited all of their brothers and sisters their spouses and kids and numerous friends to a huge celebration held in a large hall the hall belonged to my grandparents cutting down on the sticker shock but we werent planning on going quite that far for geralds communion inviting our extended families and friends would mean a guest list of more than people while geralds communion is a special day for us and for him we wanted to avoid turning the celebration into a party to rival a small wedding instead we chose to invite just our immediate family and friends for a guest list of just over rather than rent out a large hall for relatively few people i wanted to have the party at a restaurant gerrys family much smaller than mine celebrated his communion day at one of his towns best restaurants but other than his brother brian there were no kids at the party and gerry vaguely recalls being uncomfortable and bored hed rather recall fun memories of parties his parents had at their home which we bought from gerrys dad in instead of hosting the party at a nice restaurant he suggested why not have it at home after all he said we spent nearly &# on our backyard remodeling project over the last year why not enjoy it and gerry argued that having the party at home would cost a lot less per person than having it at a restaurant our son was on gerrys side our neighbors were planning to have their sons communion party at home and gerald liked the idea of our two parties merging into some kind of neighborhood block party id also have a hard time keeping him in a suit and tie if we had a party at home but i was hesitant hosting a big party at home comes with additional costs financial and otherwise that gerry wasnt considering so we ran the math figuring out how much a restaurant party would cost was relatively easy the restaurant charged &# per person for a sit down dinner party with a choice of three entrees for people or about &# with the bar bill which we estimated would come to another &# most of our guests are light drinkers would raise the bill to about &# with an gratuity the restaurant bill would come to &# and new jersey sales tax adds another &# to the tab for an estimated total of &# the communion cake another tradition in my family would be special ordered for &# and then there are balloons and party decorations around &# so the total bill would come to nearly &# that was a lot of money but i thought it was well worth the price by having the party at a restaurant gerry and i would be able to sit back and enjoy the time with family and friends thered be very little preparation required ahead of time and no messy cleanup to deal with afterwards and restaurant parties have a distinct beginning and end boundaries that are sometimes difficult to set with parties at home but gerry was lobbying hard to have the party at home hes worked very hard over the last year to get our backyard looking its best including building most of a deck himself he was proud of his accomplishment and wanted to show it off if we had the party at home wed still need to have the food catered since i wouldnt have time to do all the cooking ahead of time the catering company weve used in the past charges &# per person for a complete dinner party with a choice of three entrees which comes to about &# plus new jersey sales tax of almost &# and a &# tip for the set up person for a total of about &# stocking the cooler with drinks would add another &# or so to the cost for a total of about &# the party was set for late april so wed need a tent in case of rain wed purchased a large party tent years ago so theres no cost there we have plenty of comfortable seating in the backyard but with plus people wed need to rent tables and chairs at a cost of &# balloons and decorations another &# bringing us to &# and since my house doesnt routinely pass the glove test id need to spend at least two or three days cleaning to get it in shape hiring a cleaning service would run me about &# but after my past experience with a cleaning service id probably end up doing the job myself in the end gerry and i debated so long over where to have the party that the choice was made for us by the time we agreed to have the party at a restaurant the room was booked as were rooms at all the best restaurants gerry and gerald were happy wed have to have the party at the house but i really wasnt looking forward to all the work id have to do the night before the party it rained hard and more than ever i wished wed opted for the restaurant but the rain stopped overnight and on the big day it was warm enough to have the party outdoors two of gerrys aunts mentioned how wonderful it was to have the celebration at gerrys childhood home since they hadnt visited in years it turned out to be a great party with a few unanticipated consequences with two neighborhood families hosting communion parties parking was a problem some elderly guests had to park blocks away from our house and there were additional financial costs i hadnt factored in the ground was still wet from the previous days rain and the heavy traffic in and out of the house left its mark on our living room and dining room rugs and stairs red wine was spilled on our beige living room couch to clean it all professionally well have to pay &# and one of the chairs on our new patio dining set was damaged and will have to be replaced at a cost of &# so i estimate the total cost of the party at close to &# so what did we save by having the party at home instead of at a restaurant about &# to gerry it was worth it he thoroughly enjoyed himself but i paid an additional "cost" i spent most of the day fussing over the food and serving drinks so i didnt get to spend as much time enjoying myself as i would have at a restaurant between fretting about the weather and the last minute scramble to get the house in order i was stressed when communion day finally arrived as i sat next to gerald in church i was running through a mental to do list instead of focusing on the ceremony would it have been better paying an extra &# to have someone else do the heavy lifting gerry may not think so but i do party at home or pay to have it catered elsewhere how do you decide when to outsource your entertaining and who gets to decide write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about the
