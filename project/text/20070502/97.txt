alleging yucaipa interfered in allieds talks with the teamsters as a way to push through its own reorganization plan they also say that as an owner of a major allied competitor yucaipa has a conflict of interest and is looking to gain an improper amount of market power in the car hauling business in a lawsuit filed late last month in federal court in atlanta one of allieds outside investors hawk opportunity fund says yucaipa and the teamsters "colluded" to "manipulate and abuse" the bankruptcy reorganization process "for their own benefit" and at the expense of allied shareholders yucaipa and the union strongly deny any impropriety and a union spokeswoman calls the lawsuit "baseless " yucaipa along with the teamsterss leadership and allieds management argues that its plan holds the best hope for the companys recovery the allied case sheds some added light on the business relationship between messrs burkle and clinton who have been close friends for years after leaving the white house mr clinton became a senior adviser to yucaipa and involved in three of its investment funds mr burkle long a major donor to democratic candidates recently hosted a roughly &# million fund raiser at his beverly hills mansion for hillary rodham clintons presidential bid when mr clinton joined yucaipa in the company said he would "provide counsel" and "participate in events related to the funds and provide advice in the development of potential investments " mr clinton said he was attracted by yucaipas commitment to bring investment and jobs into underserved areas of the country neither yucaipa nor mr clinton has released full details about the former presidents compensation some observers have estimated he could make millions of dollars or more from his yucaipa connection mrs clintons senate annual financial disclosure statement for which includes spousal income shows mr clinton receiving "guaranteed" partnership payments from the yucaipa global opportunities fund i llc of "over &# " a spokesman for mr clinton says the former president owns a one third share of that fund the two other yucaipa funds involving the former president the yucaipa american fund and the yucaipa corporate initiative fund arent listed on sen clintons disclosure form mr clintons spokesman said the former president would only receive remuneration from those two funds if they meet certain investment benchmarks since he hasnt received any monies from them no disclosure is required the spokesman said in the allied matter mr burkle has credited president clinton with persuading mr hoffa to work with yucaipa as a union friendly employer a feat that mr burkle said he couldnt have pulled off on his own teamster and yucaipa officials say that in mr clinton suggested to mr hoffa that he look to yucaipa if any companies employing teamsters got into financial trouble asked about mr clintons role in the allied matter the former presidents spokesman said that mr clinton believes in doing business "in a labor friendly way" and makes the case for that approach "whenever it is appropriate " the yucaipa spokesman added that "yucaipa has enjoyed positive relationships with the teamsters for over a decade" in connection with successful investments in companies that employed members of the union "this past experience was a major factor in the unions decision to work with yucaipa" on allied he says allied filed for bankruptcy protection in blaming domestic auto woes rising fuel costs high debt and a costly teamsters labor contract in its most recent earnings report filed with the securities and exchange commission allied reported a net loss of &# million on revenue of &# million for the nine months ended sept early last year yucaipa purchased about &# million of allieds debt outstanding allied allowed yucaipa to assist the company in talks seeking contract concessions from the teamsters those talks dragged on for months "we were getting conflicting proposals from yucaipa and the company " recalls fred zuckerman director the teamsterss car haul division "we didnt know who we were negotiating with " in early january allied asked yucaipa to leave the negotiations he says allied officials declined to be interviewed in court filings yucaipa said it was only trying to help in the negotiations in early february allied asked the bankruptcy court to void its teamsters contract which could have paved the way for the company to cut union workers wages the teamsters warned that such a move would trigger a strike at that point yucaipa began negotiating with the teamsters on its own the teamsterss mr zuckerman said he had never before renegotiated a contract with someone who wasnt a party to the deal but yucaipa proposed smaller wage cuts than the company had been seeking because of the number of teamsters involved and the size of the concessions mr hoffa "was very much involved" in the allied talks "on a day to day basis " said mr zuckerman after reaching agreement with the union yucaipa told allied that if the company didnt support its new recovery plan it would stop backing managements reorganization effort say people familiar with the matter allied signed on critics contend yucaipa and teamster leadership improperly manipulated the process they kept the labor talks going until after mr hoffas successful re election as union president in november hawk opportunity fund alleges in its recent lawsuit though mr hoffa easily won re election to a third term his opponent accused him of not doing enough to protect members wages and benefits three of allieds directors members of the companys founding rutland family and owners of about of the allieds stock are among the yucaipa critics in a bankruptcy court filing they accuse yucaipa of negotiating a "secret" deal with the teamsters that "effectively cut off any possibility of success in further negotiations" between the company and the union the wage cut at allied could open the door to a similar demand from other car haulers says a recent letter from teamsters for a democratic union a group critical of mr hoffas administration teamsters officials say they had no secret arrangement with yucaipa and agreed to the wage concession only because it was the best deal they could get for members yucaipa in a filing with the bankruptcy court said it acted properly to break an "impasse" that could have led to the shutdown of allieds operations recently teamster members narrowly approved the proposed pay cut and some members of the competing investor groups recently agreed to drop opposition to the yucaipa plan in return for cash and possible equity in the reorganized allied the allied reorganization plan backed by yucaipa still needs bankruptcy court approval
