the informed patient shining a light on a deadly lung disorder recovering from a heart attack and fighting pneumonia frank miller a year old vietnam veteran was transferred from a va hospital to the university of kansas medical center in kansas city kan to be evaluated for surgery to repair his blocked arteries wheezing and coughing badly he learned he had another deadly ailment that would require treatment first chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mr miller a retired long haul trucker who had given up smoking more than a decade ago is one of an estimated million americans with copd half of whom remain undiagnosed according to the national institutes of healths national heart lung and blood institute along with a number of nonprofit groups and medical specialty societies the nhlbi is leading a new campaign to raise awareness of copd the aim is to encourage people over who may be at risk to get a simple breathing test and talk to their doctors about treatments that can slow or even reverse its course including medications and lifestyle changes such as exercise and quitting smoking copd is an umbrella term for lung diseases that inflame airways obstruct breathing and trap bad air in the lungs including emphysema and chronic bronchitis its hardly a new disease but its prevalence has been rising steadily while other major causes of death have been decreasing the increase is due largely to the fact that people are living longer and developing the disease as they age but it is also rising in younger people and women who are experiencing the long term ravages of smoking even years after they quit as well as exposure to second hand smoke and other pollutants most americans have never heard of copd surveys show and many doctors dont follow the guidelines for testing and diagnosis physicians and patients alike may dismiss symptoms such as shortness of breath fatigue and chronic coughing as a sign of aging or attribute them to other diseases copd is often linked to including heart disease and lung cancer globally copd is the fifth largest cause of death in the u s it is the fourth ranked killer behind heart disease cancer and stroke and is projected to move to third place by the total annual cost is estimated at close to &# billion annually including &# billion in direct medical costs former smokers may believe they are out of the woods because they quit but nearly half of copd patients are former smokers rather than current smokers according to amy pianalto project director of the nhblis "learn more breathe better" awareness campaign www learnaboutcopd org which is sponsoring radio and print ads and offers materials for both doctors and patients second hand smoke air pollution and workplace exposure to pollutants like chemicals dust and fumes can also trigger the disease an estimated americans also have a genetic disorder known as alpha antitrypsin or aat deficiency that makes them susceptible even without any kind of exposure "there are million people in this country who are coughing and cant breathe who dont know they have copd " says molly mcguire administrator of the nonprofit copd foundation copdfoundation org "it has been a slow process getting everyone connected to resources " the copd foundation in partnership with the american association of respiratory therapists is sending a mobile testing unit to a number of cities across the country offering free spirometry a lung function test that measures the amount of air a person can breathe out and the time it takes to do so even though hand held versions of the device can cost as little as &# to &# and it is considered the gold standard for an initial diagnosis of copd the copd foundation says that close to of primary care doctors dont have spirometers in their practice among those who do have the devices a third dont use them routinely even though medicare and most private insurers cover the use of spirometry when copd is suspected "though wed like to believe everyone is following the standard of care and is up to date on the guidelines there are millions of patients in rural areas and small towns where it is difficult for the general practitioners to keep up with everything " says frank quijano a pulmonary and critical care physician at the university of kansas who treated mr millers copd there are several drugs commonly used to treat copd which though incurable can be prevented from worsening many drugs come in the form of puffers or inhalers among the most commonly used are tiotropium known by the brand name spiriva which dilates the bronchial tubes and a combination of the steroid drugs fluticasone and salmeterol known by the brand name advair which can also fight inflammation while a host of new treatments and drug dosages are being studied in large scale trials there has as yet been no major breakthrough a study in the may issue of the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine found that a promising anti inflammatory drug infliximab failed to improve symptoms of moderate to severe copd moreover because the conditions of copd patients can often worsen dramatically it has been difficult to conduct conclusive research in one large study known as the towards a revolution in copd health trial or more of the subjects didnt continue to receive the assigned treatment throughout the study because they either died dropped out or sought other treatment according to an american lung association survey about half of copd patients say their condition limits their ability to work sleep do household chores and enjoy social and family activities while say it limits them in normal physical exertion mr miller for example has found it hard to exert himself and his hospitalizations have forced him to miss out on a treasured pastime riding his three wheeled "trike" motorcycle with the patriot guard a group that escorts military funerals though oxygen therapy and surgery to reduce the size of the lungs can help prolong the life of severely ill copd patients at present half die within years of diagnosis a toll experts say could be sharply reduced if patients are diagnosed and treated early the national committee for quality assurance which accredits health plans is pressuring plans to encourage doctors to conduct screening for copd and the center for medicare and medicaid services is evaluating whether it can cover rehabilitation services according to steve phurrough director of the coverage and analysis group for patients like mr miller who suffer from other diseases along with copd proper treatment can dramatically improve the quality of life his doctors at the university of kansas treated his lungs with inhaled breathing treatments and antibiotics and rather than perform open heart surgery that would have required a ventilator that might have done more damage to the airways they performed angioplasty to open his blocked arteries for now the copd is under control says dr quijano "he walked out of here ready to ride his motorcycle " email informedpatient wsj com
