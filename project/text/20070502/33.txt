doubleclick chief talks about google trends in industry questions for david rosenblatt company doubleclick title ceo doubleclick inc a high profile dot com name during the late s was back in the news last month after google inc agreed to pay &# billion for the online advertising firm it has been a long and winding road for doubleclick which faded from the spotlight after the dot com bubble burst and was acquired by san francisco private equity firm hellman &amp friedman llc for about &# billion in since then doubleclick has sold its email marketing services and data management and analytical units to focus on the ad serving market now many web publishers and advertisers depend on doubleclicks services to insert and deliver ads google plans to combine doubleclicks ad services with googles advertising platform google says the deal will create tools to target serve and analyze online ads of all types but rivals of the web behemoth say the deal gives google too much clout over the online advertising market while digital privacy advocates worry about too much consumer data being in the hands of one company doubleclick chief executive david rosenblatt years old joined the company in he speaks below about the deal and other trends in the industry wall street journal can you reassure web publishers who rely on google for ad revenue and traffic but worry about googles increase in market power mr rosenblatt i cant speak on behalf of google since were not owned by them yet but google shares revenue with publishers so it makes sense that their interests are pretty well aligned wsj digital privacy advocates have raised concerns about the google doubleclick merger saying neither company has taken steps to safeguard the data it collects about consumers internet behavior how do you intend to respond going forward mr rosenblatt ad serving information collected by doubleclick and this is a really important point has always been the property of our clients not us and so a change of ownership of doubleclick will not change the terms of those contracts so we are very comfortable with our current policy wsj some say the ad serving that doubleclick does would be an obvious complement to googles push to sell more graphical and video advertising what does it take to implement more graphical and video advertising mr rosenblatt in general video advertising as a trend is pretty firmly in motion in spite of that though it is still very small there are somewhere between half a million and a million search advertisers in the market there are probably only a couple to five thousand graphical advertisers and probably less than a hundred video advertisers there is no reason for that imbalance to exist so one of our goals is to increase efficiencies with which people buy and sell video advertising and democratize access to the process in the same way that google has democratized access to the search market it is going to be easier to buy video advertising and therefore many more people are going to do it wsj what is getting in the way now mr rosenblatt many of the tools to produce and track and measure video advertising are still extremely immature for example there are a lot of systems in place for graphical advertising to both collect data and also monetize the advertising so that it gets the highest response rate from customers many of these things are just not possible today for video advertising wsj for example mr rosenblatt it is not possible to dynamically switch ad content in ads that run before online videos in response to user response on a large scale that is an example of something i think will broaden the market it is still very difficult to create the video ads themselves thats another thing that i think will become easier wsj what else do you see advertisers hungry for mr rosenblatt advertisers are interested in two things one is increasing the efficiency of their media buys it still costs too much to spend money online compared to offline for example every part of the process is still not as efficient everything from tracking measurement across thousands of web sites collecting all of those forms of data billings physically trafficking ad units out to publishers all of those sorts of things are still too manual the second thing advertisers are looking for is measuring the efficacy of their media so i think we as an industry have done a good job of perfecting that measurement within specific channels like search or within graphical but not as much between them if you have &# to spend and you have a certain goal for your advertising you should be neutral between spending that on graphical on video on search media let alone between the internet and offline channels but in order to make that decision you need tools to help you measure the relative efficacies and those dont really exist yet wsj what does the google doubleclick deal mean for advertisers and publishers what differences will they see mr rosenblatt interestingly the search part of online advertising was very small in compared to what it is today one of the reasons it grew so much was because google and yahoo and others were able to create levels of access and efficiency within that market that hadnt been there before if we can do the same thing with display there is no reason why it wouldnt have a comparable effect with those graphical and video ad models
