the evening wrap lonely olmert online edition prime minister ehud olmert may be feeling alone in his perch atop the israeli government as prominent members of his own party join a growing chorus of voices urging him to climb down calls for the israeli leaders resignation have gained in volume and intensity in the two days since a sharply worded report took mr olmert and other officials to task for what it deemed a botched war against hezbollah forces in lebanon last summer israel launched the fight after hezbollah fighters crept across the border and kidnapped two israeli soldiers with mr olmert vowing to wipe out the terror group which also rained rocket attacks on northern israeli towns and bring the abducted soldier home but the war failed to accomplish either of its stated goals while exacting a heavy toll in blood over the course of the day conflict hezbollah hurled some rockets into israel killing while israel conducted a punishing campaign of airstrikes that killed more than combatants and civilians according to lebanons government the fighting was ended without securing release of the israeli soldiers and hezbollah appears to have flourished winning new supporters by claiming that it had defeated israel leader hassan nasrallah commented on the war report today saying that has "finally and officially decided the issue of victory and defeat " in light of the findings israeli foreign minister tzipi livni a member of mr olmerts kadima party and a rising superstar in the countrys politics called on the prime minister to step down ms livni who said she has no plans to leave the government herself said she told mr olmert that "resignation would be the right thing for him to do " and that she would run for the top post in the kadima party when it holds its next primary a date for the primary hasnt yet been set "its not a personal matter between me and the prime minister this issue is more important than both of us " ms livni said adding to the immense pressure that is bearing down on mr olmert kadima parliamentary leader avigdor yitzhaki said the prime minister should "act responsibly" and resign and then promptly stepped down from his own position in protest under kadima rules mr olmert cannot be ousted only persuaded to leave of his own accord israels parliament could force him from power with a no confidence vote though it appeared that there wasnt yet a majority willing to support such a measure polls published in israeli newspapers showed that anywhere between two thirds and three quarters of respondents wished to see mr olmert depart so far however the prime minister is trying to ride out the political squall mr olmert acknowledged his responsibility for the "serious failure" laid out in the report but on his way to an emergency meeting with his cabinet today he said "to those who are eager to take advantage of this report to reap certain political advantages i suggest slow down " but the furor appears to be gaining the kind of speed that will make it harder and harder to control defense minister amir peretz was also said to be considering resigning and if the labor party member leaves it could precipitate the collapse of israels coalition government but whatever the consequences for mr olmert or kadima or labor the crisiss ultimate impact on the peace process may prove its most lasting legacy mr olmert had agreed to hold regular talks with palestinian president mahmoud abbas and should he retain his grip on power the erosion of his support would likely give him little leeway to strike any major peace agreements

among honeybees is at least at this time one of natures greatest mysteries more than a quarter of americas bees have gone missing thanks to a phenomenon that scientists have named colony collapse disorder and nobody is quite sure why it has happened but theories about the cause of the bees disappearance abound and some of them have brought smiles to the faces of entomologists amid a crisis that is no laughing matter may berenbaum tells the associated press that some callers have suggested to her that bees have been called to heaven in a kind of bee rapture while others blame a quirk in the planets magnetic field ms berenbaum says she even unearthed a parody news article where she herself was quoted as blaming the whole mess on bad rapper extraordinaire kevin federline his ear puncturing concerts having apparently driven the bees into such a state that they were simply left with no alternative but to buzz off the outlandish theories are easily laughed off of course but some other plausible seeming scenarios have shown more staying power to the irritation of scientists for example that idea that wireless phones have messed with bees navigational intuition its baloney says
