making news murdochs surprise bid &# billion for dow jones high premium offer spotlights the family that controls publisher rupert murdochs surprise &# billion bid for dow jones &amp co could put into play one of the nations last family controlled newspaper companies raising the possibility of other bidders from media companies to financial buyers to internet giants news corp s bid of &# a share in cash or a combination of cash and stock is pitched at a price roughly above the recent market value of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal and a number of financial information businesses the offer puts a large premium on the publisher at a time when most newspaper companies are losing readers and advertisers to the internet a recent auction of tribune co which owns the chicago tribune los angeles times and television stations failed to drum up much interest before tribune agreed to be taken over by investor sam zell the offer from news corp which mr murdoch leads faces obstacles dow joness controlling shareholders the bancroft family who own of shares outstanding but hold of the voting power thanks to a dual share class structure first heard of the offer weeks ago they didnt immediately rebuff it as they have past overtures but yesterday dow jones said it had been told by a bancroft representative that family members and their trusts "constituting slightly more than of the outstanding voting power of dow jones" would vote against the offer the statement indicates that those in opposition represent about of the bancrofts voting power while the bancrofts have the power to block any deal thanks to supervoting "b" shares that carry times the voting power of "a" shares the family also is now far flung and comprises at least members more than two thirds of the class a shares changed hands yesterday likely putting many in the hands of merger arbitrageurs who typically push for a deal mr murdoch who turned last month has long been interested in adding dow jones to his global media empire which dwarfs dow jones in size and includes the fox movie studio and tv networks newspapers on three continents as well as the myspace web site dow jones owns in addition to the journal the barrons weekly investment newspaper dow jones newswires the factiva news and information database service wsj com the marketwatch web site and a chain of community newspapers it holds of smartmoney magazine the conservative slant of the journals editorial page is believed to jibe with mr murdochs own views while its business purview is close to his heart a deal also could eventually help news corp s planned new fox business news channel which is due to launch later this year taking on nbc universals cnbc however a cnbc content sharing arrangement with the journal under which journal staffers appear on the air doesnt expire until dow jones stock soared on the news closing at &# up &# or it was the highest close since may yet still off more than &# from a high of &# in june several other stocks in the depressed newspaper industry also rose news corp shares fell &# or to &# in a statement yesterday dow jones said its board and members of the bancroft family were "evaluating the proposal " news corp said that its proposal was a "friendly offer and that we believe the wall street journal is one of the worlds great newspapers with the best digital presence " the journal with a circulation of million is the nations largest financial daily and the second largest newspaper overall after usa today mr murdochs bid promises to raise questions about whether the journal would retain its editorial independence under his ownership mr murdoch has tended to put a strong personal imprint on papers he owns from the feisty tabloid new york post to papers in britain and australia he is known for phoning editors and even reporters about individual stories the posts media and business sections sometimes delight in skewering rivals and mr murdochs political preferences have been clear in the news pages as well as the editorial page similarly news corp s fox news cable channel despite its slogan "fair and balanced " is considered by many liberals to pursue a conservative agenda in its news coverage as well as its editorial opinions a news corp spokesman declined to comment on the issue of editorial independence in an interview on fox news yesterday mr murdoch praised the bancroft family that controls dow jones saying "this family has done a fantastic job as the guardians of this newspaper and its editorial traditions which were laid down by the great bernard kilgore a former journal managing editor and dow jones ceo and we realize that the family although not personally involved have been great guardians and we respect that " the offer could spark rival bids companies that investors mentioned yesterday as possibly interested included washington post co new york times co google inc microsoft corp and bloomberg lp however the offer carries such a high premium over the prior stock price that it could be hard for other media buyers or private equity groups to top cnbc owner general electric co for instance was also mentioned by some yesterday but ge chief jeffrey immelt said he wasnt interested "its too difficult a time for the industry " washington post co which has a content sharing deal with dow jones declined to comment as did new york times co a spokeswoman for bloomberg said it isnt interested in pursuing dow jones "at this time " the offer came in a letter signed by mr murdoch and delivered by an allen &amp co investment banker nancy peretsman it was addressed to m peter mcpherson an independent dow jones director as he was about to take over the chairmanship from longtime dow jones chairman and former chief executive peter r kann the letter was dated the day before dow joness april annual meeting members of the bancroft family met later that week and didnt immediately reject the proposal a person close to the company said that while dow jones has received overtures in the past none at least in recent history contained a specific value for the company as this one did mr murdoch struck a conciliatory tone in the letter complimenting dow jones and its management while attempting to ease any apprehension about the prospect of news corp taking control and on fox news mr murdoch said "we are a family company too " the vision he laid out in the letter was one in which dow joness content would feed news corp s nascent tv business channel while also pumping through the rest of its extensive media properties around the globe the letter made no mention of cost cuts and suggested that news corp was prepared to put significant capital into the company financial news mr murdoch wrote was the fastest growing segment of "an otherwise languishing publishing industry " he noted that he understood "the challenges of transitioning into a digital future " while saying he wanted to extend dow joness print and online businesses across the u s and abroad combining the two companies would provide "a digital platform upon which dow jones management and employees can build " he said of particular note mr murdochs letter said he was prepared to structure a deal in a number of different ways they could include the issuing of class a news corp shares a new class of convertible shares in news corp or potentially another security that would be issued on a tax free basis that would pay out an attractive dividend mr murdoch said his companys board had endorsed the offer "enthusiastically " he offered to set up safeguards to ensure the journals editorial independence through for instance creation of a separate board dow joness board said it would bring up the matter with the bancrofts and responded to mr murdoch friday a dow jones board meeting was scheduled for today theres been a longstanding wall street perception that a buyer of dow jones would have to at least meet "the hammer price " a reference to longtime former bancroft family lawyer roy hammer that price is &# per share according to one wall street banker familiar with past discussions during mr hammers tenure he rebuffed offers from the new york times and washington post companies says a person close to the family michael elefante now the bancroft familys lawyer declined to comment spanning many generations and factions the bancrofts are a diverse group with varied interests and political beliefs the family is descended from jessie waldron the wife of clarence barron who bought dow jones for &# in largely with his wifes money the couple passed their shares on to jessie waldrons two daughters since then the family has stood solidly behind keeping the company independent in the late s family members elisabeth goth and her cousin william c cox iii pushed the company to make changes in its board and business practices and helped prod the company to sell its dow jones markets unit formerly known as telerate the two were advised during this period by ms peretsman the allen &amp co banker involved in the current news corp offer other family members now have joined in being impatient with dow joness performance according to people familiar with the matter though they remain less than a majority yesterday ms goth didnt return calls and mr cox couldnt be reached no family members have management roles at dow jones a person close to the family said its members are more divided than in the past over the past two decades they have radically reduced their stake since when dow jones introduced the dual class share structure the family has cut its overall equity holding to the current from raising roughly &# billion in the process two years ago dow jones shareholders approved changes to the companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws to allow the bancroft family to reduce their ownership of supervoting stock without threatening their control last year a trust established by jane bancroft cook adopted a plan to sell as many as shares a day for months although the stock would be sold only if the market price of dow jones rose above &# the family now owns just more than four million class a shares and million of the supervoting class b shares the bid comes at a critical time for the industry when the defection of readers and advertisers to the internet has sharply eroded newspaper profits and raised doubts about the long term future in the past year two newspaper empires knight ridder inc and tribune have put themselves on the market after pressure from restive shareholders knight ridder ended up being bought by mcclatchy co while tribune agreed to go private in an &# billion transaction led by mr zell mr murdoch inherited a single newspaper in adelaide australia in the mid s he acquired or started a string of papers in australia and britain before moving to the u s in the early s he bought the new york post new yorks village voice the boston herald the chicago sun times and the express and the news in san antonio which he merged he eventually discarded most of these u s titles after expanding into television and film in the s later moving into satellite television his television properties circled the globe from england to china having sold the post to comply with tv cross ownership rules after he bought a new york station he won a waiver of those rules in and repurchased the new york paper as it teetered near bankruptcy the independent association of publishers employees a union that represents many dow jones employees said the companys staff opposed a news corp deal "from top to bottom " the union currently is working without a contract and negotiating a new one a dow jones acquisition could raise investor concerns that the publishers anemic growth could be a drag on news corp but mr murdoch has never been one to hew too slavishly to shareholder views his family controls news corp through a voting stake set to rise to about as a result of an asset swap with liberty media corp that gives mr murdochs company control of libertys voting stake in news corp mr murdoch timed his bid at a critical crossroads for dow jones he sent the letter just before mr kann stepped down as chairman and just before the company named marcus brauchli to succeed veteran managing editor paul e steiger at the journal since early last year dow joness chief executive has been richard f zannino who joined the company as chief financial officer in and became chief operating officer the next year mr murdoch acknowledged problems facing the newspaper industry in the interview with his fox news channel but he said that the "great thing and the value of financial journalism is that you can charge for it " observing that the journal and pearson plcs financial times "are the only two newspapers in the world that charge for their online editions " asked about reports the bancroft family was leaning against a deal he said "i dont know whether the whole family has been consulted yet" and added he hoped the family "will take it calmly and think about it " mr murdoch said he hadnt had a direct response from the family "other than that theyre pursuing the matter" and said he expected to have a meeting "sometime in the next two or three weeks " mr murdoch said he hoped that "with more resources " news corp could help boost the journals circulation matthew karnitschnig and stephanie kang contributed to this article
