than a couple of front running fist pumps and a few die hard sneers " after dallas built a huge lead then squandered it mr nowitzki was mentally agile on his shot to narrow golden states lead to three he dodged one defender then checked that his feet remained behind the three point line before launching now he and the mavs will try to follow the lead of their conquerors last june the miami heat who turned a late comeback down in the series by a two game margin into the start of an unlikely series win but the heat didnt have to play at the arena in oakland where crowds were deafening in the
