comrades in arms fight to preserve afghan monument two u s sergeants found ruins dear to soviet fliers the dead of an earlier war bagram airfield afghanistan when vyacheslav fedchenko dreams about his friends they are once again strong and brave and young the pride of the soviet air force when he wakes though he remembers how they met their end in afghanistan years ago their planes engulfed in flames as they plummeted to the ground or slammed into mountainsides during the year war between the soviet union and mujahedeen rebels armed by the u s "i still miss them " says mr fedchenko now a year old pensioner in the siberian city of barnaul "they were the best friends ive ever had " every year on the anniversaries of their deaths he visits a barnaul cemetery where one of his comrades is buried to honor the lost members of his squadron its the best he can do their real memorial is miles away crumbling and surrounded by land mines in a forgotten corner of bagram airfield the giant american military base outside kabul but today thanks to two u s air force sergeants fighting another afghan war the soviet pilots memorial is on the verge of returning to russian hands the americans tech sgts david keeley and raymond ross both stumbled across the memorial by accident last summer airborne combat engineers and amateur historians they were exploring old soviet bunkers at the end of bagrams runway they noticed a u shaped concrete wall that swept skyward as it curled and leaning against it a concrete slab with empty rectangular spaces the sergeants thought the walls shape suggested aviation and the blank spots a place for pictures or plaques that night they found a trove of web sites dedicated to soviet planes and pilots sgt keeley from carrollton ill had taught himself a little russian in the s at the time he figured a clash with the soviets was inevitable eventually he and sgt ross from lafayette la got in email contact with mr fedchenko who filled them in on the history of the bagram memorial in with bodies already coming home from the year old afghan war mr fedchenko enrolled in the air force aviation school in barnaul where he befriended first lts konstantin pavlyukov vladimir paltusov and victor zemlyakov lt paltusov boyishly handsome was a late bloomer who had to fight to have the height requirements waived lt zemlyakov was a bit of a rebel listening to underground russian folk music the beatles and deep purple the airmen were barred from drinking they devoted themselves instead to studying skiing and smoking after graduation in the men joined other pilots in a new squadron of sukhoi su ground attack planes nicknamed rooks after the crowlike birds on oct the squadron arrived in afghanistan where its job to protect the infantry from the mujahedeen was becoming increasingly dangerous with the spread of american shoulder fired stinger antiaircraft missiles over the course of a one year combat tour the squadron lost of its planes and five of its pilots first to die was first lt igor aleshin whose jet was damaged by ground fire and plowed into a mountainside next was lt pavlyukov mr fedchenko watched as a stinger missile hit his classmates plane lt pavlyukov bailed out and fought off the mujahedeen as long as he could as his enemies closed in he used his last hand grenade on himself capt miroslav buraks plane exploded shortly after takeoff the others were never sure whether a stinger had found him or an insurgent had sabotaged his plane lt paltusov corkscrewed to earth on july his th birthday apparently unconscious after mujahedeen rounds destroyed his oxygen system in august with the end of their tour in sight the other airmen let themselves hope that lt paltusovs death would be the last and decided to build a memorial to their fallen comrades the squadron whose members included engineers and architects held a design competition the winning design featured the curved wall at the top of which was a hand carved wooden model of an su rook roaring into the sky the slab initially held four oil on wood pictures of the pilots painted by a paratrooper with a flair for portraiture below each was a plaque with the pilots name his rank and the dates of his birth and death in front was a fence whose posts were the nose cones of bombs linked by a chain of machine gun ammunition belts the manual labor was supplied by maintenance crews political commissars and pilots including mr fedchenko and lt zemlyakov when lt zemlyakov was shot down in september while protecting a convoy of fuel trucks the other airmen extended the slab to make space for his portrait on the curved wall they placed large letters that read "your name is internationalist and your heroism is immortal " it referred mr fedchenko recalls to their sense of purpose "the duty of the soviet forces was an international duty to help the afghan people " he says that mission however came to an ignominious end in february when the soviets retreated from afghanistan before they left the airmen stripped the portraits from the memorial to prevent them from falling into enemy hands mr fedchenko thinks theyre now stored at an air base in the former soviet republic of belarus by the time sgts keeley and ross discovered the monument someone had pried off the wooden airplane a deep crack had formed in the slab and the ammunition belt fence had been scattered sgt keeley collected the links and stored them in an ammunition box with american commanders considering runway expansions at bagram the sergeants became consumed with the idea of protecting the memorial they decorated their hooch in black and white photos sent by mr fedchenko of soviet pilots in their flight suits ready for combat or in east bloc bathing suits playing volleyball on a hot afghan day they learned that lt pavlyukov the pilot who blew himself up rather than be captured had been posthumously named a hero of the soviet union the soviet equivalent of the medal of honor in the u s "they did what their country asked of them and they paid the ultimate price " sgt keeley says of the soviet pilots "it doesnt matter what country they were from it was a part of history and we didnt think it deserved to meet its end at a bulldozers blade " word spread among former soviet pilots that two americans were trying to save their memorial several offered money which the sergeants declined instead the airmen who were to return to the u s last december turned to army national guard sgt tom clark a high school history teacher from dyer ind sgt clark had been out of the military since but at the age of had persuaded the army to take him back he went straight to the officer in charge of base real estate to make his case the efforts generated publicity in russia where the story line was irresistible american sergeants fighting in afghanistan try to save a monument built to honor soviet pilots killed in an earlier afghan war including a hero of the soviet union shot down by an american missile soon diplomats and generals got involved in february russias ambassador to afghanistan toured the site with the top u s air force commander in afghanistan brig gen christopher miller gen miller told the russians that he would protect the memorial from destruction but that its ultimate fate was in the hands of the afghan government which owns bagram a month ago the russians asked the afghans for permission to move the slab section of the memorial to their kabul embassy to be restored and displayed the russians are still awaiting a response from the afghans mr fedchenko survived a second combat tour in afghanistan and retired a major years ago he now lives on income from construction jobs and a &# a month military pension he says that his anger at the afghan fighters and their american supporters has softened over time even as his sense of loss lingers "there were a lot of american planes shot down in vietnam by russian missiles " he says "in afghanistan a lot of russian planes and helicopters were shot down by american missiles i dont take it personally its politics " for sgts keeley and ross he feels only respect and gratitude "it doesnt have anything to do with being american or russian its about being a soldier every true soldier has a lot of respect for other soldiers even if its an enemy soldier "
