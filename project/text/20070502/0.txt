a hard lesson in derivatives some learn timing of subprime bets wasnt so prime placing the right bet is only half the battle the other half is making sure one can cash out at the opportune time nowhere has this become more apparent than in the opaque market for derivatives based on bonds backed by subprime mortgages those who rushed into this market earlier this year are learning that being right isnt good enough as they struggle to cash in on trades that are profitable only on paper investors such as macro hedge funds hit the bulls eye with their bet that the cost of protecting mortgage bonds against default would rise as borrowers with patchy credit struggled to meet their monthly payments they bought such protection enthusiastically by entering into a privately negotiated derivative contract but they underestimated the sticky nature of these derivatives known as single name asset backed default swaps that can trade infrequently due to the complexities of valuing them "it looks like a great trade but it isnt a profit if you cant get out " said scott simon who oversees &# billion in mortgage and asset backed securities at pimco a newport beach calif fund manager pimco is a unit of munich based insurer allianz se "investors had a naive belief in liquidity thinking just because you buy it you can sell it " mr simon said the result is a growing divergence between the price at which investors are willing to unload their derivative contracts and the price they are actually being offered these asset backed default swaps protect the contract buyer against a possible default on the underlying pool of home loans "liquidity in this market was so bad " mr simon said "the person who thought this was like trading equity note futures is extremely angry " still theres little scope for finger pointing since investors frustrated at not being able to cash out on their hefty paper profits should have better understood that this corner of the financial markets is known for its sluggish trading market participants said "the trade was between consenting adults " mr simon said bond prices decline yield at government bond prices sank as a glowing april
