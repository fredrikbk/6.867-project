common sense it may be tempting to buy now but wait smartmoney i never root for the market to go down im not a bear by nature and im always more invested than not so why did i feel a slight twinge of relief monday when the dow jones industrial average actually dropped the dow average had only declined in two of the preceding trading days a streak not seen since according to barrons however pleasant this has been for those who are fully invested and check their portfolios every day the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the great depression isnt a year id want to emulate i dont see any real danger of that but the lack of sellers the complacency in the market the anxiety of buyers who feel they must get in now because the market is only going up all of this is making me queasy repeat after me markets do not go straight up ive had to remind people of this in recent years with respect to real estate oil and now stocks this isnt a bad thing as investors we dont want markets to rise constantly if they did there would be no risk and without risk real returns would shrink to zero i have been experiencing some of the emotions of the rising market myself this isnt because the nasdaq composite hit my selling target last week and i raised some cash i dont purport to be able to pinpoint market tops and bottoms and im not looking for vindication in a falling market indeed since i sell after a rally and the average rally since has been i expect the nasdaq to reach another selling target half the time in any event im still better off in a rising market because i only shift about of my investment assets into cash this time however i am looking to buy the "ten stocks for the next ten years " which are the subject of my cover story in the may issue of smartmoney ive been waiting until readers have had plenty of time to make their own purchases but since we hit a selling threshold in the meantime ive raised the cash to buy them now im ready to spend but i never buy stocks when the market hits a new all time high i dont even like to buy on a day when the market rises i like to buy into rampant pessimism you can imagine where thats left me lately on the sidelines its been tempting to throw money at this relentlessly rising market since the issue went to press my new stocks have gained nearly double the rise in the s&amp p stock index ive had to get a very firm grip and remind myself that there will be another correction or at least a significant buying opportunity as there was as recently as february for an investment horizon of years a gain is insignificant patience is an underrated virtue in investing one that im cultivating at the moment at the same time im enjoying the rally and its effect on the value of my portfolio like most good things it wont last forever james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
