murdochs bid underscores his attraction to business news in the digital age for several months wall street has been wondering what news corp chairman rupert murdochs next big deal would be after resolving a longstanding stalemate with liberty media corp late last year news corp has been positioned to go back on the acquisition trail some investors speculated a big internet purchase was on the way while mr murdoch had long been interested in buying dow jones &amp co over the years few expected a move back into newspapers but that is precisely what mr murdoch is planning news corp confirmed yesterday it had made a &# billion friendly bid for dow jones parent of the wall street journal the bid showed that mr murdoch years old hasnt lost his taste for newspapers the sector on which he built his media empire even if his interest in the journal is as much for its online presence as its print business the size of the offer above dow joness market price at mondays close is also vintage rupert murdoch the news corp chairman has repeatedly shown a willingness to pay a big price to get an asset he covets in this case he would deepen his exposure to an industry in increasingly troublesome straits as readers and advertisers defect to the web that appetite for risk is what transformed mr murdoch from an obscure australian newspaper proprietor into one of the great media moguls of the past years relying heavily on borrowed money mr murdoch hopscotched across the world buying newspapers tv stations a film studio satellite tv systems often to dispose of them a few years later that formula almost led to disaster in the early s when news corp s heavy debt levels combined with losses on his british satellite start up and a credit crunch almost sent the company under but it survived after refinancing its debt news corp has taken a more conservative approach to borrowing money despite his age mr murdochs famously high energy level shows no signs of flagging but the question of who succeeds him hangs over the company he has said he wants one of his children to succeed him but two of his older children elisabeth and lachlan have both quit jobs with the empire in recent years currently the only one of mr murdochs children working in the news corp empire is his son james chief executive of bskyb mr murdochs relations with his older children by a previous marriage were strained a couple of years ago over his proposal that his two young children by wendi murdoch be allowed to share in control of the familys news corp stake mr murdoch later backed off his proposal although he has said his two younger children will share in the financial benefits of the news corp shareholding for investors the dow jones offer is sure to raise questions about mr murdochs strategic direction as news corp expanded into film television satellite tv and the web in recent years acquiring properties from twentieth century fox to myspace and starting the fox network its newspapers have dwindled in importance with well known names like the london sun and times the australian and the unprofitable new york post the newspaper division accounted for only of news corp s operating income last year buying dow jones wouldnt dramatically boost the share contributed by newspapers but it would raise the divisions profile in the u s given the newspaper industrys slow growth rate however investors may be concerned "we fear that news corp despite the fastest growth in the industry will begin to trade at a discount to growth rates as investors worry about future investment decisions " said sanford c bernstein analyst michael nathanson "this action will undoubtedly upset some investors " such nervousness was on display yesterday as news corp s stock price fell or &# to &# in new york stock exchange composite trading anticipating such concerns people close to news corp emphasized the digital business opportunities of dow jones mr murdoch has been particularly vocal in the past couple of years about the newspaper industrys need to adjust to the internet in fact news executives across the news corp empire will meet in monterey calif this week to discuss online strategies people familiar with the event said in an interview on fox news channel mr murdoch acknowledged that "young people are reading newspapers less" but said financial journalism has advantages over other forms of news on the web "you can charge for it " the journal and pearson plcs financial times "are the only two newspapers in the world that charge for their online editions " he said investors may also be mollified by the relatively small cost of the deal for news corp whose market capitalization is about &# billion news corp has a healthy balance sheet which will be enhanced by the pending deal with liberty in which news corp is trading its stake in directv in exchange for libertys shareholding in news moodys investor services a credit rating firm said that even if news corp funded the &# billion purchase entirely with debt it wouldnt affect the companys debt rating leaving news corp the breathing room to do an internet deal
