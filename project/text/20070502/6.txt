best of the law blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms law blog firms choice of plaintiff gives judge a bad reaction a federal judge in san francisco ruled last week that the conduct of plaintiffs lawyers in a case brought against a vacuum cleaner company wasnt squeaky clean u s district court judge marilyn hall patel declined to grant class action status to a lawsuit brought against oreck direct llc of new orleans saying "the conduct in this action does not look good does not sound good and does not smell good in fact it reeks " judge patel was none too pleased with the way in which westrup klick llp found a lead plaintiff for its lawsuit she ticked off her findings the plaintiff acknowledges he became involved in the lawsuit by responding to a newspaper advertisement by westrup klick the plaintiff said the lawyers told him "they were going to have a lawsuit" and were looking for a class representative he met his lawyer for the first time the day before his deposition in this action and he did not read the complaint before it was filed "it is clear from the record that plaintiffs counsel and not plaintiff is the driving force behind this action " wrote the judge "we disagree with the views expressed by judge patel " said lawrence cagney a lawyer at westrup klick based in long beach calif mr cagney added that the firm believes that its continued pursuit of the oreck case will benefit the public class actions let individuals band together to pursue big defendants with more power than they could on their own but critics claim that lawyers rather than plaintiffs often reap the rewards in this case the plaintiff who said he suffered from allergies sued alleging that an oreck air purifier failed to alleviate his symptoms the lawyers had asked to certify a class of more than people this isnt the first time westrup klick has been criticized for its choice of plaintiffs in an appeals court panel disqualified the firm in a class action lawsuit against apple inc citing evidence that "from to westrup klick and another firm had jointly filed class actions in which an attorney from westrup klick or a relative of one of the attorneys was the named plaintiff " bloated billings theres a whole lot of bill padding going on according to a just completed survey by william g ross a professor who focuses on billing ethics at samford universitys cumberland school of law in birmingham ala mr ross polled attorneys from a random sampling of lawyers at firms throughout the country and responded two thirds said they had "specific knowledge" of bill padding a finding virtually identical to one reached by mr ross in a billing survey also of the respondents compared with in admitted that they had sometimes performed unnecessary tasks to bump up their billable output mr ross says that bill padding involves invoicing a client for work never performed or exaggerating the amount of time spent on a matter while unnecessary work is that which "exceeds any marginal utility" to a client several law blog readers werent surprised by mr rosss findings "the amount of unnecessary exaggerated billing that goes on is the lb gorilla that people pretend isnt there " wrote one "but thats what you get when you measure peoples worth in billable hours " others came to the professions defense "if your practice group is busy and you work for good people padding isnt a problem " wrote another "clients are likely to get good results and attorneys are forced to work at a fast pace and think quickly on their feet which is the condition they work best" under judicial zzzzzs while judicial pay and judicial elections have made headlines as threats to an independent judiciary a new study identifies yet another cause for concern judicial sleepiness ronald grunstein a professor in sydney australia specializing in human sleep physiology investigated cases of "judicial sleepiness" around the world his conclusion judges should be more actively monitored for falling asleep on the bench a problem that could have consequences in the courtroom the study is included in the current issue of sleep the official journal of the associated professional sleep societies llc he cites a recent case in new hampshire in which a judicial conduct committee investigated superior court judge patricia coffey after it received complaints that she fell asleep on the bench the judge defended herself telling the committee that she had simply closed her eyes to blink in august the committee found the judge in violation of a judicial conduct code while there was no credible evidence that the judge "was ever asleep as that term is generally understood during the course of a trial or any hearing " there were "instances of nodding off very brief periods of time when judge coffeys eyes would close her head fall forward or to the side or she would appear to be fighting to stay awake " the judge didnt admit to any violation but agreed to be examined by a medical expert and to be subject to random monitoring judge coffey declined to comment for this article "the frequently monotonous and passive aspects of judicial work would increase the propensity to fall asleep in judges exposed to sleep deprivation or who have sleep disorders " writes mr grunstein "clearly judicial sleepiness threatens the integrity of the judicial system " the report hastens to add that other courtroom players most notably jurors "may also be vulnerable to sleepiness " nathan koppel contributed to this article
