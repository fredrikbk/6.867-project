no satisfaction why what you have is never enough we may have life and liberty but the pursuit of happiness isnt going so well as a country we are richer than ever yet surveys show that americans are no happier than they were years ago the key problem we arent very good at figuring out what will make us happy we constantly hanker after fancier cars and fatter paychecks and initially such things boost our happiness but the glow of satisfaction quickly fades and soon were yearning for something else similarly we tell our friends that our kids are our greatest joy research however suggests the arrival of children lowers parents reported happiness as they struggle with the daily stresses involved which raises the obvious question why do we keep striving after these things experts offer two explanations we arent built to be happy rather we are built to survive and reproduce we wouldnt be here today if our ancestors didnt struggle mightily to protect and feed their families the promise of happiness meanwhile is just a trick to jolly us along "this is an incentive scheme for the benefit of our genes " argues boston money manager terry burnham co author of "mean genes " "its a very fundamental trick thats played on us this lure of perpetual bliss " dont like the idea that were hoodwinked by some hard wired set of ancient instincts blame it instead on societal beliefs working hard and raising children may not make us happier but these beliefs keep society functioning and those who embrace them prosper and end up passing these values onto their children were bad at forecasting consider a study by academics daniel kahneman and david schkade they asked university students in the midwest and southern california where they thought someone like themselves would be happier and both groups picked california in large part because of the better weather yet when asked how satisfied they were with their own lives both groups were equally happy "when youre thinking about moving to california youre thinking about the beaches and the weather " says mr schkade a management professor at the university of california at san diego "but you arent thinking about the fact that youll still be spending a lot of time in the grocery store or doing chores people emphasize differences that are easy to observe ahead of time and forget about the similarities " when we predict what will make us happy were also influenced by how we feel today if we buy the weekly groceries just after weve had lunch we will shop much more selectively the downside a few days later we will be staring unhappily into an empty refrigerator maybe most important we fail to anticipate how quickly we will adapt to improvements in our lives we think everything will be wonderful when we move into the bigger house we dont realize that after a few months we will take the extra space for granted experience should help us avoid repeating such mistakes but it doesnt in part because we dont accurately recall how we really felt says harvard psychology professor daniel gilbert author of "stumbling on happiness " one example we work devilishly hard to get that next promotion because were sure it will leave us elated we forget that when we last got promoted it was a bit of a letdown with any luck just knowing we are susceptible to these pitfalls will help but you might also try a reality check prof gilbert says suppose you think you will be happier if you move to a small rural town adopt a child or quit your job and become a high school math teacher dont rely on the opinions of people who live in small towns have adopted kids or become teachers instead spend some time observing these folks and see whether theyre happy becoming a teacher "sounds quite romantic " prof gilbert says "but hanging around high school math teachers may quickly disabuse you of that notion " see related letters "letters to the editor the pursuit of happiness seems to bring the most happiness" wsj may
