day sign up for the e mail here it turns out the big news this morning is about dow jones and its flagship wall street journal newspaper but it is also about the wider field of traditional news organizations and purveyors of good old fashioned journalism however much thats no longer limited to old fashioned means of getting the news to readers rupert murdochs news corp makes its bid for dow jones at an especially turbulent time for the newspaper industry and when investor questions about the dwindling model of family control prompted the washington posts donald graham to defend the new york times ownership structure in the pages of the journal and mr murdoch clearly hoped to overcome the bancroft familys unwillingness to relinquish dow jones with a big offer the &# a share in cash or a combination of cash and stock came in at roughly above the companys recent market value as the journal notes and "puts a large premium on the publisher at a time when most newspaper companies are losing readers and advertisers to the internet " in contrast tribunes recent auction initially failed to garner much interest the news quickly fueled speculation on wall street that the washington post the new york times gannett and even google and yahoo could come up with counterbids as the los angeles times reports but though the dow jones board said it is evaluating the offer the bancroft family "who own of shares outstanding but hold of the voting power thanks to a dual share class structure " as the journal explains doesnt seem on board for now a family representative told dow jones that enough family members and their trusts to constitute more than of voting power were against it still a person close to the family tells the journal that its members who have already significantly reduced their stake "are more divided than in the past " a person close to the dow jones board says that last week a preliminary family count indicated less than half their voting shares opposed the offer and the journal says there was likely "fierce lobbying" between family factions that could have turned the tide meanwhile so many less influential class a dow jones shares traded hands yesterday that many now probably belong to "merger arbitrageurs who typically push for a deal " the journal adds at the end of the day dow jones shares had risen &# or to &# adding to speculation about the chemistry involved were remarks by roy hammer the now retired longtime bancroft family representative who famously suggested two years ago that a &# offer might be considered mr hammer tells new york times columnist joe nocera that he hadnt talked to any bancrofts or anyone in dow jones management about the offer but that "both he and the majority of the family have long harbored a deep dislike for the way mr murdoch runs his newspapers " mr nocera writes "and they have long believed that turning the paper over to him even at such a substantial premium would be a betrayal of the wall street journals glorious heritage as a great and serious newspaper which theyve owned for over years " for quite some time mr murdoch has made no secret that he "openly lusted" for the journal as mr nocera puts it and the reasons seem to be growing he is about to launch a fox business news cable channel that would profit from adding the journals brand name as the financial times notes and would surely like to see that brand taken away from current journal partner and future fox rival cnbc the journal notes its own editorial pages conservative slant is thought to "jibe" with mr murdochs political views and as more and more print advertising migrates to the web the online journal marketwatch and a soon to be launched personal finance joint venture with barry dillers iac are among dow jones internet media that add to the companys attraction businessweek points out they would seem complementary to a stable that currently includes the likes of fox news the new york post "american idol" and myspace as the los angeles times says and this would seem to highlight what makes mr murdochs bid a front page story this morning across so many print and online media for all the democratic and clearly lucrative allure of myspace and blogs and an environment that makes "you" time magazines person of the year the offer is affirmation of a model in which traditional information gathering and

kept islam out of public policy consider the decision an attempt by the secularist elite to hold power as the new york times reports and mr erdogan said he would also propose what the financial times
