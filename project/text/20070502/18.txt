cablevision nears deal with dolans to go private for at least &# billion the founding family of cablevision systems corp the dolans was in advanced talks last night on a deal to take the company private for at least &# billion a sign of their confidence in the cable industrys prospects despite growing competition since the board of the bethpage n y company has rejected as inadequate two previous offers from the family the latest deal is valued at more than &# a share according to a person close to the talks the previous offer valued at &# billion was for &# a share cablevision shares closed at &# a share in p m trading on the new york stock exchange but jumped more than to &# a share in after hours trading like the two previous offers for cablevision from the dolans who own a controlling interest in the company this deal could collapse the family led by cablevision founder and chairman charles dolan and his son cablevision chief executive james dolan is known for driving tough bargains a cablevision spokesman declined to comment last night members of the dolan family could not be reached the draw for the dolans cash even though cable providers face new competition as phone companies roll out tv services and video migrates to the internet they also are getting a break much of the heavy investment of the past decade used to launch networks with new products such as high speed internet hookups is coming to an end the heavy spending has been a drag on cable stocks for more than a decade frustrating investors who wanted operators to generate cash flow that could be used to buy back shares or pay dividends but now the decline in its capital spending has turned cablevision into a cash generating machine capable of throwing off hundreds of millions of dollars a year cablevision was the first major cable provider to build a network that offered all its customers a bundled package of services including digital tv phone and high speed internet other big operators like comcast corp and the cable unit at time warner inc are a few years behind cablevision in rolling out those services but they too likely will begin generating more cash as their spending declines analysts say meanwhile two other big cable companies cox communications inc and insight communications recently have gone private joining the wave of buyouts of public companies by private equity firms and controlling shareholders while cable stocks have risen sharply in the past year some analysts believe their cash generating abilities will make them desirable targets unless their stocks rise to a prohibitive level "every cable company in america is going to generate so much free cash flow none of them are going to remain in the public equity markets unless their multiples expand dramatically " said craig moffett a cable analyst with sanford c bernstein ironically cablevision which has about three million subscribers in the new york city region is among the cable companies most vulnerable to increased competition telecom company verizon communications inc has targeted its turf with its own bundle of services nonetheless for cablevision and other operators the savings from reduced capital expenses are likely to far exceed lost revenue moreover cablevision has a jump on grabbing customers with its menu of products about of cablevisions television subscribers take digital cable compared with an industry average of about cablevision provides phone service to of the homes reached by its networks by contrast the nations largest cable provider comcast provides phone service to just of its homes its capital spending isnt expected to begin falling for several years mr moffett of sanford bernstein predicts that cablevision will generate &# a share in annual cash flow by up from a projected &# in cablevision also owns madison square garden the new york knicks and rangers radio city music hall and a stable of cable tv channels the dolan family owns about of the companys common stock but has a controlling interest through its ownership of a special class of supervoting stock the dolan family is well known for fighting with such big names as new york yankees owner george steinbrenner and mayor michael bloomberg as well as one another at one point several years ago charles and james dolan stopped speaking to each other as the senior dolan pushed cablevision to invest heavily in a satellite tv service known as voom while his son sided with the board in killing the venture the dolans previous bids track the companys rising value they made their first offer to take cablevision private in june proposing to give shareholders &# for each share for the cable company as well as shares in a new spun off public company that would include madison square garden and the other entertainment assets that deal which the company said represented a premium to the &# a share price at which cablevisions stock then traded was rejected by a special two member committee of the cablevision board after that rejection the dolans persuaded the board to agree to a one time &# billion special dividend the family used its share of those proceeds to finance a second buyout offer last october the dolans said at that time the offer represented a premium to the unsuccessful offer as well as an premium to the companys week closing high but some investors complained that the price was far below the value of the company the same two member board committee consisting of thomas v reifenheiser a retired banker and retired vice admiral john r ryan rejected the second offer as "inadequate" given the value of the companys cable system the dolans were unable to increase the offer much through borrowing because that would have put cablevision perilously close to violating bank covenants then earlier this week the company struck a deal to sell its interests in two regional sports networks to comcast for &# million analysts say that could reduce cablevisions leverage enough to enable the dolans to pull off a pricier deal the company currently has about &# billion in debt still some investors could well see the latest offer as inadequate too when the dolans last floated the idea last fall critics contended that cablevision would be valued at as much as &# a share if all its assets were sold separately some cablevision investors have speculated that the dolans plan to take the company private and eventually sell it to a larger rival such as comcast or time warner to appease these concerns the dolans previous offer was structured to allow shareholders to reap some of the benefit if they sold the company it is unclear if the latest offer has similar terms
