film review waitress serves a filmmakers sweet legacy every day of her working life at a diner in a small southern town jenna the lovelorn heroine of "waitress " bakes a new pie of her own invention jennas creations are her gift to the world when she isnt baking pies that look and taste sublime shes sublimating her dreams of happiness and her present marital misery into culinary fantasies with names like i hate my husband pie "you take bittersweet chocolate and dont sweeten it " if this delicious comedy were edible it might be called "my last gift to the world pie " the writer director adrienne shelly who died in new york city late last year at the age of took such perishable ingredients as wit daring poignancy whimsy and romance added passionate feelings plus the constant possibility of joy decorated her one of a kind production with pastel colors and created something close to perfection keri russells performance as jenna must have made shelly joyful its a flawless expression of the movies sweet smart soul married to a man worth hating and suddenly appalled to find herself pregnant with his baby this dreamy young woman can crack you up or break your heart with equal ease thats the wonder of whats been accomplished here "waitress" looks like a beguiling cartoon the coen brothers crossed with "the umbrellas of cherbourg " every element has been stylized the cinematography by matthew irving the costumes by ariyela wald cohain and the production design by ramsey avery as well as shellys direction that treats the dialogue as lyrics to unheard music andrew hollander did the fine music that is heard yet the cartoon never lapses into caricature or condescension and just beneath the bright cheerful surface lies poetic longing and the urgency of love the filmmaker herself plays the role of winsome dawn one of jennas two fellow waitresses and friends at joes pie diner the other member of the steadfast little sorority is cheryl hiness raffish becky neither one would trade places with jenna because of what shes been forced to endure from her husband earl hes portrayed skillfully by jeremy sisto as a nasty brutish narcissist whose redeeming quality for us not for poor jenna is his entertainment value nathan fillion is dr pomatter jennas handsome charmingly neurotic obstetrician whom she sees through the gauzy filter of need as her last hope for happiness her only hope for financial independence appears to be a local bakeoff with a best pie prize of &# lew temple plays cal the diners laconic short order cook and eddie jemison is the love of dawns life the boobishly amorous ogie shellys direction of all of her actors seems unerring and consistently generous but one casting choice was inspired andy griffith as joe the diners owner an octogenarian who looks his age and looks like hes enjoying it this comic virtuoso is as commanding as ever but with a new dimension of restraint he gives joe a sly kindness that grows less sly as the old mans fondness for jenna deepens the two of them are wonderful together when joe launches into an extended appreciation of jennas strawberry chocolate oasis pie his flowing phrases are both eloquent and ardent aspiring filmmakers could profit from studying that exchange which looks as simple as apple pie nothing forced nothing dwelled on no tight close ups to sell big moments just discreet camera moves that amount to optical tiptoes precise editing that leaves each moment on a still rising note and abiding trust in what a pair of expert performers can do with a strongly crafted scene but the manifold beauties of "waitress" are emotional not technical and the movie is full of surprises the aftermath of jennas second visit to dr pomatters clinic ogies preposterous outbursts of spontaneous verse which recalled for me the effusions of a lovable fool in dylan thomass "under milk wood" earls lugubrious meltdown the short order cooks longer than expected reply to jennas simple question of whether hes happy even the pie leitmotif provides a measure of surprise not only does each concoction look scrumptious each suggests new comic or erotic content but another leitmotif emerges later in the film one that takes the cake for conflicted feelings its a series of thoughts and tumultuous emotions sometimes couched as letters that jenna shares aloud with her unborn baby life hasnt been easy for this mother to be and it promises to get harder since she doesnt want the baby though getting rid of it is not an option but "waitress" isnt tragedy its fantasy couched as comedy a movie in which life does right by people who want to do the right thing and everything has a way of working out in the end not just for the better but the very best by the time the picture ends jennas baby lulu has grown into a gorgeous toddler played by the filmmakers daughter sophie but this brings us back to the real life tragedy of adrienne shellys death and to its horrific circumstances last november she was brutally murdered by a construction worker in her greenwich village office a fact that i omitted at the beginning of the review to keep a sense of her last movie from being dominated by feelings about her death they cant be kept separate indefinitely of course once you know what happened theres no way to unknow it and the tragedy is all the more affecting because shelly was so gifted she first made her mark in the early s as an actress in two independent films by hal hartley "the unbelievable truth" and "trust " and appeared most recently in a screen adaptation of charles bukowski stories called "factotum " as the writer director of her own feature films she made "sudden manhattan" and "ill take you there" then she broke through to a new level of artistry with "waitress " which would stand on its own as a remarkable achievement if you knew absolutely nothing about the woman who made it talk about leaving on a rising note mr morgenstern is the
