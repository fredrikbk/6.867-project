key to companys fate is the bancroft family firm no or a maybe the fate of dow jones &amp co now depends on how much sway the companys controlling shareholders the bancroft family exercises against the wishes of other investors through the companys class of "b" shares the bancrofts votes count for more than those of common shareholders the clans roughly three dozen adult members have slightly more than voting control of the company while maintaining just under economic interest they can vote their shares as they like independent of how big a premium is placed in front of them that means gaining the bancrofts affections is the key for news corp s rupert murdoch or any other suitor valued at &# million as of monday the familys stake would be valued at &# billion based on mr murdochs &# a share offer even so a company statement late yesterday said that a director who represents the bancroft family michael b elefante had told the dow jones board that family members and trusts "constituting slightly more than of the outstanding voting power" of dow jones would vote against that offer four days earlier a preliminary family tally had showed that less than half of their voting shares opposed a transaction according to a person close to dow joness board it is unclear what happened in those intervening days but it is likely there was fierce lobbying between the factions whether yesterdays rebuff was a firm "no" to mr murdoch or simply a tactic to extract a higher offer also is unclear "thats exactly what were trying to figure out " said a person in mr murdochs camp the dual class structure of dow jones is fairly common among media companies news corp has two classes of stock one of which has very limited voting rights and the other with standard voting rights the murdoch familys stake is mostly in the latter news corp recently resolved a standoff with liberty media corp which in quietly accumulated a block of voting stock big enough to threaten the familys control news corp adopted a poison pill to stop liberty increasing its position recently shareholders have clashed with the management of new york times co over its own dual class structure hoping to embarrass its controlling family the ochs sulzbergers into making broader changes at the firm "this bid really frames the question regarding dual class voting rights in a pointed and timely way " says joseph a grundfest a former sec commissioner and current professor at stanford university despite the recent attention to the timess structure such setups have been under attack since their debut in the s when the family behind the hires root beer business locked up control with special "management shares " now in an era when activist shareholders have succeeded in pressuring a range of companies from canadas bce inc to wendys international inc to follow their wishes these structures have served as the most effective defense from unwanted suitors still the pressure from outside investors is immense especially given that news corp s offer exceeds the price reached by dow jones stock at any time in the last five years in addition the newspaper sector is viewed as being out of favor "even if the bancroft family can legally turn the bid down that doesnt mean it is at all a sensible thing for them to do in terms of their own best interests in the newspapers best interests and the shareholders best interests " said mr grundfest "and that really is going to be the test " indeed other dow jones shareholders may push hard for a sale despite their limited power or if the bancrofts say no punish them by abandoning the stock "if the bancrofts are at all forward thinking selling the company makes a lot of sense " said lawrence j haverty a fund manager at gamco investors inc which owns shares in both dow jones and news corp "sixty dollars a share as a starting point is a very generous offer " the bancrofts comprise a disparate group that runs the gamut politically the family is scattered from new england to texas to los angeles and includes writers investment bankers philanthropists and equestrians the members are descended from jessie waldron a prosperous widow with two daughters who married a dow jones correspondent clarence barron mr barron bought the company for &# in largely with his wifes money the barrons passed their shares on to jessie waldrons oldest daughter jane who had married hugh bancroft by and large the family has embraced the companys year old history and independence having rebuffed previous offers from a collection of others they have taken pride in keeping outsiders away there have been exceptions however in after it was clear that dow joness telerate unit was deteriorating two family members elisabeth "lizzie" goth and william cox iii made clear through an article in fortune magazine that they didnt have much confidence in management the article said there was a schism in the family and dow joness stock jumped amid takeover speculation surrounding the company mr murdochs offer now places the family and its board representatives elizabeth steele leslie hill christopher bancroft and mr elefante on the hot seat under existing standards a companys board is generally obligated to at least listen to an incoming offer should it decide to pursue a transaction its responsibilities elevate to another level that means that it must seriously consider all other legitimate offers and if it is deciding to take cash instead of stock it enters what is called "revlon mode" after a famous court decision which essentially requires a company to take the highest bid on the table if stock is involved a company has more leeway because the delaware courts regard such deals as "strategic combinations" that may bring other matters into consideration that gives the board latitude to extract concessions on the companys ongoing editorial independence for instance or protections against meddling from mr murdoch should the bancrofts decide to pursue any deal however dow jones will have been considered "in play" and its directors obligated to obtain the best deal possible the irony is that the bancroft board members might be forced to recommend a deal to their own shareholders but are in fact not obligated to vote for it cynthia crossen contributed to this article
