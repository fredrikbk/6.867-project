turkish turmoil the muslim worlds liveliest democracy has long been a work in progress but the stakes just got a lot higher for turkey and the greater mideast turkeys future as a pluralistic free society is on the line amid a presidential campaign marked by street protests and divisive rhetoric the powerful military inserted itself into politics late friday by threatening a coup the generals and their secularist allies in the civil service and professions are trying to derail the ruling partys selection for president yesterday the countrys highest court sided with the secularists the crisis erupted last week when the ruling justice and development party or akp by virtue of its majority in parliament nominated one of its own for the presidency the job is currently held by a secularist and the akp choice would give a party with roots in the islamist movement control over all branches of government for the first time despite the belief of some secularists that the akps "secret agenda" is to implant political islam in turkey its five years in power have done more to entrench democracy and free markets than have most previous governments the akps candidate foreign minister abdullah gul is a pro western moderate who spearheaded turkeys political and economic reforms and helped secure an invitation to start membership talks with the european union but mr gul got his political start in the islamist movement and the greatest sin in secular eyes his wife wears a headscarf the battle came to a head friday when mr gul failed by a slim margin to get the two thirds needed to win then the military weighed in just before midnight with a statement posted on its home page "it should not be forgotten that the turkish armed forces takes sides in these debates and is the absolute defender of secularism " the missive read "when necessary they will display their attitudes and actions very clearly " the message was lost on no turk yesterday the court annulled fridays vote ruling in favor of the opposition party that had boycotted the vote the judges all staunchly secular ruled that a two thirds quorum must be present in the legislature for a vote even though the constitution says nothing firmly about a quorum and past presidents were elected with less than two thirds turkey has done well under the political stability and sound economics brought by the akp which took office in late and party leader and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan may feel confident enough to keep pressing back as a soft islamist who has taken a few false steps pushing a law banning adultery and cozying up to hamas he has stronger democratic credentials and more legitimacy than the secularists who fall back on the generals the court decision while unfortunate could show a way out of the problem the public demonstrations indicate that mr erdogan continues to make a large chunk of the turkish public uneasy though mr gul is a capable politician a different candidate may calm the public storms without compromising the akps right to choose that figure down the road the akps oft mooted ideas about a directly elected president could be part of a broader constitutional overhaul mr erdogan said yesterday that early parliamentary elections are likely the immediate need for anyone concerned about turkeys future must be to get politics played by the rules and by the civilians the military made important contributions to westernizing the country but its current behavior is a danger to turkish progress the best thing that can be said about the high courts decision is that early elections are better than tanks in the street but the damage done to turkeys institutions might have been avoided by sticking to the rules set down in the constitution
