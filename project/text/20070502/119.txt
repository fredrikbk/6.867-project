texas size pay of txu chief stirs controversy in the past three years c john wilder has risen from near obscurity to become one of the most highly paid executives in the u s utility sector with a total compensation package at txu corp of about &# million covering the five year period of his contract through now the question is whether detailed disclosure of mr wilders generous pay package could disrupt a &# billion buyout bid by private equity interests some lawmakers and state utility officials have already been sharply critical of both txu which dominates the deregulated texas electricity and the proposed buyout by a group led by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and tpg the details of mr wilders compensation could solidify opinion among angry state legislators that theres urgent need to rein in txus clout and curb its profit mr wilder wasnt available for comment in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission this week txu disclosed that mr wilder received about &# million in cash compensation from his date of hire in through but complicated compensation tables and footnotes also reveal that mr wilder has been awarded about million shares of txu stock that have vested so far and that hes destined to receive anywhere from shares to about million additional shares if the company meets certain performance targets assigning a value of &# to those shares which is the price offered by the buyout group those stock holdings carry a value of &# million to &# million state rep phil king chairman of the texas house regulated industries committee said mr wilders pay package is "obscene but not unexpected " the package he said makes him and other legislators more determined to garner reductions in txus electricity rates and make other structural changes that would reduce txus ability to extract enormous profit at consumers expense when the state created its electric industry deregulation law in mr king said "it didnt go far enough" to break the power of big utilities like txu he said its "imperative" that the legislature now go the next step and force txu to divide itself into separately operated companies in the next week or so mr king will call a conference committee that will pull together pieces of txu legislation that have passed the house or senate the result could be a law requiring txu to lower its retail rates by or more reduce the number of generating plants it owns and structurally divide its different business lines much of the passion against txu is directed squarely at mr wilder a point that will only be exacerbated by the pay disclosure mr king said he doesnt have anything against the prospective buyers but "cant wait to see current management get out of town " terry hadley spokesman for the texas public utility commission said mr wilders compensation amounts to a "boatload of cash but we would point out as far as txus customers go that they have more than a dozen choices among retail service providers and may want to ask themselves if theyre getting the best deal from a company that pays its chairman tens of millions of dollars " its not clear whether legislative changes could be enough to unhinge the deal struck with txus board of directors in late february but jeff eller a spokesman for the buyers said they have "no interest" in dividing txu into different companies regarding mr wilder mr eller said that no new employment agreement has been offered and added "you can read that as positive or negative " mr wilder first came to txu in from entergy corp where he was chief financial officer and little known even in the utilities industry in just three years however he got everyones attention by dramatically improving both the companys profitability and stock price that was a big change from the previous regime which had lost &# billion in when txu guessed wrong on the direction prices would move in the deregulated united kingdom electricity marketplace the company says mr wilder has earned his pay since total shareholder return under his leadership has been putting txu seventh among s&amp p companies and first among utilities on the s&amp p utilities index all told more than &# billion in shareholder value has been created said riz chand txu senior vice president of human resources txu earned &# billion in on revenue of &# billion versus earnings of &# billion on &# billion in revenue in but all of that was accomplished with tactics that have been controversial among both consumers and politicians expertly taking advantage of texass plan for deregulating electricity sales txu has used hardball tactics to raise electricity prices to high levels prices long remained stuck at levels that reflected the high natural gas prices that followed hurricanes rita and katrina in since mr wilder took control of the company txu has cut off record numbers of customers for nonpayment and shrugged off customer erosion as meaningless because profit nevertheless has grown robustly the company attracted the unwelcome attention of environmentalists for a strategy to build big coal fired power plants in texas in the next four years which would have made the state a top emitter of carbon dioxide nationally the first act by the prospective owners was to announce plans to cancel eight of the proposed plants txu also peeved regulators when it threatened to withhold power from some of its generating plants if it couldnt get high enough prices for the power under texass market rules a generator may not withhold power from plants that is needed to assure system reliability the threat was interpreted as a bullying tactic and the company apologized now many state officials are wondering whether mr wilder will remain with the firm or leave following the proposed buyout according to the terms of his employment agreement shares of stock that would vest over time would automatically vest in the event of a change in control if mr wilders employment is terminated without wrongdoing on his part he would receive about &# million in additional payments representing salary and bonuses due under his contract which expires in february its unclear whether the prospective buyers want mr wilder to stay on or not david bonderman a co founder of tpg laura miller a critic of txus practices in los angeles last week and the issue of mr wilders future came up mr bonderman ducked a question by ms miller about whether mr wilder would stay or go but he want on to say that "one thing he wont have is discretion to act as he has in the past the company will be run differently "
