in french election web plays big role sarkozy and royal try different approaches to woo voters sunday paris the web site of french presidential candidate nicolas sarkozy includes a homemade video clip of a supporter singing lionel richies tune "hello " with new french lyrics that praise the candidate and substitute the word "sarko" for "hello" in the chorus another webcast on the site shows the year old mr sarkozy dressed in a red checkered shirt and jeans as he rides a white horse through marshlands in southeastern france surrounded by cowboys the webcasts on www sarkozy fr are among the key marketing tactics used by the campaigns front runner to lure voters ahead of the final runoff voting sunday to select frances new president "an image is worth a thousand words " says francois de la brosse mr sarkozys communications adviser "i told nicolas you need your own media so you can do whatever you want whenever you want " never before has the internet been used so forcefully as an advertising technique during a french election web penetration in france is much higher than during the last election in with an estimated million internet users among the countrys million registered voters there has also been unprecedented popular interest in the campaign during the first round of the elections on april of the electorate cast ballots the highest turnout since the web sites of both the conservative mr sarkozy and his socialist rival segolene royal have been receiving between and hits a day not including connections by supporters to linked web sites in u s elections the internet has been used by campaign staffers mainly as a fund raising tool to lure supporters who can help finance the many television ads billboards and other forms of marketing used during political battles in france however there are strict limits on the time and money candidates can spend on tv radio and billboard advertising so the internet has become the cheapest and most effective tool to spread candidates messages mr sarkozy and ms royal have each spent more than million euros &# million on the internet or about th of their respective campaign budgets both mr sarkozys and ms royals internet campaigns have combined audio video and text on interactive web platforms using streaming rss and wiki the same collective editing system used for the online encyclopedia but there are big differences in their strategies mr sarkozys site focuses on the man instead of circulating webcasts through video sites such as youtube or its french equivalent dailymotion mr sarkozys advisers decided to create their own web tv nstv consisting of different thematic channels with names such as "proposals " "backstage" and even "sports " the idea is to give voters direct access to mr sarkozy a key issue in an election pitting two starkly different personalities against each other among the webcasts is a clip of a champagne maker holding a special bottle of vintage bubbly labeled "everything becomes possible " after mr sarkozys campaign slogan in another video images of cameroon stream by as a singer strums on his guitar and sings "sarkozy the excellent " to the rhythm of a bamileke drum ms royals internet campaign focuses on what her advisers say is french peoples hunger for discussion her site desirsdavenir org which means "desires for the future" started as a discussion forum on which participants were encouraged to debate create blogs and email feedback to ms royals proposals "webcasts are a good way to attract people and it gives you a high click rate but i dont think they are efficient in the long term " says benoit thieulin who devised ms royals internet strategy content from the online debates on ms royals site was used as part of the basis for her point presidential platform unveiled in mid february since the site was launched nearly months ago a network of sego friendly sites has been created via the discussion forums according to the candidates advisers in addition some e campaigners have been informally helping deliver the royal word including via virtual world second life unlike mr sarkozys site desirsdavenir org offers little content on ms royal personally "we didnt want it to be about an image but about a person who listens " says mr thieulin while internet political marketing has gathered speed during this election restrictive french laws on data gathering are likely to get in the way of its future development says thierry vedel a senior research fellow in politics and communication technologies at the institut detudes politiques a paris university for example to send emails with political content to potential voters candidates first need to get consent from the people they target an attempt by staffers in mr sarkozys center right ump party last fall to recruit new party members via mass emails met with harsh resistance from consumer groups the campaign dubbed "sarkospam" by its opponents was quickly abandoned loic le meur one of frances most active bloggers and a collaborator on the sarkozy web campaign also wonders whether france will have to wait for a younger generation of politicians for internet politicking to really take off "the candidates have put the internet to good use but theyre too old to belong to the internet generation " he says "to them the priority is still to get on the oclock tv news "
