love &amp money update a sons soccer and a nursing home time to tie up loose ends this week im updating a couple of previous columns one about our year old son joining a premier soccer team and the effects that has had on the family and another about my in laws struggles in dealing with an aging parent before the summer i wrote about my son trying out for a soccer team that travels around the region for games and tournaments he made the team and though were in a break now our family has spent the past months living soccer because i love and play the game my view is biased just about any inconvenience seems worth it so ill let amy speak of the effects on our family first the facts our son played more than games in five cities over weekends along with twice weekly practices we traveled to every game requiring our year old daughter to tag along and our son to study in the car and hotel rooms "it was hectic " amy says "early on it was a challenge because he had to get used to doing homework or reading in the car or hotel when hed usually be playing a videogame and he wasnt always happy about that " in fact we dealt with a lot of fussing and griping until we reminded him of the sacrifices were making as a family for his pursuit one of the unexpected obstacles amy notes was our son "trying to juggle his own life " on a few occasions he was invited to birthday parties for some of his best friends but those festivities conflicted with soccer games and he got mad because he wasnt sure how to choose he ultimately went with soccer because we told him at this level he has an obligation to his team though he wasnt always pleased with that and is still sore about missing those parties our daughter has behaved better than expected she attended every game and played on the sidelines with other tag along siblings still that put more on amys shoulders since she had to entertain our daughter while i was interacting with our son and the team i asked amy recently how she would respond to parents seeking advice about their child signing up for a premier team "if your child really has an interest in soccer i would say go for it " she says "but have a heart to heart with everyone in the family about what the commitment means weve had fun and enjoyed it for the most part but this is something that the whole family takes on its more money spent lots of time on the road and theres a lot to balance if you have more than one child " early last year i wrote about amys year old maternal grandfather and his failing health i noted that he never wanted to live in a nursing home instead wanting his family to care for him in the house where he and his wife raised them that request meant amys retired mom in particular spent a great deal of time running her fathers life frequently spending the night at his house and dealing with his personal and financial issues the situation has changed amys grandfather is now in a nursing home when doctors diagnosed early stages of alzheimers disease and dementia it became clear that he needed care well beyond what sitters and family members could provide like many families tested by the same circumstances the decision was emotionally wrenching for amys mom and her moms four siblings still amys mom says "once you get to a place where youre comfortable with the nursing home its all right it was very upsetting at first to have to do this but it didnt take us long to realize that he really is better here because of the level of care at home we could never give him the kind of care he needs and here he has someone who can care for him hours a day " hes in one of the nicest facilities in town "and that has helped " amys mom says "because i dont even think of it as a nursing home if it had been some of the other places i might have more of a problem with it " he has friends at the nursing home and someone from the familiy spends time with him almost every day but amys mom says "he still tells us sometimes that he wants to leave " while that can be tough particularly around the holidays when amys family has traditionally gathered at her grandfathers house "we know we made the right decision " amys mom says "were over the hurt because we know hes a lot better off where he is " finally amy and i have hired a woman to help us keep our house clean thats an issue we were debating earlier this year because as i noted in the original column our life is often so consumed by job obligations and our kids school duties and extracurricular activities that "many household chores get punted from one day to the next and then to the next " amy is pleased with this arrangement but i still question whether its worth the &# a week were paying you can see more of our debate about the issue on this weeks love and money video at wsj com loveandmoney jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
