money funds feel the credit squeeze "since the onset of the credit crisis in august money market mutual funds have been taking steps to ensure the safety and liquidity of their portfolios they will continue to take action as market conditions warrant " says paul schott stevens president of the investment company institute turmoil in the mortgage and bond markets this year has caused tremors in one of the safest investments available to individuals money market mutual funds but industry officials and financial advisers generally say there is little reason to worry money funds aim to maintain a steady share price of &# and pay income from their holdings of high quality short term debt securities they are different from money market accounts which are bank accounts backed by the federal deposit insurance corp in an attempt to get higher yields a number of money funds have in recent years bought some exotic but at the time high rated securities including those backed by mortgages in recent months some of these types of securities lost value raising concerns about whether some of the funds might lose value and "break the buck " or have to lower their share price below &# that has not happened so far thanks mainly to the fact that fund companies have stepped in to buy some troubled securities from their funds in fact since the first money fund was founded in only one fund marketed to institutions rather than individuals is known to have broken the buck in the community bankers u s government money market fund shut and returned only cents a share to investors because of risky derivatives investments that regulators later prohibited the mutual fund industry is focused on not letting money funds lose value particularly to maintain the funds reputation of safety "i dont think the consumer is in danger at this point " says connie bugbee managing editor of research firm imoneynet thats also the word from a leading fund industry association "since the onset of the credit crisis in august money market mutual funds have been taking steps to ensure the safety and liquidity of their portfolios they will continue to take action as market conditions warrant " says paul schott stevens president of the investment company institute despite some concerns about these funds investors spooked by other kinds of investments have flooded money funds with new cash the funds have taken in &# billion so far in a record annual inflow that has raised their total assets to a record of more than &# trillion according to ici the cash has come largely from investors both individuals and institutions that are seeking a "flight to simplicity flight to quality " says deborah cunningham head of the taxable money market group at federated investors money fund assets have risen even as the federal reserve has trimmed short term interest rates cutting its target rate to as of last week from in august the average seven day yield on taxable money funds has fallen to last week from as high as in april according to imoneynet and the latest fed move is likely to produce lower yields over the coming weeks each day stock and bond mutual funds must calculate their "net asset value " or the per share market value of their portfolio holdings that determines the price for investors buying or selling shares in contrast money funds declare their nav based on the purchase price of their securities and then make periodic assessments that the per share value of the portfolio securities is indeed very close to &# if the difference ever becomes or more that is if the per share value of the portfolio is cents or less the fund would likely have to cut its nav and thus break the buck this years money fund troubles began in the summer when some so called asset backed commercial paper a type of short term debt security couldnt find buyers and started losing market value some money funds such as those from bank of americas columbia management advisors wachovias evergreen investments and u s bancorps first american funds held commercial paper from some issuers that in august said they couldnt pay back their debt on time then in october and november concerns arose about securities issued by structured investment vehicles or sivs sivs raise money by selling short term debt and use it to buy higher yielding long term securities including mortgage securities as investors shied away from risky assets even high quality siv debt became hard to trade eventually wachovia u s bancorp and bank of america bought some of the troubled commercial paper and siv securities from their funds however as of earlier this month at least a dozen money funds were still holding some siv securities that had been put on review for a possible ratings downgrade by moodys investors service a number of fund companies say these holdings are small portions of their funds and they are comfortable that these holdings will ultimately be paid off money funds have lately been cutting back on their investments in siv debt and are allowing securities to mature without rolling them into new debt from the issuers also some of the sivs corporate parents including citigroup last week are taking steps to support these securities bruce bent creator of the first money market fund and chairman of money fund firm the reserve disapproves of some of the exotic securities some money funds have been buying "people have taken the concept of money funds and corrupted it by investing in an siv " he says he adds however that he "sincerely doubts" that any money fund will break the
