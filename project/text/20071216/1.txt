getting going how to beat the next bubble the current decade saw the proliferation of innovative new mortgages that allowed home buyers to put down little or no money and still enjoy low initial monthly payments fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me as stocks collapsed earlier this decade investors vowed never again to be so reckless yet within a few short years folks were rolling the dice once more this time flipping condominiums and making massive bets on rental real estate youve got to wonder how could this possibly happen markets of course have a long history of bubbles and busts still why did we have two insuch quick succession william bernstein author of "the four pillars of investing " blames it on a combustible mix of innovation and easy money in the late s we had the explosive growth of the internet combined with plentiful financing from venture capitalists and public stock offerings meanwhile the current decade saw the proliferation of innovative new mortgages that allowed home buyers to put down little or no money and still enjoy low initial monthly payments throw in rock bottom interest rates and these loans were even more affordable ironically the bursting of the stock market bubble helped fuel the housing bubble as share prices tumbled and the economy slowed the federal reserve cut short term interest rates providing the cheap financing that propelled the property boom "i dont think that were going to see another real estate or stock bubble for at least another few decades " mr bernstein says "but not to worry i have faith that our genius for financial innovation will provide us with many new and exciting areas capable of vaporizing large amounts of wealth " while innovation and easy money were key ingredients in both bubbles investor psychology also played a crucial role want to make sure you dont lose your shirt in the next bubble watch out for these four mental mistakes we assume rising investments will keep on rising it isnt surprising we think this way following the crowd is often a smart strategy notes terry burnham co author of "mean genes" and director of economics at bostons acadian asset management for instance if a new gadget or a new movie is wildly popular its probably pretty good but if an investment is wildly popular it has likely already posted big gains and we may be buying something that is overvalued problem is not all overvalued investments immediately tumble in price in fact we may make money at first and end up learning the wrong lesson instead of swearing off hot investments we might come away believing were good at picking winners but that we just didnt sell in time "people make the same simple mistake buying an investment after its already gone up a lot repeatedly " mr burnham says "they do it their whole life " as markets climb investors grow increasingly self confident they attribute their gains to their own brilliance and start making even bigger bets in the s this self confidence drove technology stock investors who had enjoyed some initial success to pour even more money into the sector in the current decade real estate speculators who fared well with their first property were soon buying half a dozen buildings this growing appetite for risk is also driven by the "house money" effect like casino gamblers who get lucky early in the evening winning investors feel like theyre ahead of the game and they can afford to take extra risk their thinking even if they lose a little they will still have handsome gains unfortunately when a bubble collapses the losses are never small the nasdaq composite index tumbled between march and october true home prices have so far barely dipped but because property speculators are typically betting with borrowed money even modest price drops can mean big losses when a bubble bursts many folks freeze unwilling to sell at a loss but others may take on even more risk in an effort to recoup their losses indeed no doubt some tech investors who had lost a heap of money in the stock market decline turned to real estate hoping this second roll of the dice would get them back to even whats the lesson here that brings us to a fifth mental mistake it is easy to decry the foolishness of those who chased the hot returns of internet stocks and florida condos yet at the time there was a heap of uncertainty about the direction of these markets some pundits declared that stocks and real estate were in a bubble years before these markets collapsed other experts remained full throated bulls to the bitter end "yes bubbles happen " says meir statman a finance professor at santa clara university in california "no you cant tell when to get in and get out youre better off just staying on the rollercoaster " if you stay on the rollercoaster however you want to stay on with a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks bonds and real estate "if you concentrate all your investments in energy stocks or technology or initial public offerings you will be a big winner or a big loser " prof statman warns "its true that diversification ensures mediocrity but mediocrity is better than being a big loser "
