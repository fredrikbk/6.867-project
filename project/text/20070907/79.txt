rambos view move over bridge to nowhere congress is back in town and clearly back to business even uglier than usual it takes hard work to come up with an earmark more egregious than that infamous alaskan bridge but californias dianne feinstein is an industrious gal her latest pork lets call it rambos view deserves to be the poster child for everything wrong with todays greedy earmark process the senators &# billion handout yes you read that right to wealthy west l a yes you read that right too is the ultimate example of how powerful members use earmarks to put their own parochial interests above national ones in this case the needs of veterans its a case study in how congress uses the appropriations process to substitute its petty wants for the considered judgments of agency professionals and its just the latest proof that no matter how much outrage the american public might display over these deals and no matter how often congress promises to clean up its act the elected have no intention of reforming the process the pork here revolves around the west los angeles medical center though this is no average veterans facility donated to the government in the center is sprawling prime real estate acres in the middle of tony west l a more than twice the size of the national mall it is surrounded by the mansions and playgrounds of the citys elite including the bel air country club and the beverly hills estates of sylvester stallone barry bonds and tim mcgraw to name a few huge portions of the facility are also a veritable ghost town it isnt just that acres is an enormous space and far larger than any one veterans community in todays america might ever need according to the u s census bureau los angeles county also falls on the lowest end in terms of the percentage of veterans living in the area nationally veterans make up about of people over the age of the countys average is below of buildings on campus are today partially or wholly vacant meanwhile the number of enrolled veterans in that facility is expected to decline by nearly a quarter over the next years which is why when the department of veterans affairs set up a process in to study its infrastructure and rationalize its facilities it designated the west l a center as one of sites that might be downsized any extra land being used to produce more revenue for veterans needs under law acres of the l a site cant be touched but the remaining plus acres sit in the middle of a highly desirable real estate area and could yield significant financial gain the va has yet to make any decisions but according to government estimates even a modest reuse of the property say leasing out excess acreage could result in an extraordinary &# billion for better care for veterans everywhere given the recent uproar over walter reed and congresss many calls that we do more for the men and women returning home wounded from iraq and afghanistan youd think no elected representative could possibly have the chutzpah to impede the vas considered attempts to inject efficiency into its facilities and provide better care for its constituents think ever so much again it turns out the well to do in west l a consider the veterans center grounds their own little rolling personal park and they want it to stay that way thank you very much the area has in fact revved up a powerful lobby machine to ensure americas veterans dont get anything extra at the expense of their backyard ms feinstein california congressman henry waxman and other luminaries have united to publicly bash the vas plans and instead demand the "preservation" of the ground for local use an overwrought los angeles times weighed in bemoaning that so few l a children live within "walking distance of a public place to play " and demanding this "treasured resource" not be ruined by "thoughtless" development word is that some hollywood luminaries who live in mr stallones neck of the woods have also complained that any changes would impede views from their square foot manses ms feinstein who in the last election received some of her largest donations from the rich area has been only too happy to come to its defense she honed in on the military construction and veterans affairs bill a sensitive spending vehicle that few republicans would dare vote against and that president bush would be loath to veto she then slipped in an earmark provision that would bar the va from disposing or leasing any of the ground thus a potential &# billion worth of help and aid for our nations veterans goes bye bye in the name of preserving a view for those hollywood actors who play veterans in the movies the indefatigable earmark warrior south carolina sen jim demint offered an amendment this week to strip ms feinsteins earmark california sen barbara boxer rose in righteous indignation on the senate floor and fizzed that she would never dream of leveling such a direct "attack" against south carolina the point of this speech was to remind her senate colleagues that whats hers is hers and that the penalty for voting against her and ms feinsteins california pork would be the targeting of projects in their own states they got the message in the final vote only senators had the courage to put the nations veterans above ms feinsteins scenery including just one democrat sen russ feingold gory details aside ms feinstein has set a concerning new precedent up to now congress has had a healthy respect for the decisions of the vas infrastructure review that may well change as more in congress see ms feinsteins success as an invitation to bring their own parochial concerns to the vas decision making process there is still one hope that some brave soul will take up this cause and attempt to get rambos view stripped from this bill during the house senate conference democrats have already reneged and reneged again on campaign pledges to clean up the earmark swamp and in any event arent likely to rally against a powerful member of their own party but if republicans had a collective iq of even theyd be making this particularly offensive pork item a rallying cry that they could use to demonstrate a renewed commitment to spending reform what is clear is that if this pork stands no senator should again be allowed to bemoan a lack of veterans funds without having this weeks vote waved in his face
