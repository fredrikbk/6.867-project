august ambush how market turmoil waylaid the quants morgan stanley star is among those battered no time for music now peter muller a year old trader at morgan stanley is used to markets behaving more or less as he expects but in late july some unusual patterns perplexed him certain investing strategies that historically had posted steady gains started faltering for no evident reason soon the unusual trading spread from u s to japanese and european markets as well mr muller picked up rumors that one or more unknown investors were buying and selling giant positions similar to the ones he held according to someone familiar with the matter the next two weeks proved one of the biggest convulsions ever faced by a breed of market players that includes mr muller quantitative investors known as "quants " these traders use complex mathematical models to invest in markets around the globe their computers track a wide range of data and variables such as how cyclical stocks do when a particular currency rises or falls formulas programmed into their computers spit out prices at which stocks or other instruments are to be bought and sold in fact the computers themselves often do the trading quant strategies have been around for decades but in recent years they have really come into their own thanks in part to technology that has lowered the costs of their trading intensive methods whereas investors like warren buffett and peter lynch defined an era of common sense "value" investing in the s and swashbuckling hedge funds betting on everything from metals to the british pound typified the s quants have scaled the heights of the investing world in the past decade quants avoidance of the limelight has only amplified the aura of stars like james simons of renaissance technologies corp and david shaw of d e shaw group large investors such as pension funds seek the steady returns these funds have produced assets in just two common types of quant funds known as "statistical arbitrage" and "market neutral" funds have risen nearly in two years to &# billion as of june according to research group hedgefund net the rise reflects both investment gains and new money against this backdrop quant funds turmoil in late july and early august was all the more disconcerting the broader u s stock market fell about in that stretch but renaissance institutional equities slid another big quant fund aqr capital management lost a goldman sachs group inc quant fund called global equity opportunities fell about tykhe capital llc saw losses of roughly and mr muller suffered along with them though few on wall street know about it his group at morgan stanley has been among the investment banks most profitable operations in recent years known as pdt for process driven trading it produced profits of roughly &# billion in the years through people familiar with it say they add that pdt which now contains about &# billion of morgan stanleys money accounted for of the banks net income last year by producing &# million in profits but between the last week of july and aug pdt lost approximately &# million according to traders neither morgan stanley nor mr muller would comment on the losses or on pdts trading strategy morgan stanley said it is fully committed to the quantitative trading business "its a very humbling event for quants to take these kinds of losses these guys think of themselves as masters of the universe " said lee maclin manager of pragma financial systems a new york "fund of funds " or hedge fund that invests in other hedge funds the quants summer woes remind some of the near meltdown almost a decade ago of high flying hedge fund long term capital management like quant funds ltcm was steered by brainy academics who made money exploiting out of kilter relationships between different securities unlike ltcm though todays quant funds are far less leveraged and thus unlikely to sustain huge losses as ltcm did quants say their bad patch will be forgotten as their strategies continue to churn out steady profits most of the funds including mr mullers have recouped some of the losses by the end of august aqr had bounced back by roughly from its lows and the goldman fund by according to people familiar with these funds even so the outsize drops could dim the luster of the quant approach especially since quants themselves still dont know for certain what triggered the carnage a common theory is that one or more large funds was forced possibly because of losses on subprime mortgages in other parts of its business to rapidly dump stock to raise cash and this set off a ripple effect among quant traders others say that stocks that were expected to fall began rising when traders who had borrowed shares and sold them were forced to start buying shares back meanwhile the proliferation of quant funds holding a lot of the same positions may have been a recipe for magnifying the losses mathematical computer driven trading was an arcane corner of the financial industry when mr muller joined morgan stanley in he had been exposed to it however for several years at barra inc a risk analysis firm in berkeley calif a math graduate of princeton mr muller impressed some investment elders early on jeremy grantham chairman of the big money management firm gmo llc recalls seeing a youthful mr muller as a panelist at a conference years ago "i caught both super quants on the panel in a logical fallacy " mr grantham says "the first one kind of choked on it but peter danced around the minefield like a tap dancer i thought that guy can really think on his feet " restless after barra went public in the early s mr muller interviewed for a job at morgan stanley he told executives there that he didnt really think any amount of money could get him to leave his laid back california life for wall street but he accepted when the bank offered to let him set up a group that would invest some of its own money using a quantitative strategy morgan stanley which eventually bought barra wasnt new to such techniques years earlier it had employed nunzio tartaglia a onetime astrophysicist and jesuit seminarian who was an early practitioner of a particular quant strategy and one of mr tartaglias underlings in the s was mr shaw now the proprietor of one of the largest quant funds d e shaw the strategy mr tartaglia used gives an idea of how quants operate called "pairs trading " it involves betting on two stocks that have a strong historical relationship suppose that general motors and ford motor stocks usually move more or less together if they arent doing so at a particular time and there is no clear reason why theres a good chance the past relationship will reassert itself so if ford has risen while gm languished a quant might buy gm shares and sell ford short betting on it to decline the "pairs trade" will pay off if the historic correlation returns quants play the game on a massive scale betting on many different securities and using borrowed money to magnify the effect of any market anomalies detected by their computers so although they expect to lose on many trades the gains tend to outweigh the losses thanks to their formulas and computing power ideas like pairs trading have blossomed into others such as "statistical arbitrage " a more complex version that is one of mr mullers specialties at pdt by the late s pdt group had become so successful it commanded the biggest chunk of morgan stanleys stock trading for its own account mr muller let members of the group dress down when their returns were up and forced them to dress up when their returns were down so everyone else at the firm knew how they were doing but according to a short biography on mr mullers web site he "woke up years ago and realized that he can no longer find happiness in the corporate world " he had already taken a one year sabbatical in he left full time work again though he remained an adviser friends say mr muller felt he had already accomplished more than he expected and the intense money focus and social climbing side of new york left him wishing for a more balanced life he also had broken up with a longtime girlfriend so over the next several years mr muller traveled to bhutan new zealand and hawaii and kayaked in the grand canyon he spent time in california and took up yoga he began writing crossword puzzles several of which appeared in the new york times he also became more serious about his music he had taken up the piano as a child and joined a jazz band in california in and he recorded albums on his own label dog and hammock productions during his time away from morgan stanley early this decade he could be seen playing on the streets of barcelona spain and in new york city subways mr maclin of pragma financial recalls seeing mr muller playing on a subway platform "people were dropping change in his keyboard case not realizing the guy is worth millions " late last year mr muller returned to morgan stanley full time encouraged by chief executive john macks push toward more aggressive risk taking at the investment bank the trader also felt that in what was becoming an increasingly competitive quant field pdt could benefit from more hands on guidance though secretive about their formulas quants like him are often seen together at social gatherings poker is a favorite pastime mr muller is the ace of the group while away from morgan stanley he briefly joined the world poker tour and pocketed nearly &# in a tournament in in march at a charity event called math for america held at new yorks st regis hotel several quants squared off in "wall street poker" night looking on according to people who were there was a murderers row of hedge fund managers citadel investment groups kenneth griffin renaissance capitals mr simons and david einhorn of greenlight capital inc in the final round clifford asness who runs aqr capital faced off against mr muller who took the title with a pair of kings to his foes ace and this summer was less fun mr muller had retaken the helm of pdt just in time for the biggest test of his career as the subprime mortgage meltdown broadened into a more general credit squeeze among the unusual results was that stocks many investors considered low quality and had bet against began to outperform the market says diane garnick investment strategist at invesco plc she attributes much of this to "short covering" investors who had borrowed shares and sold them had to buy them back when their brokers reined in their credit lines in contrast to the "flight to quality" often seen during a crunch she says the anomalous result was a "flight to non quality " the phenomenon may have been magnified by the similarity of quants portfolios their world is one of shared theories "everybody has read the same academic literature and knows whats in the air " says richard bookstaber a portfolio manager at frontpoint partners mr asness in a letter to his investors at aqr wrote that the early august jolt "is about a strategy getting too crowded " mr muller has been playing detective to avoid repeating past mistakes peppering friends with questions about the performance of his peers asking pointedly which funds got in trouble and which did better says a person familiar with the situation he has talked several times with mr asness though computers execute quant trades real people are constantly at the switch during the trading day monitoring portfolios to make sure the programs are operating according to plan if a computer accumulates too much of a single stock a trader may intervene and quants are always tweaking their models mr muller has told friends that the august swoon presents opportunities for experienced managers like him then theres his music songs on his first two albums reflected what was going on his life including one song with the lyrics "i almost made my escape i almost got away so hard to quit when youre good at the game " but mr mullers wall street career is getting in the way again since returning to pdt he hasnt written a new song all year as he recently wrote on his web site "one of my other passions mathematical finance has taken a lot of my time this year "
