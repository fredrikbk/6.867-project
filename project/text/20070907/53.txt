irans unlikely tv hit show sympathetic to plight of jews during the holocaust draws millions each week every monday night at oclock iranians by the millions tune into channel one to watch the most expensive show ever aired on the islamic republics state owned television its elaborate s costumes and european locations are a far cry from the typical iranian tv fare of scarf clad women and gray suited men but the most surprising thing about the wildly popular show is that it is a heart wrenching tale of european jews during world war ii the hour long drama "zero degree turn " centers on a love story between an iranian palestinian muslim man and a french jewish woman over the course of the episodes the hero saves his love from nazi detention camps and iranian diplomats in france forge passports for the woman and her family to sneak on to airplanes carrying iranian jews to their homeland on the surface the message of the lavish state funded production appears sharply at odds with that sent out by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad who has repeatedly called the holocaust a myth in fact the governments spending on the show underscores the subtle and often sophisticated way in which the iranian state uses its tv empire to send out political messages the aim of the show according to many inside and outside the country is to draw a clear distinction between the governments views about judaism which is accepted across iranian society and its stance on israel which the leadership denounces every chance it gets "iranians have always differentiated between ordinary jews and a minority of zionists " says hassan fatthi the shows writer and director "the murder of innocent jews during world war ii is just as despicable sad and shocking as the killing of innocent palestinian women and children by racist zionist soldiers " he says mr fatthi years old is a well known director of historical fiction for television in the past his work has focused on iranian history but he also dabbles in comedy winning international critical acclaim two years ago for a hit feature "marriage iranian style " he says he came up with the idea for "zero degree turn" four years ago as he was reading books about world war ii and stumbled across literature about charge daffaires at the iranian embassy in paris abdol hussein sardari saved over a thousand european jews by forging iranian passports and claiming they belonged to an iranian tribe mr fatthi says he chose the title because the world at the time was in dire circumstances offering few options for avoiding the terrors to come shot on location in paris and budapest the show stars iranian heartthrob shahab husseini and is so popular that its theme song an ode to getting lost in love is a hit too "its captivating no matter where i am or what im doing on monday nights i find a television set and watch the show so does every jewish person i know here " says morris motamed the lone jew in parliament mr fatthi enlisted the help of irans jewish association an independent body that safeguards the communitys culture and heritage the association has criticized mr ahmadinejads comments about the holocaust but has praised mr fatthis show iran is home to some jews the largest population in the middle east outside of israel irans jews along with christians and zorastrians are guaranteed equal rights in the countrys constitution irans jews are guaranteed one member of parliament and are free to study hebrew in school pray in synagogues and shop at kosher supermarkets despite mr ahmadinejads statements it isnt government policy to question the holocaust and the countrys supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei hasnt endorsed those views while iran makes it no secret that it considers israel an enemy it has been extremely touchy about criticism of its treatment of jewish citizens the show is seen as an effort by the government to erase the image that it may be anti semitic both at home among jews and non jews and abroad "in this show you notice that a new method of political dialogue is being promoted that is more in line with the modern world " says mohammad ali abtahi a reformist cleric and former iranian vice president the message appears to be grabbing the public sara khatibi a year old mother and chemist in tehran says she and her husband never miss an episode "all we ever hear about jews is rants from the government about israel " she says "this is the first time we are seeing another side of the story and learning about their plight " the show also pushes irans political line regarding the legitimacy of israel the jewish state was conceived in modern times by western powers rather than as part of a centuries old desire of jews for a return to their ancestral homeland in one scene a rabbi declares it a bad idea for jews to resettle in arab lands in another the french jewish protagonist refuses a marriage offer by a cousin who is advocating the creation of israel iran has long used tv to shape public opinion where newspapers and the internet are seen as media for the elite the states control over radio and television is enshrined in the constitution ayatollah khamenei the supreme leader is not only head of the armed forces and the judiciary but also the national broadcast authority "the regime appreciates the fact that to appeal to the masses both in iran and the muslim world television is the most important outlet " says karim sadjadpour an expert on iran at at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington on any given day the countrys seven state run channels broadcast a mostly drab offering of news sports cooking shows soap operas and religious sermons political propaganda is constantly fed into the mix dissidents such as students or reformers are routinely paraded before cameras to read confessions after stints of solitary imprisonment a slick documentary style program recently aired long interviews with two iranian americans who were detained on allegations of working to overthrow the regime the interviews in which the pair blandly admitted to meeting with iranian scholars and dissidents but not to attempting to topple the
