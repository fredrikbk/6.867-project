weekend journal taste dont suffer the little children another school year has sprung itself upon us which is always an occasion for my wife a former detroit public school teacher and me to remind ourselves why we home school part of the reason in addition to my wifes expertise in this area can be found in thomas sowells "a conflict of visions " published years ago mr sowell contrasted the "unconstrained vision" of utopians who want to radically improve humankind with the "constrained vision" of realists who begin with the proposition that man is inherently self interested and not moldable into whatever form the high minded types have in store for us once they get their itchy fingers on the levers of power mr sowells book has been influential among conservatives for its compelling explanation of the divide between people who want to reshape us often via large intrusions on liberty and those who believe that the purpose of government is to protect institutions like markets and families that channel our inherent selfishness into productive behavior it is also a handy guide for parenting while some mothers and fathers stubbornly cling to the utopian beliefs of their childless years the vision of humans as inherently sinful and selfish resonates with many of us who are parents nobody whos stood between a toddler and the last cookie should still harbor a belief in the inherent virtue of mankind an afternoon at the playground is apt to make one toss out the idealist rousseau "man is a compassionate and sensible being" in favor of the more realistic hobbes "all mankind is in a perpetual and restless desire for power" as a father of four sons ive signed on to mr sowells summation of a parents duty "each new generation born is in effect an invasion of civilization by little barbarians who must be civilized before it is too late " the constrained vision indicates that world harmony and universal satisfaction are mirages people are innately selfish and theyll always desire more goodies this means that tradeoffs between competing wants are inevitable my wife and i therefore forbid our children to use the word "fair " parents still in the thrall of the unconstrained worldview are prone to manipulation by their kids who like little human rights lawyers insist on fairness as an imperative and dont get me started on the damage that an exaggerated sense of fairness and entitlement has done to public schools in our house things are much simpler that last piece of cake had to be divided somehow and in this imperfect world your brother got the extra frosting deal with it while the unconstrained worldview teaches that traditions and customs are to be distrusted as holdovers from benighted generations those of us with the constrained view believe its good to make our children address their elders properly refrain from belching at the table and wear clothes that actually cover them mr sowell noted that some benefits from evolved societal rules cant be articulated because theyve developed through trial and error over centuries this reveals the sublime wisdom in that time honored parental rejoinder "because i said so " its not surprising then to see mr sowell approvingly cite edmund burkes observation that traditions provide "wisdom without reflection " this is lived out in our house by the dictum that parents are to be obeyed first and politely questioned later that seems oppressive to parents with the unconstrained worldview who want to nurture juniors sense of autonomy and broad minded reasoning its awfully useful however when junior is about to ride his bike into the path of an oncoming car obedience may be a dirty word in progressive schools and enlightened parenting circles but it saves lives mr sowell also notes that among those espousing the unconstrained view intentions are pre eminent utopians are cooking up a better tomorrow after all and should be excused for breaking a few million eggs while making the human omelet in our house however you are in big trouble if you push your brother into the pool regardless of the sincerity behind your desire that he learn to swim without his floaties hiding an animal trap directly on the path dad takes to get his morning paper is likewise unacceptable no matter how badly you want to catch a critter and while other parents cherish whatever art their little monets create we punish activities that incorporate moms jewelry and superglue no matter how glittery the final product many parents in the unconstrained camp adhere to rousseaus sentiment "man is born free but everywhere is in chains " they not only fail to punish bad behavior but snarl at anyone who rebukes their precious darlings in our house we have reversed rousseaus theory you are born in bondage and should be darn grateful for the free room and board besides if you want to talk about restrictions on liberty you can take it up with your mother who hasnt had an uninterrupted trip to the bathroom since i sometimes speak to groups of high school and college students and i have taken to disabusing them of the feel good notion that they can do anything they want so long as they are passionate about it intentions as mr sowell observes mean very little in the constrained worldview and besides individuals are neither equal nor perfectible this means that some of us will dig ditches for a living especially if those certain someones who know full well who im talking about dont stop shooting spitballs at their brothers and get back to their math workbooks firmly in the constrained camp im less concerned that my children self actualize at an early age than that they learn a trade and get out of the house as it turns out this tension between realists and utopians has existed for at least as long as people have been making a buck dispensing wisdom about how other folks should raise their kids ann hulberts "raising america experts parents and a century of advice about america" reveals successive generations of disciplinarians pitted against "gentler rousseauian" proponents of the inherent goodness of a childs nature ms hulbert quotes the president of the national congress of mothers proclaiming in that science based parenting innovations would so change civilization that "those of us who live to see the year will behold a new world and a new people " fast forward past two world wars and the global ravages of utopian totalitarianism to when education expert stephanie marshall writes exuberantly that "the fundamental purpose of schooling is to liberate the goodness and genius of children " perhaps the fundamental purpose of schooling should be to liberate parents from the necessity of supporting our kids well past our retirement years but regardless this notion that humans are inherently angelic and that it is society that corrupts them is at the heart of much bad parenting as well as inept schooling rather than help our children develop internal constraints that channel their energy and passion into productive enterprises we end up teaching them that limits and discipline are for chumps ms hulbert notes that even dr benjamin spock whose advice in his book "baby and child care" was so often blamed for parental permissiveness had seen enough of the consequences "i can hardly bear to be around rude children " he wrote "i have the impulse to spank them and to give a lecture to their parents " mr woodliefs pamphlet "raising wild boys into men a modern dads survival guide" is available from the new pamphleteer see
