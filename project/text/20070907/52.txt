in the ivy league entrenched trustees stiff arm the competition i wish to commend you on your sept editorial "the illiberal college" and joseph ragos "the weekend interview with t j rodgers mr rodgers goes to dartmouth" on the same day both pieces reflected deep research and considerable thoughtfulness i write as an unlikely supporter of a "conservative cabal " i graduated as the first full term female from dartmouth at the age of phi beta kappa summa cum laude numerous citations and other honors i received a masters from the london school of economics and then spent years working for the u s congress i dont really give a fig whether dartmouth sports teams may ever call themselves "indians" again i think its silly for alumni ae to spend years fighting over such an issue im not particularly interested whether the dartmouth swim team survives though i see no reason why it should not at an institution that just raised almost &# million in the past year from alumni what i do care about is undergraduate education at dartmouth the dartmouth i left in still had small class sizes and world class professors it taught undergraduates to think the professors didnt as a rule write blockbuster novels impose their airy concepts on others or have teaching assistants run their classes i still know the name of every professor under whom i studied and they know mine most alarming is the trustee election process without delving into the arcana involved in this process it is plain and simple that the "haves" are determined that the "have nots" should not be represented on the board of trustees keep in mind that the "have nots" are also dartmouth alumni and have run and won fair elections processes now the "insiders" intend to steal rights won during hard fought races from the very people who contribute to the well being of the college i have been through such academic fights before phi beta kappa is a stunning example where "beauty contests " pomp and circumstance and the willingness to grovel the lowest are the main qualifying factors for "elective" office the reward for which is the occasional upscale lunch or dinner i learned while working in congress to always "follow the money " my money will not be going to dartmouth until it reforms itself into what it was intended and used to be f marian chambers  graduated wichita kan the plight at dartmouth reflects partially a similar though more sinister and injurious process now under way at my alma mater colgate university not only are concerned and dedicated alumni ae who are trying to gain rights to nominate and elect board members being stiff armed by the entrenched board and administration a la dartmouth but the university has brazenly confiscated the property land and houses of greek social organizations without any vote of alumni ae the solution abrupt and sweeping changes across all lines of university authority to ensure all interested alumni ae administration faculty and students are heard and receive balanced and reasonable decisions from freely elected board members edward a ross jr spring texas mr rago in describing mr rodgerss struggle to make dartmouths undergraduate education "really really good " didnt ask more thoughtful questions of mr rodgers or look deeper and more objectively into the conflict as a result i suspect he missed the critical core of the dispute why for example did he not ask mr rodgers the obvious specifically how does he define a strong college education and i also wonder why mr rago neglected to interview any voices on the other side of the issue such as the college administration or the current trustee board chair id bet the farm that he would have found that the two groups share very similar broad goals of keeping dartmouths undergraduate education as strong as ever but they have very divergent core educational philosophies in terms of curriculum content and basic pedagogy that difference and the narrow mindedness its engendering on both sides of the divide is probably whats driving the alumni governance battle at dartmouth ted scheu middlebury vt dartmouth alumni are fortunate to have a man like t j rodgers to represent their views and a mechanism that allows those alumni to elect leaders like him to its board of trustees as an alum of columbia my views have no comparable representation of which i am aware when i hear about columbia pursuing policies such as the banning of rotc and its lack of punishment for students who abuse conservative speakers i realize i have no recourse whatsoever shane cotner bloomfield hills mich nonprofit corporate governance has become a high profile issue because dartmouths "members " its alumni are actually having contested elections and exercising their democratic franchise many nonprofit governance "gurus" typically hired by paid executive staff or often in bred volunteer leadership champion small cohesive boards while this certainly makes for efficient decision making it does not necessarily lead to optimal decision making this advice has already resulted in the virtual disempowerment of the membership in national sports governing bodies what is surprising is that there is little empirical evidence in support of this radical change in traditional nonprofit governance nonprofit corporations do not face the market and shareholder discipline that business corporations do transparency and accountability to an active membership are among the few ways to inject outside review and rejuvenating new ideas engaged members provide needed oversight when a small overly collegial board becomes too dependent on professional staff to perform their monitoring function adequately the first study to explore the role of membership in ensuring good nonprofit governance was just released and bears out the traditional importance of a strong involved membership "nonprofit governance in the united states findings on performance and accountability from the first national representative study" urban institute center on nonprofits and philanthropy among the findings was that nonprofit boards with directors elected by the members have a high correlation with board "activity in multiple internal and externally oriented roles e g fund raising financial oversight planning monitoring programs setting policy " this potent empirical insight deserves more attention in the debate over the composition of the dartmouth board and nonprofit governance generally michael e malamut boston
