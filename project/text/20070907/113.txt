weekend journal review television the joys of sex hbos new drama "tell me you love me" sundays p m et pt in which a therapist helps assorted couples address marital malaise is billed as a "provocative exploration of intimacy " its also one evidently that strives to tear back bedcovers and television taboos its not surprising therefore that the show has benefited from overheated advance press no soft focus here an aging couple the therapist and her retired husband enacts foreplay to a jarringly incongruous pop music soundtrack a middle aged mom neglected by her husband watches forlornly as he engages in the auto erotic act that he prefers in lieu of sex with her a more assertive wife one driven by baby lust uses a venerable method to procure sperm from her husband for a volume assessment in one of many scenes in which the camera angles are not so much candid as utterly unabashed an exhaustive catalog of sexual acts is graphically depicted and no detail that can shock is kept off camera the therapist who looks like one of those sage and seasoned women in the eileen fisher ads is completing a book called "bed dread " and her clients are her raw sometimes very raw material they seem meant to represent the life stages of troubled relationships the young couple hes monogamy phobic she wants to call off the wedding at the th hour the politely stressed out young professionals and the desexualized something parents who now bond over little league but not much else "tell me you love me" is per hbos declaration certainly "provocative " but is it "intimate" while there is an intimacy to the shooting the camera gets into dark corners and lingers sometimes uncomfortably on the pained or ecstatic faces of the actors there are few revelatory episodes between the husbands and wives themselves in the shared moments the moments in which intimacy often occurs in real life not in bed or at the therapists office that is but in the carpool or the cooking of dinner the script falls apart instead of exploring marital relationships through these moments or through intelligent conversation the writers telegraph the couples conflicts by having them engage in leaden repartee wife "honey we dont do anything anymore its been almost a year " husband "we do we do in my version of things " wife "what does that mean " husband "it means i love you " such nonorganic dialogue quickly becomes boring for viewers the directors seem to have lavished so much energy on the choreography of the sex scenes that they have nothing left for verbal expression we hope that frustrated wife and disengaged husband learn to communicate if only so that we might start to sympathize with one or the other of them the same goes for the other couples who seem to use their tongues for everything except talking by having the characters speak in inarticulate half phrases the makers of the series may have been striving for a certain gritty realism but the dialogue is mostly about banalities with little insight or humor to leaven the script one couple argues academically and numbingly about whether he may or may not cheat on her some day a theme interrupted only by makeup sex onscreen another pairs infertility problem grinds on with only copulation to relieve the mounting monotony as it were little else happens between these pairs they are stuck and we are stuck with them by the end were left longing for them to communicate verbally if not with each other then at least with us "the camden " a "p o v " documentary tuesday p m on pbs check your local listings explores the theme of civil disobedience in america and whether the rule of law can itself serve as an instrument of injustice the camden were members of the "catholic left " ordinary law abiding middle class americans radicalized by the vietnam war who broke into a government building in order to destroy draft records tried on several felony counts they were ultimately acquitted in a groundbreaking case that became a turning point in the antiwar movement the conflict in southeast asia was so immoral in their view that breaking into the camden n j selective service office an act likely to lead to social shunning and imprisonment was a risk well worth taking a "tentacle of power reached into your house and took your son " explains one member of the group at a time when americans were not wont to question the wisdom of the men making decisions in washington the group had we are told little recourse but to send a message up the chain of power through small acts of defiance footage of the war in vietnam shown here may be reminiscent of scenes broadcast from iraq today but it is more raw lacking the mesmerizing network packaging of this slicker era brutal scenes of field surgery and wounded infants alternate with other visual hallmarks of the era the shaggy hair and thick glasses of the camden and the groovy sideburns of a freshman dan rather reporting on the trial the war protesters an auto factory worker a student a navy veteran a social worker and several catholic priests among others were a callow guerrilla force the nixon administration feared the catholic wing of the antiwar movement we learn because its members couldnt be depicted as irresponsible hippies the fbi sought to make an example of the camden but the jury sickened by the war and the nixon white house turned the tables on them the filmmakers let both the accused and the fbi agents speak for themselves though some might still argue today that the rule of law is sacrosanct and that the protesters did indeed have legal alternatives to their actions the agents seem after all these years to be philosophical about the outcome of the prosecution while the powers behind the war machine are presented as dishonest and sinister the documentary persuasively reveals the essential decency of both the fbi agents and the vietnam era activists they sought to deter
