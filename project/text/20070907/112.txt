weekend journal review film to yuma gets derailed by epic ambitions crowes vivid villain shadow of the moon is eloquent poignant the first thing to be said about james mangolds remake of " to yuma" is that its a thoroughly modern showcase for fine actors russell crowe as the outlaw ben wade a bad guy with a tinge or a twinge of good christian bale as the rancher dan evans a forlorn guy who finds his inner hero gretchen mol dallas roberts peter fonda as a bounty hunter and the glint eyed scene thieving ben foster as wades henchman still the modernization has bestowed mixed blessings the basic plot survives intact and intriguing as ever the picture looks great phedon papamichaels elegant color cinematography has replaced charles lawton jr s elegant black and white cinematography and the action sequences are impressive for a while yet the whole enterprise is seriously out of scale what began half a century ago as a small taut western has become an extended self serious and in the end ludicrously distended spectacle that seems to bring the yuma train to the station minutes late the starting point of the plot is a conflict of interests that turns into a clash of values after the infamous wade is captured by lawmen evans who is broke and about to lose his ranch volunteers for a few hundred dollars to deliver the outlaw to a train that will take him to trial wades interest is in escaping of course or buying his escape evans anything but an idealist is interested only in the reward the question is whether the rancher can be bought but its not the only question in a film originally based on a story by elmore leonard that explores issues of morality and integrity does every man have his price as wade believes or can something more govern human behavior hint keep an eye out for something more russell crowe looking cheerfully dissolute with a smirk beneath an obligatory black hat keeps all eyes riveted on him even when the mind games ben wade plays with his captor wear thin wade is a villain by his own admission indeed by his own insistence but a complex seductive one who quotes the bible and does an admirable pencil sketch of a woman he admires christian bale a specialist in mutedness risks painting dan evans as a dislikable weasel as well as a mercenary but theres ample room for the characters growth and the actor fills it now and then though both men grow so muted that they seem to be trying to outminimalize one another the director mr mangold has a gift for working with actors he displayed it in "walk the line " and he uses it here to elicit vivid performances from his supporting cast as well as his stars i found peter fondas presence particularly moving and at the other end of the chronological scale i liked logan lermans performance as the ranchers young son but the film gets to be cluttered with picturesque characters and their posturings a plethora of poses scowls and leers and one can debate the ambiguities of the ending which substantially resembles the original but the febrile and semicoherent action climax that precedes it leaves logic in the dust instead of taking on seven gunmen as in the original the movies newly minted man of honor must now shoot his way through what amounts to a whole town thats not to enshrine the version which was directed by delmer daves as a masterpiece that contemporary hollywood vandals have defaced and clearly theres no going back to a time when a small taut feature was enough to bring an audience to a theater in our own time though when movies must compete with many media and producers want their features to be big events its worth thinking about what made the original noteworthy the performances to be sure glenn ford and van heflin were superb and the classic theme of a single man of probity carrying the day but the strengths of the first " to yuma" were enhanced by its proportionality an intimate story told in minutes the story is no bigger in the new version which goes on for minutes and its certainly not better in the shadow of the moon thanks to who they are and what theyre talking about the talking heads of "in the shadow of the moon" are more dramatic than the heroes of most dramas nine of them are apollo astronauts who have walked on the moon one michael collins served as apollo s command module pilot so that neil armstrong who doesnt appear in the film and buzz aldrin who does could become the first two of earths human beings who have earned that distinction when apollo blasted off on a hot july morning in i was there at cape canaveral sitting cross legged in a patch of tall grass and taking notes in a reporters notebook so im obviously receptive to the film it was a singular moment in my life but it was of course a singular moment in the life of the nation a time when soaring american ambition was matched by stunning achievement this magnificent documentary directed by david sington and presented by ron howard rises to the occasion by interspersing its interviews with nasa footage that evokes the grandeur of the whole apollo adventure the picture quality ranges from astoundingly crude its hard to believe that the whole world was transfixed by those blurry tv images transmitted live of armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface to remarkably sharp apollo s gene cernan and harrison schmitt both interviewed here tooling around that surface in a lunar rover and of course we see the apollo photograph that has come to be known as "earthrise " the unprecedented portrait of as one astronaut puts it "that jewel of earth hung in the blackness of space " in the run up to apollo there was whimsical talk of sending up a poet the favored candidate was marianne moore to tell us what the moon was really like no consecrated poet ever made the cut but the men in this film are no slouches when it comes to language edgar mitchell speaks of his ecstasy at the realization that the molecules of his body his crew and their spacecraft were all created in some ancient star michael collins speaking of apollo s destination says "i did not sense any great invitation on the part of the moon for us to come into its domain i sensed a hostile place even a scary place " and dave scott speaking of our planetary launching pad says "it truly is an oasis and we dont take very good care of it " words that make you think images that make you gasp dvd tip ron howard directed "apollo " a dramatized account of the near disastrous mission during which three astronauts played by tom hanks kevin bacon and bill paxton struggled to find their way back to earth in a crippled space capsule dramatization doesnt mean vulgarization the film succeeds brilliantly at organizing great gobs of information into powerful drama
