weekend journal the drivers seat chrysler town &amp country chryslers comeback kid new town &amp country is best vehicle for &# smooth and serene theres no more banal a category in the auto industry than the mid &# luxury vehicle car makers put out dozens of these models and even the better ones arent particularly interesting from the sleepily competent lexus es sedan to the crude but effective infiniti g coupe to the pseudo high tech styling of the acura rdx sport utility vehicle this price range promises little more than pretentiousness and profits you get the former the auto maker reaps the latter and everyone else is left to observe that youre not very secure in your self image perhaps this analysis is a bit harsh but its not for nothing that this segment is called "near luxury " truly the vehicles are nearer to common ordinary transportation this makes it fitting and deliciously ironic that the best &# vehicle on the market would be a minivan surely no one who plunks down that same amount on something like the laughable jaguar x type sedan a low budget ford in disguise would agree but its likely he or she has never driven the chrysler town &amp country limited either calling it the "cadillac of minivans" would be true to the spirit of the phrase and please dont let even the slightest note of sarcasm creep into your voice when you say it the limited is the class of chryslers completely redesigned minivan line which also includes the dodge grand caravan a model that can be had for as little as &# but the &# limited shouldnt and wont be mistaken for its economy class siblings as this is the nicest most comfortable and best riding vehicle chrysler sells hands down excepting perhaps the c the muscular sedan that heavily influenced the new minivans styling the town &amp country is the most attractive thing youll see at a chrysler dealership pictures dont do the vehicle justice a black limited it should be available in no other color was dropped off at my house on a friday by the end of the weekend i was nearly convinced that the "new chrysler " freed of its former german owners at daimler has a shot at its goal of taking its namesake brand upscale of course thats not going to happen with boat anchors like the aspen crossfire and sebring in the lineup but the town &amp country is another proposition entirely if its formal upright stance and simple conservative styling are the harbinger of things to come chrysler should at least be able to bury lincoln once and for all granted this is neither a tall order nor a particularly enviable outcome but good riddance just the same while the town &amp countrys resemblance to a vintage hearse especially in the "d pillar" at the rear corners may not scream american luxury to all comers its a credible stand in for the proverbial "long black limousine " indeed the limited floats along like a chauffeured livery vehicle aided by its long wheelbase and its soft leather and suede seats offer an executive grade experience the level of quiet refinement achieved in this minivan is heretofore unheard of in any chrysler product as is the quality of the interior materials the steering and suspension seem to have been designed by engineers who actually spoke to one another during the development process its still a minivan with the requisite soft suspension and lots of body roll but the vehicle is predictable and easy to control the town &amp country feels stable at all reasonable speeds and even plenty of unreasonable ones rates of travel more easily attained by choosing the new top of the line engine this liter v puts out horsepower and its a motor worthy of a sports sedan with a nice growl under hard acceleration but smooth and serene otherwise its standard on the limited and should be one of the first options anyone buying a chrysler minivan thinks about ordering coupled to a six speed automatic the big v not only outpaces chryslers anemic liter horsepower v but does so without incurring a fuel economy penalty i got about miles per gallon over miles of highway and local driving the epas official rating is mpg combined thats nothing to get too excited about but its in line with toyotas sienna and slightly better than youll do in most of the overpriced "crossovers" that auto makers are pushing as minivan surrogates now that suvs have gone gauche of course the common measure of any real minivans worth is found in its feature list suffice it to say that some shoppers of such vehicles would gladly buy an ox cart as long as it offered dvd players for every passenger and required a census to determine just how many cupholders were present thats why chrysler isnt shy about offering anything and everything in its new minivans from seats that swivel around to encircle a table between the second and third rows to three kids channels of sirius satellite television much of this stuff is as boring to read about as it is fun to play with while youre on the road so well cut the discussion short by saying that the option list on the town &amp country isnt at the end of the day as much of an entry luxury value proposition as the town &amp country limited offers its not going to be cross shopped against the bmw i and hummer h anyone with the income and inclination to drive home a limited is also likely to look at the top of the line honda odyssey and toyota sienna minivans the odyssey does have an excellent feature that deactivates up to three cylinders of its v engine while cruising which should give it the edge in fuel economy however honda has yet to announce the revised fuel economy rating of the model a less compelling case can be made for the sienna in that it can be ordered with all wheel drive yet neither of the competitive minivans can quite match the chryslers comfort and sophistication let alone its visual appeal or feature list the town &amp country limited is just competing on a wholly different level
