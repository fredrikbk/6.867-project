weekend journal taste de gustibus child labor "kid nation " which airs sept on cbs is a social petri dish for the small screen the now widely publicized reality show puts unsupervised kids ages to together to see if they can make a better go of civilized society than their parents dropped in a small new mexico "ghost town " the youngsters were asked to create a functioning economy and government complete with a candy store a "saloon" selling root beer for a nickel and weekly town hall meetings the show aims in the networks words to answer one of historys great conundrums "can these incredible kids build a better society can they succeed where adults have failed " its unclear how adults have failed but perhaps were to assume that left to their own devices teenagers would have accomplished world peace by now in fact cbs may be engaged in a different experiment can grown ups resist the opportunity to use kids as pawns to win lawsuits or make political points lets start with the parents who dragged their little darlings into audition rooms in the first place and signed the yard long contracts on their behalf these "guardians" are now complaining about everything from too little oversight resulting in at least one child drinking bleach to too much oversight some of the youngsters were reportedly fed scripted lines dont be surprised though if they hire a lawyer and start shaking down the network for some postcontractual compensation meanwhile new mexico attorney general gary king is investigating whether children who carried water buckets and cleaned latrines were "working" in violation of state and federal child labor laws raising the question of whether acting like youre working is really work shocking as this behavior may be to parents of the playstation set its hardly child abuse each kid is being paid a &# wage plus has the chance of winning &# at intervals throughout the show they also all get to appear on tv which judging from the antics of people at ballgames is the highest satisfaction life affords nonetheless the los angeles daily news a paper with a following in the show business community has lent dignity to the idea that children are being exploited "one hundred years ago children routinely toiled long hours in sweatshops and were used as human beasts of burden on farms in our modern society that sort of treatment is not acceptable " the paper opined maybe in the age of reality television laboring in show business just isnt as glamorous as it used to be but parents did not have to thumb deeply into the pages of us weekly or watch too many reruns of "the simple life" to know that it can be an occasionally unpleasant occupation meanwhile a minor consideration which represents child stars has aligned with the bizparentz foundation to expose the show as a farce "havent we come to expect this sort of thing from corporations concerned only with boosting ratings and the bottom line " one showbiz blogger laments oh the disillusion of it all the whole controversy has been manna to one group however the screen actors guild which has been looking for an opportunity to clamp down on reality shows in which nonunion amateurs are said to be stealing from the mouths of hollywoods professional starving waiters its true that the &# stipend paid to each child which works out to less than &# an hour isnt exactly dakota fanning cash but its more than most year olds make from their summer jobs reality tv has long been the nemesis of the unions whose power depended on an entertainment oligopoly that itself is rapidly being blown up by the internet youtube and the like but if they want to know why shows like "kid nation" that at least attempt a family friendly premise are catching on heres a clue a study from the parents television council reported this week that sexual and violent content has climbed to record levels during traditional family programming time but the most wholesome fare was the reality shows nonetheless the response to "kid nation" is unsurprising in a culture that increasingly tries to protect kids and not just kids from everything including second hand smoke and sugary bottled juices the one thing you cant protect kids from is themselves as the saying goes kids are people too with all the mischief included if that ends up being the lesson of "kid nation " it might actually be a useful one ms levy is a journal senior editorial writer based in washington
