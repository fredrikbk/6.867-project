ratings firms practices get rated sec probes if conflicts fueled subprime troubles in the wake of mortgage market turmoil regulators plan to probe how the big credit rating companies are paid and whether they are independent enough of the wall street firms that issue bonds the securities and exchange commission and state attorneys general in new york and ohio have begun to examine how the ratings firms evaluated subprime mortgage backed securities that grew into a trillion dollar market the ratings firms include mcgraw hill cos standard &amp poors the moodys investors service unit of moodys corp whose stock has soared in recent years and fitch ratings a unit of fimalac sa of paris wall street bankers churned out profits in recent years by bundling mortgages into securities and selling them to investors ratings firms played an important role because they gave investment grade ratings to many of those securities making it easier for wall street firms to sell the bonds hundreds of those securities have since been downgraded by the ratings companies though that is a small portion of all the securities graded by the ratings firms the reversal contributed to a rout in credit markets last month and has sparked criticism of the ratings firms critics point out that ratings firms financial fortunes are closely tied to the volume of securities deals and that higher ratings often spur deals on by making securities easier to sell in recent years mortgage backed securities have become a major profit driver at moodys from to the growth in the mortgage market helped moodys stock price triple while its profit climbed a year on average the firms ceo raymond mcdaniel received a compensation package of &# million last year about double his pay package in and triple what his predecessor made in s&amp p as a unit of a larger public company isnt required to release compensation figures this type of financial information is likely to be scrutinized by the various state and federal regulators while ratings firms generally disclose the amount they collect to rate different kinds of bonds the sec wants to see whether clients that sell more deals and thus generate more revenue for ratings firms tend to get better ratings while there is no evidence so far of this kind of preferential treatment regulators are interested in examining the question given the lucrative nature of the mortgage market one person familiar with the matter said "were going in to look at the conflicts of interest both in how they are paid and in their standards for rating " said erik sirri director of the secs division of market regulation after testifying on capitol hill on wednesday in new york state attorney general andrew cuomo has subpoenaed documents from s&amp p and fitch as part of a broader probe into the mortgage market in ohio attorney general marc dann is looking into the ways that rating firms interacted with wall street underwriters "the more we look at it the more we realize that these firms are important " said mr dann ratings firms which say they did nothing improper contend they remained independent evaluators of the securities even as their ratings business grew with the exploding mortgage backed security market s&amp p and fitch spokesmen said their firms are cooperating with the investigations and they look forward to discussions about how the ratings process works s&amp ps spokesman added that the firms ratings criteria are "publicly available non negotiable and consistently applied " a moodys spokesman said "we have received various government inquiries and we will fully assist with each of these " the ratings firms are only one piece of the vast mortgage market but they are an important cog at a time when the business is under scrutiny the senate banking committee and the house financial services committee are planning hearings about the role of ratings firms in subprime mortgages or those made to less creditworthy borrowers which have been hit by the recent decline in housing prices investors have lost billions of dollars and many homeowners face foreclosures prompting ratings firms to lower ratings on hundreds of mortgage backed bonds ratings firms publish bond ratings that express an opinion about the likelihood of default firms like moodys and s&amp p have been rating corporate bonds for generations using ratings from safer triple a bonds down to junk bond levels recently one of the fastest growing segments of their business has been rating complicated pools of mortgages and other consumer backed debt their role can be tricky because the firms are paid by the companies that issue the bonds and not the buyers making things tougher is the desire by bond issuers to have their bonds evaluated by the firm willing to give the highest rating issuers often work with the rating firms to restructure the securities that are deemed high risk or even attempt to get another firm to rate the bonds earlier this summer moodys said its market share dropped to from in rating commercial mortgage deals after it increased standards making it harder for wall street firms to get high ratings on the bonds they sold ratings firms employ both analysts and committees to evaluate securities in a kind of checks and balances system to minimize conflicts of interest the analysts dont participate in fee negotiations and their pay doesnt depend on the fees garnered from deals they rate while overall compensation at moodys rose about a year from to much of that was the result of additional staff since moodys spending on compensation and benefits roughly doubled to about &# million last year from about &# million in according to the moodys data the average compensation package at the firm rose about from to to about &# from &# the moodys spokesman said the firms "compensation practices are in line with the industry " those salaries are low by the standards of wall street where many analysts find jobs after working for the ratings firms that has led some critics to question whether analysts might go easy on bond ratings so they dont alienate issuers who might be prospective employers down the road sylvain raynes a former moodys analyst who is now a principal at valuation advisory firm r&amp r consulting argues that such direct moves should be prohibited unless the analyst takes at least two years away from the ratings business julia whitehead a senior adviser at boutique investment bank miller mathis says it would be hard to change the model of bond issuers paying ratings firms but she argues ratings firms should be held more accountable when they do a poor job rating bonds see related letter "letters to the editor how s&amp p protects integrity of credit ratings" wsj sept
