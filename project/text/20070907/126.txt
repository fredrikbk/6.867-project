pavarotti is a huge loss to opera fans and in the classical music industry its also sparking a frenzy over how best to replace him tenors who have labored in mr pavarottis shadow are jockeying to take his place atop the opera pyramid classical labels and opera houses meanwhile are readying a barrage of pavarotti products and events from tribute concerts to multi album reissues mr pavarotti died yesterday at age in his hometown of modena italy after a yearlong battle with pancreatic cancer now the music industry is striving to strike a balance between showing respect to a cherished star and moving strategically to fill a major void mr pavarotti was one of classical musics most bankable names selling more than million recordings world wide over his lifetime decca his record label for years estimates he has generated more than &# billion in revenue for the company in mr pavarotti and tenors jose carreras and placido domingo formed the lucrative "three tenors" group and their debut recording from that same year "carreras domingo pavarotti the three tenors in concert " remains the best selling classical record in history the recordings the trio made together have sold an estimated million copies opera houses and classical labels are set to mount a huge marketing push to capitalize on the attention generated by mr pavarottis death last night in an event planned just hours after the singers passing the metropolitan opera in new york kicked off an eight night series of broadcasts of mr pavarottis performances on sirius satellite radio the house is also mounting an exhibition of pavarotti photographs and memorabilia such as the ornate costume he wore for "tosca" at its hall this month to coincide with opening night some of the biggest moves will come from decca a unit of vivendi sas universal music group the label has been planning a homage for some time during mr pavarottis illness the company consulted with the singer about a series of tribute reissues of his work on tuesday decca will rerelease the album "pavarottis greatest hits " first released in then on nov decca will release a deluxe box set with newly remastered versions of studio recordings made by mr pavarotti during his career decca says it also plans other commemorative albums that will include books and dvds with the music but those are on hold until further discussions with mr pavarottis wife nicoletta mantovani his former assistant whom he married in "his wishes would always be respected with regards to various albums so we will be discussing these new commemorative albums with her " says decca spokesman liam toner the real drama however is the race to succeed mr pavarotti as the opera worlds most in demand tenor contenders several of whom have been strategically positioning themselves to appeal both to hard core opera fans and mainstream listeners in recent years include italys salvatore licitra mexicos rolando villazon and italys "popera" star andrea bocelli mr pavarotti was when he first performed as one of the three tenors frances roberto alagna dubbed by some "the fourth tenor" was considered a front runner until he stormed off the stage at la scala in december after being booed bruce zemsky of zemsky green artists management represents four of the singers whose names have been floated as possible successors to mr pavarottis legacy mr villazon mexicos ramon vargas argentinas marcelo alvarez and germanys jonas kaufmann mr zemsky says he has booked all four tenors for at least three performances a week through mr alvarez is doing his first solo album for decca in july while mr kaufmanns is due out in january meanwhile mr villazon will have his solo debut at carnegie hall on dec something mr pavarotti did in mr villazon is also making a film version of "la boheme" in paris in february the title of top tenor is of course an unofficial one but will likely be judged by members of the industry on the basis of leading roles in new productions mounted on the stage of major opera houses the metropolitan opera in new york has messrs kaufmann licitra and alagna booked for separate appearances this season decca currently has contracts with a number of tenors including messrs kaufmann and bocelli and englands russell watson and perus juan diego florez but according to mr toner decca is placing its biggest bet on mr kaufmann perhaps the least known of the group mr kaufmann performed last year at londons royal opera and was "a sensation " mr toner says "he was in the studio two months later " mr toner says that decca currently has no interest in releasing a variation of the "three tenors" album by replacing mr pavarotti with a new tenor "we have had that thought of course " says mr toner "but we realize that it would be an inferior me too situation and wouldnt work " he adds that the voices of the three tenors were in the same range which is rare and would be difficult to duplicate instead decca is hoping to develop a performer like mr kaufmann as a solo superstar costa pilavachi president of emi classics is backing a different tenor englands ian bostridge whose new album comes out this fall in the u s "he is the top tenor of his type in the world " said mr pilavachi "there is nobody better in the english language " many in the music world say no one has emerged who can truly match mr pavarottis vocal talent mr pilavachi formerly the president of decca says that while mr alagna and mr villazon are "closest to pavarotti at least in terms of what they sing " they dont rival the power of his voice mr pilavachi says he has been looking for new talent in places like bulgaria and russia "we are very attentive to rumors of new singers these days " he says "and they can come from anywhere now not just from spain or italy or the u s " in june a former cellphone salesman from australia paul potts won the english television talent show "britains got talent" for his operatic singing skills and landed a record deal with sony bmg by july he had released an album which hit no on the british album charts mr zemsky who represents tenors with his partner alan green says he has acquired a dozen new singers in just the past two years alone and he receives between five and seven resumes and calls a week from hopeful tenors recently he got up at a m to audition one such hopeful at the rome airport where the singer worked as a security guard "thats how badly we are looking for new people " he says unfortunately he says the tenor "wasnt any good " up and coming tenors face some new challenges todays opera performances require more acting and physical exertion from singers than productions of decades past and at a time when many of the metropolitans productions are simulcast to movie theaters with close ups of the performers singers are expected to show youthful looks and a new level of fitness "the strategy now is to replace the appeal of one pavarotti with a new generation of artists we are looking for great singers who can also act " says peter gelb general manager of the metropolitan opera but while physical attractiveness is more important for todays opera singers mr pilavachi says "if anybody came along with mr pavarottis vocal skills today no matter what they looked like they would be snapped up "
