heard the one about al franken senate candidate comedian plays it straight in minnesota campaign gop has video footage minneapolis a man walks into a political campaign and calls his opponent for high public office the presidents lackey no actually he says something cruder more insulting could that help decide which party controls the u s senate the man is al franken the year old former "saturday night live" comedian and the bane of conservative talk radio the campaign is for the senate seat now held by minnesota republican norm coleman and the question is no joke mr coleman is widely considered one of the senates most vulnerable members his defeat would help secure the democrats control of the closely divided senate mr franken still needs to win the democratic nomination before he can face mr coleman but with months to go before the general election hes competitive in the opinion polls he has raised more money than mr coleman has with the help of contributors including comedians dan aykroyd and robin williams and cartoonist garry trudeau his &# million war chest puts him among the years top congressional fund raisers but in a year comedy career much of mr frankens humor has been bawdy and crude not the tight lipped chuckles that minnesotans tend to favor says university of minnesota political scientist lawrence jacobs mr franken is known for "the kind of trash talk and potty mouth that people find offensive " he adds "i can imagine a whole line of attack ads " mr jacobs says and "all of a sudden the challenger is on the defensive " mr franken has a ready response "people should give minnesotans credit for knowing what a joke is and what it isnt " he says before launching into examples of what a joke isnt including the iraq war veterans care and congressional earmarks lorne michaels the producer of "saturday night live " adds that mr frankens humor isnt out of step with a generation that grew up watching the show and its irreverent take on authority "nothing in his resume seems that unusual if youre in the baby boom " he says still the republican party isnt wasting time minutes after mr franken declared his candidacy in february the party released four pages of what it called mr frankens "mean spirited and divisive partisan" remarks among them mr frankens statement in a new statesman magazine interview last fall that mr coleman is "one of the administrations leading b boys " mr coleman calls the slur "out of control vitriol " mr franken says "it was meant as a joke i should have used lap dog and ive said i will use lap dog from now on " among the republicans other examples a proposal to raise money by raffling off former attorney general janet reno as a lap dancer or blasting oldsters into space on pay per view tv "it was hyperbole " mr franken says now a republican party "tracker" also has been following mr franken videotaping his speeches and casual banter with voters "every once in a while i dont do a joke i might have " mr franken says because of the tracker a year old duluth college student mark drake a minnesota republican spokesman says the party is "gathering footage" on mr franken that intense focus on his humor presents a problem for mr franken whose campaign crowds seem to expect a laugh or two in a franken appearance on "the late show with david letterman" last year mr letterman raised what he called "the potential conflict between your comedic instinct versus political instinct " as he urged mr franken to tell a particularly bawdy joke "if you were going to ever run for the senate you wouldnt tell it " mr franken said of the joke which he persuaded mr letterman to tell instead mr franken says his humor was political but nonpartisan during the years he wrote for "saturday night live " that changed in he says when the republicans began to pare funding for social programs while also portraying themselves as the party of family values his response was to write a string of books starting with "rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot" that relentlessly needled republican party luminaries and conservative talk radio he signed on as a talk show host on the liberal air america radio network where he honed his outrage he left that gig in february two years ago he began planning a run for the senate seat that mr coleman won in after the death in a plane crash of mr frankens political idol democratic sen paul wellstone mr franken moved from new york to minneapolis where he had grown up as the son of a printing salesman and spent a year headlining local level party events he now runs his campaign from his downtown minneapolis house a billboard across the street advertises conservative talk show host sean hannity who is a regular object of mr frankens scorn mr frankens chances of winning mr colemans seat are helped by the revival of the democrats liberal base whose politics neatly mirror his own he is also helped by mr colemans support for the iraq war and for president bush who headlined a coleman fund raiser last month in a july poll market researcher surveyusa reported that mr coleman led mr franken by just seven percentage points down from points five months earlier mr coleman attributes his declining poll numbers to voter "cynicism and frustration" and defends his support for the war as doing "what i think is right " he defends his ties to the president by insisting that "those relationships benefit minnesota " citing as an example the quick federal commitment to rebuild the minneapolis bridge that collapsed in august mr franken isnt in for an easy race though his chief rival for the democratic nomination michael ciresi did just as well in a two way surveyusa match up with mr coleman and mr coleman already is attacking mr franken for his support among "hollywood ultra liberals " although mr franken also claims to have other donors who have given him an average &# each but mostly theres mr frankens long comic career all of it written or recorded and much of it directed at the republicans he will have to work with should he be elected "if you ask minnesotans if this is the voice they want to represent them " mr coleman says his voice trailing off to suggest that he thinks they dont indeed in a minnesota public radio survey in may of the people who said they had heard of mr franken said they an unfavorable opinion of him "a candidate whos pretty vanilla might be what voters are looking for " says the university of minnesotas mr jacobs that could be especially true given minnesotans election of jesse "the body" ventura as governor in mr ventura the former professional wrestler became the target of jokes many by mr franken until he announced he wouldnt seek re election these days on the campaign trail mr franken offers only a few corny jokes "ive been married years many of them happy " he told a group of democratic picnickers in oakdale a minneapolis suburb on a recent saturday as his wife sat gamely nearby after a few wheezes mr frankens stump speech quickly gives way to indignation over the iraq war and government spending on veterans health and education that message got a warm reception followed by requests for mr frankens autograph and queries about other comedians of his acquaintance "hes paul wellstone returned " said tom olson a retired pharmacist who attended a chisago county party picnic later in the day "wellstone stood for stuff and al franken is like that " mr franken faces months more of these picnics barbecues spaghetti dinners what he calls "bean feeds " "im having a gas " he sometimes tells picnickers during an event but he didnt serve up the gag to the dozen picnickers at oakdale the campaign is "energizing " he told them "i love it "
