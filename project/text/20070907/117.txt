weekend journal taste houses of worship hippie shakeup remembering that christians were part of the s too like many children of the s arne and marie bergstrom rebelled against the expectations of their middle class families in halfway through their undergraduate studies at the evangelical bethel college in st paul minn they dropped out got married sold all their possessions and went to do gods work their journey took them to papua new guinea sudan and the philippines where they adopted two girls they had two sons as well when they settled back in the u s arnes beat was disaster relief he went to rwanda kosovo and turkey after a massive earthquake to refugee camps at the iran afghanistan border marie became an award winning fifth grade teacher a couple of months ago our church in wheaton ill had to bid the bergstroms goodbye they were moving again close to seattle where arne took a position at world vision the christian relief and development agency if you had seen them standing in front of the congregation you could hardly have failed to recognize them as aging hippies maries long straight hair arnes grizzled beard and they are both runners thin as rails the bergstroms story is an inspiring tale of faith in action but it is also a goad to rethink what we mean when we talk about "the s" which of course cant really be contained within a year span canonical accounts from both the left and the right have systematically ignored played down and distorted the religious dimensions of that tumultuous time not long ago i took a look at a half dozen histories of the s every one of them mentioned students for a democratic society only one of them mentioned the catholic charismatic revival that began on a retreat held by duquesne university faculty and students early in or the parallel influence of pentecostalism on protestants especially of the evangelical variety that changed the face of worship and piety in countless american churches and connected american believers with the global surge of pentecostalism and what about the lubavitchers and similar orthodox jewish movements that began to attract young people at the same time why this ludicrous disparity in coverage simple in the master narrative of these histories shaped by a peculiarly complacent conception of civil society what millions of people happened to be doing in churches or synagogues isnt worthy of notice especially if it contradicts the assumption that the trajectory of the s was taking a whole generation away from organized religion sure the slideshow will feature maharishi mahesh yogi but a bunch of christians speaking in tongues please note too that just as chroniclers from the left want to preserve the zeitgeist of the s from any contamination by the holy spirit so chroniclers from the right conservative christians in particular are wont to cast that decade as a time of dramatic national apostasy a turning away from god the bitter harvest of which we are now reaping to acknowledge that the reality was much messier that the bergstroms are as well suited as jim morrison or janis joplin to represent the spirit of that time would require these pundits to start from scratch what should be done for starters we need a new generation of historians perhaps one with a less personal stake to look at the s with fresh eyes there are signs that this is starting to happen in for example columbia university press published doug rossinows "the politics of authenticity liberalism christianity and the new left in america " which showed how various strands of postwar christian thought played a part in the formation of the new left mr rossinows account goes much deeper than the familiar images of william sloane coffin et al at the barricades just this year baylor university press published preston shiress "hippies of the religious right " a rather plodding book that doesnt quite live up to its marvelous title but that nevertheless makes a case for its counterintuitive thesis "conservative activism" the trademark of the religious right "was actually a faithful expression of commitment to radical engagement that had been engendered and nurtured by sixties youth during the counterculture " it isnt surprising that both mr rossinow and mr shires were writing from the peripheries of high academe at the time his book was published the former was at metropolitan state university in the twin cities while the latter is an instructor in history at southeast community college in lincoln neb they were going against entrenched orthodoxies but where they have led the way many will follow not just because they want to come closer to the true meaning of the s but also because scholars desperately need subjects for their endless articles and books "publish or perish" isnt all bad and when the revisionist dust has settled well have an understanding of that tumultuous time that is richer and more capacious a narrative in which people like arne and marie bergstrom will have their place mr wilson is the editor of books &amp culture a bimonthly review
