weekend journal how i spent my summer vacation there were grand plans to read proust sail the pacific and drop pounds nancy keates on the big summer goals of dozens of movers and shakers nobody finished "einstein " no ones backhand got any better and andy borowitz still cant speak italian summer may be a time for cookouts berry picking and cold beer but its also a time for setting goals like a second new years eve many start the season with ambitious plans to lose weight write a screenplay or grow a perfect tomato but summer is also about kicking back and doing nothing to find out whether sloth or diligence prevailed in june we called people to ask them their goals for the summer of course their intentions were impressive but so were the excuses when we checked back in late august to see how they fared "the contractor flaked out" is why restaurateur charlie palmer didnt build a goal post for his sons in the field next to his home in healdsburg calif in june flush with good intentions he said he would do the work himself "i have a tractor " he said neither judith rodin president of the rockefeller foundation nor tina brown author of "the diana chronicles " improved much at tennis ms rodin stepped on a chair tack on the set of "the charlie rose show" that went through her shoe and into her foot ms brown tripped at heathrow airport and broke her wrist massachusetts sen edward m kennedy fulfilled his goal of spending time aboard his foot schooner he also was successful in painting hes nearly done with a scene he describes as "a lot of sky a lot of sea and sailboats " antonia hernandez a civil rights attorney and ceo of the california community foundation met her goal of reconnecting with her inner homemaker making curtains from scratch for her beach retreat but surfer kelly slater whos proved his determination by winning eight world championships said "too much traveling" was the reason he was unable to stick to his resolution to eat only organic food this summer hollywoods roy disney spent a week at a luxury hawaiian hotel near the finish line of the sailing race hed planned to participate in partly because he worried hed be in the way of the rest of the crew and uzodinma iweala author of "beasts of no nation " didnt get around to writing a screenplay or designing plans for a beach house in nigeria that would run on totally renewable resources and be cost effective to build the novelist did manage to finish "atonement" by ian mcewan and go running or swimming every other day "im only human " he says "the reason you make summer goals is because the stakes are lower youre not trying to kill yourself " the difficulty of achieving summer goals has even been the object of academic study in her paper "competing demands and complementary motives procrastination on intrinsically and extrinsically motivated summer projects " regina conti associate professor of psychology at colgate university found that since summer goals tend to be more intrinsic personally satisfying than extrinsic such as a requirement set by other forces people tend to procrastinate more it isnt enough to just want to improve oneself there has to be some other motivation such as money or a deadline to make people act indeed "too much work" was a common excuse this summer lee cooperman chairman and chief executive of the hedge fund omega advisors had one extremely modest goal spending a long weekend at his sons rental in the hamptons explaining why he didnt expect more time off he tallied up his long hours up at a m on the a m ferry from new jersey to new yorks financial district at his desk by a m not home and in bed until p m when his wife asked him to go on a cruise of the greek isles he reminded her of his daily ferry ride to work "thats my cruise and it only takes six minutes " he told her her reply "she called me a jerk " for some the summer "fun" goals were hardly less ambitious than work goals and often just as focused on displaying achievement maybe thats why some had plans that included "tool around in my foot sailboat" scientist craig venter and "drive my convertible around the connecticut countryside and cook african tagines and stews for guests at my connecticut country house" michael kahn artistic director of the shakespeare theatre company in washington d c jerry abramson mayor of louisville ky intended to hike every new trail and pedal every new bike path in louisvilles acre jefferson memorial forest "the largest municipally owned forest in the country " economist jeffrey sachs cited ending world poverty as his summer plan though he acknowledged that might take more than one summer the book on the most to do lists the page pound "einstein his life and universe " no one in our survey finished it this summer gordon segal founder and chief executive of crate &amp barrel decided that meeting the books author walter isaacson at an aspen colo festival and attending lectures on the subject was enough when it comes to summer year old evan odorney winner of the scripps national spelling bee might have the best answer yet "i dont tend to think about goals i just tend to approach whats there and do it its
