stalled at ground zero the recent preventable deaths of two firemen in the toxic hulk of the deutsche bank building adjacent to ground zero casts a shadow on new york mayor michael bloombergs hands off managerial style it also casts a light on rudy giulianis handling of the cleanup and by extension his governing style as mayor both the cleanup achieved with surprising even defiant speed and the deconstruction of the deutsche bank building which is still standing six years after have involved bitter controversies with the firefighters mr giulianis imperative was to clear ground zero and thus defy the terrorists by returning the city to semi normality as soon as possible however this admirable goal clashed with the firefighters similarly admirable desire to continue searching for the body parts of their lost brothers mr giuliani stood his ground earning the undying enmity of the international association of fire fighters leadership which has demonstrated its political muscle by dogging the former mayor across the presidential campaign trail but engine company which suffered heavy casualties on lost two more men on aug when a fire broke out at the deutsche bank building that still stands as a monument to bureaucratic gridlock the attack produced "the pile" acres of rubble feet high covering over white hot fires that would shoot into the air as cranes lifted away the mountain of girders inspired by anger and unhampered by bureaucracy by may the men in "the pit " american flags on their helmets had laboring heroically cleared the site three months ahead of schedule it was too much to expect such an extraordinary effort to continue despite lofty rhetoric about confounding the terrorists by rebuilding quickly what followed under the aegis of gov george pataki and mayor bloomberg was a quick return to business as usual in the absence of strong leadership new yorks political culture of ferociously clashing interest groups and waltzing elephantine bureaucracies produced subway repairs aside almost nothing additional for five years while the governor zigged and zagged mr bloomberg backed away from his ground zero responsibilities to focus on building a heavily subsidized source of congestion a football stadium on the west side of manhattan mayor bloomberg was so disconnected from ground zero that he didnt even name his full complement of eight members to the lower manhattan development commission the body created to direct the rebuilding until november of mr bloomberg had masterfully lowered expectations in the new york times spoke of how mr bloombergs legacy could be judged by the way he helped lead the reconstruction effort but by he was praised for merely involving himself the mayor whos never had a harsh word for the lumbering port authority bi state bureaucracy that mr giuliani had hoped to dismantle devoted his energies to pushing larry silverstein who pre had leased the world trade center out of the picture on the grounds that he couldnt do the job of rebuilding but its mr silverstein who has planned built and rented the story world trade center the only real above ground progress at ground zero thanks to mr bloomberg the deutsche bank site was handed over to the port authority and the lower manhattan development corporation the lmdc in turn put day to day responsibility for deconstructing the "vertical love canal" in the hands of the lower manhattan construction command center known as the "lm three c " what followed led directly to the tragedy of aug and the death of two more firefighters at the deutsche bank building despite warnings from the department of investigations the lmdc hired john galt a company that had been blocked from doing other work for new york to handle under inflexible epa rules the delicate job of asbestos removal galt had no experience with asbestos removal and violated safety standards with impunity at the same time mr bloombergs fire and buildings departments neglected to inspect the site where the water system needed to fight a fire had been disabled mr bloomberg was busy with his shadow campaign for president and none of this seemed to merit his attention when reporters asked the mayor last week if the "lm triple c " as its sometimes called was being investigated the mayor looked confused "triple c " he said turning to his spokesman who clarified by offering the agencys full name "oh " the mayor said "i have no idea ill take a look and see i dont know who was responsible and were taking a look at that " mr bloombergs answer provides a glimpse of what the clean up might have been like under his auspices mr giuliani sometimes ran rough shod over the citys self serving bureaucracies but his intense hands on involvement with the specifics of governing produced numerous accomplishments in addition to numerous enemies mr bloomberg has neither mr siegel a professor of history at the cooper union for science &amp art is the author of "the prince of the city giuliani new york &amp the genius of american life" encounter books
