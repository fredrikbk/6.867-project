viral technique challenge for aids fighters circumcising africans safely procedure cuts infection but surgeons in rituals lack tools and training bungoma district kenya the recent finding that circumcision dramatically reduces the risk of contracting hiv has global health authorities mobilizing to offer the procedure broadly in africa but introducing mass circumcision presents challenges epitomized by a young man in western kenya kennedy sikuku went to the mud and wattle shack of joseph wanjala for a circumcision kennedys father thought his son was getting treated by a doctor in fact mr wanjala is a nurse and barred by kenyan law from doing the operation over a dusty floor mr wanjala carried out the surgery to mark the passage of the teenager then years old into manhood mr wanjala couldnt stanch kennedys bleeding that set off a three week ordeal in which kennedy contracted a severe infection and escaped death "by a whisker " according to a medic who examined him at his lowest ebb fortunately he was in a study evaluating the quality of locally performed circumcisions and the study team took him to a district hospital for emergency intervention circumcision offers one of the best ways to turn the tide against africas raging aids epidemic but implementing the procedure is fraught with danger in a region with threadbare medical regulation a shortage of doctors and patients who often are minimally educated in the "aids belt" of eastern and southern africa where the disease has taken the biggest toll rates of circumcision are generally low zambia zimbabwe rwanda and malawi all have circumcision rates below in south africa the largest ethnic group the zulus generally do not circumcise kenya is an exception with more than of men circumcised complications from circumcision in this region of kenya are common showing the risks that may arise if health officials push circumcision throughout africa the study in which the younger mr sikuku took part assessed more than boys and teenagers who received circumcisions in it found that of those circumcised by ritual circumcisers who have rudimentary medical training at best suffered side effects such as infections excessive bleeding and pain when urinating even among those who were circumcised in medical settings a category that includes private clinics such as mr wanjalas suffered adverse side effects the rate is often under when modern medical approaches and equipment are used the results were published in in a report funded by the u s government robert bailey of the university of illinois and moi universitys omar egesah led the research the total number of sub saharan africans with the aids virus reached million last year up from million in estimates the joint united nations program on hiv aids known as unaids providing lifelong drug treatment for every aids patient is too costly for poor countries technology to prevent sexual transmission of hiv has remained stalled for decades with no new intervention since the condom attempts to develop an aids vaccine have foundered behavioral methods such as abstinence monogamy and condom use have rarely worked well enough to reverse the trajectory of the epidemic circumcision is inexpensive and according to recent studies sharply reduces the chance of getting infected removing the peniss foreskin causes the newly exposed skin to thicken making it more resistant to microbes also circumcision may improve hygiene and protect against other infections such as syphilis and herpes that can contribute to hiv infection aids experts long noticed that the epidemic was generally worse among noncircumcising people in kenya the adult hiv infection rate among the luo who live along lake victoria and traditionally dont circumcise is estimated to exceed whereas it is just for kenya as a whole according to figures from the kenyan health ministry religious differences also play a role in primarily muslim west african regions such as senegal and northern nigeria boys are circumcised and generally have a lower rate of hiv than in christian areas while circumcision isnt religiously prohibited among most christian groups the practice is less common in kenya the province with the lowest hiv prevalence is the heavily muslim northeast province circumcision isnt the only factor a study of kenyan truck drivers found that muslims reported less use of prostitutes early this decade scientists intrigued by the observations set out to prove the circumcision aids prevention link three research teams working in south africa uganda and kenya conducted clinical trials in which a total of men were randomly assigned to circumcision and noncircumcision groups and tracked to see whether they were infected with hiv such trials are considered the gold standard of medical research the three trials were separate from the one on circumcision safety that involved kennedy sikuku in july the results of the south african trial came out showing a reduction in the risk of acquiring hiv still given the daunting practical hurdles and cultural sensitivities involved in recommending circumcisions policy makers didnt move to roll out the procedure widely then in december the results of the other two randomized trials were announced confirming the first result the new evidence spurred health authorities at the united nations and governments in the u s and africa to prepare to offer widespread circumcision in march the world health organization and unaids formally recommended circumcision to prevent hiv saying the science suggests the policy "will result in immediate benefit to individuals " the groups say they wont carry out the procedure themselves but will provide technical support to those governments that choose to implement it last month the u s said it will provide funding for circumcision programs through the presidents emergency plan for aids relief a spokesman said the u s has already allocated &# million mostly for preparatory work in kenya the ministry of health is finalizing a draft policy that is expected to declare male circumcision "should be promoted " circumcision doesnt make men immune to hiv so they would still have to use condoms or practice monogamy but when combined with those behavioral prevention methods says peter cherutich a member of the kenyan health ministrys male circumcision task force the procedure "could make a huge difference in the hiv epidemic " the problem now for health officials is ensuring safe circumcisions even medical personnel sometimes lack adequate tools such as scissors that are sharp enough to perform the surgery without leaving ragged edges ritual circumcisers who are culturally revered and sometimes less expensive than medical doctors frequently go without sterilization equipment and even bandages circumcision is one of the oldest and most common surgical procedures but it can go awry the penis is rich in blood vessels and so excessive bleeding and infection can occur if the vessels arent properly tied or cauterized the local anesthetic most commonly used in kenya lignocaine can cause irregular heartbeat and even cardiac arrest if it is injected into the bloodstream rather than into the tissue five year old clinton libasia named after president clinton was ritually circumcised last month by year old thomas molama who wore the ceremonial skins of a leopard and a colobus monkey as well as a leather hat festooned with bells colored beads and white buttons mr molama said no one trained him in removing the foreskin he said he learned how to perform the surgery in a dream young clinton removed his pants and mr molamas two assistants wearing tall feathered hats held the boy tight mr molama holding aloft his gleaming knife pulled the boys foreskin taut and sliced it off in less than seconds the operation was over and clinton crying profusely squatted off to the side blood dripping into the grass mr molama doesnt dress the wound or apply antiseptic believing that the cut heals faster without a bandage after a few minutes clintons father vincent libasia who himself had been circumcised by mr molama many years ago took his boy home social forces are motivating more kenyans to have their sons circumcised medically not ritually education has spread the value of sanitary medical procedures the definition of a man is changing from one who can endure intense pain and be a warrior to one who can earn a good living in the modern economy christianity which is widespread in kenya often frowns on rites associated with indigenous religious practices while christians dont see circumcision as a religious requirement some churches have started offering medical circumcisions as a service to their communities still many kenyans especially those with little education dont understand the differences among doctors nurses and outright quacks aineah sachita says he performs circumcisions out of a private clinic that charges the equivalent of about &# for an operation mr sachita keeps about &# of that he estimates he has circumcised boys and says none have had complications with the equivalent of a th grade education he says he learned how to perform circumcisions while working at a clinic in nairobi the capital he started as an office messenger he says but ended up assisting with the surgery actually cutting the foreskin with scissors he produced a photocopied letter of reference from kakamega highway hospital recommending him as a nurses aide but with his name in a different typeface than the rest of the letter the doctor who signed the letter jacob maleche says he doesnt recall mr sachita ever working at the hospital and declares the letter not authentic "weve had a lot of problems" with forged letters he adds mr sachita says the letter is legitimate mr wanjala the nurse who couldnt stop kennedy sikukus bleeding works at a provincial hospital his superiors say he wasnt authorized to perform the surgery outside the hospital authorities say the type of makeshift private clinic he ran during the circumcision season which in his part of kenya comes in august of every even numbered year is illegal mr wanjala admits his clinic was never inspected a prerequisite to a clinic being licensed but insists it was legal along with being a nurse mr wanjala is also a ritual circumciser if his client prefers mr wanjala will perform the surgery with one of his ceremonial knives rather than surgical instruments and with no anesthetic kennedy who received a "medical" rather than ritual circumcision is listed in mr wanjalas log of patients along with the payment of kenyan shillings about &# mr wanjala says he doesnt remember the case late on the day of his circumcision kennedy weak and still hemorrhaging was taken by bicycle on dirt roads to the nearest government clinic there the night nurse called on a local ritual circumciser not a doctor to help her stop the bleeding they failed but the medic in charge of the clinic succeeded the next day while he was recovering at home kennedys wound got infected and gangrene set in at the district hospital where kennedy was finally taken a surgeon says he operated and administered antibiotics keeping kennedy in the hospital for five days he is fine now to eliminate unqualified private practitioners dr cherutich of the kenyan health ministry hopes his country will provide circumcisions free of charge "quacks are not into philanthropy " said dr cherutich "they want money " to pay for the program kenya seeks support from wealthy governments and international organizations with fewer than medical doctors serving a population of more than million dr cherutich says the circumcision task force will consider training nurses to perform circumcision that might not solve the problem he notes because most nurses in kenya are women and most traditional cultures have deep rooted objections to women performing circumcisions circumcision is more than a mere medical procedure meshack riaga chairman of the luo council of elders decries circumcision as a "betrayal" of luo culture and fears it will be "forced" on his people but tradition doesnt hold as much sway these days even before the news broke that circumcision provides protection against the continents most dreaded disease young luo men were increasingly opting for the surgery according to interviews with doctors and ordinary luos one reason is that members of circumcising tribes have ridiculed them as not real men amos abongoh a year old luo man who lives in yala not far from the home of presidential candidate barack obamas paternal grandmother says he got circumcised last month because he believes its more hygienic it can help him avoid hiv and his girlfriend wanted him to do it
