virus suspected as cause of u s honeybee deaths scientists link pathogen with affected colonies other factors still remain new research suggests a virus may be causing the puzzling collapse of honeybee colonies across the u s that has hurt commercial beekeepers and farmers who rely on these bees to pollinate crops a team of scientists said it has found a strong association between a pathogen known as israeli acute paralysis virus or iapv and the deaths of billions of honeybees in the u s the identification of the virus may even suggest a way to fixing the problem breeding bees that are resistant to the bug and then repopulating decimated hives with them at least half of all u s commercial honeybee colonies have been affected by what is known as "colony collapse disorder " "its a virus that really only came to light in the last few months its a surprise " said ian lipkin a scientist at columbia universitys mailman school of public health and a senior researcher on the paper which is being published in the journal science while other countries have reported similar problems among bee colonies the scale of the problem in the u s is especially large bees pollinate more than fruit and vegetable crops whose economic value is estimated at more than &# billion in the u s alone a shortage of honeybees means commercial beekeepers who supply the bees to farmers must spend significant sums to repopulate their hives large producers of agriculture and fruit then pay more to acquire the bees pollinating services in affected colonies a few dead bees are typically found near the hive but most adult bees seem to disappear without a trace some scientists speculate that if an iapv infection is really the cause it may somehow be affecting the bees ability to return to the hive researchers homed in on iapv by using genetic techniques to identify foreign pathogens bacteria fungi and viruses found in bee colonies they found that the iapv virus existed only in the collapsed colonies despite the finding the scientists stress that they have yet to prove a casual link between this virus and the death of billions of bees and iapv probably doesnt act alone other factors such as poor nutrition or the bees exposure to pesticides may also be involved iapv was first identified in israel where it rapidly killed bees within the hives according to dr lipkin he says that the u s virus which doesnt cause the same kind of acute rapid death may be a variant of the israeli one however israeli scientists found that a small number of bees had incorporated part of the viruss genetic material and thereby become immune to it if those survivors could be bred in large numbers said dr lipkin "we could collect those bees and expand colonies" in the u s
