with their exclusive black american express centurion cards "they are finding out " mr contreras says "that carpinteria isnt as low as they thought " kathleen winter a longtime santa barbara real estate agent describes the community as "very much a throwback in a lot of peoples minds carpinteria is what montecito used to be before it was monied " still the towns commercial center is

adding that a buyer could convert the square foot barn into a private office space for a hedge fund a fellow polo player from the middle east recently came for a look mr fell says hes in no rush to sell because he is still building his next home in montecito for years padaro lane consisted mainly of relatively modest second homes many of them owned by residents of the los angeles suburb of pasadena and the central valley city of bakersfield today the more than homes range from shingle covered cape cods to modern manors with floor to ceiling windows along the two mile stretch of road the
