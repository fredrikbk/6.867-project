is wamu out on ledge earlier stumbles cut into banks credibility on mortgage holdings with its share price down more than so far this year washington mutual inc ought to be a textbook buying opportunity for investors hunting for major mortgage lenders that are down but not out wamu has "good liquidity " or diverse sources of funding according to a moodys investors service report last week the seattle thrifts retail banking operation is raking in cheap deposits to help fund new mortgages and about the best thing going for it these days is that it doesnt look like the next countrywide financial corp but stumbles made by wamu long before the credit market turmoil have undermined the credibility that other subprime lenders such as wells fargo &amp co are leaning on to lift their ailing stocks the result even though wamu has tightened underwriting standards for riskier loans many analysts and investors are taking a talk is cheap attitude about the assurances "my opinion is itll get worse " says stuart plesser a standard &amp poors stock analyst who slapped a "sell" recommendation on wamu last week he thinks the share price is likely to sink an additional in the next year in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange wamu shares rose cents to &# about where the stock traded in investors do benefit from the stocks dividend yield now at compared with about for wells fargo and for wachovia corp wamu shares trade at about times projected per share earnings for the next year compared with a median of roughly for its peers in the kbw bank index according to kbw research just three of analysts following the stock are urging investors to buy according to thomson financial with a stock market value of about &# billion wamu had &# billion in subprime mortgages as of june or about of its overall loan portfolio dismal results in the companys home loan unit are expected to sap profit for at least several more quarters partly because of rising loan loss provisions estimated by wamu at &# billion to &# billion for it doesnt help that among the largest u s mortgage lenders wamu last year made the highest proportion of loans to real estate investors or second home buyers according to data filed with federal regulators those loans are considered especially risky generating an outsize share of defaults the mortgage bankers association said last week wamu also is exposed to some teetering mortgage lenders through its little known warehouse funding operation typically wamus mortgage firm customers would make loans then sell them to investors and use the proceeds to pay off the warehouse loans from wamu but the shriveled secondary market has pinched that business for example wamu was the largest warehouse lender to first magnus financial corp of tucson ariz which specialized in prime and alt a mortgages but when lenders demanded that first magnus put up more collateral to compensate for dropping loan values it couldnt sell enough loans to generate the cash and filed for bankruptcy court protection last month that leaves wamu on the hook for about &# billion in loans that first magnus couldnt sell according to bankruptcy court filings wamu chairman and chief executive kerry killinger wasnt available to comment libby hutchinson a wamu spokeswoman says executives feel "quite good" about the thrifts position in the first magnus loans because the delinquency rate is "immaterial" and wamu has plenty of room on its balance sheet to hold the loans if they cant be sold at a profit wamu expects to sell a "significant portion" of the loans next month she adds as for loans backed by nonowner occupied homes that still are in wamus loan portfolio ms hutchinson says they generally have higher credit scores and loan to value ratios than loans where borrowers live in the home "we have been and continue to be comfortable with their performance " the wamu spokeswoman wrote in an email "i know theyve done some poor underwriting " says keith stribling los angeles based co manager of highmark value momentum fund with assets of &# million the fund held shares of wamu as of june down from a year earlier "everyone went after market share and people get less focused on the details " mr stribling says the fund is maintaining its current position wamus mortgage business can tap the federal home loan bank system unlike most of countrywide that is another reason wamu is better insulated from the sort of liquidity squeeze that drove countrywide into last months sale of &# billion of convertible preferred shares to bank of america corp wamu also has been reducing its exposure to option adjustable rate mortgages which let borrowers choose their monthly payment but can increase the total amount owed wamu says it is "very comfortable" with the performance of its option arms citing its more than years in that business but those loans accounted for half its home loan portfolio as of june overall nonperforming assets surged to &# billion from a year earlier wamu just hired away countrywides chief credit officer john p mcmurray who starts at wamu later this month countrywides turmoil aside mr mcmurray "is highly respected" in the industry and will "bring immediate added value " mr killinger said in a statement despite the moves to shore up confidence few investors have forgotten bad bets wamu made in its mortgage hedging operation in when the mortgage business was still booming the flub contributed to a profit slide for the year and fueled doubts that still linger despite a reshuffling of wamus management wamu also had to scale back its ambitious retail bank branch expansion after the effort fizzled in some markets such as chicago and atlanta ms hutchinson the spokeswoman says that in recent years wamu has "reduced or exited business lines to improve profitability and lower risk diversified our revenue sources" and cut costs "to improve efficiency " "the real dilemma of being a value investor with these companies is you dont know how everything is inter related " says john buckingham ceo of al frank asset management inc which has &# million under management "people dont know where the next bombshell is " the laguna beach calif firm known for taking buy and hold positions in beaten up stocks had about wamu shares as of aug down about from a year earlier william nygren manager of the oakmark select fund with nearly &# billion in assets and million wamu shares as of june says wamu just needs some time to navigate the mortgage industrys problems even if the thrift has to sharply increase loan loss reserves or write down loans that would be "trivial in size compared to their deposit base " he says although oakmark selects stake in wamu is down about from early mr nygren said that is mostly a byproduct of fund redemptions over the past year and shouldnt be read as a sign he has cooled on the stock wamu remains the funds largest position mr killinger has said wamu plans to take on between &# billion and &# billion in additional home loans as it tries to seize market share from other lenders fred cannon an analyst with keefe bruyette &amp woods which provides investment banking services to wamu says he expects any new loans to be "similar or worse" than wamus existing portfolio he rates wamus shares the equivalent of a "hold " hopes that wamus profitable retail bank with branches in u s states will attract a takeover also have dimmed some analysts and investors say potential suitors are likely to remain leery until the extent of problems in wamus mortgage portfolio becomes clearer
