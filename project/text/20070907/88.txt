to happen " mr hernandez said valentinos mr sassi who met the duo at a paris textile fair in february says he respects their desire to keep control of their company "we saw these two guys so fresh so enthusiastic so open minded " he says "they werent at all prima donnas " the designers had some leverage in june they won the prestigious council of fashion designers of americas womenswear designer

under a glass on her tray saying he loved fashion and hoped she would pass along his name for an internship at a new york design house some weeks later the office of michael kors called offering mr hernandez a job ms wintour is now a big booster of the proenza schouler label as seniors messrs mccollough and hernandez joined to create a collection using money from their parents it won the schools competition and barneys new york bought the line markus hofels a german venture capitalist put up enough money to fund production for the next year from there mr mccollough says "it started snowballing " growth was strong but the business was still losing money the designers faced other hurdles the italian mills and factories that produced most of their clothes gave preference to larger brands such as ralph lauren and chanel resulting in delivery delays for proenza schouler that meant their clothes faced a greater risk of being marked down because many consumers buy high end clothes at the beginning of a season retailers in japan and other countries wanted the merchandise even earlier which presented huge logistical challenges a turning point for the label came a year ago when they signed on to do a guest collection for target corp for an undisclosed fee which industry observers estimate at &# million or less they created low priced pieces plus some accessories and promoted the line in tv and magazine ads the line which included a &# version of their famous bustier in silk sold out quickly at many target stores some items even resold later on ebay for much higher prices such as &# for a &# top with the money from target the designers bought out mr hofels and began a search for a new investor who could give them an edge in strategy by working with valentinos factories and having a new proenza production manager in italy the designers expect to produce their collections faster and get deliveries to stores sooner valentinos distribution channels will also help proenza get into more stores in europe and asia the designers say their goal is to reach &# million in annual wholesale sales in five years up from about &# million now says shirley cook the labels year old chief executive and partner who will keep her job as part of the valentino deal a new line of sunglasses priced at &# to &# will be shown on the runway today they intend to open a smattering of boutiques around the world valentinos mr sassi says his companys recent ownership change private equity fund permira holding bought a stake from the marzotto family and other investors and is launching a bid for the rest doesnt affect his plans to help expand proenza schouler "europe and asia are huge opportunities for them " he says but "the first priority for now is to support them regardless of whether they break even or do better than that "
