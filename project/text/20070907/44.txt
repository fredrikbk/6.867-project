gold mining and corruption in romania although having a "wide angle" documentary reviewed on the editorial pages of the wall street journal attests to the impact of our pbs series now in its sixth year there are errors in john funds piece on our program "gold futures" "make up your own mine " aug he says the film about the rosia montana mining venture of gabriel resources a canadian mining company in romania "leaves unsaid that half of the villagers voicing opposition have now either sold their homes or will not have to move because they live in a protected area " to the contrary the film expressly says "as of may almost two thirds of the village houses had been purchased or optioned " mr fund also contends that viewers "wont realize the hills hide a huge abandoned communist era mine " in fact that very mine appears in the film large as life in a scene shot before it was closed with the narrator stating that "until the state operated one of the countrys last gold mines in rosia montana " mr fund goes on to endorse the film "mine your own business" over ours reporting that it was made "on a shoestring &# budget largely provided by gabriel resources " that just about says it all &# is hardly a shoestring and given gabriel resources vigorous public relations campaign to drum up support for its project why would anyone regard a film that it financed as truly free of gabriel resources influence again although we appreciate your raising awareness about our film we would rather mr fund didnt publicly cast aspersions regarding our work or our editorial standards unless he is prepared to do so based on accurate descriptions of our programming as readers of the journal no doubt know pbs is the most trusted source of news and public affairs programming in america roper poll and stephen segaller director news &amp public affairs programming executive producer wide angle thirteen wnet new york new york while a few misguided residents of rosia montana support the gabriel gold mining project mr fund ignores the fact that the main beneficiaries will be gabriel and a few corrupt politicians not the rural romanian villagers as he claims the campaign against gabriel resources is spearheaded by romanians themselves with support from civic groups and the bucharest based soros foundation romania of which george soros is the chairman unlike the public relations efforts coming out of denver opposition to the mine represents a grassroots movement to address local concerns contrary to mr funds assertions the towns poverty will not be solved by gold the shady machinations surrounding the gabriel deal which was pushed through without real public debate make clear that rosia montana will be yet another case in which the discovery of natural resources spells tragedy for the people of the region bringing with it graft instability and environmental ruin moreover the soros foundation romania did respond to mr funds request for an interview gabriel petrescu executive director soros foundation romania bucharest romania see related letter "letters to the editor digging for accuracy in pbs film on mine" wsj sept
