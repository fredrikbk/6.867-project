weekend journal review theater this is the way we were our town hartford stage church st hartford conn &# &# closes oct hartford conn if i were to pick a handful of works of art that taken together embody the american experience one of them would be thornton wilders "our town " that was wilders purpose in writing his best known play "this is the way we were in our growing up and in our marrying and in our living and in our dying " says the stage manager the character who narrates his fictional chronicle of life in a small new england town not long after the turn of the th century it is a claim that only the most self assured of artists would dare to make and one that "our town" satisfies to the fullest degree so too does hartford stages revival of "our town " in which the year old hal holbrook gives the performance of a long lifetime as the stage manager this is the finest "our town" i have seen or hope to see a production masterly in its self effacing understatement and satisfying in every possible way "when the theater pretends to give the real thing in canvas and wood and metal it loses something of the realer thing which is its true business " wilder wrote in his preface to "our town " to recapture that deeper realism he wrote a play that disposed of the traditional trappings of "realistic" drama "no curtain no scenery the audience arriving sees an empty stage in half light " thats the first stage direction in "our town " and the stage managers opening line is no less startling today than it was seven decades ago "this play is called our town " he says matter of factly and all at once we are whisked away to a new theatrical world one in which the members of the audience are invited to decorate the bare stage with their own memories and put themselves in the places of the actors who sketch the outlines of everyday life in an ordinary town wilders point of course is that no human life is ordinary as emily webb one of the residents of grovers corners his imaginary new hampshire town discovers when she dies in childbirth is given a chance to relive her th birthday and finds herself asking the bittersweet question that lies at the heart of "our town" "do any human beings ever realize life while they live it every every minute " that this stabbing cry of rue has since become a staple of new age greeting card philosophy does not diminish its force but it does raise the bar for actors and directors seeking to put a fresh spin on wilders now familiar theatrical innovations it long ago became commonplace for "our town" to be staged in ways that sometimes have little to do with the play wilder wrote i well remember how intensely i disliked spalding grays flip irrelevantly sardonic stage manager in the lincoln center theater revival just the other day i read about a minneapolis production that went so far as to dispense with the stage manager altogether his lines were distributed among the members of the ensemble next week two river theater company of red bank n j will open a production whose cast consists of seven actors and puppets im not opposed in principle to such productions part of what makes a classic play classic is its ability to stand up to an infinite number of approaches and still remain recognizable at the same time few things are so compelling as a revival of a well known play that offers you nothing more or less than the thing itself unadorned and direct this is the way that gregory boyd has treated "our town" in his hartford stage production and the results are as illuminating in their own straightforward way as the most radical of reinterpretations not all of wilders stage directions are taken literally mr holbrooks stage manager doesnt smoke a pipe but at no time do you feel that mr boyd and his actors are getting in the way of the text instead they revel in it taking grovers corners at face value and letting us draw our own conclusions about the plain people who live there such an approach requires first rate acting to make its effect and hal holbrook is the man for the job his stage manager is very much in the tradition of frank craven who created the role on broadway in and filmed it two years later in hollywood his accent is purest new england his manner spare and flinty you could i suppose call it conventional but that would be missing the point like mr boyd mr holbrook trusts the play and is content to let it make its points without superimposing any of his own the simplicity with which he delivers his oft quoted curtain speech "most everybodys asleep in grovers corners you get a good rest too" is an object lesson in how to act without seeming to do so i was amazed to learn that mr holbrook has played the stage manager only twice once on nbc in and once at new havens long wharf theatre in i saw the telecast which is now available on dvd and recall it as one of the most sensitive realizations of a stage play ever to be presented on tv still i doubt that it was as good as the version i saw two nights ago in hartford ross bickell and ginna carter were especially fine as dr gibbs and emily webb but all the performers were worthy of their octogenarian leader and rui ritas sensitive unshowy lighting displayed them to ideal advantage is "our town" a truly great play in the past ive had my doubts it has its sentimental moments and i suspect that some of the more extreme interpretations it has received in recent years were in response to the suspicion that grovers corners is too idyllic to be true but wilders portrayal of small town life is more tough minded than it looks and as i grow older i increasingly incline to agree with brooks atkinson who saw the original broadway production of "our town" and called it "a fragment of the immortal truth " certainly no one who sees hartford stages revival will doubt for a moment that it is great theater or that hal holbrook is a great actor mr teachout the journals drama critic
