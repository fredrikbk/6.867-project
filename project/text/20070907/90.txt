tax deferral cap weighed for hedge fund managers washington congressional democrats are considering a proposal that would dramatically reduce hedge fund managers ability to put off paying taxes on their compensation rep rahm emanuel d ill said he soon will introduce a bill capping hedge fund managers offshore deferrals to the same amount most people are permitted to defer tax free each year into k and individual retirement accounts for that amount is &# the legislation would be aimed at managers of hedge funds that are based overseas managers of these funds under current law can put off for years the income taxes due on large chunks of their compensation they can also reinvest the deferred amount in their funds and let it grow tax free in the meantime representatives of the hedge fund industry already were arguing they shouldnt be singled out "it seems to me singling out one industry for different treatment is not in keeping with general tax policy principles " said lisa mcgreevy executive vice president and chief operating officer of the managed funds association no estimate was available of how much revenue might be gained under mr emanuels proposal but it may well find traction in congress where lawmakers have been hunting for additional revenue to offset other tax breaks to comply with budget rules "if its in the tax code we have an interest in it " said rep charles rangel the new york democrat who is chairman of the house tax panel he said he plans to hold hearings delving into the offshore deferral issue the proposal also meshes with the theme democratic tax writers in the house have seized on to describe their broad ranging agenda for the year tax fairness for middle income people the agenda includes a reduction in the alternative minimum tax for middle income people which likely would be offset with increases for wealthier taxpayers "congress needs to reform the tax code to assure all americans that they are on a level playing field regardless of their income level " said mr emanuel who is the chairman of the house democrats political committee mr emanuel said his proposal would include an exception from the new limits for employees of u s companies who are working abroad and qualify for an existing exclusion in the tax code that prevents double taxation mr emanuels proposal may serve as a diversion from an issue he says is more complex the taxation of carried interest a cut of profits received by managers of hedge and private equity funds as well as some real estate investors he so far hasnt been a vocal supporter of legislation pushed by others that would raise tax rates on carried interest still the proposal may well become part of a big tax bill mr rangel is planning the idea of limiting tax deferred compensation for high paid people already has traction in the senate which earlier this year approved a yearly cap of &# million on all taxpayer deferrals it was dropped in talks with the house but is expected to resurface mr rangel said he is "pretty confident" that his committee will soon pass a major tax bill he said it is "very likely" that the measure would come to a vote in the full house he acknowledged the senate is unlikely to pass some of the provisions his panel is working on such as the permanent changes to the alternative minimum tax
