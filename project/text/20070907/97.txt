the numbers guy how policy makers use number analyses to turn our heads most of us go about our daily lives without having to handle sums in the billions and trillions so when advocates politicians or business leaders want to get a rise from us over say wasteful spending they have to figure out how to get us to understand what their studies have uncovered and to see it their way these days one of the numbers we hear most often in the news is that the federal government has spent more than &# billion on operations in iraq that figure calculated by the congressional budget office is frequently cited by opponents of the war when they urge troop withdrawal the challenge is to make that number provoke shock and awe one web site divides the cost among u s adults showing visitors how each adult could have bought two pairs of manolo blahnik patent leather pumps or longneck bottles of bud or bud light beer a blogger conjured up the notion that &# billion would buy enough golf balls to fill all the tractor trailers it would take to reach across a lane highway bumper to bumper from los angeles to new york readers of the reason magazine blog offered their own analogies such as the number of reason subscriptions nearly years worth for every person on the planet that could be purchased for &# trillion an economists projection of the past and future cost of the iraq war after a writer for the magazine said his "head is too small" to comprehend figures that big hes not alone human beings really do have a hard time understanding big numbers the figures used in newspapers and political debates can seem like confusing abstractions cognitive psychologists say "the brain probably didnt evolve to process very big numbers " says michael mccloskey a johns hopkins cognitive scientist mathematician john allen paulos author of several books about numbers and how they are used says his students at temple university in philadelphia often cant grasp the scale of large figures he has told them a million seconds is equivalent to days and then asked how many days contain a billion seconds "i often get answers like twice as much or times as much " its days or about years michael ranney a cognitive scientist at the university of california berkeley says journalism students in his number training class who should know the u s population is million sometimes guess california has one billion people instead of million for those looking to use policy figures to stun rather than edify one popular device is to describe a stack of bills stretching into space ronald reagan used that image a tower of &# bills miles high in to depict the national debt which was headed toward &# trillion in a brookings institution report stephen schwartz wrote that the total cost of nuclear weapons to that point equaled a stack of dollar bills stretching to the moon and nearly back but "people dont have much of a grasp of the distance from here to the moon " prof mccloskey points out he suggests making numbers small such as figuring costs per person mr schwartz editor of the nonproliferation review admits to hesitating before using the stacking image he decided to bring several bricks of dollar bills to a news conference about his report and recalls those went over well robert siegler a carnegie mellon cognitive psychologist calls the stack in space image "silly" and adds "it doesnt provide any more intuition than people already had " these days stephen crockett an online co host at democratic talk radio keeps the actual heights of such stacks vague when he asks listeners to picture one million stacks of one million &# bills representing projected war costs of &# trillion thats because he recalls visiting the bureau of engraving and printing when he was in high school and seeing stacks of bills not singles worth &# million "they were not that high " he confesses using the bureaus formula a stack contains about new bills per inch other war critics note how much the budget for iraq could buy in say port security or teachers salaries this line on war costs suggests that federal spending is a zero sum game meaning that money spent on the war could easily be substituted elsewhere in the budget thats not entirely the case but then the purpose of such arguments is often more to advocate than to explain ucla economist lee ohanian says the iraq war is a "drop in the bucket " about of the federal budget especially compared with world war ii which consumed at least of federal expenditures from the wwii figure however includes all defense spending for the period "no matter what the number is you need to put it in perspective " says prof ohanian numbers can have a powerful impact prof ranney says the real statistics behind controversial topics often surprise people and sometimes provoke them "by giving people numbers you can change what they prefer " he says "what can be more empowering than that " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily
