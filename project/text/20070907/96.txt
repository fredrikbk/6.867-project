the morning brief dealing with poverty by focusing on misery online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here how to help the worlds poor thats a perennial question with apparently ever shifting answers at the highest levels of government though some simple approaches are out there the world bank these days under the leadership of newly installed president robert zoellick is looking for a new long term strategy the banks missions are essentially to reduce global poverty and improve living standards but as the wall street journal reports as the institution seeks to "prove its continuing relevance " an internal review is urging it to refocus its lending on big borrowers like china brazil and mexico "lending to so called middle income countries should focus on improving anticorruption measures easing income inequality and attacking global environmental problems " according to a report by a bank working group thats reviewing its programs and priorities the journal says the bank is "trying to figure out what role it should play in a world where big developing nations have built up huge financial reserves and can borrow readily on private markets " the journal adds and while some critics want it to focus on the poorest countries and give them grants rather than loans the bank depends on money earned from its loans to more prosperous developing nations these middle income countries are those where per capita income ranges from about &# to &# and they received about &# billion from the bank in but as last years nobel peace prize suggests it was awarded to the bangladeshi microcredit pioneer muhammad yunus and his grameen bank there are strong arguments for alleviating poverty and misery from below mort rosenblum a veteran american reporter who has probably covered as many global conflicts humanitarian crises political phenomena and cultural wonders over the past four decades as any other living journalist looks at the battle against both misery and poverty in the tribal village of galder in northern india life in galder he writes in the international herald tribune is tough with a year drought getting worse crops withering and medical care "so precarious that the cure for anything serious is death " yet mr rosenblum argues "faraway experts with prescriptions to end poverty which most define as living on less than a daily dollar could learn a lot here " for while no one in galder seems to have heard of president bush everyone there knows madan nagda and his "hip pocket aid agency " mks mr nagda helps people in villages to improve their lives with the likes of a model farm that shows people "how to coax better yields out of drier land" and hillside sculpting that traps rainwater and channels it into depleted aquifers as well as clinics that teach hygiene and sanitation mr rosenblum writes and the key to mr nagdas efforts seems to be working directly with the people he is trying to help "if villagers pay no attention to an american president who means nothing to their lives they vote without fail for their member of parliament and their local leaders " mr rosenblum says "they know exactly what they need simple pumps to tap a nearby river and check dams to catch rare rain a ride to udaipur so they can market vegetables and get a day labor job when they need cash a schoolteacher who shows up for work help for women who organize community projects " if poverty is a concept relative to the wealthier economies that define it and one where only major aid from rich nations and an assault on corruption and inefficiency can make a difference "misery is what makes poor people give up hope and drink pesticide " he adds "this galder shows us we can do something about at very little cost " more leeway at the fed on the global finance front several federal reserve officials gave speeches yesterday echoing the beige book view that while recent market volatility has increased the risks for the broader economy the fallout has been relatively limited for now as the wall street journal reports still the prospect of significantly slowing growth could be enough to produce a cut in interest rates especially if the feds fears about potential inflation pressures are also assuaged a report yesterday albeit from the second quarter might have done just that the labor department said productivity at nonfarm businesses was revised upward to from the previous estimate of as dow jones newswires reports since that means companies were producing more with the work forces they had it could translate into decreased pressure on wages which had been a worry discussed at the last fed policy meeting in early august meanwhile the securities and exchange commission and state attorneys general in new york and ohio are now looking into "how the big credit rating companies are paid and whether they are independent enough of the wall street firms that issue bonds " the journal reports a vast and widespread uncertainty about the value of mortgage loans underlying investment vehicles was one of the root causes of the recent market turmoil the petraeus put the long anticipated congressional testimony of gen david petraeus wont take place until next week but the suspense about what hell say has been steadily diminishing senior bush administration and military officials tell the new york times the top american commander in iraq "has told president bush that he wants to maintain heightened troop levels in iraq well into next year to reduce the risk of military setbacks but could accept the pullback of roughly troops beginning in january in part to assuage critics in congress " while some senior military officials and members of the joint chiefs of staff consider gen petraeuss view overly cautious officials say "it reflected his concern that the security gains made so far in baghdad anbar province and other areas were fragile and easily reversed " the times says white house officials add that mr bush had yet to make any final decisions about the recommendations but gen petraeuss "apparent agreement to a small withdrawal beginning early next year could fit into a narrow consensus that is beginning to emerge on capitol hill " according to the times even that small pullout "would be contingent on the ability of u s and iraqi forces to sustain what the administration heralds as recent gains in security and to make further gains in stabilizing iraq " the washington post says it notes mr bush followed a briefing this week by gen petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker in iraq by saying he was told "if the kind of success we are now seeing continues it will be possible to maintain the same level of security with fewer american forces " bolstering any idea of a withdrawal gen james l jones the prominent retired marine general echoed what middle east experts have been saying for quite some time during testimony on capitol hill yesterday the high profile u s military presence in iraq has fostered animosity among iraqis he said adding that american forces should reduce their "footprint" in iraq to counter the impression that it is an occupying force as the los angeles times reports chryslers toyota tack chrysler scored what the detroit news
