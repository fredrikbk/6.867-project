ahead of the tape help wanted for economy from jobs data the job market has been a bright spot for the economy but beneath the surface it might not be as healthy as it looks consider whats happening in unemployment benefit offices there havent been many changes in the number of people filing initial claims for government unemployment benefits a closely watched indicator of layoffs in the week ended saturday initial jobless claims held steady nationwide at a seasonally adjusted level of not much more than the who filed a year earlier but there have been increases in the number of americans staying on unemployment once they get there the number of so called continuing claims hit million in the week to aug up from a year earlier continuing claims are up as much as in states slammed by the housing bust such as florida nevada and arizona according to moodys economy com even in states less exposed to the housing bust such as minnesota rhode island and tennessee continuing claims have risen by to the labor departments monthly surveys of households also suggest the undercurrents of the job market might be cooling in july of unemployed people said they were out of work because theyd lost their jobs and their layoffs werent temporary by contrast of unemployed workers said theyd voluntarily left their jobs while others said they were entering the work force for the first time or were re entering the work force after dropping out the number of people who were facing seemingly permanent job loss has been inching higher for three months the governments household surveys are used to calculate the unemployment rate which at remains reassuringly low but other aspects of the household surveys provide less comfort while labor department surveys of businesses suggest employment has risen by per month on average so far this year its surveys of households say employment has been rising by just a month business surveys might not be picking up trends like migrant workers losing undocumented jobs or self employed americans giving up on real estate dreams andrew tilton a senior economist with goldman sachs constructed a "regional diffusion index " separating the continental u s into regions looking back to mr tilton found recessions were associated with at least eight of the regions losing jobs today the index shows an average of of the regions lost jobs over the past three months based on the grim household data again using data from business surveys the picture is less bleak an average of just four regions showed job losses over the past three months this brings us to the labor departments employment report for august due out today a weak report will signal to wall street that the economy is slowing and the federal reserve might cut short term interest rates in response a strong report could make investors wonder if the economy is in such bad shape wall street is leaning strong economists expect the government to report nonfarm payrolls expanded by last month compared with in july they also believe the unemployment rate stayed at but one has to wonder if those numbers tell the whole story send comments to conor dougherty wsj com
