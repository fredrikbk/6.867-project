politics &amp economics u s plots new climate tactic speedier chemicals ban sought by white house but china may resist washington the bush administration plans to push for speeding up by a decade the global phaseout of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer and contribute to global warming but it is likely to run into opposition from china which stands to profit more if current treaties hold the administrations proposal will be presented at a meeting opening sept in montreal where representatives from nations that have signed the treaty will discuss toughening the year old montreal protocol the treaty was designed to reduce the use of chemicals that have created holes in the ozone layer that shields the earth from the more damaging parts of solar radiation though a dozen countries are expected to offer proposals to tighten the treaty the u s plan is regarded as the most aggressive it would shift the deadlines for phasing out a family of chemicals called hydrochlorofluorocarbons or hcfcs to from for industrial nations and to from for developing nations in addition the proposal would require developing nations to shrink their production of the chemicals by stages before the deadline "we believe that we can reach phaseout years faster than the current agreement because the technology is now available " said kristen a helmer a spokeswoman for the white house council of environmental quality she said mr bush has been promised support from a variety of nations nevertheless the proposals fate is unclear because the conference usually operates by trying to reach a consensus one of the original targets of the montreal protocol was chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which are chemicals that had been used since the s as refrigerants in cooling systems these chemicals originally designed to be safer than ammonia and other refrigerants released chlorine and were later discovered to be destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere the treaty called for the use of hcfcs as transitional chemicals because they released less chlorine into the upper atmosphere but scientists discovered that some hcfcs accelerate global warming far more than carbon dioxide which is thought of as the main culprit in trapping the suns heat in the earths atmosphere now the effort among diplomats and chemical companies is to shift to newer chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons which contain no chlorine and have less effect on global warming the bush administration is being backed by chemical manufacturers including dupont co the companies see a tougher treaty as a way to bolster global demand for newer less harmful refrigerants "what we want is continuously lower impacts on the ozone layer " says mack mcfarland chief atmospheric scientist for dupont but china is expected to resist under the treaty developing nations are allowed to continue making hcfcs based on production levels until that has been an unintended bonanza for several nations particularly china which has built a number of refrigerant factories a byproduct of chinas process is a gas called hfc a chemical that is times more powerful in global warming as co this has made the gas very popular under an emissions trading regime created by a second treaty the kyoto protocol to curb global warming traders estimate china has earned more than &# billion by installing incinerators to destroy the potent gas chinas effort is being financed by companies in europe and japan which buy the resulting emission reduction credits and use them to meet their domestic greenhouse gas restrictions because they are cheaper than emissions reductions that can be obtained elsewhere in montreal negotiations china is expected to oppose attempts to accelerate the phaseout beijing wants to protect its income from the kyoto treaty which some environmental groups and scientists call a "perverse incentive" because it makes the harmful byproduct far more valuable than the refrigerant chinas ministry of foreign affairs didnt immediately respond to a request for comment an official in the air quality department at chinas state environmental protection administration said he was unaware of the bush administrations plan but he said that chinas government "has been trying to reduce related chemicals according to the montreal convention " and that china is "trying hard on ozone layer protection " kersten zhang in beijing contributed to this article
