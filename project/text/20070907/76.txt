politics &amp economics out of iraq some common ground troop drawdown could enable democrats and republicans to claim victory washington the likelihood that u s forces will begin pulling out of iraq later this year is tamping down what was expected to be a rancorous debate over the u s role there and providing an opening for democrats and republicans to reach agreement on an iraq policy both sides could tout as a victory gen david petraeus the top u s commander in iraq is expected to announce next week that although the "surge" of an additional troops since the spring has produced little progress toward achieving national political reconciliation it does seem to have reduced violence in baghdad senior military officials say gen petraeus will likely ask that the elevated troop levels be maintained at least through november or december when the u s would begin slowly withdrawing the additional troops as troop levels fall over the course of from the peak of u s forces are likely to gradually shift to more of a training and advisory mission advocated by many moderate democrats "the democrats have started to sound themes that arent inconsistent with the administrations positions " said peter feaver a political science professor at duke university who helped develop the surge plan while serving in the bush administration "increasingly they are talking about how stability in iraq is in our national interests and how this means we cant simply walk away " he said "that makes a convergence of proposals more possible " to be sure next week will see fireworks democrats and republicans are certain to dispute whether violence really has fallen in iraq and whether the apparent gains mean anything if iraqis refuse to reconcile but the fact that mr bushs surge is drawing to a close has given moderate democrats and republicans critical of the administration room to agree on putting a legislative stamp on what the military now describes as the unavoidable need to end the surge the latest date that the bush administration can sustain the surge without extending troops beyond their current month duty tours is april at that point the pentagon will have to begin pulling out one brigade a month for five months for both political and military reasons the actual drawdown is likely to begin sooner than april say senior military officials every time the military pulls a unit from iraq it must redistribute u s forces to ensure that no area is left totally uncovered starting the drawdown sooner and proceeding more slowly gives u s commanders more time to manage the gaps that occur as troops are shifted around the battlefield "you certainly are the most vulnerable during transitions " a senior administration official said the looming need for withdrawing some troops is opening the way for democrats to float legislation that would require the administration to act by the end of the year to win over moderate republicans majority leader harry reid and other democratic senate leaders are considering dropping demands for a fixed calendar for a total u s withdrawal such a compromise which some prominent democrats are promising to oppose would allow republicans to tout the upcoming drawdown as both a sign of success in iraq and a realignment of the u s mission there while the democrats could portray it as the beginning of the end of the war last week sen john warner r va an influential voice on defense matters urged the president to begin pulling some troops out of iraq by christmas mr reid followed that by saying his party was ready for a potential compromise with senate republicans at the same time the congressional debate this month is almost certain to kick into next year the bigger questions of iraqs future and the long term u s role there that could expose the democrats in particular to potentially harsh criticism from the partys left wing that they have abandoned the real fight to end the war now democrats seized on a series of independent iraq assessments by the intelligence community the government accountability office and a congressionally appointed study group to buttress claims that violence in iraq remains high and progress toward national reconciliation is almost nonexistent "iraqs leaders are not achieving the political reconciliation that was the stated purpose of the surge " said sen barack obama d ill "its time to begin to bring our troops home so that we can relieve a strain on our military that endangers our national security " yet beyond the argument over whether the u s has seen real progress in iraq there is growing conviction among moderates of both parties that the u s has little choice but to diminish its role there white house officials say the drawdown next year could go further than the to "surge" troops whose month tours are ending if conditions continue to improve in certain areas and iraqi troops begin to fill the breach administration officials say the u s could reduce its troop presence in iraq to as low as by the fall of one senior administration official predicted that fewer than troops might remain when the next president takes over in january as troop numbers fall soldiers and marines will begin to pull back from patrolling streets and protecting citizens to training and advising iraqi army and police forces a mission that would begin to remove them from urban conflict zones "by its very nature there will have to be a task and mission shift as we start to draw down " said david kilcullen who until last month worked as gen petraeuss counterinsurgency adviser in baghdad such a shift has been at the core of several democratic proposals for changing the mission in iraq one such proposal by the center for new american security a defense think tank led by several prominent clinton administration officials suggests that the u s could reduce troop numbers to as low as by the end of next year but will have to maintain as many as troops in iraq through such a drawdown would be far more aggressive than anything being considered by bush administration officials who say that too quick a drawdown could lead to chaos the leading democratic presidential contenders meanwhile have backed away from offering firm prescriptions for u s troop withdrawals both sens hillary clinton and obama offered detailed withdrawal plans early this year but neither camp has since revised those proposals or set a new date for a withdrawal
