weekend journal sports by the numbers laying the foundation as the mlb postseason approaches the outcome of every game is of pivotal importance to a contending team that tends to make the closers for those teams the center of attention but a detailed look shows that their setup men deserve just as big a place in the spotlight the first thing to notice is that these days closers are usually brought in to start an inning so they dont often have to start by working their way out of a jam new york mets closer billy wagner has faced just three inherited runners all season while san diego padres closer trevor hoffman has faced nine compare that to the inherited runners faced by middle relievers aaron heilman of the mets and heath bell of the padres this trial by fire may be part of the reason why middle men tend to play such important roles in october the trend began with new york yankee reliever mariano riveras dominating eighth inning performances that set the stage for closer john wetteland in and continued through last season when hard throwing joel zumaya helped the detroit tigers advance to the world series to determine which setup men have been most effective this season well use off base percentage ofb ofb shows how often a pitcher retires the batter he faces the higher the number the better his performance this season features some interesting new setup men for example the yankee bullpen added strength by calling joba chamberlain up from the minors in limited work hes posted a ofb well above mr riveras all ofbs are through games of tuesday expect mr chamberlain not kyle farnsworth ofb to get the call in the eighth inning if the yankees make the playoffs the cleveland indians also have an intriguing bullpen situation their closer joe borowski leads the american league with saves but his ofb tells another tale a big reason for the tribes success rafael betancourt whose ofb has been the stingiest in baseball with rafael perez not far back while boston red sox closer jonathan papelbon has been superb eric gagne acquired by the bosox in a trade deadline deal has disappointed with a ofb and is currently sidelined with arm trouble but expect the stat heads in boston to notice how effective hideki okajima has been and use him accordingly for the al west leading angels justin speier has proved even more effective than francisco rodriguez in the national league the closers on the contenders each have a setup man whos equally adept at retiring batters for the mets messrs heilman and wagner posted identical ofbs while in san diego messrs hoffman and bell sit at and respectively that puts them just ahead of the arizona diamondbacks best tandem of closer jose valverde and tony pena in the nl central francisco cordero of the milwaukee brewers has saves but his ofb isnt as stellar and derrick turnbow and scott linebrink have been less than lights out on the chicago cubs carlos marmol and bobby howry have been every bit as strong as closer ryan dempster but if relief pitching decides this division the edge should go to the st louis cardinals jason isringhausen is having a great season with a ofb and his setup man troy percival has returned to form ironically mr percival collected the save that won the world series for the angels with the support of mr rodriguez more than anyone he understands that down the stretch closers get the glory but its the setup men who do the heavy lifting
