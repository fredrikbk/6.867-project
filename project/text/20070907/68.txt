pavarottis passing rome in italy opera and national identity have been linked together since the th century risorgimento when giuseppe verdi provided musical accompaniment for the countrys unification at that time in theaters under austrian or bourbon rule audiences would shout out the composers name as an acronym for that of their desired sovereign "vittorio emanuele re di italia" victor emanuel king of italy love of music and motherland were one a century and a half later luciano pavarotti came as close to personifying italianita for his countrymen and the rest of the world as any public figure in his lifetime virtuosity in the nations emblematic musical genre was his primary credential of course but he also fit the profile in more superficial ways a gastronome who reportedly weighed kilograms pounds at his peak he almost literally embodied italians passion for food his public persona matched the stereotype of a people whose disposition is supposed to be as sunny as their climate pavarottis biography epitomized the aspirations and experiences of contemporary italians son of a baker his childhood dream was not to sing but to play the national pastime of soccer like so many of his talented and ambitious countrymen he achieved his greatest fame and financial success abroad especially in the united states that success was not always applauded at home where the press increasingly emphasized his foibles in accounts of his marital breakup and tax related legal troubles like many other rich italians he claimed foreign residence in order to avoid his countrys high tax rates in italy as elsewhere music critics censured the maestro for dumbing down his art especially in lucrative collaborations with the likes of ricky martin and the spice girls now that he is gone italy grieves within hours of the tenors death italian news coverage was brimming with tributes "there were tenors and then there was pavarotti " said the film and opera director franco zeffirelli in a representative remark saturdays funeral in the modena cathedral will no doubt draw a crowd of mourners it will be instructive to compare the reaction over the next couple of days with that provoked by the loss of another pillar of italian culture one decade and a half ago after federico fellini died in his coffin on a soundstage at romes cinecitta studios drew over mourners in a single day they were paying their respects to one of the main authors of italys postwar cultural renaissance and a foremost protagonist of its glamorous high life whether or not pavarottis death has touched italy as deeply as fellinis both men belong to an era in the countrys history that has now definitively ended a generation ago the most famous italians at home and abroad included film directors like fellini and luchino visconti actors like marcello mastroianni and anna magnani and writers like alberto moravia and italo calvino some of these were popular stars others appealed more to elite tastes but together they contributed to the widespread image of italy as a bastion of culture though an earthy and often chaotic one no figures of such stature stand for italy today pavarotti in spite of his maligned commercialism was a classically trained performer of undisputed brilliance and thus an ambassador of high culture to those outside its usual reach for the italian soccer fans who adopted his rendition of a puccini aria as a fight song for their national team he was a link to something even finer than victory the most sublime elements of their own heritage that link is broken now to italys loss and ours mr rocca is an american writer in rome
