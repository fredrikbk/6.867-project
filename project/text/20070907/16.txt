conflicts and the credit crunch in terms of market meltdowns and the degree of pain inflicted on the financial system the subprime mortgage crisis has the potential to rival just about anything in recent financial history from the savings and loan crisis of the late s to the post enron turndown at the beginning of this decade the scope of this crisis is not the only similarity to the enron era scandals they also share root causes that include conflicts of interest a lack of accountability and limited transparency leavened with a healthy dose of naive greed then these symptoms were found among a key group of gatekeepers auditors now they are found in an equally critical gatekeeper the credit ratings agencies as documented both in the media and by the securities and exchange commission sec credit ratings agencies such as moodys investor service s&amp p and fitch ratings are playing both coach and referee in the debt game they rate companies and issuers that pay them for that service and in the case of structured financial instruments which make it possible to securitize all those subprime mortgages they help issuers construct these products to obtain the highest possible rating these conflicts are hard to spot because transparency among these agencies is murky at best and currently it is difficult to hold these agencies accountable for any wrongdoing and the credit ratings agencies need to be held accountable they rated enron debt at investment grade until four days before default performed similarly when orange county went bankrupt in and up until the middle of this summer they gave top ratings to securities built from risky subprime mortgages while congress passed legislation last year to bring competition and accountability to the credit ratings agencies its clear that further action must be taken to reform this critical part of our financial markets up until the s the business model of credit rating agencies was fairly straightforward investors bought a subscription to receive ratings which were then used to make investment decisions then the business model changed and the issuers of securities became the ones who paid to be rated this conflict of interest deepened with the rise of complex structured financial products the credit ratings agencies not only rate these instruments but also offer the issuer help in constructing the product in order to obtain a certain rating over the past few years this has become a lucrative business for the ratings agencies for example structured finance deals accounted for of moodys total revenue last year calling into question the objectivity of ratings that are critical to the proper functioning of the market while an outright ban on ancillary or consulting services may be the easiest way to eliminate this conflict of interest it is not the most feasible course of action the rules passed earlier this year by the sec to implement the credit rating reform act of recognize that and require credit ratings agencies to have polices and procedures in place to manage these conflicts this is a good start but we should go further first we need more oversight under current rules the sec only can judge whether or not the agencies are living up to the policies and procedures that they set for themselves it cannot judge the quality of these standards or set them this is similar to the type of oversight we had of auditors pre enron thankfully that changed and this must as well the sec should be given the authority to set standards monitor and evaluate compliance and discipline ratings agencies for violations including in the most egregious cases the revocation of sec recognition as we have seen with auditors this sort of meaningful oversight makes a difference in behavior that benefits investors but oversight cannot happen without the right personnel the legislation passed last year provided no budget for additional sec personnel to perform the inspections of credit ratings agencies if we want a more robust oversight regime to make sure that ratings agencies are serving investors then that will take more sec employees and the funds to pay for them second we need more independence those that help structure a financial instrument for an investment bank or other issuer should have to wait a year before joining that firm a requirement that auditors for instance currently have ratings agency employees also should be prohibited from soliciting or accepting money gifts or favors from issuers and the lead analyst for a client should be rotated every five years we also should resurrect the sec proposal from which would have prohibited the linkage of new business development with analyst compensation in addition just as sarbanes oxley gave audit committees direct responsibility for the selection monitoring and compensation of external monitors audit committees should be given this responsibility over credit ratings agencies this would bolster their independence from management and lessen any pressure brought to bear on them third we need more transparency in addition to the disclosure requirements issued by the sec this february we also should require in debt offering documents or in annual filings of a registrant whose publicly held debt is being rated the disclosure of any services a ratings agency has provided to the company in connection with the issuance or rating of debt including any consulting on the structuring of the transaction and the amount of fees related to those services that were paid to the rating agency this will help prod the ratings agencies to diminish their conflicts of interest moreover we need more transparency in the market for structured financial products itself we need to improve disclosure of rating triggers so that investors are not surprised when they become operational and cause a liquidity issue we also need more transparency on secondary market prices and volumes as well as liquidity which ideally can be achieved through market mechanisms fourth we need more accountability credit ratings agencies just like other gatekeepers should be held liable for malfeasance that is more than mere negligence of course the ratings agencies will respond that their ratings are constitutionally protected speech since they do not offer a recommendation to "buy" or "sell " yet when it comes to ratings of structured financial products that the credit ratings agencies helped create their claims of first amendment protections are on very shaky ground as opposed to when they offer just unsolicited ratings whether done through court decision or congressional action we should make clear that credit ratings agencies opinions are no different from those of other gatekeepers and they can be held accountable for wrongdoing finally we need investors to accept more responsibility for evaluating structured financial products credit ratings agencies play a critical role in the capital markets but their judgments are guides not stamps of approval too often institutional investors have been investing in sophisticated credit products on the basis solely of the credit rating and without fully understanding the inherent risks they are undertaking the current crisis may change this behavior for some but to remedy this further a new set of rules worked out by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii and their emphasis on internal risk evaluations not just external ratings represent a possible model to emulate hopefully this set of reforms will prove to be effective in mitigating the central problem with ratings agencies their conflict of interest if not then we should consider more direct methods to change who pays for ratings fees for now however we should keep in mind that this should not be an occasion for overreaction and finger pointing rather its a chance to strengthen our financial system as the capital markets grow more complex and global a move that will help investors of all sizes world wide mr levitt is a former chairman of the securities and exchange commission
