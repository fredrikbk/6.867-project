the daily fix colts start new nfl season just as they ended last one online edition one game into the new nfl season it looks like nothing has changed for the indianapolis colts critics keep raising questions and the colts keep knocking them down last year many wondered if they could win in the playoffs with a defense that was lackluster at best in the regular season but the colts defenders played better in january and february and helped the team win the super bowl this year that defensive unit lost four starters prompting questions of how it would stop drew brees reggie bush and the high powered new orleans saints offense in the nfls opening regular season game however the colts defense retained its postseason form in a win over new orleans saints mark montieth writes in the indianapolis star mr montieth reports that the colts who held the saints to yards have played seven consecutive quarters and of the last without giving up a touchdown "the colts d may be undersized but its quick really quick " dennis dillon writes in the sporting news he adds "maybe its time to get off the back of the colts defense and jump on the bandwagon " the colts offense is also a target of criticism last year because of the departure of edgerrin james and this year after the sudden retirement of left tackle tarik glenn however rookie left tackle tony ugoh did just fine sans a holding penalty and a false start mr dillon writes the line gave peyton manning plenty of time to pick apart the saints secondary especially former colt jason david who signed as a free agent with new orleans "the clear picture that developed thursday night was a snapshot of david trailing colts players as they crossed the goal line " john deshazier writes in the new orleans times picayune "again and again and again " rick ankiel had been one of the best stories in baseball this year mr ankiel the onetime rising pitcher star who suddenly fizzled out and couldnt throw a strike returned to the st louis cardinals in august as a slugging outfielder on thursday afternoon he hit two home runs and drove in seven to up his season total to nine homers and rbi in games his performance has helped the cards to pull within one game of the chicago cubs and the milwaukee brewers who are tied for first place in the national league central "hes been putting up nintendo numbers " shortstop brendan ryan told the st louis dispatchs derrick goold "to do it in september where every hit every rbi is everything we need to win is incredible hes going to be a better position player than maybe he ever could have as a pitcher " but on thursday night new york daily news reporters t j quinn christian red michael okeeffe and bill madden broke the sad story that mr ankiel received a month supply of human growth hormone in its unclear whether mr ankiel will face any repercussions legally or from major league baseball which has been accused of doing too little to rid the sport of performance enhancing drugs mr ankiel has not been accused of wrongdoing and he stopped receiving hgh before mlb banned it in according to the news the news also reported that steve woodard who pitched for milwaukee cleveland texas and boston during a career that ended in received steroids and growth hormone mr ankiels agent declined to comment to the news and mr woodard didnt return calls the two are the first two baseball names to be linked to a two year investigation into an illegal internet prescription drug outfit an inquiry that has brought indictments and nine convictions speaking of the investigation gary jacobson offers some details in the dallas morning news on why dallas cowboys quarterbacks coach wade wilson was a part of the illegal drug ring mr wilson who was suspended by the nfl for five games says he received a cocktail of drugs including hgh to treat impotence which was a complication from his diabetes wilson said he got the idea after watching " minutes " which ran a story on an anti aging clinic after undergoing an exam and blood work in chicago he then talked to a florida doctor on the phone mr wilson said he received two substances from florida facilities which are targets of the investigation "i thought he was a legitimate doctor " wilson said "he made a recommendation " novak djokovic advanced to the mens semifinals of the u s open but he also made headlines for what he did after the match around the tennis circuit mr djokovic is known for impersonations of other players so during a postmatch on court interview the usa networks michael barkann asked mr djokovic to an impression "this could have backfired in so many ways " bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "djokovic could refuse as virtually any other player would hes got a u s open semifinal coming up against david ferrer for crying out loud or he could have blown the impressions unprepared to deliver in such a spontaneous public manner instead djokovic walked to the baseline and did a side splitting sharapova words hardly do it justice suffice it to say that he didnt even need to shriek such was his mastery of sharapovas ever so feminine ways then came the absolute flip side the macho and bare shouldered nadal leaping out a crouch to sprint into serving position complete with a massive tug on the crotch " in the las vegas sun ron kantowski offers a little insight into the business of college sports he notes that unlv paid &# to wisconsin and that helped increase the season ticket sales for the rebels college football team to from how "wisconsin fans snap up the visiting teams ticket allotment within minutes of when they go on sale " kantowski writes "this forces those who milk cows and put the whiz in the cheez and the other working stiffs who cant take off to stand in line for tickets to purchase them for the entire rebels home season via the internet " the fans dont mind buying the extra tickets because the unlv season tickets cost as little as &# the windfall for unlv from this game could be as much as &# million "heres how a sharp guy from the other madison avenue might have approached it he could have asked &# for wisconsin and maybe &# for hawaii and another &# for byu two more good draws then lets say for the final three games you sell it for face value &# to the first utah colorado state and san diego state fan who approaches the ticket window and asks for the best seat available " tip of the fix cap to reader joan lima found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and
