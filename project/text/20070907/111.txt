weekend journal review books the trouble to come the iranian time bomb by michael a ledeen st martins pages &# the islamic republic of iran casts a giant shadow over todays middle east so much so that american policymakers are now as pre occupied with how to hold iran in check as they are with how best to wage the war in iraq the answers dont come easy in either case certain iran experts even acknowledging irans support for terrorists and nuclear ambitions have pushed for a strategy of "selective partnership " by which they mean some kind of diplomatic relations with iran in conjunction with our european allies but so far such efforts have proved ineffectual meanwhile the state departments attempts to cobble together sanctions against iran with the participation of other countries have failed miserably democrats routinely blame president bush for being alarmist about irans potential threat arguing that it might take a decade at least for iran to build a nuclear weapon their counsel is often one of diplomacy and delay but a few prominent democrats and bush critics have fallen silent of late sen joseph biden not much given to silence among them and little wonder the united nations international atomic energy agency recently declared that irans nuclear timetable is closer to three years or even two this week iran proudly announced that it had centrifuges online for refining uranium meanwhile the rhetoric of mahmoud ahmadinejad irans president is as toxic and combative as ever what to do michael ledeen thinks he has the answer mr ledeen has long been an advocate of "regime change" in iran but he has never been especially bellicose about it he has pointedly said that bombing iran as some analysts advocate is the wrong way to go and he has denounced gratuitous saber rattling he believes that irans citizens we need to remember that iran unlike so many other middle eastern nations has a broad middle class are deeply discontented with their rulers they are unhappy he says not only with mr ahmadinejad whose policies have maimed irans once thriving economy but also with the mullahs who govern so much of iranian life with a fierce allegiance to sharia law it is mr ledeens hope that the west led by the u s can encourage pro democracy movements within the country eventually leading to the kind of peoples revolution that we have seen in recent years in ukraine and lebanon if we just give dissidents in iran enough "hope information and some material support " mr ledeen says presumably money and laptops he rules out sending arms or using the cia then they will figure out a way to topple the hated regime and set up a more humane government and a more democratic one "the iranian time bomb" is a forceful argument for such a policy but also a harrowing portrait of iran itself a place where torture imprisonment and death are deployed to intimidate the populace and where outsize ambitions drive the ruling elite mr ledeen tells the story of ahmad batabi an iranian student whose picture appeared on the cover of the economist magazine holding up the bloody t shirt of a friend during anti regime protests in tehran in that picture earned mr batabi a death sentence from an iranian court a sentence that was commuted to years imprisonment mr batabi was subjected to torture and solitary confinement which finally left him in a coma the mullahs according to mr ledeen routinely release dissident prisoners on "medical leave" or "furlough" halfway through their ordeal so that family members and friends can see their physical and emotional scars and learn that there is no alternative to obedience in mr ledeens view americans know too little about such gruesome aspects of irans regime or just as important about irans imperial mission he argues that for the ayatollah khomeini the man who led the iranian revolution in and for each theocratic leader since america has been the one great obstacle to "iranian hegemony over the muslim middle east " iran watches the entire region from the khyber pass and the mountains of afghanistan to lebanon saudi arabia and egypt for opportunities to extend its influence and it seizes them at every chance it does so mr ledeen says by supporting terrorist militias like iraqs mahdi army lebanons hezbollah and the palestinians hamas the desire for hegemony is one reason why iran seeks a nuclear weapon the ultimate tool for dominating the muslim world it is also one reason why iran and its proxies are so intent on helping to defeat the u s in iraq and afghanistan they want to drive america out of the middle east the problem has been getting american policymakers to take this challenge seriously samuel johnson famously described second marriages as the triumph of hope over experience the same applies to the u s governments dealings with iran mr ledeen shows in woeful detail how one administration after another including the current one prefers to deal with an iran that exists only in their imaginations a normal nation state with normal foreign policy interests a country that can be wooed through "constructive engagement" or deterred by sanctions the real iran mr ledeen argues is beyond the reach of such strategies and it is hard to disagree with him given the ferocious character of the iranian regime though and the extent of its ambition one has to wonder whether mr ledeens solution a democratic revolution brought about in part by u s encouragement and aid is enough mr ledeen and like minded thinkers have been waiting more than a decade for such a middle class challenge to the mullahs power it has not happened yet and it may well not happen for some time to come as things now stand the stark truth is that popular discontent rarely turns into genuine revolution until a country is staring military disaster in the face or suffering the loss of an imperial patron it was fear of advancing austrian armies not the declaration of the rights of man and citizen that finally convinced the people of paris in to overthrow the monarchy and start afresh it was the collapse of russias armies in that prompted tens of thousands of workers sailors and army deserters to toss out a worthless czar and his government even the so called popular revolutions that swept eastern europe after the cold war only happened because mikhail gorbachevs soviet union no longer had the will to fire on unarmed crowds to protect its erstwhile power irans revolutionary guard will have no such qualms unless someone applies stronger medicine from outside the idea of a military confrontation with iran usually brings to mind air strikes to take out irans nuclear facilities or to cripple its infrastructure mr ledeen is opposed to such a move and understandably so given the risks but there is another military option using u s air power to protect a naval blockade of the hormuz straits cutting off irans supply of gasoline and other vital materials at the same time american special forces would seize iranian oil platforms in the persian gulf so that the mullahs would lose their source of revenue and one might hope their legitimacy in fact this strategy worked once before during the so called tanker war of when the iranian revolutionary guard started attacking american warships escorting kuwaiti tankers through the straits the u s navy took out the iranian oil platforms that the guard was using as staging areas and then blew the iranian navy out of the water when it came out to retaliate largely forgotten today the tanker war remains the largest single naval conflict since world war ii it even convinced the iranian revolutionary council that the u s was about to attack and forced the ayatollah khomeini to do the unthinkable and terminate his long war with iraq afterward khomeini said that signing the peace was like "drinking bitter poison " but he clearly feared american intervention more irans navy has never recovered from the tanker war its air force is moribund and its armys morale is in tatters the one military force that the mullahs can count on the vaunted revolutionary guard is manifestly corrupt and operates more like the mafia than a phalanx of storm troopers by its own admission one third of its operations are not military at all but commercial if war comes the guards leaders will likely be less concerned with fighting back than with protecting their ill gotten business rackets and monopolies under whatever regime takes the mullahs place meanwhile discontent within iran is growing the country is awash in cash from oil but must ration gasoline to its unhappy citizens roughly of them live below the poverty line there has been of late a tattoo of anti government riots in irans cities including tehran in short the moment is propitious commentators including mr ledeen often compare mr ahmedinejads iran to hitlers germany a better comparison might be to mussolinis italy behind the bombast and the facade of ideological solidarity is a regime rotten to the core when american soldiers landed on italian soil in the italians did not rally to il duce they strung him up by his heels perhaps mr ledeen is right and we wont need to take military action but perhaps not what was it that friedrich nietzsche said if you see something slipping give it a shove in the case of iran the time has come to start shoving mr herman is the author of "how the scots invented the modern world" and "to rule the waves how the british navy shaped the modern world "
