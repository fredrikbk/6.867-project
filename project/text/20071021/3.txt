family finances make a car sale final if you dont handle the sale of a used car or truck properly it could come back to haunt you you could be hit with parking tickets bills involving an accident or other expenses for a vehicle you thought was long out of your life just recently for instance my husband gerry received a collection letter from a local car towing and impound service the letter said he owed &# for towing and storage of a ford pickup that was impounded by the police in gerry did own that truck but years ago before selling it privately in most cases when you sell a vehicle the new buyer immediately has it retitled in his or her name if the buyer doesnt take that step however you might appear to still be the owner in our case the towing service did a search on the trucks vehicle identification number my husband appeared as the most recent owner the manager told me each state has different rules regarding proper title transfer in many states both the seller and the buyer have paperwork to fill out to ensure the transfer is legal per new jersey rules my husband had signed the back of the trucks existing title along with the date the trucks sale price and the odometer reading before handing it over to the buyer philip reed author of the book "strategies for smart car buyers " says providing an accurate odometer reading is critical because it provides proof of the moment in time the car is no longer yours "the key for readers is to actually look at the odometer dont round it off " he says "the buyer could go around the corner and have an accident and claim that you are responsible " most states recommend that buyers and sellers complete a bill of sale to provide proof of the transfer and to protect sellers from any future tickets violations or other problems with the vehicle dmv org a clearinghouse of motor vehicle information from all states provides a sample bill of sale at dmv org bill of sale form php other states require sellers to fill out an additional vehicle transfer form and suggest that sellers also notify the county tax assessors office of the sale documentation like a bill of sale protects the seller if the buyer doesnt retitle the car says keith kiser vice president of vehicle programs at the american association of motor vehicle administrators "as long as you can prove you sold the vehicle and everything is properly dated you shouldnt be legally bound to the failings of someone else " he says we looked over the paperwork from the sale of our truck which we keep tucked away in our fire resistant box along with purchase and sale documents from every car weve owned gerry had followed all the rules to transfer the title we had the bill of sale and the receipt for the license plates hes turned in as proof it wasnt difficult to resolve the problem from there but the incident drove home how important it is to maintain a paper trail when selling a car just a month ago id considered weeding out some of the older documents because our fire box was teeming with papers instead ill be buying a bigger one terri cullen is personal finance columnist for the wall street journal online wsj com
