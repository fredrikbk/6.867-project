wrights westcott house is made new again springfield ohio frank lloyd wright designed this citys westcott house in three years before his robie house in chicago both exemplify the maturity of his prairie style with its long roof lines and low rectilinear profile and both qualified for inclusion in his so called wasmuth portfolio the two volume collection of wrights self selected finest projects up to published that year in germany the portfolio alerted europe that the u s had a world class modernist architect too the similarity between the two dwellings may be said to have ended there their reputations in the interim have markedly diverged as have the fates of their respective cities whereas robie has been a well studied much loved canonical masterwork in histories and picture books of american architecture a narrative starring chicago as a prosperous and innovative player westcott has gone unmentioned even in most biographies of wright you can see why when looking at photographs of the place from the s and s during the post world war ii housing shortage the owners chopped it up into seven minuscule apartments wrights fixtures rotted or were stripped and his careful array of horizontal lines were jumbled as springfield once a dynamic midwest industrial hub shuttered its factories in the s and s many of its proudest structures including the westcott house collapsed into ruins like most ohio cities springfield is still leaking jobs and population but at least it can now boast once again of having the only prairie style wright house in the state open to the public since last year an impressive piece of architecture it turns out to be the frank lloyd wright building conservancy can be thanked for the turnaround it identified the importance of westcott and in bought the sagging eyesore for &# then resold the structure to the nonprofit westcott house foundation after five years and a &# million renovation that involved some laborers and craftsmen who shored up the foundation and rebuilt items of furniture it has been restored to a condition that is recognizably wright burton westcott was a typical wright client for this period like other turn of the century midwestern businessmen in chicago buffalo and cleveland he was wealthy and risk taking enamored of technology as well as nature a titan of industry might work in one of the new skyscrapers during the day but wanted to come home to the illusion of the country frederick robie had a bicycle company eventually bought out by schwinn and westcott was treasurer of a large farm implement company in springfield in he brought the family business westcott motor car co from richmond ind to springfield where its luxury coupes sedans and touring cars were assembled by hand in choosing wright as his architect he was demonstrating his progressive taste but the corner lot he gave him to work with the last one on springfields east high street known then as "millionaires row" was tiny little more than three quarters of an acre it had other problems as well a cemetery lies across the street and in an act of hubris that would shame even todays crassest real estate agents westcott petitioned the city to dig up the bodies and move them so his sleeping porch would not overlook the graves the city approved his plan to turn the cemetery into a park but never carried it through wrights response no doubt with the consent of westcott was to erect what today might be called a mcmansion the house is square feet and the garage now the gift shop and offices is square feet the tour guides claim springfield society derided wrights plan as "too modern " that may be unlike the tall filigreed victorian homes in the vicinity his sleek plan barely rises to two stories but westcotts neighbors may also have been upset and rightly so that the architect had extended the buildings in two of four directions almost to the property line robie house also could be seen as oversized for its site wright oriented the house toward east high street and in typical prairie style it seems to have grown out of the earth a patch of lawn rises like a wave from the sidewalk toward the living room two enormous urns the largest he ever designed for a home sit on the edge of a small pool a pair of large elm trees that once stood as sentinels on either side fell victim to disease but the retractable awning has been restored the house interior though offers the strongest sense of wrights velvet gloved masterly hand the main entrance is discreet along unbusy greenmount avenue the foyer is like a well with steps leading up into the house and once inside you are immediately aware of a contrast between dark and light the oak paneling throughout is stained a deep brown and the walls are plastered with encaustic each room has a color scheme olive blue or yellow the textural effect of the paraffin mixed with solid pigment is both plush and minimal at the same time the relative gloom of the entrance is pierced by beams of sunlight from a central skylight with its original stained glass above the staircase directly ahead to the right is a playroom the restorers have cleverly installed not only a childs table and chairs by wright but a set of froebel building blocks similar to the ones the architect played with as a boy and a toy reproduction of a westcott car to the left is the communal living area a flowing series of three rooms without doors and arranged around what wright deemed to be the center of any home he built the hearth to prevent this wide structure from interrupting the horizontal lines in play elsewhere wright used long slender bricks and in a characteristic touch decreed that the color of the masonry binding them be different white for lengthwise grout and a pale gray seamlessly matching the tone of the bricks for the vertical the highlight of the dining room is a handmade reproduction of a wright table and six straight back lattice work chairs like the set once owned by the westcotts at each of the tables four corners are square lampposts wired from below and clad in art glass this rectangular pattern is repeated in the four overhead lamps and found in other prairie style houses including robie the upstairs is more symmetrical with a pair of master bedrooms for burton and his wife orpha each with capacious bathroom and closets two bedrooms for the children are on one side of the house two maids rooms on the other the westcotts were among the first in springfield to have electricity one maids room features an original fixture as well as an original exceedingly sallow low watt bulb wright designed a pergola to run along the side street and to link the house with what was at first a stable for the childrens ponies and then a garage the small garden has been replanted and clematis has again taken hold on the trellises the westcott house foundation has also folded nature back into the plan by building a birdhouse for purple martins near the main entrance found in wright blueprints but never constructed it may not be "original" but looks it all of this sumptuousness was expensive at the time even without wrights fee land and house were assessed at &# in about &# today when the commission was fulfilled that it required so much more money to bring it back to life says a lot about the upkeep that it needed and has received the slogan for westcott motor car co "the car with a longer life " turned out to be a misnomer as burton westcott was forced to close the business in he died a year later broken hearted at the age of his descendents should take some solace in knowing that their family home is again a landmark that he and springfield can be proud of mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
