lithium ion problems hit matsushita cellphone battery replacement is potentially industrys largest tokyo a year after sony corp s much publicized voluntary recall of laptop batteries a similar problem at rival matsushita electric industrial co underscores the challenges that the battery industry continues to face nokia corp said tuesday that an overheating problem was reported in some lithium ion batteries made by matsushita that are used in million cellphones nokia said it would replace the batteries in a voluntary replacement program its not known how many batteries the company will swap but the number of potential replacements is more than four times bigger than sonys recall last year making it the biggest battery replacement program in the industry since dell inc shocked the world with a massive recall of sonys lithium ion laptop batteries last august the battery industry has been plagued by similar issues at other companies nearly every major computer maker has announced recalls of sony batteries while sanyo electric co has recalled laptop and mobile phone batteries the spate of reported issues and recalls is attributed in part to the companies responding more assertively in light of increasing consumer concerns but it also exposes the difficulties of manufacturing the batteries themselves rechargeable lithium ion batteries have been a major factor in the success of the laptop computer and mobile phone industries in the past years because they are inexpensive lightweight and environmentally safer than alternatives such as nickel cadmium however the batteries are difficult to manufacture are more prone to overheating and have more consequences than conventional alkaline batteries when they short circuit some of sonys batteries last year were found to catch fire in the case of the nokia cellphones the matsushita batteries overheated during charging exacerbating the situation computers and cellphones have become increasingly complex and have outpaced developments in battery technology which means greater burdens are being placed on the batteries since the negative fallout around batteries using lithium ion technology toyota motor corp has delayed plans to use them in hybrid cars still industry experts say that despite its limitations lithium ion is still the most practical battery technology for the foreseeable future sony this week announced it will spend billion yen &# million to build a cellphone battery factory in singapore seeking to maintain its share of this market sony will make batteries with a more advanced lithium ion polymer technology it plans to begin operations at the plant next august with an initial monthly capacity of one million batteries rising to eight million in companies such as toshiba corp are working to develop alternative energy sources such as fuel cells which dont use chemicals but they are still a long way from commercial use matsushita which is one of the worlds top four lithium ion battery makers said its battery problems were caused in manufacturing when a part designed to prevent short circuits by acting as a barrier between the positive and negative electrodes was scarred only cases of overheating in nokias phones have been reported and there have been no serious injuries nonetheless the company said it is taking a precaution by exchanging all batteries of the same kind made between december and november at its main plant in osaka in western japan matsushita is expected to bear most of the cost of the replacements which some people estimate could be about billion yen the companys shares closed down nearly at yen on the tokyo stock exchange yesterday
