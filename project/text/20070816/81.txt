politics &amp economics can u s force irans hand despite a lack of support washington an impending move by the u s to slap unilateral financial sanctions on irans secretive revolutionary guard corps reflects a growing sense within the bush administration that the best way to boost pressure on the iranian government now lies outside of the united nations after months of intense debate u s officials said they are increasingly concerned that objections from china and russia could block passage within the u n security council of any economic sanctions robust enough to get iran to back off its nuclear work so the bush administration is looking for other ways to step up economic restrictions on iran the u s and other countries allege that iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons while tehran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes designating the iranian revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist organization under u s law a step that may still be weeks away would significantly ratchet up white house efforts to squeeze iran financially but senior administration officials acknowledged that the move would have little impact unless irans key trading partners above all china japan germany france and italy agree to lend support by isolating the revolutionary guard and its many business units the efficacy of any move against the irgc could also depend on whether the u s provides a detailed list of companies controlled by the group something administration officials are working on since early the treasury department has been stepping up financial pressure on iran over its nuclear program and alleged support for terrorist groups it has blacklisted more than a dozen iranian companies banks and charities much of the focus has been on quarantining the vital nodes of the financial networks iran uses to sustain its programs such as major state owned banks two of the countrys biggest banks are blacklisted and more may soon be added to the list the u s is also considering adding the central bank of iran to the list of sanctioned iranian entities u s officials said treasury officials have barnstormed europe to explain to bank regulators and executives there how iran is using its financial system to allegedly further illicit activities two of germanys biggest banks recently agreed to end most of their business with iran the irgc however would offer by far the largest single target since its creation as a sort of peoples army following the islamic revolution in it has evolved into a massive and increasingly commercial enterprise experts say the irgc controls more than companies in iran many of which such as the engineering giant khatam ol anbia are involved in huge infrastructure and oil and gas pipeline projects many of the companies rely on outside suppliers subcontractors and lenders to do business the u s has long blocked u s companies from doing business in iran and lists the government of iran itself as a state sponsor of terrorism the legal order on the irgc would require u s companies and banks to seize any bank accounts held in the u s by any business entities controlled by the revolutionary guard more importantly it would provide the treasury department with leverage to go after foreign companies doing business with the irgc u s officials said they still have much work to do in trying to persuade european allies to impose similar economic restrictions on the revolutionary guard within the european union european diplomats yesterday said there have been numerous discussions between the u s and europe over how to proceed over the irgc but that no decisions had been made in major european capitals u s officials said they still hold out hope that the u n security council can move forward on another sanctions resolution on iran next month but many officials within the bush administration are increasingly convinced that the u n effort is running out of steam china and russia have resisted calls by both the u s and some in europe to impose stiffer economic punishments on iran in an effort to get it to suspend its uranium enrichment work and iran has continued to push ahead swiftly on its nuclear program in recent months
