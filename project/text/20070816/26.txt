optimistically in hindsight that the market would calm down on the injection of liquidity " mr bruce wrote "it has not in our view " in a report titled "liquidity is the achilles heel " mr bruce said demands for more collateral or repayments from lenders along with forced asset sales could weaken countrywide long viewed by wall street as one of the most solid mortgage companies he said the risk of such a "liquidity event" at countrywide is rising in one scenario he wrote if creditors were to cut off funding to countrywide forcing it to sell assets in a weak market "then it is possible for the company to go bankrupt " wall street analysts rarely raise such scenarios in published research for fear of alarming the market the merrill report noted that the firm has provided investment banking
