alcoa puts faith in ex siemens ceo at a crossroads following a failed merger attempt with its chief rival and widespread merger speculation alcoa inc tapped former siemens ag chief executive klaus kleinfeld as its no and likely successor to its current ceo in a sign that it hopes to pursue expansion opportunities as a standalone business but the appointment of mr kleinfeld a year old german with significant global deal making experience also marks a gamble that mr kleinfeld wont be tainted by the investigations at siemens mr kleinfeld announced in late april that he would step down from the german conglomerate after the supervisory board again delayed extending his contract amid a widening corruption scandal mr kleinfeld says he didnt do anything wrong but critics accused top management of not doing enough in recent years to clamp down on alleged bribery criminal prosecutors from several countries including the u s are investigating allegations that siemens managers paid bribes to potential customers abroad over several years "the board did look into that aspect and is quite comfortable and satisfied that mr kleinfeld is a person of the highest integrity " said kevin lowery a spokesman for new york based alcoa he said the company hadnt included any contract language to protect itself if mr kleinfeld should become involved in any investigations at siemens alcoa said mr kleinfeld wasnt available for comment mr kleinfeld an alcoa board member will become president and chief operating officer effective oct alcoas chairman and ceo alain belda is years old and widely expected to retire next year the position of president and chief operating officer had been vacant since mr belda was named to his current position in "were going to have a planned and orderly transition and klaus is obviously at the center of that " said mr lowery mr kleinfelds compensation package includes a &# million salary a &# million signing bonus and &# million stock award that take effect oct the company said he is entitled to &# million in stock and options equity awards that are service and performance based he also is entitled to cash incentives based on performance that would range from more than a years salary to more than double that amount although mr kleinfeld is joining a company that is far smaller than munich based siemens he is expected to have more leeway at alcoa because of different corporate governance structures in germany companies have a management board and a nonexecutive supervisory board that vets major management decisions thus limiting a ceos powers the alcoa move gives mr kleinfeld a chance to distance himself from siemenss troubles and make his mark one of the biggest questions surrounding the company is whether it will pursue a deal in the wake of its unsuccessful hostile bid in july for canadian aluminum giant alcan inc that attempt which failed when australias rio tinto plc swooped in with a higher bid was viewed as a major disappointment to mr belda "the fundamental decision mr kleinfeld will have to make is whether to sell the company or build the company " says john tumazos a former senior metals analyst with prudential who now has his own firm very independent research mr tumazos said he believes the company could remain independent because demand for aluminum world wide remains strong moreover the fallout in the credit markets has put a damper on deals for the foreseeable future especially those involving private equity firms still alcoa could become an attractive target as it continues to explore divesting itself of several downstream operations including its underperforming consumer packaging business which makes reynolds wrap aluminum foil shedding noncore operations is an area where mr kleinfeld has demonstrated success mr kleinfeld headed siemenss u s unit from until the end of and was credited with helping bring the money losing business back into the black by closing divisions and slashing jobs after becoming ceo of siemens in early he moved quickly to restructure the wide ranging company by selling struggling businesses such as wireless telephone handsets and acquiring companies in areas such as medical diagnostics the moves helped boost profit margins after becoming ceo of siemens in january mr kleinfeld moved quickly to overhaul the far flung conglomerate by selling poorly performing businesses such as wireless telephone handsets and making acquisitions in areas such as medical equipment to narrow the companys focus the moves helped boost profits and made him popular with investors although some analysts had been expecting an internal successor for mr belda the move isnt unprecedented indeed former chairman and chief executive paul oneill had been an outside director before being tapped to lead the company for example alcoa directors launched their search for mr beldas eventual successor in spring and started wooing mr kleinfeld soon after according to one person familiar with the situation alcoa extended him a tentative offer in august this person recalled and then gave him six months to complete pending initiatives believing the siemens ceo was such an attractive prospect mr kleinfeld dragged out his decision about joining alcoa until this may this person added soon after he announced his planned exit from siemens the courtship resumed with negotiations turning serious earlier this summer alcoas new second in command signed his employment contract tuesday according to this individual yesterday in p m trading on the
