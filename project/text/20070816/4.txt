a cause of child auto deaths draws increased attention some say tall suvs worsen the problem of backovers regulators step up research many people are familiar with the perils children face in cars from poorly installed booster seats to a lack of safety features in older vehicles but they often overlook a significant danger outside the vehicle sometimes drivers injure or kill children by accidentally backing over them and often the driver is the victims parent pulling out of a driveway such tragedies are getting increased attention with federal regulators planning more research into prevention and consumer organizations contending that the problem is on the rise from to children died after being backed over by a vehicle compared with from to according to kids and cars a nonprofit consumer advocacy group the group which is funded largely by private donations says its estimates are based on police reports media reports and tips from lawyers as well as discussions with the national highway traffic safety administration so far the nhtsa the federal agency that overseas vehicular safety has few statistics of its own on such accidents because the incidents occur mostly on private property however late last year the agency published a report at the behest of congress on backovers and the use of electronic sensing technologies to possibly prevent them nhtsa officials say they have combined information from federal crash records with death certificate reports and other data to develop rough estimates of at least fatalities annually caused by drivers striking pedestrians while backing up as many as injuries many relatively minor result from backover crashes per year the agency says the report said that the nhtsa doesnt have evidence that the problem is on the rise but it did find that the backup detection technology available in cars today "is expensive unreliable and gives drivers a false sense of security " says nhtsa spokesman rae tyson the agency is continuing to gather statistics to better track backover accidents and it plans to work to improve the use of electronic detection systems that can be installed in vehicles to potentially help alert drivers to backovers many consumer advocates and parents believe the problem of backover accidents is exacerbated by the way vehicles are designed taller suvs and crossovers with big rearward blind spots are increasingly popular also most cars today have high trunks and small rear windows that dont allow drivers to see certain obstacles close behind them very young children are simply not tall enough to be seen out of the back window of many of todays vehicles some advocates including janette fennell founder of kids and cars in leawood kan have called for the government to mandate the use of backover detection systems angela gridley says her daughter aliviah would probably be alive today if her uncles pickup truck had a rear view camera the cedartown ga mother of four says her year old darted behind the truck as it was backed out of the driveway at a family gathering in late however she says that while electronics can help drivers avoid accidents the biggest contributing factor may be parents denial "they really think it cant happen to them " says ms gridley "its like a syndrome " the nhtsa notes that backup technology systems are marketed largely as parking aids and are not an ideal way of detecting small children behind a vehicle the agency which plans to continue to research the potential of such technology conducted a number of tests in which children were placed behind vehicles equipped with a variety of rear sensing devices in many instances the equipment failed to detect the children "it was scary " mr tyson says last years nhtsa report was a follow up to a similar report about years ago the first one focused more on commercial trucks and the bulk of available detection equipment came from aftermarket sources and had to be added to a vehicle after purchase now the emphasis of the agencys inquiries has shifted to passenger vehicles where detection technology is increasingly available on cars and suvs directly from auto makers still the technology has been relatively slow in coming to market and the vast majority of passenger cars lack rear view cameras one reason is that while back up cameras themselves are relatively inexpensive costing about &# to &# they are typically available only when buyers also order a much costlier satellite navigation system thats because navigation systems come with dashboard mounted screens that also work with the camera with a satellite system costing as much as &# many shoppers skip both options toyota motor corp is one manufacturer trying to overcome the sticker shock by offering backup cameras either with or without navigation systems on its recently redesigned tundra pickup truck and highlander suv but a toyota spokesman notes that rear mounted sensors were designed mainly to warn of the proximity of another cars bumper or other large obstacles while parking rather than to detect small children nissan motor co too which installed division installed rear view cameras on its model infiniti q sedan as part of a package with a navigation system says the cameras and sensors on its vehicles are parking aids and arent meant to detect children ford motor co offers a rear view camera system bundled with other options on its ford f series super duty f expedition lincoln mark lt and navigator ford spokeswoman tara martin says the company doesnt consider its rear view cameras and rear sensors as safety features but as conveniences for parking and towing see related letter "letters to the editor circle for safety method can prevent child deaths" wsj aug
