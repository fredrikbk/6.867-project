sonic diagnosis is found effective ultrasound technology was found to be more effective than typical methods in diagnosing infections in artificial hips and knees a study result that may lead to wider use of the technique in all forms of medical implants the ultrasound technique known as sonication could improve care for the often debilitating and difficult to treat infections about a million patients develop infections associated with implanted medical devices in the u s each year in the study of patients sound waves were used to batter parts of artificial hip and knee samples submerged in liquid to dislodge bacteria on them the dislodged bacteria reacting with chemicals in the liquid would then adhere to metal plates from which cultures could be made researchers also used the typical method of taking a sample of tissue growing around joint replacements they found sonication diagnosed infections in of patients who were in fact infected that compared to accuracy by the usual means "sonication could help diagnose infections in all sorts of implanted materials including breast implants defibrillators catheters " said robin patel one of the studys authors and a researcher at the mayo clinic rochester minn the study appears in todays issue of the new england journal of medicine sonication is commonly used in laboratories for mixing chemicals and other tasks many jewelers use the technique to clean their gems it isnt yet widely used for diagnosing infections in medical implants joint replacements are increasingly popular in the u s boosted by an aging and more active population in doctors implanted prosthetic knees up from in and prosthetic hips up from in according to the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons the academy predicts that by million americans will get knee or hip replacements each year when joint replacements fail which they do in about of cases figuring out the cause is difficult yet crucial patients may experience pain with no other sign of what is wrong the problem can be mechanical or the result of an infection and the care for each is different heartened by the results the mayo clinic this year began using sonication to diagnose infections in all of its patients who have prosthetic joints removed other hospitals may begin using the technique because the required technology is already in their laboratories the results are likely to encourage study of sonication as a means of diagnosing infections related to other medical implants the method already has been shown to improve accuracy in examining central venous catheters which are a major source of hospital born infections
