paulson expects markets to slow not stall growth washington treasury secretary henry paulson in his first public comments since the sharp downturn in financial markets said the turmoil "will extract a penalty on the growth rate" of the u s economy but he expressed confidence that "the economy and the markets are strong enough to absorb the losses" without provoking a u s recession the market turmoil occurs "against a backdrop of a very healthy global economy with strong fundamentals " mr paulson said in an interview in his office reflecting on a year career on wall street he added "looking over periods of stress that ive seen this is the strongest global economy weve had " some funds or businesses may go under and the "adjustment" in financial markets is likely to continue the former goldman sachs group inc chief executive said but he emphasized that he expects the u s economy to keep growing nonetheless senior economic policy officials talk carefully when markets are gyrating they are aware that if they say anything that undermines public or investor confidence they can unintentionally exacerbate problems but are also aware that appearing complacent or unconcerned can damage their credibility mr paulson sought to walk that delicate line in yesterdays hourlong interview speaking slowly and picking his words with care he said the recent "reassessment or repricing of risk " as he termed the widespread reluctance to make loans to more risky home buyers and firms and to hold securities backed by such loans "shouldnt surprise anyone " mr paulson stopped short of calling this welcome but termed it "inevitable " "when you have periods of benign markets particularly in situations where parts of markets and the economy are growing at levels that are unsustainable market participants arent going to be as vigilant as they should be " he said the current strength of the global economy he said is one major difference between this crisis and the one it most closely resembles the episode in which russias debt default and currency devaluation and the implosion of hedge fund long term capital management led credit markets to seize up although the u s economy has slowed the international monetary fund recently projected that the world economy will grow at a better than clip this year and next after three years of unusually strong growth other big differences between and mr paulson said are the global integration of economies and markets over the past decade and the large increase in the number and size of hedge funds and other private pools of capital he said that beyond the steps already taken to encourage more transparency among hedge funds and the like the ability of the bush administration to react constructively is limited it has largely relied on the federal reserve and other central banks to fight the financial fire by pumping large amounts of liquidity into parched money markets "there is nothing in my judgment that we should be doing in terms of guaranteeing market participants against losses or in terms of restraining risk taking " mr paulson said "one of the natural consequences of the excesses is that some entities will cease to exist " he hesitated to specify areas where he and regulators will focus in coming months as they draw lessons from recent weeks "clearly there really needs to be a focus on mortgages and how the product is originated and sold " he said a major source of todays problems was deterioration of the standards used to issue mortgages particularly in the subprime market and the ripple effects when delinquency rates on those loans began to rise the persistence of the housing bust the shrinking of the subprime mortgage market and problems in the market for large or jumbo mortgages have prompted calls in washington for widening the powers of government sponsored enterprise mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac and pleas from the companies to lift caps on the size of the two firms portfolios the u s office of federal housing enterprise oversight which regulates fannie and freddie recently rejected at least for now the pairs bid to raise limits on the size of the portfolios of mortgages and mortgage backed securities they can hold noting the market for prime conventional mortgages of less than &# they typically hold is functioning reasonably well mr paulson echoed that reasoning "where weve got issues are in the riskier mortgages and in the jumbo prime mortgages where legislation is necessary" for fannie and freddie to participate he said "clearly were looking at all the policy levers available to us to increase liquidity in the markets thats the job youd expect us to be doing right now and in that context of course well look at what levers are available here " he encouraged fannie and freddie to use the ability they already have to help the mortgage market for lower income and other subprime borrowers noting freddies april vow to buy &# billion of subprime loans over the next several years for its portfolio and fannies similar initiative the treasury secretary wouldnt specifically respond to a question about the role of credit rating companies which have been widely criticized for their favorable evaluations of some mortgage backed securities but cited a need for "better understanding" of increasingly complex financial instruments mr paulsons wall street background stands in contrast to the previous two bush administration treasury secretaries who had been chief executives of industrial companies after taking office in july he initiated scenario planning exercises some in cooperation with his british counterpart to prepare for market turmoil and ordered up communications protocols for various eventualities he also reopened the treasurys market monitoring room which had been shuttered to save money by his immediate predecessor john snow a former railroad executive and economist in august at an annual gathering of mr bush and his economic advisers at the presidential retreat at camp david in maryland mr paulson outlined "the possibility of turbulence in markets and the reassessment of risk " this years session was held at the treasury department last wednesday just before markets tanked since then mr paulson said he has talked frequently by phone with fed chairman ben bernanke and other members of the presidents working group on financial markets wall street executives he knows from his past career and a couple of his counterparts in other countries corrections &amp amplifications an interview with treasury secretary henry paulson that was featured in a front page article yesterday was conducted tuesday the article incorrectly said the interview was conducted wednesday wsj aug
