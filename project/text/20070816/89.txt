personal dose in milestone fda pushes genetic tests tied to drug agency seeks to tame risks of blood thinner some doctors protest in may karen schmale was rushed to barnes jewish hospital in st louis gasping for air diagnosed with blood clots in her lungs she was given a powerful blood thinner called warfarin the medicine probably helped save her life then it almost killed her about a week later ms schmale years old noticed blood in her urine and soon became so weak she could barely climb the stairs to her second floor apartment the warfarin was causing the bleeding and she had to go back to the hospital for an emergency blood transfusion a genetic test revealed ms schmale was unusually sensitive to the drug and needed a smaller dose before the test "nobody knew i was going to react like that " says ms schmale a data entry coordinator at a university in st louis the case shows the advances in personalized medicine where treatment is tailored to an individuals genetic makeup but in a possible harbinger of battles to come the warfarin tests have also led to a clash between the food and drug administration and some doctors the fda is set to announce today that warfarins label will carry new information describing the role of genetics in dosing the label will say that a lower initial warfarin dose "should be considered for patients with certain genetic variations " some specialists say testing hasnt been proved to reduce the risks of the drug they fear patients who dont get the tests and run into trouble will sue doctors citing the drugs label while medicare covers the tests which generally cost between &# and &# major insurers such as aetna inc wellpoint inc and cigna corp dont the insurers say they need more evidence about the benefits "it would be irresponsible and potentially harmful to suggest that testing be used or even mentioned in the label " said university of washington professor ann wittkowsky in an interview before the fdas decision "it is fascinating science but it is not yet ready for prime time " larry lesko director of the clinical pharmacology office at the fda says the agency has "substantial" evidence to support the new label and hopes it will improve safety by informing doctors dr lesko is part of a larger initiative at the fda to promote the use of genetic factors to predict how individuals will react to medicines its a shift for the agency which traditionally has more of a reactive role as the regulator of the drug industry "if the potential wasnt huge we wouldnt be doing it " he says "we felt we had to be more outspoken " the agency has already included information about genetic testing on the labels of less frequently used drugs for colon cancer and leukemia among others one drug genentech inc s herceptin for breast cancer is designed especially for women whose tumor cells have a genetic abnormality but warfarin is the largest case study to date of what happens when the new science of genetics runs up against the everyday practice of medicine originally marketed as a rat poison the drug was prescribed more than million times last year in the u s according to ims health its available as an inexpensive generic pill its main problem is the narrow window for safety an excessive dose leads to bleeding warfarin is the second most likely drug after insulin to send americans to the emergency room by one estimate it accounts for er visits a year in the u s if tests for warfarin sensitivity genes become commonplace it would encourage other efforts to develop genetic tests linked to popular drugs researchers are looking at how genes affect the action of such drugs as the antidepressant prozac the diabetes drug metformin and the asthma inhaler albuterol a team of harvard researchers has shown good results with a genetic test predicting who will fail to respond to albuterol and similar drugs says scott weiss a professor involved in the study "theres going to be a debate about every one of these tests " says dr weiss researchers began developing warfarin as a drug for people after an army inductee during the korean war tried to commit suicide by eating it he survived and doctors were struck by how effectively the poison had restricted his bloods clotting ability or coagulation president eisenhower took it after a heart attack the drugs generic name derives from the wisconsin alumni research foundation or warf which originally held the patent on it it is also known by the brand name coumadin from the start doctors struggled with how to give warfarin safely in the s they began using a measure called international normalized ratio that compares the bloods clotting ability at a given moment to a standardized measure typically doctors prescribe an initial warfarin dose based on factors including a patients size age and other medications they check the patients blood frequently every few days at first and tweak the dose to bring the inr within the desired range stephanie davis a development director for a johns hopkins university cancer center in baltimore developed blood clots in both legs after a long flight home from california three years ago as she was released from the hospital she was prescribed warfarin to prevent new clots and told to visit a clinic two days later so her blood could be checked the test showed ms daviss inr wasnt in the target range so her dose was adjusted and she had to return two days later in the end she spent five months visiting the clinic every other morning before she went to work even after that she still had to get checked twice a week eventually she stopped taking warfarin her doctors felt she didnt need to be on a blood thinner full time "it is so frustrating " says ms davis who is on the board of an organization for people with blood clots without such scrutiny warfarin can be deadly maria tirado a year old diabetic who suffered from an irregular heartbeat was prescribed a high dose after a brief hospital visit the doctor noted that if her inr went above a certain number the drug should be halted but staffers at the la jolla nursing and rehabilitation center in la jolla calif didnt check her inr according to a state inspection report and kept giving the high dose for at least three weeks ms tirado was eventually brought to an emergency room and died in january after "massive bleeding into the brain " the inspection report said ms tirados family is suing the nursing centers owner and people involved in her care andrew torok the centers general counsel declined to discuss specifics of the case but said the center is appealing the states findings he said the center is "dedicated to providing quality care" and is "committed to taking whatever corrective actions are warranted " about a decade ago research began to show that a gene known as cypc could affect how peoples bodies process warfarin people with certain variants tended to break down the drug more slowly meaning it stayed in the body longer in its potent form a study in the journal of the american medical association suggested these people were more likely to get too much warfarin and bleed a few years later researchers discovered that a gene known as vkorc also plays a role it affects how efficiently the body processes vitamin k that is relevant because warfarins anticlotting action comes from its ability to interfere with vitamin k a study in the new england journal of medicine affirmed that patients with certain variants of vkorc appeared to need lower warfarin doses doctors in the field say that traditional measurements such as size and age account for just to of the variability in responses to warfarin adding the genetic factors can raise that figure to or higher say advocates of genetic testing ms schmale in st louis says she had a rare combination of both genes that made her highly sensitive to warfarin doctors had started her on a daily dose of milligrams of the drug but after the tests she ended up on a dose averaging less than one milligram a day for another patient year old john d marlin genetics pointed in the opposite direction when he developed a clot in his lung this may the retired biology teacher from evansville ill was told he would start with four milligrams of warfarin each day but after the genetic test doctors switched the dose to eight to nine milligrams daily "i just dont absorb it very well so it takes more of it to work " mr marlin says ms schmale and mr martin were part of a study led by brian gage an associate professor at washington university "theres clear agreement that variants of these genes affect the therapeutic dose of warfarin so the product labeling ought to reflect that knowledge " says dr gage as studies on the genetic connections began to appear the fdas dr lesko was intrigued he is a year old pharmacologist and former university of maryland researcher the agencys database showed warfarin had one of the highest rates of reported side effects the year old drug seemed like a perfect subject for a working group dr lesko and others had formed to examine how emerging science could be translated into real world safety improvements dr lesko had a personal experience with the issue when his year old mother in law prescribed warfarin after a hip replacement struggled with the frequent blood checks "using genetic factors not only improves safety that was my belief but it also was a way around the inconvenience " he says in november an outside fda advisory committee by an vote favored putting information about genetic tests on warfarins label "i think doctors need to know " says the panels chairman david flockhart a professor at indiana university but the agency has encountered resistance from doctors who believe the tests benefits are unproven on may of this year dr lesko addressed a medical group called the anticoagulation forum which includes doctors nurses and others who work at clinics focused on clot treatment he said warfarin doses were being set by "trial and error " and described how genetic testing might help dr leskos talk "put a chill up many of our spines " says david garcia of the university of new mexico the forums president dr garcia notes that no one has conducted a clinical trial focused on bleeding rates that randomly assigns patients with clots to either the genetic testing approach or the traditional way of prescribing warfarin unless such a trial proves that the tests lead to better safety "its all just theoretical " says dr garcia the forums board wrote a letter to dr lesko warning that doctors might rely too heavily on the tests and fail to monitor patients closely enough the letter said doctors might think they had to wait for test results to come back before giving patients any warfarin although the fda says thats not what it intends the group asked that any new label "reflect the uncertainty" so doctors wouldnt be held liable in court for failing to do the tests in a nod to such concerns the new warfarin label keeps the genetic factors out of a "black box" at the top of the label that warns of bleeding risk it also refrains from directly recommending that doctors conduct the genetic tests when they prescribe warfarin however a section of the label called "precautions" says certain variations in the two key genes "may increase the need for more frequent inr monitoring and the use of lower warfarin doses " another part of the label summarizes the genetic research on warfarin for doctors the new label may create practical dilemmas experts are still developing guidelines for how to translate genetic results into a recommended dose washington universitys dr gage has one computer program posted at warfarindosing org but there is no definitive model the fda is backing research to develop a guide three fda officials including deputy commissioner randall lutter released an economic analysis last november projecting that widespread use of the tests in the u s could avoid serious bleeding events and strokes a year and save about &# billion annually david matchar director of the center for clinical health policy research at duke university calls it a "very optimistic interpretation " and says there is "a disconnect between the clinical evidence and the idea that the fda should be advocating for this " the fdas dr lutter an economist says the analysis was meant to "draw attention to the exciting opportunities" and is "consistent with our mission of protecting and promoting the public health " but wasnt intended as a treatment recommendation dr lesko says "the evidence for updating this label was much more substantial than it has been for other label updates " in the past year a growing number of lab testing companies including the for profit unit of the mayo clinic and laboratory corp of america holdings have begun doing warfarin genetic tests quest diagnostics inc another major testing company plans to introduce one soon because it takes time to get test results doctors typically have to decide the initial dose using older methods some testing labs say they can deliver results in one to three days labcorp does its test only at a facility in north carolina and it takes about days to get results a company official says it hasnt heard complaints about the turnaround time medco health solutions inc which manages employers drug benefit plans is doing a study with the mayo clinic to examine the effect of the genetic testing in a real world setting robert epstein chief medical officer of medco says an fda label change could have a big impact but some insurers are "waiting for studies like the one were doing to see what is the ultimate outcome "
