nolan ryan pitches virtues of u s beef to dubious japanese tokyo baseball legend nolan ryan is making a big pitch to get the japanese to eat american beef again its a tough task given that consumers havent really missed it as part of a summerlong campaign the hall of fame pitcher has his picture in the meat aisles at major grocery stores under the slogan "beef makes you strong " mr ryan threw out a ceremonial first pitch during a baseball game in chiba a tokyo suburb last month a concession stand called the "american meat booth" sold bento boxes filled with american beef and featuring mr ryans photo the campaign is part of a broader effort by the u s meat export federation to get the japanese to buy american beef again the japanese government banned u s beef in after an outbreak of mad cow disease the ban was partially lifted in june but consumers havent flocked back retailers say sales are just of what they were before the ban when japan was the no importer of american beef "were trying to win back the hearts and stomachs of the japanese " says philip seng president of the denver based federation making mr sengs job even harder the overall demand for beef in japan has been slowing during the economic heyday of the late s and early s consumers lusted for fat rib eye and juicy filet mignon which were about half the price of costly japanese beef but lately the japanese have been opting for fish chicken and pork per capita consumption of beef in japan is down from according to japans agriculture bureau as the market shrinks competition intensifies australia new zealand and other beef producing countries that havent had an outbreak of mad cow disease have capitalized on the u s beef ban over of the meat sold in japan last year was imported from australia while american beef was banned as the japanese eat less beef theyre more willing to splurge expensive japanese beef made up of all beef sales last year up from half that in "the market itself has changed " says shirou inukai deputy director of the meat market and trade policy division of japans agriculture bureau "when american beef was gone australian beef filled the void " the meat export federation which develops overseas markets for beef pork and lamb has wooed japanese retailers in hopes they would carry american beef again and has lobbied washington to demand that the japanese government ease its remaining import restrictions but to revive the japanese appetite for u s beef the association figured it also had to connect directly with customers mr ryan who now raises cattle in texas and is well known in baseball crazed japan seemed like the perfect spokesman so the federation developed its elaborate "beef makes you strong " "beef de genki " campaign starring mr ryan and featuring more than different beef related promotions over a three month period developed in house the campaign includes advertisements in magazines and newspapers that give mr ryans and other famous athletes favorite red meat recipes a sweepstakes at more than retailers gives customers who buy american beef the chance to enter to win prizes such as autographed baseballs and barbecue pits photos of mr ryan at his ranch in texas hang in the beef aisles at major grocery stores including seiyu ltd the japanese subsidiary of wal mart stores inc and japans third largest grocery store chain by sales the promotion also included focus groups at which mr ryan told customers how the beef ban had affected his family ranch which produces about calves a year and has seen prices fall due to a decrease in demand mr ryan known for his record breaking fastball retired from major league baseball in and is now president of the american breeds coalition an organization that promotes u s cattle the federation declined to say how much the campaign cost monthly sales of american beef have doubled since the campaign started in june according to mr seng but he says the beef industry still has a lot of work to do the u s currently exports about tons of beef per month to japan compared with about tons before the ban haruo yoshida a manager in the meat department at a tokyo grocery store says the campaign hasnt affected his customers "we mostly sell japanese beef u s beef isnt popular at all " he says the anxiety over american beef started in when the first case of mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy was found in the u s more than people mostly in britain have died from consuming meat of infected animals since the human variant of the disease was first spotted in in japan reported its first human death exacerbating consumers fears japan has found more than cases of mad cow disease in its own cows since but has managed to ease the publics fears by implementing strict health screenings on all japanese cows japan partially lifted its ban on u s beef in december but enforced it again in january when the japanese government said it spotted a safety violation today japan only allows beef imports from the u s if its from cattle younger than months because younger cows are believed to be safer the u s beef industry is pushing tokyo to change the age to months sachiko takahashi a year old homemaker says shes noticed the nolan ryan campaign in the meat aisle of her local seiyu store but it hasnt convinced her to buy u s beef again "even though they say its safe now i am not sure " she says "besides japanese beef is delicious " naoto okamura contributed to this article
