orpheus at glimmerglass cooperstown n y for his first season as general and artistic director of glimmerglass opera michael macleod decided to mark the th anniversary of monteverdis "lorfeo" the earliest surviving opera with four operatic versions of the orpheus story if this sounds tediously repetitive it is not the works with dates spanning four centuries are very different musical and theatrical confections indeed the two latest ones are only loosely based on the story of the great singer who travels to the underworld and uses music to reclaim his beloved eurydice from death producers tend to be afraid that the monteverdi opera which is very static and full of pastoral choruses will bore the audience the director of the work at glimmerglass christopher alden must have been very worried because he corrupted it completely grafting on a new gimmicky scenario his orfeo michael slattery became a rock star with a dissolute entourage some in quasi renaissance garb all lying around or jumping on mismatched furniture in what looked like a paneled basement lit a bilious yellow paul steinberg designed the set doey luthi the costumes and adam silverman the lighting the wedding to euridice megan monaghan did not seem to be cause for much rejoicing as the two spouses clearly didnt like each other euridice got taped to a wall caronte read a newspaper pluto raped proserpina orfeos famous plea to caronte to allow him to cross the styx was rewarded with applause and money so much for the power of music it was all very ugly there was musical corruption as well the orchestra led by antony walker and buttressed with some period instruments had good energy but it often went too far and some of the continuo instruments were miked making it sound aggressively like a rock band while slow sections sagged interminably even worse the singers were coached into some blatant belting and crooning which spoiled the exquisite music since glimmerglass has never produced "lorfeo" before it seemed especially pointless to offer it in a form that bore so little resemblance to its th century origins glucks orpheus opera went through numerous revisions after its premiere in vienna glimmerglass chose to present it in the edition created by the composer hector berlioz for paris in "orphee et eurydice " sung in french was a vehicle for the mezzo soprano pauline viardot in the role of orpheus earlier versions were scored for castrati and high tenor but glimmerglass cast the male soprano michael maniaci mr maniaci has some spectacular high notes which enabled him to actually sing the showy aria "amour viens rendre a mon ame " which gluck first added for the hero then a tenor in however the arias flashy ornamentation just the sort of thing that gluck wrote his "reform" opera to eliminate sounded like a siren a party trick rather than an expressive element indeed mr maniaci didnt quite have the charisma to carry the opera soprano amanda pabyan in the relatively tiny role of eurydice made a better more heart felt connection julian wachners conducting was prosaic director lillian groag and designer john conklin opted for a classical frame of arches and columns the furies looked like bedlam inmates in constance hoffmans homespun gowns and the elysian fields were an enlightenment paradise with the shades doing art and admiring astronomical models the production hinted at the artists struggle between passion and rationality but it did not successfully solve the problem of what to do about all that dance music when you have only two dancers katarzyna skarpetowska and trey gillen choreographed by nicola bowie gave it their best shot but it wasnt enough offenbachs "orpheus in the underworld" sung in english was frothy operetta fun its excellent tunes kept bubbling by conductor jean marie zeitouni in this story the philandering title character annoys his wife with endless saccharine violin solos she runs away with a shepherd who turns out to be pluto orpheus is thrilled but public opinion insists that he must retrieve her trips ensue both to olympus where jupiters progeny squabble and complain about their boring diet of nectar and ambrosia and the underworld where pluto throws a party complete with the famous can can glimmerglass went all out on the costumes for this one gabriel berry did bright colors and multiple layers in the first scene eurydices stiff polka dot dress got ripped off to reveal a candy pink ball gown the final party scene was a riot of transvestitism eric einhorns directing was as detailed as the costumes allen moyers set cleverly suggested all three worlds unlike earlier operatic versions this is eurydices show and jill gardner was forceful if lacking in nuance the vocal standout was one of the companys young artists the sparkling joelle harvey as a scene stealing cupid the best show of the season turned out to be the most recent philip glasss "orphee" based on the cocteau film this moody piece has a cinematic flow with theatrical scenes that dissolve musically from one to the next and conversational vocal writing that floats through the propulsive orchestration here too the story is altered the poet orphee is seduced by death a k a la princesse who kills others including eurydice to get to him but finally sacrifices herself to his artistic immortality sam helfrichs precise directing and andrew liebermans set an elegant modern apartment with mirror image spaces to evoke the movement between worlds and kaye voyces costumes modern with surrealistic touches were beautifully appropriate to the work so was ann mansons skillful conducting which maintained the pulse of the opera and kept the orchestral writing clear "orphee" also had the most consistently top flight cast lisa saffer was extraordinary as la princesse combining the vocal acrobatics needed for the roles high tessitura with deep emotional power jeffrey lentz was touching as her loyal chauffeur heurtebise who falls in love with eurydice philip cutlip gave a subtle performance as the confused orphee and caroline worra was forthright and warm as eurydice an ordinary girl saddled with a genius the production proved that high concept has its place if this theme season was intended to spark reflection about the power of music it worked best when all the pieces combined to let the music speak
