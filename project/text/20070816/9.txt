the nations largest builders of starter homes those betting against beazer homes now might have the upper hand its recent disclosure of accounting irregularities is expected to accelerate a months long government inquiry that began in may says a person familiar with the situation late last week beazer said its former chief accounting officer improperly recorded "reserves and other accrued liabilities" on the companys books a continuing internal investigation found that the improper accounting was related to land development and home completion costs the executive michael t rand was dismissed in late june after beazer said he had attempted to destroy company documents mr rands lawyer declined to comment the disclosure is expected to bolster an investigation by the securities and exchange commission related to whether beazer of atlanta violated securities laws the sec hasnt specified the focus of its probe disclosed in early may but the inquiry came amid charges from home buyers in north carolina that beazers mortgage unit steered them to loans they couldnt afford while home builder stocks have been hurt by the turmoil in the housing and credit markets beazers share price which hit a week high of &# on dec has been hurt more than most in addition to the investigations the company has been beset with rumors that it was going to file for bankruptcy court protection beazer has called the rumors "scurrilous" and "unfounded " after months of decline beazers share price shot up aug after hedge fund investor citadel investment group disclosed it had bought more shares the next week short sellers were covering their bets a move that typically drives share prices higher the accounting news was disclosed last friday beazer shares fell cents or to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday giving the company a market value of about &# million one possible focus of the secs inquiry is whether beazer was properly disclosing its mortgage practices to investors said the person familiar with the situation accounting irregularities in the companys books however can be easier for investigators to pursue this person said an sec spokesman declined to comment beazer which found the accounting irregularities during its internal inquiry into its mortgage operations says it is cooperating with the sec "so far everything suggests the mortgage issues were a local problem " says robert curran an analyst at fitch ratings "whereas the accounting issue appears to be a corporatewide problem " he said the disclosure raises the possibility beazer may have to restate prior earnings or take a charge when an eroding housing market has already battered the builders profits beazers accounting woes coupled with the overall issues in the credit and housing markets set off a wave of warnings by debt analysts this week beazers bonds which total about &# billion already are rated below investment grade or "junk " by most ratings agencies fitch downgraded much of the companys debt to double b from double b plus while moodys said it put its ratings under review for a downgrade standard &amp poors placed beazers corporate credit and unsecured debt ratings on "creditwatch negative" indicating that a downgrade is possible the boston law firm of brown rudnick berlack israels llp has scheduled a meeting of beazers bondholders today to discuss "recent developments" as well as the companys announcement that it would delay filing its fiscal third quarter financial results while beazer hasnt detailed what went wrong in its accounting its description indicates a classic case of cookie jar accounting in such situations executives during good times set aside funds or record an accrual for some future liability this results in an expense against the current periods profit and an entry on the companys balance sheet of an accrual or reserve for a liability the idea is that down the road if bad times hit the company can reverse or write down a portion or all of the liability and flow that amount back through the income statement academic research has found that accruals are one of the areas that can be manipulated to smooth a companys numbers that is because such reserves are based on estimates and even though accounting rules give guidance on when accruals can be created and forbid the establishment of rainy day funds it is still more art than science beazer says it doesnt expect the amount of money involved in the accounting issues to be "quantitatively material" and that it wont affect its cash levels which are critical amid the housing downturn the company hasnt given a timetable for when it expects to file its quarterly report to the sec but yesterday it released unaudited financial statements for its fiscal third quarter ended june to provide its investors with "updated financial and other information regarding the company " still bondholders clocks may be ticking according to fitch beazer has a day grace period from last thursday when its quarterly report was due at the end of that period beazers bondholders could send the company a notice of technical default giving it days to file its report if the company still hasnt filed the report by then bondholders could demand their money back it isnt clear whether yesterdays release from beazer will satisfy the bondholderss requirements for timely financial reporting at the very least the accounting issues threaten to delay the outcome of the investigation being conducted by beazers audit committee which analysts had expected to conclude by sept the end of the companys fiscal year
