toy story mattels second major toy recall in as many weeks is giving executives a public relations migraine and investors the jitters the episode is another example of chinas difficulties in meeting western quality standards but in the rush to apportion blame for this latest safety scare china is coming in for more than its fair share senator dick durbin d illinois jumped right in calling for a new requirement that all toys from china be tested for lead paint at the border never mind that of the recalled products had nothing to do with lead paint those looking for excuses to raise the costs of trading with china will hit upon any pretext of the approximately million toys recalled world wide are being pulled off shelves for containing impermissible levels of toxic lead paint according to mattel these toys were manufactured by a contract supplier the supplier in turn outsourced the task of painting the toys and the company doing the painting violated mattels safety rules a similar problem with a different supplier sparked a global recall of million toys earlier this month the paint is banned in the west and with good reason it can lead to developmental disorders in children who ingest it the other million toys in the current recall suffer from an unrelated defect one that has nothing to do with where they were made they feature small magnets that can detach and if swallowed cause serious or even fatal intestinal injuries in children this is not the fault of the chinese manufacturers that made the toys it seems to be the fault of the engineers who designed them and would have been a hazard even if the toys had been manufactured in the u s its not unusual for politicians to reach for the headline grabbing soundbite instead of focusing on where the most good can be done headline writers also focused on the lead paint angle perhaps because its easier to grasp than the danger of intestinal perforation resulting from multiple magnet ingestion three kids did require surgery a while back when magnets they swallowed stuck together in their guts the key point is that companies like mattel and its suppliers have every incentive to do something about faulty products not merely to appear to be doing so mattel has already announced that it will begin testing every batch of toys shipped from overseas at considerable expense rather than risk a replay of the past two weeks mattel knows all too well that the cost of salvaging its brand would far exceed any marginal profit gain from winking at quality in the name of squeezing its suppliers on price mr durbin can grandstand for a while and move on to the next soundbite for toy makers and their suppliers getting a reputation for unsafe toys could be fatal parents will decide in coming months how much they trust products made for mattel in china but mr durbin is not helping nervous financial markets most investors know that consumers will punish companies for safety problems but that politicians pose an even greater threat if they use the product recalls as an excuse for protectionism see related letter "letters to the editor not the whole toy story" wsj august
