fannie freddie and the housing bust fannie mae and freddie mac were founded in and respectively with a specific charter to facilitate homeownership for low and moderate income families providing these entities with federal agency status along with the advantage of being able to borrow at more attractive rates was intended to spur broader homeownership the resulting ripple effect through the economy including the myriad new jobs in homebuilding materials roads and infrastructure and mortgage finance has been pointed to by economists throughout the world as an important element in the foundation of u s economic vitality i have been in the real estate finance business for my entire career beginning in as a lending officer trainee at a small california savings and loan association back then the dollar limit on loans that were eligible for the fannie mae freddie mac subsidy was close to &# the mortgage lending industry dominated by the nations savings and loan institutions that were also chartered to encourage home mortgage finance was in very good shape the s&amp ls were doing just fine using their deposit base to make home mortgage loans available to the u s homebuyer and making steady if unspectacular profits about the same time as my entry into this business a group of revolutionary thinkers led by lewis ranieri and bob dahl at salomon brothers and laurence fink at first boston initiated a broad secondary market for mortgage loans through securities backed by the collateral of these mortgages this "securitization" of the mortgage business whereby the bond buying community replaced the s&amp ls as the ultimate financiers of mortgages changed the business forever and i would argue largely for the better s&amp ls were turned into mortgage originators holding assets for a much shorter time which reduced their balance sheet risk considerably and improved their prospects for delivering to their shareholders a much higher and safer return on equity the mortgage borrowers were now given access to a larger and more consistent source of capital in the bond market dominated by pension funds whose longer duration liabilities were better matched to the year fixed rate mortgage asset than were the s&amp ls with their overnight deposits for their revolutionary contributions messrs ranieri dahl and fink and their wall street associates were richly rewarded and deservedly so these rewards apparently caught the attention of those at the helm of fannie mae and freddie mac who incorrectly viewed themselves as pioneers equally deserving of such rewards rather than as stewards of organizations doling out government subsidies through persistent lobbying these executives continued over time to increase their approved lending limit ultimately crowding out the poor s&amp l industry from their chartered business as human nature would logically dictate the managers of s&amp ls then petitioned congress for expanded investment authority moving into areas where they had little or no experience or expertise such as commercial real estate corporate finance construction lending and land development their demise was inevitable the cost to u s citizens which was quoted at the time between &# billion and &# trillion was greatly understated this estimate only covered the bill to shutter the s&amp ls the s&amp l crisis of the late s caused a nationwide tightening of credit sent asset values plummeting and propelled our economy into a deep three year slump our current subprime lending crisis seems to have initiated the latest credit tightening drive is it a coincidence that both of these tightening periods in the credit cycle were set off by mortgage lending issues i posit no and lay the blame at the feet of fannie mae and freddie mac and their congressional cronies whose unchecked growth into second mortgages subprime loans and many other assets not to mention their continued creep into the upper echelons of the home mortgage industry through their current lending limit of &# has pushed other mortgage market participants further out on the risk spectrum in search of a livelihood to put this lending limit issue into perspective and thus to understand how much of the mortgage market share is now touched by these two out of control entities the average u s home costs in the vicinity of &# and with the exception of the san francisco bay area and manhattan markets most homes fall well within the values to qualify for the fannie mae freddie mac subsidy recent estimates are that of all mortgages originated are now guaranteed or owned by fannie mae or freddie mac it is thus incredible that fannie mae recently petitioned congress to increase its approved lending limit so that it can "better help the market during this period of distress " not only should this offer be summarily rejected these entities also need to be shrunk considerably and through proper regulation be returned to serving their original purpose as long as fannie mae and freddie mac can utilize their government agency status to tap the debt markets they ought to limit their business activities to those that serve a public need if they want to compete with the private sector they should not have this taxpayer subsidized funding advantage until those in congress are willing to serve the best interests of the public that elected them the price that our economy and society will pay will only increase over time the current crisis is the result of the normal ebb and flows of credit cycles and the free market will amply handle the correction that is already happening calls for federal reserve intervention or for other governmental involvement including an increase of the fannie mae freddie mac lending limits must be rejected in the free market those that made bad credit decisions must be allowed to pay the price and only by paying dearly can lessons truly be learned borrowers who were unwitting and took on too much debt must learn that there are consequences for their actions homebuilders that built too many homes or overpaid for land need to face the consequences wall street firms that provided credit to all of these activities with too much laxity must also pay a price this is all part of a healthy correction all of these players reaped benefits during the housing boom that preceded the current crisis certain homeowners were able to temporarily live above their means homebuilder and bank profits have been exorbitant and shareholders and executives of these companies have profited mightily in the boom to not permit losses now would be a direct violation of the free market ideals at the foundation of our economy mr penner is a principal with the firm lubert adler and is
