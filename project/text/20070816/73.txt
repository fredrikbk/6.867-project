on style tracking the trouser cycle first there was slow food a resistance movement begun by a group of italians against the evils of fast food now thanks again to the italians there is slowear a luxury clothing maker based outside of venice that promises to be an antidote to fast fashion keeping the same styles around from season to season it says a lot about fashion today that the promise to produce the same reliable thing is a gimmick worth marketing but thanks to new technologies and the pursuit of new young customers fashion trends are moving at lightning speed these days clothing makers like h&amp m top shop and zara have brought the genius of fast food production to fashion zara owned by the spanish company inditex group employs designers who fill stores with new styles as often as twice a week the company doesnt even bother with warehouses zaras clothes move directly from factory to store among customers this increases impulse purchases "if you enter a zara store and see something you like you know youd better buy it because if you come back it wont be there " says pablo isla inditexs chief executive this business model has revolutionized the fashion industry even at the highest levels from chanel to yves st laurent brands that once created two seasonal collections a year now stream new styles into stores year round women already accustomed to the changing rhythms of fashion tend to be intrigued by the quickened pace men on the other hand are generally more leery of adopting new styles retailers say they more often remain faithful customers of a single company once they find something that fits and looks good tim wentworth the year old chief executive of accredo health group a unit of medco health solutions inc in franklin lakes n j recently replaced his year old zegna suits with new ones in a power shopping spree he says he called ahead to nordstrom and told a salesman that he wanted clothes like zegna or canali that he could replace with virtually the same suits in another years "no prada or gucci for me " he said because "if you buy prada dont expect to replace it" with the same style theres another risk to high fashion menswear he says "i cant buy anything out of the neimans catalog " he says "everybody at work would think i got divorced " it isnt just purveyors of high fashion who have caught the fast fashion bug patagonia the outdoorswear maker says it has doubled the speed with which new styles appear creating roughly four new collections a year up from just two a few years ago the company is trying to turn over its t shirt collections every days "its a fundamental shift in the way we do business " says rob bondurant vice president of marketing the balancing act he says is to remain relevant to existing customers while trying to give new customers more reasons to shop at patagonia but clothing makers who have sped up their fashion cycles admit that they hear howls from men theyve left behind "they were possibly the best shoes ive ever had and i need to replace them " wrote one forlorn merrell footwear fan in a handwritten letter to the company this year on a quest to find a recently discontinued chameleon gtx boot in a size seth cobb merrell usas general manager says that his company tracks global shipments of each shoe style when merrells graphs show that sales of a style are flattening he introduces an update adding a new sole or other style and fit changes he concedes that when it comes to timing the introduction of a new style his fear of missing the sweet spot frequently causes him to pull the trigger too soon as he did when he redesigned the sleek puma like sprint shoe store salesmen he says complained "what were you thinking " yet merrell like many manufacturers doesnt reintroduce those beloved products that would be moving backward it says while the fast fashion push is being embraced by many companies today a backlash is brewing filson a year old clothing maker known for its staple wools and cottons now is backtracking after adding more fashionable clothing in the fall of customers responded so poorly to the changes that the company hired a new president and chief executive bill kulczycki to shift the strategy into reverse by eliminating the new sportswear and leather jackets and restoring the focus on products like the "tin cruiser" jacket which was patented in "it was a major backlash " says mr kulczycki new forward looking fashions are coming at shoppers so fast and furiously that some customers have reached "burn out " says david wolfe a creative director at the doneger group fashion industry consultants in new york he points to slowear slowear was formed by brothers marzio and roberto compagno whose parents founded italian trouser maker incotex in incotexs factory near venice also churns out pants for zegna and other designers a few years ago as fashion cycles were speeding up the compagno brothers decided there was a niche for someone willing to swim against the current attracted to the "slow food" concept they formed an umbrella company and called it slowear buying up several other clothing brands that are known for consistency of style they include zanone knitwear shirt maker glanshirt and montedoro jackets and outerwear the companys pledge is that it will keep its styles around forever somewhat like the philosophy to which filson is returning slowear might introduce a new fabric or color but that style and fit you fell in love with will be there sold at department stores including barneys new york as well as many high end independent stores these clothes arent cheap incotex pants range in price from &# to &# at retail and cotton glanshirt shirts cost around &# slowear which says its model has worked well where it is established in europe is now pushing to expand its presence in the u s emilio paschetto slowears director of north american operations has been training salespeople at barneys new york and other stores in the companys philosophy "this is the opposite of fashion " mr paschetto says "we guarantee year after year after year thats what youre going to get once you marry us its forever " email christina binkley wsj com
