the right to mine in a sacred tribal forest a case that underlines the complexity of undertaking large scale industrial projects here the cases hearing by the court reflects the growing clout of activist groups in india and the bigger role the judiciary is taking in enforcing the countrys environmental rules experts say legal challenges could become a greater hurdle for foreign and local investors as indias environmental lobbyists work together and gather influence vedanta alumina ltd majority owned by london listed metals and mining company vedanta resources plc wants the right to mine bauxite in the niyamgiri hills in the mineral rich eastern indian state of orissa bauxite is refined to produce alumina which is then smelted to produce aluminum vedanta already operates an alumina refinery it built adjacent to the area it wants to mine part of an &# million project that also includes a power plant the company opened the refinery in march using bauxite from elsewhere the environmental and social activists who brought the dispute to the high court allege vedanta didnt disclose that forest land was needed for the project and therefore didnt get prior clearance from the ministry of environment and forests a violation of indian law a spokesman for vedanta resources denies this but declined to comment further on the case because it is before the court the activists also argue the project will do serious harm to the flora and fauna of the area which includes rare orchids elephants barking deer and sloth bears vedanta declined to comment at a hearing in may vedanta argued that bringing mining to the area would create jobs said a person who attended the company also promised to forest other areas in compensation for the trees lost the court is scheduled to hear the vedanta case tomorrow its ruling could stop the mine project require vedanta to find another area to mine or allow the project to proceed legal observers say the legal battle comes against a backdrop of growing social discontent as indias economic growth of more than leaves many behind "indias much feted economic miracle is not only bypassing many of the most vulnerable communities such as dalits low caste hindus urban poor and indigenous groups but is pushing them off their land out of their homes and destroying their livelihoods " says bratindi jena of the international nongovernmental organization actionaid which opposes the mine as a result foreign companies flocking here to tap into the booming economy as well as indias own fast growing corporate giants face increasing grass roots resistance across the country conflicts have erupted over projects ranging from mines to supermarkets in may villagers opposed to south korean company poscos construction of a huge steel complex in orissa seized three employees assaulted two and held them briefly canadas alcan inc said in april it would withdraw from a mining and refinery venture that had faced years of

national supermarket chain has had stores attacked as small traders fear for their livelihoods in the face of major retail competition amid such opposition "investors need to be aware of the potential for litigators to file public interest litigation in the courts " says seema desai a london based india analyst with consultancy eurasia group projects have seen opposition from a range of sources from farmers to social activists to larger nongovernmental organizations ms desai predicts that "over time some of the protesters or litigators will join hands in more organized ways in which case it could become a big hurdle for investors " public interest litigation similar to class action lawsuits in the u s is filed directly to indias supreme court because it is considered to be in the general public interest in court environmentalists are already getting a sympathetic ear says gurdip singh a professor specializing in international and environmental law at the university of delhi judicial activism has led to india adopting stringent environmental regulations he says the judiciary tends to see the environment as the property of future generations to be protected and it treats the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental human right mr singh says the supreme court is "taking a big interest in things like urban planning land issues environmental issues " says ms desai in taking on such cases the supreme court is filling a gap left by the central government which has been reluctant to strictly enforce environmental laws says anand prasad a new delhi based partner with indian law firm trilegal the vedanta case centers on a report produced by an expert panel assembled by the ministry of environment and forests on the direction of the supreme court the report said use of forest land in an ecologically sensitive area like the niyamgiri hills shouldnt be permitted it suggested environmental clearance for the refinery should be revoked until an alternative mine site has been identified and said that if the plans had been properly reviewed at the outset the project would have likely been abandoned the refinery was completed and began operating after the report was issued vedanta resources declined to comment on the report
