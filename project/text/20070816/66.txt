moving sidewalks france decides arent thrill rides mr cotes rolling carpet needed a lot of tweaking to avoid slips and falls paris france created the worlds fastest passenger jet and fastest train now one frenchman is trying to perfect the worlds speediest moving sidewalk it has been slow going for more than a decade anselme cote has been working on a rolling walkway to whisk people through train stations airports and malls faster than a city bus the year old frenchman has spent &# million in state and private funds on three prototypes and studied hundreds of trial users yet when he finally inaugurated his masterpiece five years ago so many people tripped that authorities halted the walkway for three months "its like bicycling " mr cote said recently over a lunch of rabbit and sancerre "you cant avoid falling once " today his "fast rolling carpet " or tapis roulant rapide as its called in french is operating again at the montparnasse metro station in paris though its the fastest moving walkway in the world it runs at well below its potential top speed of miles per hour mr cotes team keeps tweaking the tapis to allow it to go faster without causing accidents the french have a paradoxical fascination with high speed transport by law france caps the workweek at hours and gives employees at least five weeks vacation each year civil service workers regularly go on strike and much of the country shuts down for the whole month of august yet france pioneered some of the fastest machines in the world development of the franco british concorde the worlds fastest commercial jetliner was spearheaded by france in the s new models of the countrys tgv high speed trains first unveiled years ago run ever faster french engineers are trying to develop the worlds fastest sailboat mr cote says his efforts to build a speedy walkway were driven by what he sees as another great contradiction a mile trip from the loire valley in central france to paris on a tgv takes just an hour but then a walk inside the train station to the nearest metro stop can take another minutes "whats the point in making the tgv go faster " asks mr cote "its absurd " tapis roulants have a long history in the french capital one of the worlds first versions of the moving sidewalk ran at the universal exposition in paris in the city council even considered replacing the underground metro system with them when charles de gaulle airport opened outside paris in its walkways inside clear plastic tubes crisscrossing high above the ground became a paragon of futuristic design frances fast walkways have sparked awe and skepticism abroad "its a great idea because so much time is spent on the last leg of a trip " says george haikalis head of the nonprofit institute for rational urban mobility inc in new york "but there are great doubts over whether people can use it safely not to mention risks of litigation " adds mr haikalis who in the late s studied a plan to build speedy sidewalks in new york subway stations today however as shopping malls and theme parks expand fast moving sidewalks are again drawing interest torontos pearson airport is now installing a foot walkway from german heavy industrial group thyssenkrupp ag that rolls at a brisk mph or about three times the speed of ordinary models mr cotes passion for fast moving sidewalks started in when he took a job at pariss state controlled transport company regie autonome des transports parisiens or ratp one of the high school graduates first jobs was to monitor pedestrians on the slow moving walkways that had just been installed in a corridor at the montparnasse metro station although the new walkway rolled at only around mph slower than an average strollers pace commuters who werent accustomed to the machine frequently tripped in mr cote got his chance to help design a walkway when ratp asked him to work on a new generation of fast rolling carpets mr cote teamed up with a french energy and transport engineering company constructions industrielles de la mediterranee sa or cnim that was looking to expand its line of conventional walkways the challenge was to design a walkway that could accelerate to a speed of around mph roll at that constant rate and then slow back to a strolling pace all without making passengers tumble creating one beltway that operates at various speeds simultaneously is a surprisingly difficult task that mr cotes team tackled by dividing their rolling carpet into three segments acceleration high speed transportation and deceleration pedestrians first reach their top speed standing on a foot long stretch of parallel metal rollers each turning incrementally faster then a conveyor belt zips them along finally another progressively slower metal rollers slow them down in mr cotes team built a foot prototype of the walkway inside cnims factory to simulate a subway station for human guinea pigs cnim constructed a mock pedestrian tunnel around the walkway projected images of trains at the two ends and blasted sounds of trains running through a station three years later ratp let mr cote build a real life prototype at the montparnasse station in july amid a flurry of media coverage it was inaugurated by french dignitaries and thousands of spectators with the flick of a switch the sidewalk began rolling at high speed mph and crowds eagerly poured on "we no longer walk at montparnasse we get teleported " paris region governor jean paul huchon boasted at the inauguration according to footage of the ceremony but within minutes people were tripping of the people who trod the walkway in its first hours of operation about ended up sprawled on the ground "no serious injuries but we had a few broken wrists " says ratp spokesman pascal halko immediately video of the hapless pedestrians ran for laughs on nightly news programs ratp pulled the plug and gave mr cote and his team three months to make the machine safer "i didnt sleep from july to september " recalls mr cote sitting back at his desk beneath a framed award for "project of the year " from elevator world magazine the culprit was a thin strip of metal bridging the conveyor belt and the slow down rollers at the end that prevented some people from gliding smoothly mr cotes team redesigned the strip and slowed the belt to mph to alert riders of the walkways approaching exit they added blinking signs recorded warnings and video monitors showing users how to disembark safely but because a few people kept tripping each week ratp in slowed the walkway down to mph or about a third of its initial speed ratp plans to gradually accelerate the walkway over time says mr halko the ratp spokesman mr cote says hes confident the team is near perfecting the technology their next challenge selling one of the machines
