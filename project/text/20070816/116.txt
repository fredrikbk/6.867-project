why siemens bribery probe slogs on decentralization stonewalling make quick resolution unlikely after more than police raided siemens ags offices in november the german conglomerate promised to get to the bottom of damaging corruption allegations as quickly as possible nine months one departed chief executive several arrests and more than &# million in outside expenses later europes largest engineering company by sales is still struggling to get its arms around the scope of potential wrongdoing several forces are preventing a quick resolution a lack of centralized oversight internal resistance to probes and an ever widening circle of suspicious payments tied to alleged bribes for business schemes the scandal poses serious challenges for peter loescher who became chief executive of siemens last month after being hired from new jersey drug giant merck &amp co mr loescher succeeded klaus kleinfeld who boosted profits and was popular with investors but stepped down following criticism that top management didnt do enough to crack down on corruption mr kleinfeld who has denied any wrongdoing was named president and chief operating officer of u s based alcoa inc yesterday people familiar with the investigations say one issue is the decentralized nature of much of the companys business managers at siemenss dozen business units as well as regional managers in the countries in which siemens operates exercised great autonomy in recent years that included the power to craft vaguely defined consulting contracts with third parties that criminal investigators suspect were used to funnel bribes to potential customers retracing what happened is requiring extensive digging not just at the munich headquarters but at offices in other countries in december siemens hired the u s law firm debevoise &amp plimpton llp to delve into the allegations of wrongdoing but the law firm recently informed the nonexecutive supervisory board of siemens that managers in some country units havent been cooperating board members have told the wall street journal such stonewalling has slowed debevoises work and sparked increased scrutiny from the u s department of justice which has been conducting a criminal probe of siemenss business dealings after sticking to the sidelines for months while debevoise and german criminal prosecutors did much of the spadework the justice department investigation has become "far more active" of late and is conducting its own interviews in the u s according to people familiar with the matter a siemens spokesman declined to comment siemens has confirmed that prosecutors in germany the u s switzerland italy greece and "other countries" are conducting criminal probes that already have led to several arrests in addition to its internal auditing efforts siemens has paid million euros &# million from late last year to june on outside advisers including debevoise to probe questionable transactions the german company says it remains committed to clearing up the bribery allegations it adds that it is beefing up internal controls by centralizing bank accounts and cash payment systems business consulting agreements require the approval of senior managers and the chief compliance officer the company has declined to discuss details of many of the aspects of the probe but in its latest regulatory filing to the u s securities and exchange commission friday siemens acknowledged that "substantial uncertainties remain" and that it "does not yet have enough information" to estimate the potential financial fallout from alleged wrongdoing it also warned that the problem could be much bigger than it indicated last december when it flagged &lt euro&gt million in suspicious transactions at its telecommunications equipment unit stretching back seven years siemens said that it is reviewing a "significantly" higher number of suspicious transactions and that it is probing payments in five other business units people familiar with the matter say that siemens is confident it has identified most of the suspicious transactions at the telecom equipment unit and that the current estimate of the value of those transactions is about billion euros more than double what it uncovered in december but the company is still far from nailing down details of the funds final destinations they add that siemens has only begun to scratch the surface at other units in part because of the scale of the companys sprawling operations which range from high speed trains and water filtration systems to medical scanners and light bulbs recent scrutiny has centered on the power generation unit alongside the transportation systems and medical equipment units siemens disclosed friday that a german public prosecutor searched the power generation units premises in three cities last week as part of an investigation into alleged bribes to secure a power contract in serbia siemens also is reviewing its accounts before when german tax law was changed to prohibit bribes paid abroad from being deducted as a business expense initially the company focused on suspicious payments made from onward debevoise hasnt given siemenss supervisory board the german equivalent of a u s companys board of directors an estimate in dollars of potential bribes across the company the people familiar with the matter said but board members who vet major management board decisions under germanys dual board structure are bracing for a big number one supervisory board member said he has been "shocked" by the picture being painted by the law firm siemens may disclose revised estimates on the size of suspicious transactions after closing the books on its fiscal year which ends sept people familiar with the investigations predict it will take much longer until siemens arrives at a final reckoning lack of a swift resolution could tarnish the image of mr loescher who was hired to give siemens a fresh start "peter loescher has an interest that the past is relegated to the books as quickly as possible if stuff is still coming up two years from now it wont look very good " said one supervisory board member this person added that board members have confidence in mr loeschers abilities mr loescher has promised to quickly review siemenss organizational structure and find ways to heighten transparency he plans to deliver his recommendations to the supervisory board this autumn he faces a difficult balancing act centralizing authority could boost compliance oversight but also make siemens less nimble when it comes to finding customers and making sales around the globe that could crimp the companys bottom line and make it less attractive to investors who have been snapping up siemens shares in recent months despite the corruption allegations glenn simpson contributed to this article
