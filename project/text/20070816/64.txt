mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q can you recommend a device that would allow me to surf the web on a bedroom television connected via ethernet and to control the device via a wireless keyboard or remote control a perhaps the most direct approach would be to buy the msn tv device from microsoft that is specifically meant for browsing the web on a tv from a distance and can be used with ethernet it costs &# plus a monthly fee comes with a wireless keyboard and remote and can be ordered at msntv com a second option would be to buy a small computer with a wireless keyboard and hook it up to the bedroom tv instead of to a computer monitor for instance i have surfed the web this way using a tiny &# mac mini computer from apple which comes with a wireless remote and accepts almost any wireless keyboard though it doesnt come with one there are numerous windows computers that could do the same and many cost less though most are larger another method would be to use a game console capable of surfing the web even if you have no intention of playing games these are made to work with tv sets and some can use a wireless keyboard and or wireless controller to do the job for instance the &# nintendo wii game machine has an optional web browsing function q apple has released a windows beta version of safari is it any safer to use than microsofts internet explorer a its too early to tell as the windows version of safari is still in beta and is very new to users and hackers alike certainly operating in windows will make safari much more vulnerable to attack than it is on the macintosh operating system if only because the writers of malicious software aim their firepower overwhelmingly at windows while internet explorer is hardly impregnable it has become safer over the years and microsoft certainly has much more experience battling windows security issues than apple does apple has already issued some security updates for this new version of safari and will undoubtedly have to keep issuing more to keep ahead of the bad guys q i am thinking of buying a thinkpad laptop from lenovo with at&amp t broadbandconnect do i still need to buy some sort of card from at&amp t and insert it into the laptop and must i pay a subscription fee to them a no and yes the laptop likely has the modem for at&amp t built in so you can connect to the internet via at&amp ts cellular network without buying an external card however the service isnt free you cant use it without a subscription which typically runs &# a month you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
