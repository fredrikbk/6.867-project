schumers tax gambit in the battle over raising taxes on private equity new yorks chuck schumer has now thrown down the gauntlet to fellow senators chuck grassley and max baucus hell only support such a tax hike if taxes also go up on all such private partnerships thats what they call in the beltway a "poison pill " because the more people the senate tries to whack with higher taxes the more opposition it draws but however brilliantly devious mr schumers gambit also has the virtue of exposing the lack of principle behind the effort to close the so called private equity "loophole " one senators loophole is anothers "incentive " as messrs grassley and baucus understand all too well the tax "loophole" they want to close is a law that allows certain publicly traded partnerships to pay a capital gains tax rate now on investment earnings rather than the corporate income tax rate now that law lets corporations that earn at least of their income from investments "passive income" pay the lower tax rate mr grassley the iowa republican now calls that "unfair " but wait it turns out hes a cheerleader for this same loophole as long as it applies to his favorite industry corn based ethanol on june the iowan successfully sponsored a tax provision that allows "certain income and gains" related to alternative fuels to be "treated as qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships " his co sponsor was none other than mr baucus the finance committee chairman who is mr grassleys running mate in closing the private equity "loophole " apparently some partnerships are more equal than others and to be sure mr grassley has an explanation for this new &# million ethanol tax exception "current publicly traded partnership law allows for the production processing refining and transportation of fossil fuels were not expanding that to include ethanol were saying that if a publicly traded partnership owns a pipeline to transport gasoline it should be allowed to transport that gasoline blended with ethanol " any way you look at it though mr grassley is still saying that a partnership involved in transporting ethanol deserves the tax rate while a private equity partnership does not why well he goes on to say because ethanol partnerships rely on "passive income" while "the investment management business is really the only active business that has tried to rely on the passive income exception " this sure sounds as if the difference between "passive" and "active" income is in the eye of the senate beholder or to put it another way if you transport ethanol from iowa a senator from iowa thinks your partnership should pay a lower tax rate than if you invest money out of senator schumers new york so its all right to "erode the corporate tax base " as senators like to say as long as you live in the right state or operate in a business favored by key senators on the finance committee there is in fact a good case for treating hedge funds and private equity as publicly traded partnerships on most of their income thats because the corporations owned by these partnerships already pay the corporate income tax when the profits are earned and before the dollars are passed on as dividends to the private equity owners to tax this income again as corporate income by the partnerships and then a third time as a capital gain to investors in the equity fund constitutes multiple taxation of the same income how this helps u s financial competitiveness is a mystery meanwhile corn ethanol is already among the most heavily subsidized industries in america the industry might not even exist today if not for senator grassleys tax ministrations and mandates including a cent tax credit for refiners for every gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline plus the cent a gallon tariff on the import of sugar based ethanol that mr grassley recently lobbied successfully to extend to our point here isnt to pick on one or two senators who are doing what comes naturally in promoting constituent interests the real issue is the arbitrary nature of this assault on private equity it is precisely because the u s federal corporate tax rate is one of the highest in the world at that companies and sometimes entire industries are always looking to win "loopholes" from senators who are only too happy to help them but this also erodes corporate tax revenue if he really cares about the corporate tax base mr grassley would fight to replace all corporate loopholes with a single low tax rate come to think of it mr schumer could do the same rather than trying to raise taxes on all partnerships to the corporate rate why not lower them on all corporations to the partnership rate our guess is the treasury would get more revenue over time as fewer businesses shielded income abroad in the meantime if private equity partnerships should pay higher taxes then so should ethanol see related letter "letters to the editor no more exceptions to corporate taxes" wsj aug
