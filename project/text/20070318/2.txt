getting going principles remain methods must change the rules are the same but the game has totally changed we all know what it takes to manage money sensibly keep investment costs low save regularly hold down taxes diversify broadly use debt wisely and those rules havent changed but putting them into practice sure has want to keep your finances on track dont overlook these six key trends shouldering the load it has always been critical to save but now it is more critical than ever among workers with retirement benefits had traditional company pensions in according to boston colleges center for retirement research by that figure had shrunk to as companies shifted to k plans instead but at least these employees have a retirement plan many arent so lucky among nongovernment workers less than half participate in an employer sponsored plan either because they arent covered or because they choose not to contribute this wouldnt be so alarming if it wasnt accompanied by another worrisome trend even as workers are asked to shoulder more of the burden of saving for retirement the savings rate has plummeted and today americans spend more than their after tax income living longer the need to save isnt driven just by disappearing pensions we are also living longer and that means we need to finance longer retirements men turning age in can expect to live another years on average up from years for those who turned in meanwhile by women age will be looking at another years up from years in these might seem like modest increases but were talking about a longer retirement for men who quit the work force at and longer for women and this isnt our only financial challenge what if social security retirement benefits get cut back what if stock and bond returns fall short of their historical averages the bottom line our best defense is a prodigious savings habit drowning in debt unfortunately instead of socking away money for ourselves were busy borrowing from others according to the federal reserve the value of household assets has grown a year over the past two decades but our debt has ballooned even faster up a year arguably this makes financial sense interest rates are lower today so there is a greater incentive to borrow but make no mistake this ballooning debt has also been driven by looser lending standards and changing attitudes toward debt borrowing hefty sums is no longer considered financially imprudent but its still mighty dangerous until recently many mortgage companies were happy to lend of a homes purchase price but borrowers have to repay that money plus interest and the monthly payments could quickly wipe out their finances if they lose their job or get hit with a financial emergency little wonder theres been an increase in delinquencies among overextended home buyers baffling choices two decades ago a portfolio was considered well diversified if it included u s stocks foreign shares and high quality bonds and those three sectors remain the cornerstones of any decent investment mix but ordinary investors can now buy a slew of other asset classes some of todays mutual funds zero in on exotic corners of the global stock and bond markets such as emerging market debt emerging market stocks and international small company shares other mutual funds pursue novel strategies including tracking commodities and mimicking hedge funds indeed today ordinary investors can diversify in ways that were once the sole preserve of wealthy individuals and institutional investors that doesnt mean you ought to rush to buy these new funds first ensure the costs involved are reasonable and make sure you have the stomach for what could be a rough ride "you can clearly diversify a portfolio much better than you used to " says scott greenbaum a financial planner with life goals asset management in harrison n y "but it has a good side and a bad side having so much choice can be paralyzing people also tend to pile into the wrong sectors at the wrong time its become much easier to chase performance " picking indexes for years wall street experts argued over which was the better strategy actively hunting for winning stocks or simply replicating the market averages that argument is over and market tracking index funds have won instead todays big debate is over how to index index funds now account for of stock fund assets up from in but almost all that growth has come from exchange traded index funds rather than conventional index mutual funds according to vanguard groups bogle financial markets research center and etfs which trade on the stock market just like a regular stock are really a different breed index mutual funds typically offer exposure to large swaths of the market and weight the companies they own by their stock market value etfs by contrast frequently focus on narrow market segments and some weight their companies by untraditional measures such as dividends and sales once again this means more choice for investors but it also means we have more ways to shoot ourselves in the foot lumping together heres where things get a little puzzling even as wall street presents us with a bewildering array of investment choices the advice for ordinary investors has changed forget building a portfolio out of these specialized funds amateur investors are now encouraged to purchase all the major market sectors in a single mutual fund by buying a lifecycle fund in fact many k plans are adopting these one stop shopping funds as their default investment option if employees dont make an investment choice their k contributions get funneled into a lifecycle fund "people dont want to be bothered with all this stuff " mr greenbaum says "if people are likely to hurt themselves a lifecycle fund is a good thing but given time energy and expertise i think people can greatly improve on it " jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
