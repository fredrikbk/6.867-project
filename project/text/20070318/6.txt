love &amp money readers no more fund raising want to get a parent angry apparently all you have to do is say the word fund raiser i learned that after my recent column in which i complained that my son gets nothing out of assignments to raise money for a cause he and his friends care only about winning some prize for sellng the most worthless items and its usually the parents who end up doing most of the selling anyway i noted in my column that i would much prefer schools and organizations to just hit me up for an unvarnished donation that to me is more palatable some readers agreed others didnt "i wish it would be so easy " says alicia escobar a school principal in santa cruz calif ms escobar agrees fund raisers are "a pain however its the only way we can fund art and music at our school " straight donations she says "will work with affluent and middle class parents but it wont work for working class parents " ms escobar says many parents at her school like the fund raisers "because they have extended families they can tap into this is a way they can contribute as they cannot afford to pay the high prices that our middle class parents pony up" at an annual student art show auction steve morse in mt pleasant s c also says i was "off the mark " he has two sons ages and in cub scouts who "spent countless hours with dad for most weekends from late august until late october taking orders from door to door and delivering the product " both wanted mountain bikes that required &# in sales each both reached their goal mr morse says "without a single dime from mom and dad and no one from work " in all mr morse says "this gave my boys a valuable lesson in goal setting and hard work they also know they helped support the troop " still the majority of parents i heard from like beth eagleson in san clemente calif came down opposed to fund raisers she says she told her sons school that her year old third grader "will not participate in fund raisers " "telling an elementary school child they can win a great prize is unkind and encourages them to cheat " ms eagleson says when her sons first fund raiser arrived he "wrote down the names of all his friends so he would have a full sheet not realizing that they would not be buying anything " when ms eagleson told her son she wouldnt buy either it led to tears ms eagleson has become what she calls "the school jerk " the parent teacher association serves as fund raiser for her sons school and the pta recently promised to give &# to each teacher for classroom books as long as every family in the class paid to join the pta at her sons school she says " of the population qualifies for free lunch where that pta payment may make the difference in feeding the family that week " "i gave the teacher &# to buy books for her classroom and explained to my son why sometimes it is necessary to go against the grain " ms eagleson says "sometimes the indoctrination our kids receive from school is not the kind we want them to have and teaching them to be principled jerks is the best thing we can do for them " eva lang in memphis tenn who likens the fund raising for prizes concept to "extortion " says she visited the web site for a popular fund raising program to find that schools get as little as cents on every dollar raised "i am often approached by a child or a parent stuck in fund raising purgatory " ms lang says "and i always buy one of the items because i feel so sorry for them but it is the case that if they just asked for a donation i would have been glad to give a larger amount " like many parents ruth lopez a pleasanton calif mom of a year old doesnt allow her son to go door to door so she says "i ended up placing orders for grandma and aunts and family friends that i pay for " a co worker persuaded her to bring the sign up sheet into the office since thats what all parents there did that fund raising vehicle was cookie dough and when ms lopez picked up the order "i had to find some place to refrigerate the dough five pound tubs which i left overnight in the day care centers refrigerator after a long battle with them i had to go into work late the next morning in order to pick up the dough then rearrange the refrigerator at work to be able to put the dough in there the orders were all mixed up as no one remembered what they ordered and the copies of the order forms were illegible all in all a horrible experience and i will not repeat it " but is there a better way shelly runyan in austin texas says that when parents begin discussing annual fund raising plans she always asks the same question "what is the average profit for the group per family and who is willing to pony up that much not to have to go through the hassles " the response she says "has been writing a check this has made life much easier i do not believe this sends the wrong message to children it teaches them to look at time versus income " holly frachetti in denver participated this year in her first fund raiser for her year old sons school but instead of selling junk the fund raiser was an all school spelling challenge in which kids hit up sponsors to pay for correctly spelled words on a challenge day test graded by teachers the kids won "prizes" such as an extra recess and the school kept of the donations "as a parent " ms frachetti says "id much rather spend my time helping my child learn something than to have to sell something which is not a good value to anyone this type of fund raiser gives kids a specific positive goal which is complementary to their education personally having participated as a sponsor for the kids in our neighborhood throughout the years i would be so much happier to contribute to this type of fund raiser than the other ones with products or food that we dont eat or use anyway " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write to him at lovemoney wsj com
