real time readers discuss net radios future webcasters decry proposed royalty rates listeners share their net radio experiences online edition last weeks column on the potential perils facing internet radio brought a huge outpouring of mail webcasters wrote in to warn that the copyright royalty boards proposed performance royalty rates would put them out of business while users said they heard a lot of new music via net radio which they then went out and bought cnn money has a good overview of the issue including some new developments since my column my argument radio should be radio regardless of how its delivered the issue shouldnt be what performance royalty rate webcasters pay but why they pay one at all "terrestrial" radio stations dont pay such royalties reflecting a long established understanding that artists and record labels gain in exposure what they lose in royalties they do pay composer royalties to songwriters and music publishers internet radio offers the same bargain except its better for artists and labels net radio makes it easy to know who sings that new song you love and to buy it keep reading for the counterargument on to the letters which as always have been edited thanks to everybody who wrote in first up the webcasters jonathan tesser writes ive been operating a free form radio station www luckydogradio com with live for more than six years and its clear that the future of internet radio is in grave danger if this decision by the crb is not modified in some way the best solution would be to treat all forms of radio the same and let them all pay the same royalty rate or if it is a valid idea that airplay on terrestrial radio generates a promotional value for record companies and im sure that clear channel infinity etc will swear it is then allow the other radio platforms to operate in the same manner of the two the first scenario has a better chance although its slim at best of actually coming to pass and thats ok with me all im advocating is that there be a level playing field this will result in rates that are affordable for everyone and allow stations to compete across all platforms on the quality of their programming which is the way it should be if this decision isnt amended and the overall premise that led to it overhauled both musicians and their fans will be the big losers in the end it will become infinitely more difficult to hear so much of the wonderful music that finds the vast majority of its audience on internet radio and thats the shame of it all mike v writes because of net radio my personally purchased music collection has exceeded cds i am against any pirated audio and frown upon illegal downloading many bands have become friends of mine over the years and i know firsthand how much it costs them to create produce and record their work they make a lot of sacrifices to get their art out to the world and stealing from them is deplorable some years back i had a station on mp com recently i tossed my hat into the ring once again and have found a home on live none of us makes any money from these stations the majority of us enjoy exposing new artists from around the globe to our listeners in the hope that someone out there in the listening audience finds the music appealing enough to purchase it as well essentially we work for free in order to help someone else earn money punishing the broadcasters who are trying to help artists sell more cds by charging these proposed new royalty rates is simply ludicrous steve atkinson writes i am a small webcaster at live com i average around listening hours each month and specialize in oldies of the s and s most live webcasters myself included make no money doing this its strictly a labor of love many ambitious broadcasters last year decided to become x broadcasters they received guaranteed placement on itunes and therefore a huge boost in listening hours and ego part of this deal was they assumed the burden of paying royalties to the various agencies involved very few realized that retroactive fees could be thousands of dollars one broadcaster calculated his bill as around &# and rising all for a hobby this week most of these broadcasters have reduced their free listener slots which are assessed the new onerous fees to near zero if these new rates arent lowered very few radio streams will be able to continue online streaming satellite terrestrial stations and the amateurs like us will disappear i dont think the riaa realizes how many listeners we turn on to music i get emails from listeners all over the world including a surprising number from high school and college age kids who love what i play and go to itunes or elsewhere and legally download the tracks they like rob seaman writes i am part owner operator of an online radio station my partner in this station and i started this for the plain love of the music the genre we play and listen to is one that mainstream media have long forgot classic hard rock and heavy metal bands that used to be on major labels but now usually appear on smaller independent record labels we pay our monthly fees out of pocket and have never asked anyone to pay to listen in a good month we might get &# in donations which helps but is less then of our monthly fees with this proposed increase on the table we are looking at an increase to thousands per month and the new rates are retroactive to in our case we are talking nearly &# &# from two guys playing music for the love of it one who is currently unemployed and one with a wife and four kids to support it is stations like ours that will suffer the most many of us would have to close down and independent and up and coming artists would lose the exposure they have been gaining world wide mainstream radio isnt going to pick them up and now the listeners jonathan rogers writes every album i have purchased over the last five years was a direct result of having first heard some songs over internet radio i hadnt purchased a whole lot in the preceding years after leaving the san francisco bay area because i never heard anything new i liked thanks to somafm the recording industry gets &# of my money every year by putting somafm out of business my music spending would once again be restricted to new releases by bands with a proven track record with me and based on previous experience that doesnt add up to a whole lot craig shields writes like you ive become addicted to pandora i bought the subscription and the squeezebox to go with it over the past year i bought probably cds and numerous singles id guess eight of the cds and most of the singles were bands i found on pandora like you i go back to my thumb up picks every so often the rest of the cds were from bands i already know while the remaining singles were for my guitar class number of songs bought after i heard them on traditional radio nil nada zilch to cut off this new avenue for music discovery in the name of a few extra bucks today is about as short sighted as it gets i agree that all parties need to be compensated and dont advocate piracy but treating the flow of music differently based on whether the signal goes over the air or through a wire is bizarre i was listening to pandora while putting this column together and bookmarked a new song to download later i doubt my wife will like viking skull but what the heck theres some more money for the artist and the record label at least for now donald bruce wright writes i listen to net radio in my studio all day with itunes when i hear something i really like i frequently stop what im doing and research the band this leads to purchases more often than maybe it should broadcast radio seldom leads to the same result for me stations often dont announce music for long stretches of airplay and by the time they do i may not be paying close attention or remember which song was which a few readers took on the larger issues of the music industry and the challenges it faces jud fink writes its amazing and at the same time entirely unsurprising to see how the music industry continually recapitulates the process of trying to protect the unprotectable and thus creating what they fear the "unprotectable" in this case are the entrenched assets of the music companies cd pressing plants marketing built around cd release schedules the album rather than the song as the product etc what the music industry fears of course is a music delivery system it doesnt control and cant profit from rather than trying to save the current industry model from the new one that does a better job of giving consumers what they want the industry should be in the process of junking the current model and jumping all over the new one music industry execs should be deeply embarrassed that steve jobs rather than a "music company " came up with the itunes ipod model and that other non music company enterprises are the source of continuing new developments such as pandora long after movie companies having been dragged into the rental age kicking and screaming discovered that rental could become their primary source of revenue the music industry continues to fight the current equivalent of the battle against the vcr and yes the music industry does have defenders who contend i have it backwards alex merck writes the copyright royalty board can only be congratulated on their decision even if it hurts online radio at this time while radio was a promotional tool as well as a means of consumption of music about years ago its mainly a consumption tool now and terrestrial stations are the main music consumption media for the majority of the population world wide actually the analog radio stations should also be obliged to pay royalties to musicians and the record companies but it was decided not to change this since they are being phased out within the next few years anyhow yes there is a marketing aspect to some net radio stations but this is just one aspect there are countless studies showing that more than of the music audience in most industrial countries wont buy a cd or a download since radio is supplying all they need thinking of economic justice or a level playing field can only lead us to accept that music makers get a chance for survival with clear minimum rates for their product that they can determine it cant be accepted that they have to be responsible for the survival of every mini station that someone might want to start actually the music business is still nowhere near the rights situation of film makers completely comparable in that they make an entertainment product against tv stations most studios would stop making movies if they had to deal with the "statutory" royalty situation the music industry faces the music industry should have the right to determine an individual price for each track for airplay as is the case with films a popular track should be more expensive otherwise a radio station will over time only play popular tracks something we have seen with many broadcasters another topic that brought in the mail was my column about handwriting in the digital age and my wondering if my four year old son will ever hand write anything longer than a post it note because theres so little room left im going to spotlight one extraordinary letter jennifer odriscoll writes my husband and best friend of nearly years forwarded your article from kabul hes been overseas since may and i have been amazed at the wonderful communication we have shared during this lengthy separation our first since college days we have primarily emailed nearly daily and he has webcammed with me and all seven of our children nearly every thursday evening i send packages to him every month or so and letters from the children nearly every week all this has been very good for the children and my husband has felt very connected by being able to see them as they have grown and changed he could see the first lost tooth everyones halloween costumes that very night and so on when he returned for his leave at christmas they all reconnected in literally seconds with the baby being the only exception and she only took minutes i really credit the great technology we were blessed to enjoy for a good part of this that said when he gets my handwritten letters sprayed liberally with my perfume and kissed by my own lips somehow i always get a phone call or an email saying "you really made my day " and i still have the one letter he wrote typed but signed with his own hand and ink taped to the wall of our bedroom does this tell you anything its a special kind of touch that takes time to do and to get there and cant be deleted but must be physically saved or disposed of i appreciate knowing hes alive every day when i get online and see i have an email from my dearest love in all the world and i am grateful beyond what i can express for the tremendous amount of time and effort that has been put into making deployments easier for those serving our country and their families eagerly awaiting their safe return but when joel first deployed i stayed up late reading and re reading our mostly handwritten sometimes faxed communication from our dating years when we were separated by a long road trip and not an ocean and a continent and a war i was eager to touch those old letters he had written while sitting in his dorm or in class to see his unique handwriting on all those letters that were for my eyes only and couldnt be blind copied to anyone else archived or spell checked for accuracy you can always write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
