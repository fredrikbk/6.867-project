baghdad life time was palestinian israeli conflict made me a soldier in saddams army online edition the news about peace efforts between palestinians and israelis lately has prompted me to think of how iraqis at home might have felt when they saw the news on their satellite tvs time was iraqis were bombarded with news about the palestinians saddam hussein saw himself as a champion of their cause and to him it was the patriotic duty of iraqis to join in as it turns out very few people i know back home have been following the news and the ones who have been largely said they felt the peace talks held late november in annapolis were irrelevant after all one friend said the palestinians dont seem to care about difficult conditions in iraq "its time for us to pay attention to our lives " he said times were much different in saddams iraq when the palestinian israeli conflict was a critical issue to iraqis after the outbreak of the al aqsa intifada in the palestinian territories in saddam indignant and resentful of israeli actions immediately called for iraqi mobilization and in a matter of days formed al quds army or jerusalem army baghdad officials claimed it consisted of seven million iraqi men and women ready to sacrifice their lives to help their palestinian brothers i remember from propaganda at the time that the goal of these volunteers was to "liberate palestine from the mediterranean sea to the jordan river " in solidarity with the palestinians saddam changed the names of two streets in baghdad one famous shopping street in baghdads karrada district was named after yasser arafat but the name didnt stick among iraqis another street was named after mohammed al durrah a year old palestinian boy who became an icon of the palestinian uprising when he was filmed crouched behind his father during a gunfight in the gaza strip at the beginning of the intifada this name made more of an impact state run iraqi television kept showing pictures and video of the boy along with patriotic songs urging arabs to rise up and fight the israelis many iraqis believed saddam was mobilizing the nation for another purpose though people thought he was preparing people to carry guns and defend iraq in case of a u s attack but iraqis fearful of government reprisals and punishments kept those beliefs quiet and although it was said that al quds army was for volunteers every iraqi capable of carrying a gun was required to join many were college age but its ranks also included people in their s and occasionally older soon training camps mushroomed everywhere in neighborhoods schools government institutions and mosques the intensive military training lasted for more than a month some of the trainers told us they were retired army generals i started my training at the end of the spring of i was a year old college freshman studying english and had to along with other college mates wear a military uniform and carry a rifle while attending classes we attended training sessions after school to make sure no student skipped the military training the schools main doors were locked after classes and anyone entering or leaving had to show a student identification card and explain why he or she wanted to get in or leave i found an old dark green military uniform that one of my dads friends gave him and borrowed it for training although we were given rifles by my schools baath party officials most students had to find uniforms for themselves some students boasted about having more prestigious uniforms than others some wore special forces uniforms and other had republican guards uniforms when my mother first saw me wearing my uniform she laughed and said i didnt even know how to free a chicken from a trap so how would i be able to use a gun and liberate a country as volunteers we marched in the hallways and courtyards shouting "long live saddam iraq and palestine " we learned how to dissemble rifles and pistols clean them and assemble them again just like any conventional army we were divided into brigades and units with our own leaders or trainers one day while we were marching a baath party official and trainer noticed a student who wasnt dressed as a soldier flirting with a girl the official sent for him and asked him in front of all trainees why he was not in a military uniform and partaking in the training "im not iraqi im palestinian " the student said sardonically the official asked the student who did he think we were being trained for he blushed we laughed wholeheartedly on one foggy morning when we were done with training we were herded into big buses and taken to a military school on the outskirts of baghdad to practice shooting at targets for the first time i shot a gun i later learned that my older sister at that time cried and fainted when she was asked to shoot so a general took mercy on her and she was exempted a few days later we were told that we would be participating in a military parade the location and other details werent disclosed for security reasons we marched in celebrations square in baghdad and under the swords of qadisiyah also knows as the hands of victory monument which was destroyed by the iraqi government earlier this year up in the pavilion a military official was reviewing the parade and waving to the volunteers but it wasnt saddam so we concluded that this was just practice on another day we were told to clean and iron our military uniforms as we were to march again once more no details were given we were ordered to carry nothing except our unloaded guns no food or water was allowed most major roads and highways that day were closed and were only open to the buses and trucks that transported the volunteers long lines of buses and trucks bringing volunteers from every corner in baghdad inched toward the monument everyone thought it was just another mock parade the volunteers began to assemble early in the morning but by the time my group approached the monument it was already dark as we disembarked security service officers in dark green military uniforms checked our guns to make sure they were unloaded military music was roaring and a famous television news anchor was on a loudspeaker repeatedly he called the volunteers the "sons" of saddam he called saddam a "lion" and our beloved leader who would take us to victory and glory marching in cadence with the military music we stepped with our boots on thousands of u s dollars that had been placed on the road and covered with a transparent plastic we heard a command to turn right saddam hussein in blood and flesh was standing there wearing a cap and shooting bullets into the sky above our heads i couldnt stop looking i grew up seeing him every day and everywhere in statues in books on television and in photos and posters that were in the streets markets schools and even in homes as we marched on and then began to disperse almost everyone looked back to catch another glimpse after marching in front of saddam i was granted a certificate that shows i had participated in al quds army at the time i was proud like many iraqis i wouldnt learn until later about saddams atrocities i still have the certificate i left it behind at home in baghdad coming next more about relationships between iraqis and palestinians write to sarmad ali at sarmad ali
