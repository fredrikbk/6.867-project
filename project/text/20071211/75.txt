home entertainment the internet the tv heres how to finally bring them together multipurpose devices that let you watch internet video such as tivo inc s digital video recorders havent found a mass market either analysts say in august internet users in the u s viewed billion online videos up from billion in january estimates research firm comscore inc users watched more than a quarter of those videos on google inc s youtube but online video from traditional entertainment companies is exploding too millions of people love watching internet video on their pcs so why cant the technology industry figure out how to get them to watch internet video on their television sets it isnt for lack of trying for several years silicon valley has bombarded the market with gadgets that let you tune into online video in your living room plug one of these set top boxes into your tv and you can download a selection of movies and tv shows or perhaps browse video sites like youtube it seems like a no brainer consumers get a greater breadth of on demand content than cable offers and in the comfort of their living room or bedroom the industry argues yet consumers arent buying internet video players like apple inc s apple tv and akimbo systems inc s akimbo player havent managed to reach an audience beyond the early adopter crowd and multipurpose devices that let you watch internet video such as tivo inc s digital video recorders havent found a mass market either analysts say whats the holdup generally speaking the video players are just too complicated to hook up too expensive and too limited in what they can do there are skeptics too who think internet video players are trying to solve a problem that simply doesnt exist especially as cable companies enhance on demand video services "the issue with these next generation set top boxes is theyre hard to use hard to install and the return on investment isnt particularly large because the content is available elsewhere " says mike volpi ceo of joost nv a london based internet television service available through pcs still tech companies cant stay away from the idea because of the booming popularity of internet video in august internet users in the u s viewed billion online videos up from billion in january estimates research firm comscore inc users watched more than a quarter of those videos on google inc s youtube but online video from traditional entertainment companies is exploding too over the past two years broadcasters have begun streaming nearly all of their most popular shows free with advertisements on their web sites a stream doesnt allow users to keep a permanent copy of the show nbc alone says it streamed million shows from its site during october how can tech companies get consumers to take the next step and start watching internet video on their tvs we interviewed more than a dozen executives in the technology and entertainment industries analysts and others what follows are five reasons internet video players havent taken off and five broad changes that could help their chances of reshaping the television landscape the problem too many boxes lets start with one of the most basic problems clutter consumers simply dont want to add a new box to their home entertainment centers consumers made exceptions of course for dvd players and vcrs but the benefits of stand alone internet video players have been too weak to make people clear space in their homes akimbo of san mateo calif earlier this year gave up selling its &# internet video player which let users download cooking shows anime and other niche programming from the internet the company is now focusing on offering its video on demand service through pcs and multipurpose set top boxes like at&amp t inc s homezone which contain a satellite television tuner and digital video recorder "i love toys but a stand alone box needs to give me something i cant get anywhere else " says thomas frank ceo of akimbo even apple despite its smashing success in digital entertainment with the ipod hasnt seen a big success with apple tv which went on sale early this year forrester research inc of cambridge mass estimates apple has sold fewer than apple tvs an apple spokeswoman declined to comment apple ceo steve jobs has tried to downplay expectations for the product by calling apple tv a "hobby" for the company the solution blend boxes many technology and entertainment executives now believe the surest path for internet video is through an existing device in the living room though there are lots of guesses about what that device is jason kilar ceo of hulu an online video site thats a joint venture of news corp s fox and general electric co s nbc universal believes the device will be a specially equipped television set because while people may not buy any more boxes they might be willing to upgrade to a new tv jeremy allaire chairman and ceo of video delivery service brightcove inc of cambridge mass thinks high definition dvd players are likely candidates he believes lots of consumers already plan to replace existing players with ones capable of playing high definition movies some companies like akimbo are already taking steps in this direction sony corp this year began selling a &# adapter for its bravia high definition television sets that tunes into internet video the company eventually plans to let users download television shows and movies to its playstation game console as microsoft corp already does with its xbox game console microsoft says about a third of its more than seven million xbox users in the u s have downloaded television shows and movies through the companys xbox live online service meanwhile tom rogers ceo of tivo is betting his companys dvrs are the best system for downloading internet video tivo of alviso calif already lets its users download television shows and movies through a partnership with amazon com inc cable and satellite set top boxes might be in a strong position to become internet video players in part because of their history of copying innovations and bringing them to a mass market for example the vast majority of the roughly million dvrs in u s households are part of tv tuners from cable and satellite companies fewer than two million are stand alone tivo models kip compton general manager of the video and content networking unit at cisco systems inc which owns cable set top box maker scientific atlanta predicts cable companies will begin rolling out the first cable boxes that can access internet video next year "people are buying testing and getting ready to deploy them " mr compton says some tech executives believe the cable industry will drag its feet rolling out internet based video because it could represent a long term threat to its traditional subscription television business the fear will people be willing to pay for traditional cable service if they can watch lots of tv shows free of charge from the internet on their regular tv sets on the other hand wide acceptance of internet video would likely be a huge boon for cable companies broadband internet access businesses "were going to go where the customer takes us " says an executive at one cable company some analysts predict new entrants to the pay television market verizon communications inc s fios tv and at&amp ts u verse will be the first to open their set top boxes to video from the internet thats because their services already use the same underlying communications technologies as the internet for now video on those services is delivered over the telecom companies private networks not the public internet the problem too complicated besides the hassles of getting internet video players hooked up to television sets most of them also need to be configured to connect to the internet over a wired or wireless home network and that process can be daunting wireless access points often require users to remember and enter a password before adding any new devices to the network which hinders the "plug and play" experience many consumers expect from entertainment systems some devices like apple tv force users to take an awkward first step users must purchase movies and tv shows on their pcs before they can access them in the living room though apple tv users can access youtube videos on the internet directly from their devices the solution keep it simple first home networks and internet video players will have to play more nicely with each other ciscos linksys division which makes home networking equipment has made it easier to add new computers to a wireless network by pushing a button on the devices eliminating the need to enter a security password makers of internet video players will need to integrate support for such features into their products to make setup easier cable satellite and telecommunications companies entering the video market may again have a leg up on rivals because they have fleets of technicians who handle the installation of new gear in living rooms another way to make things simpler is to give the set top box its own internet connection building b inc a belmont calif company developing an internet video player uses long range wireless internet technologies to send video directly to television sets so users dont necessarily have to connect the box to their home network the problem sticker shock compared with other methods of getting entertainment internet video devices are often pricey the movie box from vudu inc of santa clara calif costs &# and apple tv starts at &# hundreds of dollars more than a dvd player tivos sell for as low as &# but users must subscribe to a service that costs between &# and &# a month plus rental or purchase fees for downloading videos from amazon and thats on top of the monthly cable and satellite subscription fees users typically pay "additive bills create frustration " says bruno pati ceo of building b consumers have also shown a limited appetite for buying tv shows for &# an episode on apples itunes store and amazon unbox when so much of the content is available free on their pcs or cable systems nbc for one says online purchases of its shows represent less than of the volume of the free ad supported shows it offers online the solution set video free some industry executives say internet video players need to get cheaper if they become part of cable set top boxes some executives believe they should convert to a modest monthly charge with no up front fee to the consumer much like cable dvrs if tech companies stick with the current pricing for their boxes there is one thing that could help customers stomach the cost a rich supply of free video supported by advertising which brings us to our next point the problem limited selection today most internet video players are tightly linked with the hardware makers own online video service or those theyve cut deals with selection isnt comprehensive on most of these services limiting their appeal often the services dont have deals with all the hollywood studios and television producers dont get the best mainstream titles fast enough or dont offer youtube and other sources of user generated video the great attraction of the internet after all is the breadth of content take away that breadth and you take away a lot of the allure xbox for instance works only with microsofts xbox live video service which is stocked with content from comedy central warner bros and paramount apple tv plays video purchased on itunes including movies from walt disney co and television shows from cbs corp as well as youtube clips "all of the companies seem to be building entertainment silos " says jerry pierce former senior vice president of technology at universal pictures the movie studio owned by nbc universal but "consumers dont play in silos " reed hastings ceo of netflix inc says internet video players also havent benefited from something that helped propel ipods into the mainstream content copied from physical media or downloaded from illicit online sources nor is that likely to change soon since dvds are tougher to copy than cds and online piracy of video while worrisome to entertainment companies isnt nearly as widespread as it is for music mr hastings says the solution open up the boxes brightcoves mr allaire believes hardware makers should open their internet video players to anyone who wants to deliver entertainment to them to ensure internet video players work smoothly with multiple sources of online video mr allaire believes a good model to follow is really simple syndication or rss this technology allows users to create web pages that automatically receive headlines and other updates whenever their favorite news sites blogs and other web pages add new content mr allaire says internet video players could open themselves up to online video providers through a similar technology for instance users might go to a central web page and browse constantly updated catalogs of offerings from various video services for their part broadcasters say theyre willing to cut deals to bring their free advertising supported television shows which are already on the internet to internet video players such deals could take a while though since entertainment companies are trying to avoid cutting deals with technology partners that create powerful new online gatekeepers earlier this year apple stopped selling nbc tv shows on itunes after the two camps couldnt reach an agreement on pricing and other terms the problem slow downloads watching a television show or movie through some internet video players can be an exercise in delayed gratification some boxes like the xbox can begin playing videos purchased or rented online after only a few minutes depending on the speed of a users broadband connection in other cases users often have to wait hours to watch a movie until it has fully downloaded as with videos purchased from amazon through tivos older digital video recorders newer tivo boxes let users watch videos as theyre downloading "until they make it easier to do than to simply get into a car and drive to the blockbuster these boxes arent going to take off " says james mcquivey an analyst at forrester research the solution faster smarter as a first step makers of internet video players could learn from a clever trick that vudu employs the company automatically stores the first few seconds of every movie it offers online more than titles currently on vudu users boxes when customers select a movie to watch the video begins playing immediately while the rest of it downloads in the background ultimately though internet infrastructure is going to need to get faster residential broadband connections are already getting zippier with speeds in some parts of the country of to megabits per second through services like verizons fios for those faster speeds to matter though providers of internet video will also need to boost the speeds at which they deliver content on their end especially if that includes high definition video aimed at big screen televisions mr
