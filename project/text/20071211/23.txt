business technology best of the business tech blog excerpts from recent entries at wsj coms tech blog because these companies all have intellectual property that could help a foreign government be it military documents or information on financial markets and the latest tech products web surfing on iphone erases doubts of mobile devices future online role we have always felt that the game changing feature on apple inc s iphone was its web browser now we have proof iphone owners were responsible for nearly one out of every web page views last month this erases any doubt that the future of mobile devices most certainly includes the web many phones have web browsers but most are made specifically for mobile devices and give phone owners access to only watered down versions of web sites the iphone has the same browser as apples computers meaning iphone owners can see the same version of web pages people see on their personal computers iphone owners embraced the browser to the extent that they accounted for of all web pages viewed in november that doesnt sound like much but consider that through september apple had sold million iphones as a point of comparison devices running every version of microsoft corp s windows mobile operating system combined made up of web page views companies have been making mobile devices that run windows since and three million of the devices were shipped in the first quarter of alone according to research company gartner inc it is obvious people have a desire for web access even when they arent at their desks or at home or wherever else they have a pc and it is equally obvious businesses could make their employees more productive by ensuring that the mobile devices they give them have a full fledged browser we arent saying companies should go out and buy everyone an iphone although if you do we would love to hear about it presumably it is just a matter of time until an iphone like browser is a standard feature on mobile devices cyber espionage alert it isnt just databases full of credit card numbers that hackers are after they are after your secrets for most businesses may go down as the year they realized that criminals were after the information they keep on their customers and employees we say "may" because while stories about data breaches are ubiquitous companies arent exactly pushing each other out of the way to fix the problem in cyber security circles is going down as the year a much more sinister threat emerged state sponsored cyber espionage that is the highlight of a new report by mcafee inc a technology security company this year the u s indian and australian governments were allegedly hacked by china and estonia suffered a cyber attack it blamed on russia according to the report the chinese and russian governments deny all involvement it isnt just governments that are susceptible to attack says paul kurtz chief operating officer of consulting company good harbor consulting llc and a former cyber security adviser to presidents bill clinton and george w bush state sponsored hackers also are targeting government contractors financial institutions and high tech companies why because these companies all have intellectual property that could help a foreign government be it military documents or information on financial markets and the latest tech products "unfortunately data breaches are still seen as a cost of doing business " mr kurtz says companies have accepted the fact that people will fall victim to email scams and that hackers will on occasion gain access to corporate systems mr kurtz says he hopes if companies realize that their intellectual property is also at risk they will take security more seriously at a minimum he recommends businesses use advanced authentication tools such as tokens that have an ever changing identification number that people have to enter in addition to passwords among other things tech support woes a division of cisco systems inc is giving "customer service" a whole new meaning until recently people calling the support number for one of the companys tech products were being redirected to a phone sex line the offending phone number is printed on the box for the linksys wrhg model wireless router a piece of tech equipment that lets people set up wireless internet networks in their homes linksys which is owned by cisco designed the router for sale in india but its price tag you can buy the wrhg for &# after rebate is making it a popular buy in the u s as well evidently linksys wasnt prepared for this global success the number on the box is for technical support in india when people in the u s called the number they were told to call a different number instead of reaching an engineer who can answer technical problems callers heard a message from what appears to be an adult chat line a linksys spokeswoman says the problem is that numbers arent global the number on the box works when dialed in india but has a different owner in the u s but there is no country code or other clues the number should be dialed only from india linksys has since resolved the situation a recording now directs callers to the real linksys support line and the spokeswoman apologizes for any embarrassment the problem caused customers
