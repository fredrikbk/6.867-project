freddie fed try to limit damage mortgage investor to trim purchases of late loans regulator targets practices the fed is expected to propose a ban on penalties for prepaying certain subprime mortgages and a requirement that in some cases borrowers include money for taxes and property insurance in their monthly mortgage payments it says it will do that only in cases when the loans have been modified to ease terms for borrowers a foreclosure sale occurs the mortgage is overdue for months or the cost of guarantee payments to the investors exceeds the cost to freddie of holding the loan on its own books regulators and government backed mortgage investors are struggling to contain damage from soaring home loan defaults and prevent future blowups freddie mac announced yesterday a policy that will reduce the number of overdue loans it purchases from investors in mortgage securities guaranteed by the company the move is designed to preserve capital by avoiding the large immediate losses freddie must recognize when it makes such purchases a spokesman for fannie mae freddies main rival said it plans to follow suit meanwhile the federal reserve is preparing to propose mortgage regulations banning certain lending practices and extending the feds reach to the subprime mortgage lenders and brokers that proliferated during the housing boom the fed is expected to propose a ban on penalties for prepaying certain subprime mortgages and a requirement that in some cases borrowers include money for taxes and property insurance in their monthly mortgage payments freddies new policy came five days after fannie quietly imposed a fee of on all new mortgage loans it buys or guarantees fannie said the fee sure to be passed on to consumers is part of an effort "to ensure that what we charge aligns with the risk we bear " fannie and freddie also have recently added surcharges on loans to people who have credit scores below on a standard scale of to and who are borrowing more than of the propertys value fannie and freddie created by congress to channel money into housing but owned by private shareholders own or guarantee more than of u s home mortgages outstanding their role in the market has expanded in recent months as other investors have shunned u s mortgages amid rising defaults and falling home prices "on the one hand politicians are trying to make refinancing easier" for people stuck with loans they cant afford to pay said steven walsh president of scout mortgage a mortgage brokerage firm in scottsdale ariz "on the other hand fannie and freddie are making it more expensive " freddies announcement on delinquent loans raised concerns that the company could try to delay recognition of inevitable losses "it doesnt really change the ultimate level of credit losses " said joshua rosner an analyst at graham fisher &amp co a research firm in new york "it just changes the accounting treatment " a spokeswoman for freddie said the policy will better reflect "our expectations for future credit losses" and wont hurt investors in mortgage securities because they will still be compensated by freddie whenever borrowers fail to make their payments the companies regulator the office of federal housing enterprise oversight or ofheo didnt immediately endorse the action "we are assessing this change " an ofheo spokeswoman said fannie and freddie guarantee payments on loans that back mortgage securities held by others if borrowers default on those loans fannie and freddie are responsible for compensating the investors freddie said its policy has generally been to buy problem loans from the investors shortly after they become days overdue now it says it will do that only in cases when the loans have been modified to ease terms for borrowers a foreclosure sale occurs the mortgage is overdue for months or the cost of guarantee payments to the investors exceeds the cost to freddie of holding the loan on its own books freddie reported a loss of &# billion for the third quarter about &# million of that loss was from markdowns on delinquent loans bought from investors in mortgage securities when freddie buys such loans it must mark them down to estimates of the current market value of delinquent loans freddie has argued that such markdowns overstate the likely costs of its guarantees because many of the borrowers eventually catch up on their payments freddie also is required by regulators to hold more capital for loans it holds on its books than on those it merely guarantees so buying fewer late loans would reduce capital needs paul j miller jr an analyst at friedman billings ramsey &amp co said the freddie policy makes sense but raises the concern that in some cases the company is merely delaying losses it eventually will have to face as house prices fall it will be harder to save borrowers who fall behind by offering them better terms "nobody knows how bad this is going to get in the next year " mr miller said the feds action would require approval of its board but doesnt require legislation from congress it applies only to loans made in the future not those already made details are expected to be unveiled at a public meeting of the feds board next week unlike other bank regulators the fed has authority to target loan practices at both state and federally licensed lenders but it likely cant prohibit practices by wall street investors an approach that many consumer advocates say is necessary to ensure widespread reform senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd d conn plans to introduce legislation today that would ban many mortgage practices and make secondary market investors more liable for purchasing securities backed by illegal loans some advocacy groups fear fed action could be seen by some democrats as sufficient to avoid legislation many bankers and some at the fed hope for that outcome figuring any legislation would be harsher than the fed rules
