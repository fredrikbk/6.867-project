justices back sentencing leeway rulings may bring an end to era of rigid formulas open door to rehearings in a pair of rulings the supreme court emphatically declared that trial judges have wide discretion over criminal sentencing effectively ending the federal laws year experiment with rigid formulas for punishing individual defendants washington in a pair of rulings the supreme court emphatically declared that trial judges have wide discretion over criminal sentencing effectively ending the federal laws year experiment with rigid formulas for punishing individual defendants taken together the rulings will broaden the discretion of federal district court judges in handing out sentences they could also lead to thousands of defendants seeking a rehearing the rulings are potentially more expansive than the supreme courts last word on such guidelines in after that the court sent back more than cases to lower courts for rehearings "every federal defendant who is on appeal about to be sentenced or has been sentenced and lost on appeal is about to call his or her lawyer and say can we do anything with this " said douglas berman a professor and expert on federal sentencing at the ohio state university law school in congress adopted a sentencing system that was designed to equalize sentences for similar crimes it charged a sentencing commission with developing formulas that required judges to impose sentences within a range depending on facts of the case in a case known as booker the supreme court ruled that such guidelines were unconstitutional because they required judges to consider facts not proven to a jury but the courts splintered opinion didnt clearly outline how much weight trial judges should give the guidelines earlier this year the court ruled that it is reasonable for a judge to follow the guidelines meaning a defendant would face a heavy burden to have it thrown out yesterday the court ruled that the reverse doesnt follow a sentence that deviates from the guidelines isnt necessarily unreasonable as such the rulings make clear that sentences imposed by trial judges generally can be reversed only for "abuse of discretion" a rare event as long as they stay within the minimums and maximums prescribed by law in one case the court upheld a trial judge who rejected the additional penalties that federal sentencing guidelines impose for crack cocaine crimes over those for powder cocaine the drugs have the same active ingredient crack defendants are typically black and powder defendants more commonly white in the case a federal judge in virginia sentenced derrick kimbrough to years for intent to distribute more than grams of crack among other crimes the guidelines called for at least years so the government appealed a federal appeals court in richmond va sided with the government ruling that judges may not impose lighter sentences "based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses " writing for the court justice ruth bader ginsburg said that while judges must give "respectful consideration" to the sentencing guidelines judges are free to "tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well " such as the "history and characteristics of the defendant " the trial judge noted that mr kimbrough had no prior felony convictions and was a combat veteran in november the u s sentencing commission responding in part to criticism of the disparate racial impact reduced the difference in guidelines for crack and powder cocaine today the commission is expected to announce that the lessened penalties will apply retroactively to the crack offenders now in federal prison in the other case the court likewise found that a trial judge had acted properly when he gave a lenient sentence to a former drug dealer a federal judge in iowa sentenced brian gall to three years of probation rather than a like period in prison because of his unusual story of "self rehabilitation " while a university of iowa student in mr gall had taken part in a ring distributing the drug popularly known as ecstasy mr gall withdrew from the operation after seven months graduated from college and became a master carpenter years later federal agents tracked him down and he admitted having taken part in the drug ring mr gall was indicted and pleaded guilty a federal appeals court in st louis threw out the sentence agreeing with the government that the trial judge had given too much weight to mr galls successful effort to go straight writing for the supreme court justice john paul stevens said the appellate court mistakenly assumed there was some exact formula for measuring such factors "the formula is a classic example of attempting to measure an inventory of apples by counting oranges " justice stevens wrote justices clarence thomas and samuel alito dissented from both rulings kimbrough v u s gall v u s
