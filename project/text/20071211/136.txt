the nie fantasy along comes the nie to instantly undo four years of diplomacy using a semantic sleight of hand to suggest some kind of distinction can be drawn between irans bid to master the nuclear fuel cycle and its efforts to build nuclear weapons the nies real purpose becomes clear in the next sentence when it states that irans behavior "suggests that some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways might if perceived by irans leaders as credible prompt tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program " the ussr could derive considerable military advantage from the establishment of soviet medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles in cuba or from the establishment of a submarine base there either development however would be incompatible with soviet practice to date and with soviet policy as we presently estimate it " special national intelligence estimate sept twenty five days after this nie was published a u spy plane photographed a soviet ballistic missile site in cuba and the cuban missile crisis began its possible the latest nie on irans nuclear weapons program will not prove as misjudged or as damaging as the estimate but dont bet on it at the heart of last weeks nie is the "high confidence" judgment that tehran "halted its nuclear weapons program" in the fall of "primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure resulting from exposure of irans previously undeclared nuclear work " prior to that however the nie states also with "high confidence " that "iranian military entities were working under government direction to develop nuclear weapons " left to a footnote is the explanation that "by nuclear weapons program we mean irans nuclear weapon design and weaponization work we do not mean irans declared civil work related to uranium conversion and enrichment " lets unpack this in august an iranian opposition group revealed that iran had an undeclared uranium enrichment facility at natanz and an undeclared heavy water facility at arak both previously unknown to the pros of the u s intelligence community since then the administration has labored to persuade the international community that all these facilities have no conceivable purpose other than a military one those efforts paid off in three successive u n security council resolutions demanding iran suspend enrichment because it was "concerned by the proliferation risks" it posed along comes the nie to instantly undo four years of diplomacy using a semantic sleight of hand to suggest some kind of distinction can be drawn between irans bid to master the nuclear fuel cycle and its efforts to build nuclear weapons how credible is this distinction in "avoiding nuclear anarchy" mits owen cote notes that "the recipe for designing a weapon is very simple nor are the ingredients other than plutonium or heu highly enriched uranium hard to obtain for a gun weapon the gun barrel could be ordered from any machine shop as could a tungsten tamper machined to any specifications the customer desired the high explosive charge for firing the bullet could also be fashioned by anyone with access to and some experience handling tnt or other conventional chemical explosives " my emphasis in other words iran didnt abandon its nuclear weapons program on the contrary it went public with it its certainly plausible tehran may have suspended one aspect of the program the aspect that is the least technically challenging and that if exposed would offer smoking gun proof of ill intent then again why does the nie have next to nothing to say about irans efforts to produce plutonium at the arak facility which is of the same weapons producing type as israels dimona and north koreas yongbyon reactors and why the silence on irans ongoing and acknowledged testing of ballistic missiles of ever longer range the development of which only makes sense as a vehicle to deliver a weapon of mass destruction equally disingenuous is the nies assessment that irans purported decision to halt its weapons program is an indication that "tehrans decisions are guided by a cost benefit approach" an interesting statement given that irans quest for "peaceful" nuclear energy makes no economic sense but the nies real purpose becomes clear in the next sentence when it states that irans behavior "suggests that some combination of threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures along with opportunities for iran to achieve its security prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways might if perceived by irans leaders as credible prompt tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons program " this is a policy prescription not an intelligence assessment nonetheless it is worth recalling that if iran did have an active weaponization program prior to as the nie claims it means that former iranian president mohammad khatami was lying when he said that "weapons of mass destruction have never been our objective " mr khatami is just the kind of "moderate" that advocates of engagement with iran see as a credible negotiating partner if hes not to be trusted is mahmoud ahmadinejad then again when it comes to the issue of trust it isnt just mr ahmadinejad we need to worry about it has been widely pointed out that the conclusions of this nie flatly contradict those of a nie on the same subject calling the entire process into question less discussed is why the administration chose to release a shoddy document that does maximum political damage to it and to key u s allies particularly france the u k and israel the likely answer is that the administration calculated that any effort by them to suppress or tweak the nie would surely leak leading to accusations of "politicizing intelligence " but that only means that we now have an "intelligence community" that acts as an authority unto itself and cannot be trusted to obey its political masters much less keep a secret the administrations tacit acquiescence in this state of affairs may prove even more damaging than its wishful thinking on iran for years it has been a staple of fever swamp politics to believe the u s government is in the grip of shadowy powers using "intelligence" as a tool of control with the publication of this nie that is no longer a fantasy
