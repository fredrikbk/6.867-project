jobs and sell preferred stock to generate &# billion in capital the moves continued a year of bad news for a once highflying financial institution closely associated with the explosion of retail banking and heavily marketed mortgage loans across the u s in recent years the announcement also raised the questions of whether chief executive officer kerry killinger the architect of wamus rise from an obscure west coast savings and loan to a marquee name in banking should continue to run the company and if washington mutual could be sold outright "you just might say nows the time to take the golden parachute and walk away " said analyst richard bove of punk ziegel &amp co in a statement released after the close of the market yesterday wamu based in seattle said it plans to slash its quarterly dividend to cents a share from cents a share cut more than jobs as it exits the subprime market entirely and raise &# billion in capital all to address "unprecedented challenges in the mortgage and credit market " the company also said it expects a fourth quarter loss on a &# billion goodwill write down on its home loans business a spokesman for wamu the nations biggest s&amp l by market value declined to comment about mr killingers status or the possibility of a buyout of wamu mr killinger the ceo since couldnt be reached last week people close to mr killinger said that while the company perhaps should have moved quicker to address subprime fallout no leadership shake up was warranted wamus plan to abandon the subprime market is a reversal from the plan mr killinger outlined a year ago to rejuvenate the company after three years of falling performance in the early years of the decade the thrift rocketed through a &# billion expansion growing to more than branches and registering exponential profit growth the high speed expansion stumbled however on poor execution bad branch locations and problems with integrating acquisitions as per share profits fell in mr killingers growth plans included a significant focus on loans to borrowers with blemished credit a bet on the subprime market now in free fall of the top five mortgage lenders wamus portfolio has the

almost in the past months analysts have been forecasting a dividend cut as the thrifts mortgage business has struggled with losses and nonperforming loans but mr killinger said as recently as last month that the board wasnt expected to evaluate a change in its dividend policy until january a spokeswoman for wamu said the board made the decision to take up the question of the amount of the dividend earlier than expected although washington mutual said the actions would help it weather difficult housing markets in they could also prompt potential suitors to pounce wall street analysts have long speculated that wamu with about branches could be an attractive takeover target to banks such as j p morgan chase &amp co that are seeking to expand on the west coast a j p morgan spokesman declined to comment a potential problem is a lack of buyers as major u s banks such as bank of america corp and wachovia corp have their hands full integrating recent purchases wamu also could be viewed as a potentially difficult integration both because of past technology issues and continued concerns over the quality of its portfolio of loans in wamus written statement mr killinger said the actions "better position us to pursue various initiatives particularly in our leading retail banking business which is at the core of our business strategy " though wamu has been scaling back it was
