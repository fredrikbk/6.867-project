hospital responds on &# million bill for which they got little by focusing on a few isolated charges on a bill that covered four months in one of the most sophisticated technologically advanced medical settings in the nation you failed to address the wider issue of health care costs and inadequate reimbursement in general cynthia chiarappa senior director of marketing and communications california pacific medical center san francisco i dont like the idea of price controls but i wonder if in health care the common law of "implied consent" should be changed to "explicit signed consent " there is a real need for a serious discussion about health care costs in america sadly your article "as medical costs soar the insured face huge tab" page one nov missed an opportunity to be part of that debate and ended up being a story about nothing you chronicled the story of james dawson who ended up spending close to six months in intensive care four of those months at california pacific medical center during that time he exhausted his own health insurance coverage and ended up with a bill for more than &# million california pacific worked with the dawsons to resolve the bill and in the end because of the catastrophic nature of the bill and their severely limited finances they had to pay almost nothing your article mentions that all this happened after your reporter called us but the journals involvement had no impact on our decision we have counselors who work very hard every day to help families like the dawsons deal with financial hardships like this like many other hospitals around the u s cpmc frequently writes off medical bills when it is clear the patient is unable to pay we arent in the business of saving patients lives only to hound them to death over unpaid medical expenses missed in all this are several critical factors first the excellent care that mr dawson received at cpmc saved his life not just once but on several occasions second by focusing on a few isolated charges on a bill that covered four months in one of the most sophisticated technologically advanced medical settings in the nation you failed to address the wider issue of health care costs and inadequate reimbursement in general cynthia chiarappa senior director of marketing and communications california pacific medical center san francisco i dont like the idea of price controls but i wonder if in health care the common law of "implied consent" should be changed to "explicit signed consent " in other words the patient or the health care decision maker has to consent explicitly by signing a price list to each specific price if it is to be binding the government could then establish a schedule of "imputed prices " but they would only kick in when explicit consent to the health care providers price hasnt taken place howard ahmanson irvine calif i wonder how much of this problem can be attributed to the very substantial difference between retail and negotiated rates in my case for the emergency repair of an aortic aneurysm in my hospital and physicians bills for the days i spent in the hospital undergoing surgery and recovering were in excess of &# however the charges at the rates negotiated by my insurance carrier were only a tenth of that or about &# my part of the cost was or about &# i was astonished at this i believe that you will continue to see stories like those of the dawsons until the medical system is adjusted to provide billings that more closely reflect actual costs robert d parker galena forest nev patients with insurance have little incentive to economize their use of the health care system unlike other goods and services where a consumer must make economic decisions as to what to purchase and at what cost insured patients blindly rely upon their insurance carriers to take care of them the network provider system whereby carriers contract special prices with their network of hospitals and other providers creates a surreal two tiered system as jim dawson and his wife found out network providers and carriers "game" the system by blatantly overcharging and over billing the carriers in an attempt to make up for the drastically reduced agreed upon charges for their real substantive services however when the patient doesnt have insurance loses it or goes out of network the providers especially hospitals and surgeons bill those patients at "retail " which can be to times what the providers would accept from an insurer in these cases the patients who obviously are the least able to pay are charged the most as in your article the providers over billing assures that they dont get paid and in a touch of sad irony they use that as the excuse for continuing to over bill patients and carriers i would suggest that two ways to help rectify the system would be to create a system where everyone pays the same charges and an economic incentive for patients to make wise choices such as through the consistent use of co pays for the latter if a patient had to pay a percentage of every charge economic choices would be made and the workings of a free market economy would move us toward a greater sense of economic and medical rationality sanford f young new york see related letters "letters to the editor crushing hospital bills how are they calculated " wsj dec
