they beat cancer in childhood and then for many who defeat illness lingering effects mean they struggle in the working world while workers who contract cancer or a chronic illness as adults carry similar impairments childhood survivors face the added obstacle of trying to get and keep that all important first job for many people the first chance to get employer provided health insurance and establish a career employers must make accommodations for people who have a disability where there is some kind of workplace barrier that needs to be removed such as allowing time off for medical treatments or ensuring that workplace buildings are accessible to employees with physical impairments says peggy mastroianni associate legal counsel at the u s equal employment opportunity commission andrew flaton survived a brain tumor as a child but he still suffers from the effects of his cancer treatments one of his most challenging tasks holding down a job he was left almost entirely deaf after undergoing chemotherapy he cant work more than four hours a day without feeling exhausted and he often suffers from panic attacks which he struggles to keep under control the year old oakville mo resident earns less than &# a month and lives with his grandparents and the longest period he has spent in one job doing part time filing work for an anesthesiologist is two years before landing his current job as a retail clerk mr flaton was unemployed for a year he filled out close to two dozen job applications without receiving any calls for an interview "it was very difficult to find an employer who was accepting of what i could and could not do " he says as mr flatons struggle illustrates the transition into the workplace can be rocky for many childhood cancer survivors especially those who have been treated with high doses of radiation and chemotherapy the resulting cognitive and physical impairments can make it hard to keep a job and while workers who contract cancer or a chronic illness as adults carry similar impairments childhood survivors face the added obstacle of trying to get and keep that all important first job for many people the first chance to get employer provided health insurance and establish a career the problem is becoming more acute as a greater number of childhood cancer survivors enter the work force thanks to improvements in treatments over the past few decades for patients age and younger who were diagnosed between and survived at least five years according to the national cancer institute for those diagnosed between and the rate jumped to though no one tracks the number of survivors in the work force doctors and agencies who deal with childhood cancer patients say it is increasing survivors of pediatric cancer "are competing with young enthusiastic healthy hard working people " says robert hayashi co founder of the late effects clinic at st louis childrens hospital "they are often at a disadvantage when they are being considered for entry level positions " according to a study published in june in the journal pediatric blood and cancer of cancer survivors have never been employed compared with of their siblings "we were surprised at the magnitude of the difference " says debra friedman an author of the study and director of the survivorship program at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle the research was based on self reported employment history in childhood cancer survivors and siblings over age between and the risk of having never been employed was highest among survivors of brain tumors and bone cancers who typically go through the most severe treatments which include high doses of radiation and sometimes even amputation but the risk of chronic health problems resulting in employment problems was spread across various types of cancer says dr friedman who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the university of washington in seattle the risk of unemployment was higher if patients were diagnosed at a younger age presumably because the consequences of treatment are more severe another factor that could affect employment the psychological impact of being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing treatment "we see a fair amount of psychiatric illness in our survivors " dr friedman says such as post traumatic stress disorder anxiety and depression in many cases childhood cancer survivors are protected from employment discrimination by the federal americans with disabilities act employers must make accommodations for people who have a disability where there is some kind of workplace barrier that needs to be removed such as allowing time off for medical treatments or ensuring that workplace buildings are accessible to employees with physical impairments says peggy mastroianni associate legal counsel at the u s equal employment opportunity commission but the ada applies to employers only with or more employees companies cant legally ask a job applicants medical history but they may ask questions related to ability federal law prohibits employers that offer group health insurance plans from denying employees coverage based on health status clinics that specialize in treating adult survivors of childhood cancers encourage their patients to find positions at larger employers which are more likely than small businesses to offer group health plans "people who are late adolescents have very sparse benefit packages to begin with " says dr hayashi who is also associate professor of pediatrics at washington university school of medicine in st louis indeed mr flaton who currently pays for his own health insurance has struggled in the past to get coverage through employers his was let go from his second job as a locksmith in st louis before qualifying for insurance coverage even though he was able to work a hour week when he was mr flaton suspects it was because his employer beishir lock &amp safe inc didnt want to give him health benefits in missouri insurance companies are allowed to charge more to smaller employers if someone in the group has a serious health condition whenever he inquired about getting the coverage that other full time workers had his boss brought up his lack of progress in taking the locksmith exams required of company employees he says ted beishir president of beishir lock &amp safe says he doesnt recall the specific reasons mr flaton was terminated but that it wasnt because of health insurance he says he tells new hires upfront that he doesnt offer health insurance until they have worked at the company for a year the range of difficulties that childhood survivors face in adulthood varies depending on diagnosis and treatment says dr friedman brain tumor survivors who have gone through cranial radiation and chemotherapy treatments for instance may experience developmental and cognitive issues ranging from mild attention span difficulties to profound learning disabilities survivors of leukemia can be at risk for obesity diabetes and high blood pressure which could result in cardiovascular disease and some chemotherapy drugs used to treat bone cancer may cause heart problems whatever their experience survivors who have gone through extreme treatments that result in cognitive problems often have difficulty finding a job and may be afraid "of showing that they have a condition that would limit their work " says kevin oeffinger director of the program for adult survivors of pediatric cancer at the memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york in some cases there may be obvious physical characteristics that drive an applicant to voluntarily disclose his medical history says dr oeffinger jason cox a year old probate litigation attorney in houston has contended four times with recurrence of a cancer diagnosed when he was the rhabdomyosarcoma a fast growing malignant tumor in his right cheek has required at least facial surgeries his history of cancer didnt come up four years ago during his job interview at houston law firm galligan &amp manning he says but a year and a half ago he developed an infection in his cheek he had to undergo hyperbaric treatment which is used to promote blood flow in tissue damaged by radiation therapy he would have to take off half a day for about days plus extra time for surgery "that was when it became something that had the potential to interfere with the amount of work that i could do so i had to be very clear with them about what was going on " mr cox says his boss allowed him to take as much time off as he needed mr flaton who is divorced and has joint custody of his daughter is less fortunate after losing his locksmith job he spent time working at his familys business flaton machine works inc where he has had insurance coverage for much of his working life at he found work at performance motors a local auto repair shop while studying for an automotive associates degree at st louis community college he "loved cars and was obsessed" with them he says the owners of the shop were family friends when he was hired he had hoped to work as a mechanic but mostly test drove cars and chauffeured customers still he found the work exhausting and switched to part time from full after eight months in late his boss told him he wouldnt be needed until the following summer mr flaton recalls last year he was hired as a part time store associate at dallas based retail chain tuesday morning corp which sells discounted home accessories he assists customers stocks sales merchandise

and do something i really enjoy doing " ideally he says he would like to work for the missouri department of conservation or be a full time writer but right now "i dont have a whole lot of options " he says after effects survivors of childhood cancer often suffer long term debilitating effects of their treatment as a result such people are at a significantly higher risk of unemployment the risk of unemployment was highest among survivors of brain and bone cancers who typically go through the most severe treatments
