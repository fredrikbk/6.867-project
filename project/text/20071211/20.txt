business solutions beyond the firewall as a new breed of professional hacker emerges companies are finding new tools to protect their networks breaches of corporate computer security have reached epidemic proportions so far this year more than organizations have lost sensitive information like customer credit card or employee social security numbers and those are just the ones that have disclosed such incidents publicly while lost laptops and misplaced or misdirected files are partly to blame many breaches have a more sinister culprit the professional hacker theres a thriving black market for the kind of information companies keep about their customers and employees hackers can sell a credit card number for up to &# or a social security number for up to &# and a bank account number can be worth as much as &# according to symantec corp a provider of computer security software based in cupertino calif this has led to an increase in the number of hackers and to more sophisticated attacks the new breed of hacker has a bag full of tricks to get around the technology that companies historically have relied on to keep them safe so called firewalls that act like a fence around the company network security today requires a new generation of tools designed to keep a companys data safe even if a hacker has gained access to the network unfortunately theres no silver bullet "no one technology can address all your security needs " says andy spiers information security officer for national life group a financial services company based in montpelier vt security now requires companies to think like a hacker and find a way to counter each kind of attack while theres no way to make a company secure "you can make it difficult enough for hackers to say it is not worth my time " says mr spiers heres a look at some of the challenges companies are facing and how theyre responding email scams most people know not to respond to an email asking for their atm password or to open attached pictures of angelina jolie many of these scams get caught by email filters before they reach their targets anyway but hackers have responded to improved filtering software and a savvier population by aiming their attacks at specific individuals using publicly available information to craft a message designed to dupe a particular person or group of people fred danback chief information officer and managing principal at new york based integro insurance brokers nearly fell for one of these targeted attacks recently when he was trying to sell tickets to the broadway show "wicked" on ebay from his home computer someone sent him an email asking if his tickets were the same ones the emailer had seen listed elsewhere on the site the emailer provided a link and mr danback clicked on it the web page asked him for his ebay username and password which mr danback entered before he noticed the site was a fake it didnt have the little lock icon in the corner that indicates a legitimate site he didnt hit the "enter" key so the scam was foiled mr danback presumes that the hacker who sent the email was planning to use the requested information to steal his credit card number and other information from his ebay profile but the link just as easily could have been used to install malware computer code that a hacker plants on someones machine to do things like steal passwords release a virus or give the hacker control of the computer and such emails are being sent to people at work not just on their home computers even though integro trains employees to spot emails that might be from hackers mr danback knows how easy it would be for one of these scams to work thats why he uses antivirus and antimalware software from four different providers to protect his company software from sophos plc of abingdon england and from sybari software inc a unit of redmond wash based microsoft corp monitors email traffic while software from symantec protects the companys workstations from attack and software from mcafee inc santa clara calif does the same for the companys servers the back office computers at the heart of the system this way if a virus or some other code written by a hacker gets by one companys product it will get caught by another says mr danback key loggers one common form of malware is a key logger which captures the usernames and passwords that an unsuspecting computer user types and then sends these to a hacker the hacker then uses these credentials to log into and pilfer a companys database doug true senior vice president in charge of technology at forum credit union fishers ind installed software from biopassword inc of issaquah wash on the credit unions network in order to prevent a hacker from using a key logger to steal his companys information the biopassword software records each employees typing rhythm and uses that as an extra means of authentication so even if someone logs into a system with the right username and password if he types them too fast or too slow the system will deny access forum is also using biopasswords software on its online banking site which of its customers use forum doesnt have any control over what its customers do or dont do with their computers but mr true knows that if someones account is broken into over the internet no matter whose fault it is that customer could blame the credit union with the biopassword protection in place even if someones online banking information falls into the wrong hands the bad guys probably wont be able to access the account because theyre unlikely to be able to mimic the typing rhythm of the person they stole the information from patrolling the network lloyd hession the new york based chief security officer for london based bt group plcs global financial services unit compares a corporate network protected by a firewall to a hotel once someone gets through the front door he can go anywhere he wants one way to counter that threat is to limit peoples ability to move around the network mr hession uses hardware and software from consentry networks inc milpitas calif that allows him to impose tight controls over where on his network each person can go someone who tries to access a part of the network he isnt authorized to will be turned away even if he has a valid login so a hacker who has stolen an employees login wont be able to roam freely around the system the system also tracks where a computer is accessing the network from and will block someone from accessing information from an unapproved location for instance someone from the human resources department could access employee information from his office but not from another location in the building a conference room say or from outside the building so if his computer was stolen the thief would be denied access the consentry system also helps protect bt group against a hacker who has taken over someones computer most people use the network in a predictable way accessing the same few systems over and over again a hacker on the other hand needs to discover where the most valuable information is kept and is likely to snoop around the network trying to find it mr hession says the consentry system can detect when someone is behaving in a suspicious manner similar to the way a good security guard can tell when someone is casing a building policing the police consentrys system also helps protect a companys computer system against dishonest employees other products offer similar protection in different ways ed lipson a vice president at bank of new york mellon corp worries that one of the banks database administrators the people hired to keep the banks computer systems up and running or other employees might try to sneak information out about customers and their accounts mr lipson uses software from new york based application security inc that monitors who accesses each database and can tell if they make any changes to it if there is suspicious activity someone trying to access information that he or she shouldnt or repeated failed login attempts that suggest someone is fishing for the right combination of keystrokes the software notifies the databases designated security manager the software also sends an alert if someone makes an unauthorized change to a system the application security software also helps find databases that the information technology department isnt aware of maybe something created by someone outside the it department or by an employee who has since left the company such databases might not have the proper security measures in place mr lipson says and could be easy prey for a hacker or someone on his staff "i know all these guys " mr lipson says "it would be very surprising to see one of them steal the information but it happens " mr worthen a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau writes the journals business technology blog at wsj com biztech he can
