medvedev was head of mr putins administration when the kremlin took what critics described as steps to undermine democratic institutions they include the elimination of elections of regional governors and direct voting for members of parliament in a speech to the world economic forum in davos switzerland early this year mr medvedev said "i believe what we have in russia is real democracy " he added "we are well aware that no nondemocratic state has ever become truly prosperous for one reason freedom is better than nonfreedom " mr medvedev has little foreign policy experience having devoted his career to domestic issues since mr putin brought him into the kremlin current and former officials agreed that mr medvedev backs mr putins assertive line of standing up to the west in a briefing with

choice of mr medvedev would lead to "an administration that will carry out the same policies that have brought us results for the past eight years " politicians and analysts said mr medvedev will likely offer little resistance to whatever role mr putin chooses to take "hes a soft person and a person who compromises " said sergei markov a newly elected legislator from the united russia party

for position in preparation for mr putins departure mr putin a former kgb spy "will still be seen as one of them and will without a doubt keep his influence in this sphere " mr markov said he noted that mr medvedev because of his youth is likely to serve out his full four year presidential term unlike some other potential candidates who were thought likely to cede power early and allow mr putin to return others who had been mentioned as possible presidential contenders include prime minister victor zubkov and first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov the russian constitution bars mr putin from a third consecutive term but not from running again later mr putin has said he might consider returning to the presidency in mr putin has given no indication of what role he plans to play after his term ends leaders of the united russia party whose ticket mr putin helped carry to a crushing victory in dec parliamentary elections have called on him to play a vaguely defined role as "national leader " though mr medvedev has said there is no such role in the constitution before the election mr putin said a big victory for the party would give him the "moral right" to continue to ensure his policies were followed after he leaves office mr putin has packed the government and major state owned companies with loyal allies many from the kgb in what some analysts say is an effort to ensure his influence after he steps down politicians said he could wield control as chief of united russia which would use its dominance in parliament to nominate a cabinet other possibilities include heading the security council a kremlin body with broad powers in security and foreign policy analysts said a fluent english speaker mr medvedev presents a younger face than others who had been
