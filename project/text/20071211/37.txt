consumer technology doing your home work house hunters can arm themselves with information long before they contact a real estate agent the web has helped home buyers find places to live for years through real estate agencies sites and classified listings but now a number of sites have emerged that provide a raft of information beyond price location and photos among other things these sites allow house hunters to screen prospective neighbors evaluate school districts and see how members of the community rate a streets internet connectivity and cellphone service shoppers can keep abreast of the news in a neighborhood theyre considering and get alerts when houses list for sale or restaurants open or when a registered sex offender moves to the area consumers can find energy efficient homes and compare locations by levels of toxic waste or drought conditions and both buyers and sellers can join discussions with others who are in the market and real estate professionals all of this information can be particularly helpful in turbulent real estate markets like todays when many people would welcome greater assurance that theyre making the right decision heres a survey of whats out there "you can see just about any type of information about a house on trulia com " says matthew orr a long beach n y resident who used the site to find the home he and his fiancee are due to close on this month for starters users can enter a city town or zip code and see a listing of every home for sale sortable by price address number of bedrooms or bathrooms broker or type of home single family or multi family they can also narrow the search by establishing parameters for location size and property type mr orr says he and his fiancee used trulia com which is owned by san francisco based trulia inc to zero in on houses with big yards for their dogs and he recommends the sites home comparison features clicking on a listing brings up a page with a more detailed description of the home including how long it has been on the market and photos this page also offers lists of similar homes for sale and similar recently sold homes with links to pages for each of those homes charts comparing the homes price to those of the similar homes and to the average listing and sale prices in the area a sales history for the home drawn from public records and a link to a real estate guide for the area that includes information on market trends schools crime statistics income levels and commuting times there are also discussion boards and users can arrange to have email alerts sent to them when properties within their search parameters are listed or sold the site can also send alerts when the price of a particular house changes or the house is sold similar features are available on the site owned by seattle based zillow com boulder colo resident melanie fredericks says that when she and her husband were considering selling their house and buying a new home closer to their jobs they used zillow com to "gather all the information before even heading to a real estate agent and decided to wait for a better time to sell " one feature she found helpful was what the site calls zestimates which are zillow coms estimates of the value of homes including homes that arent listed for sale another interesting feature of zillow com is that people whose homes arent on the market but who would consider selling at the right price can post a "make me move" price to see if theres any interest worth exploring users of these and other real estate sites should keep in mind that the data the sites use can sometimes be dated for instance information on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms may not reflect recent renovations and the census figures the sites use for demographic profiles may be years old so they may not reflect recent trends in rapidly changing neighborhoods or towns one way to supplement the statistical information on real estate sites and to get help with particular questions or concerns is to seek input from others in the market and from real estate professionals on the sites discussion boards both trulia and zillow say these are their most popular features lisa suarez an insurance broker from san leandro calif turned to a discussion board on trulia com recently after months of failing to find a buyer for her home ms suarez posted a message on trulia voices at a m asking if anyone had any suggestions on how to speed up the process of selling her home within minutes she says she was contacted by a real estate agent who offered some advice that ms suarez liked and the two agreed to meet ms suarez hired the agent cindi hagley of windermere real estate services co in san ramon calif and within three weeks had two offers for her house that she is considering "in this devastating market it means everything that you can reach someone out there thats listening " she says other sites are designed to give users a look at neighborhoods through the eyes of the people who live there on recently launched streetadvisor com based in melbourne australia buyers can look for input from residents of a particular street about their neighbors local services and more for instance potential buyers looking at a home on north carlyn ave in campbell calif can read a review of life on the street written by tom huggett who has lived there for years he notes that the first houses were built before world war ii and readers can practically feel the shade of the mature sycamores redwoods oaks and fruit trees he describes the people range from infants to seniors he says and are "friendly but not nosey and helpful but not pushy " and he notes that its only about three blocks to a "newly vibrant downtown" with a lot of bars restaurants and shops reviewers also rate their street for its overall "vibe " which includes neighborly spirit and night life among other factors for its internet and pay tv access and cellphone reception for its "health " which includes factors like cleanliness noise levels and traffic for the cost of living and real estate values and for services and amenities like public transportation medical facilities schools child care and parks and recreation users can post pictures and videos as well one drawback of the site is that it hasnt had the time to build up much content mr huggett is the only contributor from his street for instance and users will find no comments for many streets for a different take on neighborhood life house hunters can check san diego based rottenneighbor com this site lets users post complaints about their neighbors so it can serve as a warning about frictions in a neighborhood one recent user in chicago wrote that the "guy on the top floor of this building plays his stereo all day and night its so loud hes why im moving " again while such sites can be useful there is a caveat there is no way for sites that depend on user generated content to verify the vast majority of information that people post and of course such comments are largely and often entirely subjective several sites cater to house hunters concerns about energy efficiency and the environment walkscore com started by seattle based front seat management llc in july rates the walkability of a neighborhood by the proximity of stores restaurants schools parks libraries and more to an address the user submits in the wake of a recent rash of brush fires water shortages and other drought conditions around the country sperlings best places of portland ore launched droughtscore com last month by

energy users can find builders working with the epa to build homes that meet the governments energy star standards for energy efficiency another site ecobroker com owned by ecobroker international evergreen colo can also help users find homes with energy efficient and environmentally friendly features other sites specialize in information on school systems and crime statistics areas that some real estate agents arent inclined to talk about because of concerns that their comments could be construed as steering people away from or toward certain neighborhoods "im very careful as to what i tell buyers when they ask those questions " says toni l medjuck owner of beach to bay realty in seminole fla "id rather refer them to where they can find the information " for sergey krasnovsky and his wife planning a move to seattle meant using greatschools net to narrow their search to two school districts for their year old son only then did they look for a potential home to buy "the site
