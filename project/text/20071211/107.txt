paradigm lost as drug industry struggles chemists face layoff wave lipitor pioneer is out at doomed pfizer lab a blockbuster drought raised with a passion for american comic books dr sliskovic says he jumped at the opportunity to come to the u s two years later his research completed he received a job offer from warner lambert co s ann arbor labs "holy cow i accept " he remembers saying warner lambert assigned him to a team of three other chemists investigating a new idea whether lowering cholesterol the soft waxy substance that can clog arteries would help people avoid heart attacks ann arbor michigan in january pfizer inc announced it was closing its storied research laboratories here laying off people among the casualties bob sliskovic a year lab veteran who helped create the worlds most successful drug the closure and dr sliskovics abrupt change of circumstances are emblematic of the pharmaceutical industrys declining fortunes it was at the ann arbor facility in the late s that dr sliskovic first assembled the chemicals that make up lipitor the cholesterol lowering drug that has generated about &# billion in sales since its launch and ranks as the bestselling pharmaceutical product ever today lipitor is nearing the end of its patent life and pfizer hasnt been able to come up with enough promising new drugs to replace it following that initial breakthrough some years ago dr sliskovic worked on several other research projects but none panned out his losing streak mirrors the industrys a byproduct of the late th century chemical business pharmaceutical research thrived for more than a century by finding chemical combinations to treat diseases but after contributing substantially both to human health and drug industry profits it has failed to produce significant innovations in recent years high failure rates have long plagued chemistry based drug research between and compounds are tested for every drug that makes it to market in recent years the problem seems to have gotten worse despite spending tens of billions of dollars more on research and development pharmaceutical companies have fewer and fewer drugs to show for it in the industry received food and drug administration approval for just new chemical based drugs down from in moreover many of those drugs are variations of existing medicines robert massie president of the american chemical societys database of chemistry research says some researchers are questioning how many more chemical combinations there are that are useful against diseases "its like how coming out with metal drivers in golf was a huge innovation but now its incremental youre just coming out with drivers that are a little longer or rounder " he says as pills like lipitor made out of elements from the periodic table prove harder to come by pharmaceutical research is being superseded by the newer field of biotechnology the latter relies mostly on biologists who make proteins from live cells the shift is exacting a human toll as big drug companies like pfizer lay off thousands of chemists casting a pall over what was once a secure well paying profession "when i started in this industry in the s you didnt worry about things like this " dr sliskovic says of the lab closure it isnt clear how many chemists have lost pharmaceutical company jobs but overall chemists were employed in down from in according to the bureau of labor statistics during the same period employment of biologists rose to from just as the rise of biotechnology is contributing to an economic boom in northern california the decline of chemical based research is hurting the michigan cities of ann arbor and kalamazoo along with some regions of new jersey and illinois dr sliskovic a year old with a mustache and the scattered air of a scientist was raised in doncaster a coal mining town in northern england his father a refugee from the former yugoslavia found work there after world war ii as a child dr sliskovic says he was fascinated by such things as the properties that "make a mint minty " that interest led him to pursue a doctorate in chemistry in his ph d adviser told him of a friend who worked as a consultant for a pharmaceutical company in new york the company was looking for chemists to do postdoctoral research raised with a passion for american comic books dr sliskovic says he jumped at the opportunity to come to the u s two years later his research completed he received a job offer from warner lambert co s ann arbor labs "holy cow i accept " he remembers saying dr sliskovic was hired as the pharmaceutical business entered a golden era of huge profits its labs churned out drugs for chronic conditions such as heart disease and depression while its armies of salesmen promoted them through aggressive marketing warner lambert assigned him to a team of three other chemists investigating a new idea whether lowering cholesterol the soft waxy substance that can clog arteries would help people avoid heart attacks other companies were at work on similar projects dr sliskovics new boss bruce roth had invented a chemical structure that he thought would work in the late s dr sliskovic fine tuned the compound isolating its potent part an early version of the compound wasnt absorbed well by the body so the team brainstormed about how to modify it to get more of it into the bloodstream "we sat around the table and said you try this you try that and they said bob why dont you look at salt formation " dr sliskovic recalls a calcium salt he tried solved the problem and lipitor was born though it would reach the market in after several rival drugs lipitor would turn into a blockbuster because it was more potent its runaway success sparked pfizers &# billion hostile takeover of warner lambert in ahead of the takeover pfizer suggested one of warners main appeals was its research and development force "we would like to keep them all " pfizers then research chief john niblack told the wall street journal in "you need a big staff to run this strategy warner lambert offers us a nice instant fix " with the acquisition new york based pfizer inherited the ann arbor labs where dr sliskovic worked and continued to base much of its pharmaceutical research there between and it invested &# million to expand the facilities by that time dr sliskovic had moved on to other projects as lipitor traveled down the long road of animal and human testing in the early s he led a group of chemists developing drugs to prevent cholesterol from being absorbed by the body and stored in arteries lipitor by contrast works by reducing the amount of cholesterol the liver produces one compound called avasimibe seemed to work well in animals despite skepticism from higher ups dr sliskovic and his team persuaded warner lambert to take it into human testing for a while it looked as though avasimibe could be a contender to succeed lipitor but it failed in an intermediate stage of clinical testing and the company abandoned it dr sliskovic had devoted about six years to the drug he recalls needing pep talks from his boss about picking up and starting over he blocked out disappointment he says by throwing himself into the days science rather than thinking about the odds of creating a marketable drug "youve got to develop the hide of a rhino " he says in the mid s he tried to develop compounds to counter inflammation in the heart which some scientists think can cause heart attacks those projects also flopped but got him interested in another area of research inflammatory arthritis dr sliskovic took on the challenge of finding a drug that would repair the cartilage that can break down between bones and cause arthritic pain but the several compounds he concocted didnt meet testing requirements in dr sliskovic was promoted to a management role that took him away from the day to day work of drug discovery he says his new job required him to teach his scientists how to remain excited in the wake of failure "it was me who started telling them oh well never mind what can we do about this other project " he says but over time those failures added up in december pfizer killed torcetrapib the cholesterol compound the company had placed its hopes on because it was associated with too many deaths in clinical testing it was a huge setback because pfizer didnt have much else in its research pipeline to replace lipitors sales the company relies on lipitor for more than a quarter of its revenues and the drug could face generic competition as early as the company has had some successes pfizer appears to have a rich cancer drug pipeline and has come up with two notable new chemical based hits recently the antismoking medicine chantix and a pain drug lyrica which was discovered in ann arbor the companys new chief executive jeffrey kindler has emphasized biotech after taking over some months ago in october pfizer opened a new biologics center in san francisco by january mr kindler was promising to do something radical to shake the worlds biggest drug maker out of its worsening slump rumors of layoffs were swirling at pfizer few imagined anything as drastic as closing the half century old ann arbor labs where pfizer was just finishing the &# million expansion dr sliskovic says he learned of the closure on jan in a morning meeting with the sites top managers the room went silent he says after the meeting dr sliskovic called his wife on her cellphone to tell her the news she thought he was kidding realizing he was serious she offered to increase her hours at her part time job at a pet food store later at home over lunch his year old daughter asked whether they would have to sell the familys three horses the announcement also took michigan officials by surprise the state which has the countrys worst unemployment rate was already reeling from auto industry cuts pfizer was also ann arbors largest taxpayer contributing &# million a year into city coffers at a press conference later in the day local officials pledged to fight for scientists to stay in the area later they pledged &# million in interest free loans for start ups run by laid off scientists or existing companies that hire them a state budget deadlock delayed the money for months but it is now being handed out to scientists pfizer offered about half of the ann arbor researchers internal transfers mostly to its other big research facility in groton conn but a higher proportion of those offers went to biologists than to chemists former lab employees say though it is far from abandoning chemistry based research pfizer has been increasingly outsourcing chemistry work to contract research organizations some in india pfizer declined to comment on which scientists were offered transfers in april about laid off pfizer chemists from ann arbor traveled to nearby detroit to hear a talk by career consultant lisa balbes ms balbes told them the story of a former chemist who now uses her skills to enhance acoustics in stereo systems her message start thinking about different career paths as winter turned into spring dr sliskovic found himself going to a parade of goodbye parties for colleagues dr roth his former boss left in april for genentech inc the biotech pioneer based in south san francisco dr sliskovic organized the send off in early may david canter the head of the ann arbor site threw a dinner party for other departing employees a band played songs parodying pfizer and the executive who symbolized headquarters decision making john lamattina pfizers connecticut based head of research to the tune from evita they sang "dont cry for me lamattina " a few weeks later dr lamattina himself announced his retirement as part of mr kindlers broad reorganization of top company executives martin mackay who succeeded dr lamattina as research chief and played a major role in the research restructuring says the company was "very aware" of its impact on the community "we made this decision after very careful and thorough review of all possible alternatives " mr mackay said in a statement scott larsen one of the chemists who attended the going away party came to pfizer four years ago when the company merged with his former employer pharmacia corp he applied for a transfer to groton but didnt get an offer he tells his two sons who are both in college and love science not to go work for a drug company in august dr sliskovics team stopped doing research and began transferring projects to other pfizer sites the labs are now being cleaned inspected and sealed off the acre campus is a ghost town of empty rooms and boxed up equipment dr sliskovic didnt seek an internal transfer he felt that moving would be too hard on his family as acting head of chemistry at the ann arbor labs dr sliskovic earned far above the &# a year paid to the average chemist of his experience level dr sliskovic says he will receive severance pay for between months and two years with two children in college and another in high school he says two years is the longest he could afford to forgo a paycheck dr sliskovic has already repainted the family kitchen and living room now he is festooning the house and yard with holiday lights worried about their financial future his wife cindy took a second part time job at the barn where they keep their horses the irony that the drug her husband helped discover will bring in nearly &# billion for pfizer this year hasnt been lost on her as a staff scientist dr sliskovic earned no bonus or royalties for his work on lipitor former pfizer scientists have founded companies in the area dr sliskovic says he would prefer to do the creative work of discovering drugs instead of the rote chemistry some such companies do for drug makers instead he dreams of being involved in another blockbuster sometimes he says he lies in bed at night wondering if it will happen "if the best thing i did was lipitor in its like being the high school athlete who was on the football team and that was that " he says
