h p printers press into heavy duty markets when he printed labels for a winery called tomei cellars last month the labels came off a high end inkjet printer from hewlett packard co mr grossman president of a division of mrs grossmans paper co petaluma calif says he leased his h p digital printer called indigo in october the challenge repositioning h p as not just the maker of printers for office and home documents but also form commercial printing wine labels books newsletters and advertisements that stick onto buildings and cars for years jason grossman printed wine labels using traditional flexographic presses but when he printed labels for a winery called tomei cellars last month the labels came off a high end inkjet printer from hewlett packard co mr grossman president of a division of mrs grossmans paper co petaluma calif says he leased his h p digital printer called indigo in october he says the &# machine eliminates the time and cost of creating a new rubber printing plate for each new label and makes it much less expensive to print small and medium size jobs "i dont know anyone whos not using h p printers on wine labels right now " says mr grossman who still uses older presses for his largest printing jobs h p increasingly is relying on customers like mr grossman to engineer a shift in its &# billion printing business the challenge repositioning h p as not just the maker of printers for office and home documents but also form commercial printing wine labels books newsletters and advertisements that stick onto buildings and cars in the past few years h p has shelled out more than &# billion to acquire high end press maker indigo nv and large format printer makers scitex corp s scitex vision and macdermid colorspan inc yesterday h p announced plans to acquire another large format printer nur macroprinters ltd for &# million h p also is reducing its emphasis on market share of printers sold while increasing focus on the percentage of total printed pages that come out of its machines "its all about moving from printers to pages " says vyomesh joshi head of h ps printing unit he says internal research shows that h p printers produce only of the worlds total pages the year old is expected to outline more of h ps printing strategy today at h ps analyst meeting in new york "the transformation is in my mind deep and broad " mr joshi says "this is not just a tweak " the palo alto calif technology behemoth has long led the world wide computer printer market by selling inkjet and laser printers and profiting from repeat ink and toner sales many office and home documents are printed with h p products giving the unit a world wide printer market share and helping it generate more than of h ps overall profit but revenue growth from h ps traditional printer sales is slowing while global laser and inkjet printer sales are projected to rise about this year to million units much of that growth is in low end machines whose profit margin is shrinking according to research firm lyra research as a result h ps revenue from inkjet sales has stagnated hovering between &# billion to &# billion for the past three years mr joshis move is part of h p chief executive mark hurds strategy to maintain the robust overall revenue growth his company has had during the past two years without incurring new costs mr hurd recently said the printing unit will "be taking out costs and realigning resources" by trimming less profitable product lines the savings he said will be invested in the units new technologies the shift requires a delicate approach h ps strategy involves getting into markets dominated by digital printer makers such as xerox corp and traditional makers of offset presses such as germanys heidelberger druckmaschinen ag which for decades have been selling commercial machines that produce books and newsletters other companies with decades of experience in areas where h p is a relative newcomer japans canon inc and oce nv of the netherlands in high volume digital printing and copying and fuji photo film co and eastman kodak co in digital photo printing as it shifts h p risks taking its eyes off its core inkjet and laser business which still generates the bulk of the printer units revenue h p also will have to provide more involved customer service than what its traditional markets required thats an area where rivals such as xerox say they have an advantage since it has years of experience sending out technicians to fix copiers and commercial printers dan renouard an analyst at robert w baird &amp co who follows h p says he is optimistic about h ps strategy since the company has been successful in developing print technologies but he sees challenges as h p tries to convince large volume printers to move away from traditional machines that use metal plates and rubber rollers to new inkjets "ultimately you have to change customer behavior " he says when a customer has a problem xerox guarantees that an employee will arrive in a few hours says quincy allen the president of xeroxs production print division mr joshi says h ps service is comparable but acknowledges that establishing involved relationships with clients is a change h ps printing shift began in after mr joshi says he realized the low end printing market couldnt fuel much more growth for the business during the next six months he began making over his team appointing a key lieutenant to take over a new graphics division that would develop commercial print technology and hiring an executive from competitor lexmark international inc around the same time mr joshi says he began shifting costs and employees away from product lines with waning returns toward projects such as the bigger digital printers that produce wine labels he declined to say how much money or how many people are being moved the changes havent all gone over smoothly early last year h p assigned engineers to work on a new digital printing press that had been in development by scitex vision a company h p acquired in that makes printers for billboards and banners since scitex machines use a different inkjet technology than other h p printers it took h p engineers a year longer than expected to finish developing the new printer "we were late shipping" because of the differing technologies says steve nigro h ps vice president of graphics there was other friction as product developers were reassigned from making cheap printers to expensive commercial machines h ps executives curbed the engineers practice of building hundreds of prototypes for example which is too expensive when dealing with high end printers that cost more than &# "now you cant build hundreds of them for your tests " mr nigro says "youve got to build tens of them " h p still needs to win over skeptical customers particularly since it remains more expensive to print large numbers of copies on its large new digital printers compared with the traditional presses much of the cost in traditional printing comes in setting up the printing plates at the beginning of the process and the per page cost of printing drops as a run gets larger mr joshi says the indigo printer which analysts say prints color pages at about five cents each is cheaper than offset for jobs of as much as about pages gartner research says offset becomes cheaper for most jobs at about pages robert ryan president of commercial printer graphic color inc teaneck n j says he only gave the indigo a brief look last year before deciding to stick with his traditional heidelberg machines mr ryans company prints advertising material in runs of pages or more the indigo "doesnt do the volume " he says
