an incomplete metamorphosis argonautika berkeley repertory theatre through dec the production then travels to washington d c and then princeton n j berkeley calif writer director mary zimmerman prefers to present her imaginative evolving literary based theater pieces in repertory theaters outside of new york they may end up in manhattan but that has never been her goal her unforgettable "metamorphoses " based on of ovids tales erotic humane and miraculous began in chicago her home base in then played in seattle berkeley and los angeles before finally arriving in new york where the production in which an agile and clever cast waded drowned floated fought and made love in and around a shallow pool full of water won her a tony award in as "best director " ms zimmerman has also spun theatrical gold out of "the odyssey " "the arabian nights " the "notebooks of leonardo da vinci" and episodes of proust her staging of donizettis "lucia di lammermoor" opened the metropolitan operas season in september ms zimmermans latest adventure in theatricalized mythology is a spectacle called "argonautika " based on the harrowing quest for the golden fleece by jason and his hardy shipmates primarily as related about b c by appolonius of rhodes his is one of many versions of the myth which also served as the basis for a popular movie and a tv special ms zimmermans production opened at chicagos lookingglass theatre in fall it was then physically restructured and recast for the current berkeley repertory theatre production which will run until dec this version then travels to the washingtons shakespeare theatre jan march and princeton n j s mccarter theatre march april daniel ostlings simple swedish modern set is basically a floor ceiling and two side walls made of steel veneered with polished poplar planks inserted into the proscenium opening on the left is a floating unrailed balcony reached by moveable ladders used for various kinds of action the argonauts sit along its edge to ply their oars superior beings stand on it to look down on their inferiors on the right side a tall pole rises from the floor through a hole in the ceiling most often the mast of the argo it can also serve other functions a trap door in the ceiling allows puppets to be manipulated and eros to fly down on wires a trap door in the floor opens to become the brook in which one character drowns and the path to hades that medeas ghost descends at the end one of the more fascinating scenes occurs as the argonauts turn this box into their ship pulling down riding up and fastening ropes in a choreographed frenzy of activity both filmed versions of "jason and the argonauts" are noted for their special effects stop action animation in the case of the columbia movie computer generated images for the nbc tv special at an epic remove from these the best of ms zimmermans effects are as simple and transparent as those at shakespeares globe a big green cloth is flapped up and down to represent a violent storm at sea suddenly a headlike shape pokes from under the fabric presumably one actor seated on anothers shoulders two big muppet like eyes are stuck to the shape and bang an awesome convincing sea monster is evoked an infant actually a soft doll puppet controlled by strings twitches its head and limbs on the floor when bad guys decide to kill the baby they just cut the strings the jarring simplicity of such images makes them all the more powerful some scenes set to music by andre pluess and ben sussman work well others less so pinioned by eros arrow medea tosses through a sleepless lust tormented night borne up on the hands of three sailors her night of love with jason is also effectively enacted as a horizontal ballet two good weddings of movement and music i was less sure about the hip hop roll call in act i in which jasons male and female shipmates standing in for apollonius rap out their names and origins to the rhythm of drums and maracas i heard one viewer complain that the play is "episodic " of course it is so is the legend but to work as compelling theater "argonautika" needed more forward momentum or at least a unifying vision without the focus that the wading pool gave to ms zimmermans "metamorphoses " too many theatrical ideas in "argonautika" didnt seem to cohere and in a zimmerman production theatrical ideas matter more than mere words indeed ms zimmerman ran out of good ideas halfway through act ii jasons beating down and yoking the terrible fire breathing oxen two actors with horned helmets was quick and perfunctory the argonauts subsequent battle with the warriors risen from the dead bouncing little plastic halloween skeletons held out on sticks was a pathetic reminder of ray harryhausens historic stop motion sequence in the film the dragon who guards the golden fleece was a big rolling eye that medea quickly tempts to sleep instead of carrying the beached argo on their shoulders across the desert jasons crew pretended to struggle under a set of poles and in the last minutes ms zimmerman tacked on the years later fates of the cast euripides"medea " in a nutshell which struck me as a foolish way to end a good story but the main problem with the berkeley production was the quality of the acting for which the director who presumably chose and coached the cast is partly to blame the company of playing many roles mastered their complex physical demands climbing up ropes and poles somersaulting off the balcony flying on wires but few were able to give any life to their characters or lines the same cast will travel east young atley loughridge one of three members of the original cast to make the trip to california transforms medea from a droopy teenager into a woman tormented by lust and fury almost worthy of her legend but only soren oliver as a bald brawny blustering hercules and later as medeas outraged father had the vigor range and control of a true professional actor in this interpretation handsome young hylas justin blanchard is clearly hercules boyfriend their parting after hylas death was the one genuinely moving moment of the show for a while i speculated on what this promising script might have become in the hands of another director one more astute in casting in the directing of actors as distinguished from ensembles more concerned with the overall arc of a production but then i remembered that author and director are the same person "metamorphoses" has gone on to many successful productions in other hands but for the immediate future "argonautika" belongs to ms zimmerman mr littlejohn writes about west coast cultural events for the journal
