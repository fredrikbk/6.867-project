telecommunications lost connections new software improves the reliability of wireless links cutting down on the headache of constant crashes st lukes episcopal health system a large houston based hospital uses several hundred mobile devices including laptops personal digital assistants and x ray machines all of which require a reliable internet connection it happens a lot a field worker running a laptop program loses the internet connection momentarily causing the computer and the application to crash the result wasted time and a frustrated employee more and more businesses are arming their employees with laptops smart phones or other devices that connect wirelessly to the companys virtual private network but the inconsistent reliability of wi fi and cellular connections along with the problems posed by remaining connected while moving from place to place have companies looking at new software designed to improve the reliability of those wireless links "the whole idea of mobility is to improve productivity " says stacy sudan a research analyst for idc a framingham mass based research firm "if your session goes down thats a big problem " traditional virtual private networks which are secure pipes back to the main corporate network were designed to work with personal computers and laptops plugged into a phone or data line but more recently field workers have begun accessing vpns from outside of the office or workplace using a laptop and wireless card or a smart phone meanwhile many of the applications these employees use arent designed for wireless networks and their less reliable connections and that is driving demand for software from mobile vpn providers whose aim is to make the connections stronger or to keep the programs running even if the connection is temporarily severed mobile vpn programs use various techniques to maintain a connection when a signal is interrupted or when a worker is moving between hot spots if a connection is severed for instance the software can fool the vpn into acting as if the link between the portable computer and the server back at headquarters is still maintained the software does this by signaling to the vpn that data traffic has simply slowed to a crawl which keeps the line open and the program running normally until the wireless connection is restored when a device moves between wireless connections software can generate a virtual internet address that remains with the computer rather than having a new address assigned by each new hot spot the consistent address allows a person to maintain a file download or upload through a secure program even if they lose their connection before if a connection was lost during a secure file transfer the secure program would crash often dragging down the computer with it so far demand for this new technology has come mainly from field technicians or public safety departments such as police who need to roam between different wireless networks but companies with lots of mobile professionals and white collar workers are also beginning to turn to the software to maintain reliable connections for online tasks "i think well start to see it move to other markets like professional services or anything with a highly mobile work force " says chris silva an analyst at cambridge mass based forrester research inc "theres a need to take advantage of a network connection thats continuous " cox communications inc a closely held cable provider based in atlanta became interested in mobile vpn software when it started looking for a way to keep its field workers connected to the network at headquarters the technicians use the information on their laptops to keep track of which customers they serve and what their problems are but the laptops would lose their connections as many as five times a day causing the program or even the computer to crash a year ago cox began deploying software from netmotion wireless inc on its field technicians laptops to manage connections and keep the secure vpn running field workers no longer have to worry about finding the fastest network the software automatically locates and switches to it while cox declines to give any numbers al briggs the companys director of mobile services says the staff can answer more work orders because they dont have to waste time finding a connection or restarting their computers because of the reliable connection cox is moving toward storing all of its customer information on its central servers and streaming it out to field workers that way a stolen laptop in the field wont hold any sensitive data cox is now exploring other ways to take advantage of the steady connection as well "netmotion is part of the highway that allows that to happen " mr briggs says "the addition of netmotion has made connectivity stable enough that we can begin to put things out there you couldnt have done in the past " st lukes episcopal health system a large houston based hospital uses several hundred mobile devices including laptops personal digital assistants and x ray machines all of which require a reliable internet connection the sprawling complex features multiple wi fi hot spots but maintaining a steady connection is difficult when moving between floors or departments doctors and nurses were complaining that programs would halt when devices were moved too far in one direction in the hospital began using mobile vpn software from netmotion to secure its programs and valuable patient data and to prevent connections from crashing as devices moved between wi fi access points and through areas with weak signals more recently in october when it bought several portable x ray machines the technology department connected them to laptops using netmotion software now doctors have the option of sending x ray machines to where the patients are instead of always sending patients to the x ray department and while it formerly took minutes just to print the x rays having a secure mobile vpn connection means an image can be sent to doctors smart phones or laptops in less than seconds expanding the hospitals use of mobile technology has improved patient flow and cost efficiency says gene gretzer st lukes project leader for access technology indeed other departments and clinics want the technology too st lukes neurology department is now using the mobile imaging to aid in an epilepsy study the noninvasive cardiology group meanwhile and other departments are waiting for similar technology "a lot of departments are going wireless because they need to get to where the patient is " says mr gretzer "they want a constant fluid signal and netmotions system helps " netmotion is a privately held company based in seattle other companies are capitalizing on demand in other sectors three of the top retailers in the u s for instance use software from sweden based columbitech inc says asa holmstrom president of u s operations for the privately held provider of wireless security software store managers in charge of multiple locations for example use smart phones that exchange sensitive data between stores and headquarters mobile devices are often used within stores to monitor inventory as well while columbitech declines to disclose figures ms holmstrom says the retail sector has helped the company double its revenue from a year ago one of columbitechs clients the navy exchange service command based in virginia beach va oversees retail stores for u s navy personnel around the world in early october nexcom upgraded its mobile devices for managing inventory by installing columbitech software on its servers having more robust security for the hand helds "gives the labor force the ability to be using a computer but in a very small and mobile format " says kean westcott chief information officer of nexcom he adds that buying new mobile devices would have been about eight times as expensive as purchasing the columbitech software down the line ms holmstrom believes it will be common for customers in stores with secure wi fi networks to make purchases using their cellphones thats already happening to a limited extent in europe for now the need for secure mobile vpn software remains tiny but is growing forresters mr silva predicts more wide scale adoption by businesses and government agencies by about as usage continues to spread from field workers to a broad range of office employees "the natural progression " he says "is to move to much more critical applications " mr cheng is a reporter
