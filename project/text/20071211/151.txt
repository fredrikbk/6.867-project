waterboarding congress knew khalid sheikh mohammed who planned the airliner attacks on the world trade center and pentagon abu zebaydah an osama bin laden confidante captured in pakistan and described as a director of al qaeda operations and a third unidentified person after three days of screaming headlines about the cia destroying videotapes in of the "harsh" interrogation of two terrorists it now comes to light that in key members of congress were fully briefed by the cia about those interrogation techniques including waterboarding one member of that congressional delegation was the future house speaker nancy pelosi the washington post on sunday reported these series of briefings while it is not our habit to promote the competition readers should visit the posts web site and absorb this astonishing detail for themselves as reported by joby warrick and dan eggen in "hill briefed on waterboarding in in meetings spy panels chiefs did not protest officials say " porter goss the former chair of the house intelligence committee who later served as cia director from to is explicit about what happened in these meetings "among those being briefed there was a pretty full understanding of what the cia was doing and the reaction in the room was not just approval but encouragement " in all the cia provided congress with some briefings on waterboarding before it became a public issue why would the cia want to tell the most senior members of congress about anything so sensitive no doubt in part because senior officials at the cia not to mention the interrogators themselves assuredly did not want to begin any such policy absent closing the political and legal loop on it the congressional briefings touched the political base and a justice department memo at that time deemed the interrogation methods legal most crucially bear in mind that when pressed about all this at his confirmation hearings attorney general michael mukasey pointedly said he would not make a post facto condemnation of the techniques thereby putting the "freedom" of the interrogators at risk "simply because i want to be congenial " at the time we wrote that this was a sign of judge mukaseys character that word would not spring to mind in describing what the posts account says about congress one certainly may hold as abhorrent the idea of aggressively interrogating any terrorists ever either for fear of what they might do to our people as john mccain does or because one thinks this violates our values what one may not do at least not if one wants the system to function is assent to such a policy in and then when the policy is made public put up the pretense that one is "shocked" and appalled to learn of it this is bad faith worse it risks setting in motion the ruin or eventual criminal prosecution of cia employees who in did what the bush administration congress and indeed the nation wanted them to do to protect the american people from another september it has been widely reported by now that waterboarding was used on only three individuals khalid sheikh mohammed who planned the airliner attacks on the world trade center and pentagon abu zebaydah an osama bin laden confidante captured in pakistan and described as a director of al qaeda operations and a third unidentified person if speaker pelosi and her colleagues want the handling of such terrorists conformed to what they call "our values " then she should define that and put it in an explicit piece of legislation then let the members vote yea or nay in public on the record but dont sign off on such a sensitive policy at a moment when the nations "values" support it then later feign revulsion when you cant take the heat from the loudest in your political constituency there was a time when politics at least assumed more backbone than that
