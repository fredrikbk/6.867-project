the middle seat the most expensive city to leave cincinnati rankings of priciest airports show wide fare differences weighing the southwest effect efforts by airports and government officials to make room for discount airlines at congested airports like new yorks laguardia and chicagos ohare appear to have paid off it can boast lower average fares than st louis philadelphia and raleigh durham n c whats more many of the nations big "fortress hubs" airports where one carrier dominates the competition and connects scads of passengers have gotten cheaper because of increased competition if you fly out of pittsburgh you pay less on average for a domestic airline ticket for trips of the same distance than if you fly out of cincinnati memphis is more expensive than nashville and newark n j is more expensive than new yorks laguardia airport whats the reason for such wide disparities it has little to do with airline costs and everything to do with competition the presence of discount airlines such as southwest airlines or airtran airways makes all the difference consider delta air lines flight from atlanta to las vegas and flight from cincinnati to las vegas both are flown with boeing s and both arrive in las vegas at p m getting the atlanta flight to las vegas is a bit more expensive for delta because the flight is scheduled at minutes longer atlanta is miles farther from las vegas and prone to more delays yet despite slightly lower operating costs tickets on the cincinnati flight are far more expensive a weeklong trip next month from cincinnati costs &# compared to &# from atlanta on the same days delta has no direct competition on that route but from atlanta to las vegas delta competes against low fare carrier airtran airways the department of transportation publishes the average prices travelers pay per mile to fly from cities adjusting data for distance flown fares out of san francisco could be higher simply because people fly farther than travelers getting on airplanes in the middle of the country yields apples to apples comparisons of prices under that distance adjusted analysis cincinnati where delta has more than of passengers ends up with the highest average domestic fares among the nations largest airports based on fares from the first quarter this year thats not a surprise to many in cincinnati "i feel like im getting gouged " said michael

" its easy to see how a last minute round trip ticket from cincinnati to new york and back cost &# on deltas web site yesterday compared to &# for an atlanta new york round trip the middle seat analysis of fare data based on an average mile trip shows some surprises along with the disparities efforts by airports and government officials to make room for discount airlines at congested

dallas fort worth chicago ohare is even lower at no it can boast lower average fares than st louis philadelphia and raleigh durham n c whats more many of the nations big "fortress hubs" airports where one carrier dominates the competition and connects scads of passengers have gotten cheaper because of increased competition now that discount airlines have a larger presence in many hubs prices have come down travelers from denver philadelphia st louis and salt lake city all paid less than cents a mile for a mile trip on average thats less than consumers in hartford conn los angeles portland ore and many other cities on the other hand many small towns still struggle with high airfares they just dont have enough traffic to generate lots of competition charleston s c had the fourth highest fares in the country based on the analysis of first quarter data the most recent available high fares have damped the tourism trade for charleston says helen hill president of the area convention and visitors bureau so the local community put together a package of incentives such as &# for marketing and lured airtran airways to begin flights to atlanta in may incumbent airlines have matched lower prices "weve seen a substantial change in the number of passengers and prices and were thrilled " said ms hill one factor common to most of the airports with cheapest prices southwest airlines service after hilo hawaii the lowest per mile costs to fly adjusted for trip length were at dallas love field chicago midway airport islip n y buffalo n y houston hobby airport burbank calif oakland and baltimore all airports served by southwest conversely the three airports with the highest prices cincinnati anchorage and san francisco lacked discounter competition in the first quarter in the san francisco market discounters generally flew from oakland across the bay instead of sfo which is a major hub of ual corp s united airlines but this year sfo is seeing prices fall with the launch of virgin america airlines plus new service to sfo by jetblue airways and southwest like san francisco cincinnati is ringed by airports with lower prices that draw customers away richard sayre has driven

getting on the cincinnati san diego non stop flight when bad weather canceled the short hop from dayton to cincinnati the sayres drove back to cincinnati and boarded the flight to san diego "because we drove to dayton and back we got a lower fare its pretty idiotic " he said delta did drop prices in cincinnati in and said it hoped to woo back customers who were driving to other airports but that effort fizzled when the carrier landed in bankruptcy reorganization and fares have shot back up compared to the same period of cincinnati prices in the first quarter of were higher on average the largest increase in the country a delta spokeswoman says the airline and its commuter units fly to destinations from cincinnati far more than the local market could sustain on its own "this gives customers there convenient and broad options for air travel and that has a bearing on prices " spokeswoman betsy talton said also noting that delta did drop leisure fares in cincinnati by about in september on of those routes "pricing is based on what the market will bear " she said the cincinnati airport says that unlike many other airports it cant offer incentives to attract new discount carriers under its lease with existing carriers i e delta "whatever we give one we have to give to all " said spokesman ted bushelman he adds that the airport would like to see lower prices but
