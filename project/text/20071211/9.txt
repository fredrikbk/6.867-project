ahead of the tape its now widely expected that the fed will also cut the discount rate which is the interest rate it charges for the overnight loans it makes directly to banks from its discount window as fed meets recent history may be portent with the federal reserve meeting today its a good time to take a short trip down memory lane to the feds last rate setting decision in mid october most investors believed the fed wouldnt be cutting its target overnight bank lending rate known as the fed funds rate when it met late october but as the month ran its course they began to see a reduction as a sure thing stocks rallied when the fed came through and lowered the fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point to they rallied some more the next day stocks fell sending the dow jones industrial average lower they kept on tumbling through much of november likewise preliminary uncertainty about whether the fed would cut its target at todays meeting has given way to near certainty that it will lower it by another quarter percentage point whats more theres a growing sense that the fed will take additional steps to try to break up a logjam in short term credit markets thats beginning to weigh on the economy its now widely expected that the fed will also cut the discount rate which is the interest rate it charges for the overnight loans it makes directly to banks from its discount window thats expected to go down by a half percentage point taking it to just a quarter point above the expected fed funds rate that could help get money flowing to the financial sector right now financial institutions try to avoid the stigma of borrowing directly from the fed it looks desperate but at it might look like good business it costs roughly to get one month money from other banks stocks have been rallying ahead of todays meeting just as they rallied ahead of the october meeting with the dow up so far this month now as then the risk for investors may not be that the fed wont come through with the actions they expect but that those actions wont be the magic wand they desire the place to look for this will be in the interbank lending market if banks are still charging each other for one month loans after all of the feds work the market could lose its footing once again then theres the economy itself which is looking increasingly unhealthy yesterday morgan stanley economist richard berner said he believes a recession is coming the tight financial conditions faced by borrowers are only part of the problem he says the odds are also rising that the rest of the world will slow which could hurt u s exports and businesses could respond to all of the uncertainty by cutting back on investment mr berners concerns are worth noting he isnt one of those bears who always predict recessions and he also tends not to swing for the fences with outlandish calls just to get attention he also happened to be one of wall streets first economists to forecast the recession the good news is that mr berner thinks the recession will be mild the bad news is that with the dow not far from its peak stocks probably arent priced for it send comments to justin lahart wsj com
