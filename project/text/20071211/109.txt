campaign trail is also turning out to be more resilient than expected drawing on decades of retail politics in new york as he works crowds with ease and vigor as his lead has narrowed in the past month mr giuliani has unleashed a blizzard of television ads in new hampshire touting his economic record in new york and his toughness on terrorism he has come out in support of a supreme court challenge to gun control laws in an effort to bolster his support among conservative republicans he has lashed out at mitt romney in a televised debate accusing him of running a "sanctuary mansion" because the lawn service mr romney used employed illegal immigrants what his supporters and opponents are wondering is whether these moves and his campaign skills will be enough to overcome the hurdles that are coming into clearer and closer view on the windswept main street of rock rapids iowa population a crowd of about people awaits mr giulianis appearance at a coffee house it is tough territory for mr giuliani because of his past support of abortion rights and other liberal issues the area is strongly pro life one of the biggest businesses in town is an evangelical publisher that specializes in home schooling mr giuliani in pinstripe suit white shirt and tie sweeps in past two girls holding a sign that reads "rudy can keep me safe " he shakes hands with the crowd then stands in the middle of the room among the tables his hands tented in front of him mr giuliani looks like the prosecutor he once was prepared to deliver the courtroom summary that sways the jury "this election is going to be a very defining election for the country " mr giuliani begins he goes through a litany of his achievements in new york crime down welfare rolls cut taxes reduced though it was his performance during that propelled him into the national spotlight mr giuliani has turned earlier than several other candidates to the economic issues that are troubling voters he never mentions his republican opponents focusing instead on the general election "if you have hillary clinton or john edwards or barack obama you will have someone who wants to raise your taxes " he says mr giuliani tells the crowd he needs their votes twice in the january caucuses and again in november in the question and answer period social issues like gay rights and abortion never come up when one man asks about the judges he would appoint mr giuliani uses the question to show how far he is tacking to the right "i will appoint judges like the ones president bush appointed they are friends of mine i worked with antonin scalia samuel alito and john roberts at various points in my career " all are justices considered likely to trim back or vote to overturn roe v wade some of the people in the room arent impressed "here in the midwest doing the right thing when others arent watching is important " says doug vanthof who runs a house warranty business "knowing some of the things about his lifestyle in new york his social life his past that hurts him " still says mr vanthof "itll be a challenge for republicans to win the election no matter who is our candidate " he looks toward the door as mr giuliani leaves "whoever we pick theres never the perfect guy " he says most candidates spend a great deal of time on the campaign trail touting their records in their home state or in the senate the bills they sponsored that cleaned up rivers or put more police on the street or raised test scores mr giuliani benefits from the millions of people who on thanksgiving christmas and summer vacations have experienced what many consider his legacy call it the tourist vote "we were up in new york in september " says jordan wakeland as she waits behind a rope to catch a glimpse of mr giuliani as he attends the final nascar race in miami "the subways were a lot cleaner it seemed safer he single handedly did it he cleaned up new york " the giuliani campaign argues that after two razor thin presidential elections masterminded by bush political strategist karl rove that were aimed at mobilizing the republican conservative base and turning them out in record numbers the party needs a new strategy that reaches out to independents and moderate voters republicans cant beat the democrats next year by conceding new york california washington oregon pennsylvania and new jersey giuliani strategists say those are all states where mr giuliani believes he can be competitive "no other candidate can reshape the electoral map " says giuliani campaign manager michael duhaime "rudy is somebody who can secure the red states and put us on offense and give us a chance in some of the blue even if the democrats hold onto california and illinois and new york they arent doing it without spending a huge amount of money and that means less money to spend on florida and ohio " the giuliani campaign hopes republicans in will be a bit like democrats in who accepted bill clinton even though he distanced himself from party orthodoxy on some issues giuliani aides bet that many republicans will accept mr giulianis history of more moderate social views because they believe he will be the strongest candidate in november and terrorism mr giulianis strongest issue is the closest thing to an ace in his partys hand in the general election supporters hope the campaign can echo the s in new york when mr giuliani ran as a tough mayor determined to fix a broken city and won election and re election although democrats outnumbered republicans to back then mr giuliani had to win over the left rather than the right but the skills he showed were the same "when he ran for re election in he carried the upper west side of manhattan which was known as moscow on the hudson " says randy mastro a longtime friend of mr giulianis and his chief of staff as mayor "what appealed to people from brooklyn and staten island and queens is also appealing in the heartland rudy speaks from the heart and gives it straight "
