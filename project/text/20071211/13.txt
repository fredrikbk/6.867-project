bargain or bailout ubs is the latest to seek financial aid in asia middle east citigroup turned to abu dhabi agreeing to pay on a &# billion convertible bond and mbia took &# billion from private equity firm warburg pincus which received warrants to buy million shares at a discounted price the singaporean investors seem to have gotten a good deal in terms of the pricing of the mandatory convertible bond according to edward tom head of equity derivatives strategy at credit suisse swiss bank ubs may have had one too many singapore slings but its shareholders are the ones who could end up with a hangover ubs became the latest financial firm to go to asia and the middle east hat in hand hoping to raise enough cash to patch the holes in its balance sheet caused by its holdings of subprime mortgages financial firms ranging from citigroup to washington mutual to bond insurer mbia have gone begging for cash in recent weeks and the terms they were willing to accept provides some sense of their relative desperation singapores government investment fund and an unnamed middle eastern investment answered the call from ubs buying up billion swiss francs &# billion of convertible bonds ubs clearly thought that wasnt enough so it will pay its dividend in stock rather than cash and will resell about billion francs in stock it had bought back that will replenish its capital base which took another hit yesterday when the bank said it would write down by &# billion the value of securities linked to u s subprime mortgages combined with write downs announced in the third quarter ubs has owned up to about &# billion in subprime losses the biggest of any bank or broker citigroup turned to abu dhabi agreeing to pay on a &# billion convertible bond and mbia took &# billion from private equity firm warburg pincus which received warrants to buy million shares at a discounted price the question for ubs did the bank need all this capital did those conservative swiss bankers panic and unnecessarily give away a chunk of the bank owned by existing shareholders these shareholders will see their ownership diluted by and in return will get a very perhaps too well capitalized bank the bank said it expects its tier ratio a measure of a banks capital to its assets adjusted for the amount of risk they carry should be about once the deals close that ratio could climb to about by the end of next year some analysts estimate banks in the u s for example must have tier capital ratios above to be considered well capitalized and large banks on average have tier ratios of about kian abouhossein a european banking analyst at j p morgan chase estimates the bank may have to take an additional billion franc write down next year to bring its marks on subprime linked securities into line with peers that would leave ubs still very well capitalized the protection against such future losses it would seem is coming out of the hide of existing shareholders "you could argue that there are two question marks over the whole transaction " says mr abouhossein who rates ubs "outperform " "first shouldnt shareholders have had a right to participate on the same terms and did you need to pay the dividend in shares " the first point has led to quiet grumbling among ubs shareholders who have complained that they too might have been willing to stump up money to purchase convertible bonds that isnt surprising the singaporean investors seem to have gotten a good deal in terms of the pricing of the mandatory convertible bond according to edward tom head of equity derivatives strategy at credit suisse yet the change in the dividend also hurts current shareholders who likely wanted the cash in hand rather than more ubs stock and it isnt clear the switch was even necessary ubs strives to keep its tier ratio above to reassure the rich individuals who keep money in its wealth management division that they are doing business with a super sound institution even with the possibility of nearly billion francs in additional write downs next year the bank would likely have stayed above that level if ubs had kept the dividend intact shareholder dilution would have dropped to about analysts estimate supporters of ubss move argue that keeping the banks clients and counterparties confident is paramount for a financial firm and argue the terms of the deal arent onerous "its a good deal no matter what " said joel j cohen chairman and co chief executive of sagent advisors "they needed the capital where are you going to get &# billion take a little dilution to make sure the thing survives when youre a financial institution you cant fool around its all about confidence youve got to replenish your capital " the convertible bond issued to the singaporean and middle eastern investors will yield and convert into of ubss stock in two years no board seats were included as part of the deal but ubs said it wouldnt rule that out other financial firms have had to give up some management control to get investments at mbia a move by warburg pincus to provide as much as &# billion in funding to the mortgage lender came on the condition that the private equity firm got two seats on the companys board at first investors seemed negative on the deal driving ubs shares down nearly but the shares later recovered and ended up more than a sign they agreed with the banks conservative stance the dilution combined with the banks continuing problems led some analysts to say there was little reason to buy into ubs now "a year ago ubs had a solid capital base was one of the strongest capital generating banks in europe was seen as one of the shrewdest risk managers in markets and had a track record for excellence and positive surprise " fox pitt kelton said in a research note yesterday "the rationale for owning ubs now is solely the private bank with the hope that there are no more negative surprises or operational difficulties to come " there may be something to the famed swiss conservatism that seems to be a hallmark of this deal despite taking the biggest subprime write downs ubss stock is only down about on the year that compares with drops of
