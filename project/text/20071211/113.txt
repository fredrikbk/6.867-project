race and the presidential race over the past two decades in books like "the content of our character " "a dream deferred" and "white guilt " no one has offered more thoughtful assessments of the persistent color divide in post civil rights america mr obama by contrast is what mr steele describes as a bargainer a black who appeals to the white majority by agreeing not to play up the nations shameful racial history in return for not having his skin color held against him a bound man by shelby steele free press pages pages &# ask a political strategist why barack obama is unlikely to become our next president and prepare to hear that he is too liberal or too inexperienced or too far behind hillary clinton in the national polls for the democratic nomination but that type of analysis is not what shelby steele serves up in his new book even though it is titled "a bound man why we are excited about obama and why he cant win " for a minute breakdown of the electoral mechanics of an obama candidacy look elsewhere what youll find in these pages is a deftly argued discourse on the racial aspects of the illinois senators presidential quest mr steele aims to explain what it says about our nation a place where a single drop of black blood once meant the difference between bondage and freedom that a man born to a white kansan and a black kenyan is now a plausible oval office candidate "is america now the kind of society that can allow a black of whatever pedigree to become the most powerful human being on earth the commander of the greatest military in history " mr steele asks "have our democratic principles at last moved us beyond even the tribalism of race and will the black american identity still so reflexively focused on victimization be nullified if a black wins the presidency of this largely white nation " mr steeles racial focus is hardly surprising he is a senior fellow at the hoover institution where he writes mostly about race and culture over the past two decades in books like "the content of our character " "a dream deferred" and "white guilt " no one has offered more thoughtful assessments of the persistent color divide in post civil rights america the honesty lucidity and independent thinking he brings to this complex subject has made him a national treasure and "a bound man " a featherweight tome with a heavyweight punch only enhances his status it is true that blacks have sought the presidency before most notably jesse jackson and al sharpton but mr steele says that they were never in any danger of being elected because of their confrontational style both insisted on dangling americas racist past in the face of white voters and while that approach endeared them to nearly all the civil rights leadership a large swath of their racial kin and a smattering of very confused white folks it ultimately limited their cross over appeal in a nation where blacks constitute just of the population blunt racial pandering could take them only so far mr obama by contrast is what mr steele describes as a bargainer a black who appeals to the white majority by agreeing not to play up the nations shameful racial history in return for not having his skin color held against him whites dont feel threatened by mr obama because he gives them the benefit of the doubt grants them a kind of innocence mr steele argues that this implicit agreement is what explains mr obamas wide mainstream acceptance and makes him our first viable black contender for the white house yet bargaining also has its limitations mr obama cant win without near unanimous support from black voters and nothing makes these voters more suspicious than a black politician who is beloved by so many white people this is what makes mr obama the "bound man" of the title "if to please blacks obama does more challenging he begins to lose his iconic status with whites his ability to flatter them with trust " mr steele writes "if to please whites obama bargains more trades more innocence to whites he loses votes among blacks a vital constituency in the democratic party who define blackness as challenging as withholding innocence from whites " dont feel too bad for mr obama however particularly since this bind is of his own making as mr steele details he has consciously cultivated a certain type of racial identity and it prevents him ironically from allowing his own experience to inform his ideas and his politics a black u s senator by way of columbia university and harvard law school is a testament to the fact that individual responsibility brings black advancement but mr obama like the black political left generally insists on painting all blacks as victims who are still relegated to the margins of society and have no recourse except racial preferences and government largess mr steeles diagnosis of mr obamas dilemma is compelling and hard to fault and given that the author himself was born to a white mother and a black father he brings unusual insight to his subject matter but ultimately "a bound man" makes a stronger argument for why mr obama shouldnt win than it does for why he cant im not persuaded that mr obamas racial bind dooms his candidacy and thats not because i want him to succeed presidential candidates are regularly put in the position of having to placate supporters who disagree among themselves sometimes quite strongly the successful ones are up to the task of bridging these divisions and to date mr obamas political career has been nothing if not successful mr riley is a member of the wall street
