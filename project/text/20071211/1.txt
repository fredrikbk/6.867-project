cash funds have grown in popularity as investors sought slightly higher yields amid historically low interest rates they achieved added returns partly by investing in complex securities backed in part by mortgages and other assets however many of these even those with high credit ratings have collapsed in price spooked by these problems investors have been fleeing enhanced cash funds "this exodus put more downward selling pressure on securities and some enhanced funds were forced to sell causing further stress " standard &amp poors credit analyst jaime gitler said in a report yesterday officials at columbia declined to identify specific holdings in the strategic cash portfolio a spokesman said the fund had exposure to troubled investments known as structured investment vehicles in line with other enhanced cash funds losses on some of the funds investments led bank of america to try to shore up the funds portfolio before it was decided to close it down according to a person familiar with the matter the decision by officials at columbia management to close columbia strategic cash portfolio came last week the fund had suffered &# billion in withdrawals since the start of the month and several large investors in the pool were seeking to redeem investments in the past investors were able to buy and sell shares of the fund at &# per share but by last week the value of the portfolio had sunk below &# per share so it was no longer possible to cash investors out at that price without inflicting losses on remaining shareholders this means says mr crane that columbia is telling the large investors that "if you want to sell something and take a loss thats up to you " the spokesman said approximately of the funds portfolio is investments carrying a rating of triple a or double a the two highest rating levels bank analyst jeff harte of sandler oneill &amp partners described closing the fund as "not that big of a deal " since it was an enhanced fund marketed to sophisticated institutional investors "if youre getting a premium yield youre taking a premium risk " said mr harte who rates bank of america a "hold " bank of america had been holding up columbia management as a bright spot in its growing wealth management division but troubles have been building within the group last month bank of america disclosed that it would provide support of up to &# million for an institutional cash fund and a similar amount to a separate group of money market funds that own troubled securities while bank of america didnt identify the affected fund at the time
