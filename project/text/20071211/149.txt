valero may sell some refineries as it hones focus bid for efficiency comes as industry faces new pressures refiners and integrated energy companies with significant operations in refining and marketing what the industry calls the downstream side of the business have had their profits crimped in the second half of this year by oil prices that soared toward &# a barrel in particular he said units that convert a greater percentage of crude oil into desirable products like gasoline and diesel are being installed allowing refiners to produce greater amounts of high value products from a given barrel of crude oil houston valero energy corp is considering an overhaul of its portfolio of refineries to prepare for a time when the once flush refinery industry faces greater pressure on its bottom line bill klesse the year old chief executive of the largest u s refiner by output has identified a group of core refineries on which it will focus its investment and attention it is considering strategic options for a refinery in aruba including a potential sale the ceo declined to specify what will happen to its other five refineries but said the company will discuss potential sales next year leaving open the possibility of deals for facilities valued at billions of dollars "some of the plants that we have in this portfolio are probably worth more to other people " mr klesse said the intent valero hopes to be a more efficient refiner in a time of high and volatile oil prices and rising global competition mr klesse said in an interview that he sees the refining business coming back from its autumn doldrums but a return to the surging profit margin growth of the past few years is unlikely he said "i wouldnt tell people that the margins are going to continue going up and up and up nothing does that " mr klesse said valero is following moves by integrated oil companies like royal dutch shell plc and conocophillips to reduce their refining capacity with the boom in refining mature if not ebbing many in the industry are focusing less on expansion and toward investing in bigger more complex facilities valeros plan reverses a growth spurt that transformed the company into the largest independent u s refiner through acquisitions of rivals as well as individual refineries valero hopes to focus on refineries mainly on the u s coasts giving them greater access to oil from more sources and that are set up to handle oil that is tougher to refine and therefore cheaper to buy focusing investment on those refineries also could help reduce downtime and improve reliability the company plans to expand its spending on capital projects to &# billion in each of the next two years from &# billion this year refiners turn crude oil into fuels like gasoline jet fuel and diesel they profited greatly during most of the four year run up in oil prices because fuel prices also rose quickly that led to fatter refining margins or the difference between the price of oil and the price of the fuels they sell valero for example reported a profit for last year of &# billion up from and three times the net income it reported in its shares which began at a split adjusted &# went as high as &# this past july valero shares shed cents to &# each in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange but refiners and integrated energy companies with significant operations in refining and marketing what the industry calls the downstream side of the business have had their profits crimped in the second half of this year by oil prices that soared toward &# a barrel refining margins were squeezed as price increases in gasoline and diesel lagged far behind those of crude among drops industrywide valeros third quarter profit fell in addition demand hasnt risen significantly this year putting a further squeeze on margins the credit crunch and resulting impact upon the housing industry has put pressure on a segment of the population making them more concerned about gasoline prices mr klesse said globally the industry faces other pressures companies in india china and the middle east are rapidly building refineries to meet surging demand adding capacity that could bring down prices global refining capacity is expected to grow a year for the next five years a significant rate of increase for a traditionally slow moving industry according to cambridge energy research associates a research firm globally the cost for building or expanding refineries is rising amid higher prices for steel equipment and labor "we expect moderating margins down toward the period " said andrew oram a new york analyst with moodys investors service capacity growth around the world will slightly outpace demand growth leading to tapering margins he said in particular he said units that convert a greater percentage of crude oil into desirable products like gasoline and diesel are being installed allowing refiners to produce greater amounts of high value products from a given barrel of crude oil valero is emphasizing its ability to pay less than sticker price for crude oil oil futures reflect the price of a high quality crude blend to be delivered in a certain month valero can procure lower quality crude at its core refineries which often has a higher sulfur content and lower viscosity at discounts of as much as &# and still produce ample amounts of oil products at plants with upgraded equipment "i would expect that in several years barring a unique acquisition were going to be a little smaller as far as top line crude processing volume " mr klesse said last year mr klesse succeeded bill greehey who cobbled valero together over years at a time when industry margins were persistently thin mr greehey who was valeros chairman until early this year bought assets on the cheap as oil product demand increased with a growing global economy capacity grew tight and margins shot up u s refining capacity has remained tight new plant construction isnt considered feasible because of environmental concerns and because incremental expansions at existing plants are barely keeping up with demand with a sudden interest in refining upgrades have become more costly and timelines for completion have dragged out further the refining sector provided poor returns for so many years that companies were reluctant to invest allowing assets to decline and their reliability to worsen valeros shift could leave it with a better portfolio of more valuable assets "our strength needs to be that we have very good very safe and reliable assets in this marketplace " mr klesse said operating hazards like fires cracked vessels and equipment malfunctions need to be a thing of the past he said valero in may sold its lima ohio refinery to canadas husky energy inc for &# billion the price amounted to &# per barrel of refining capacity at that price the five assets valero may sell could fetch a total of &# billion though the per barrel price paid for a particular refinery could vary greatly valeros ardmore okla refinery a tiny piece of valeros total system could play an important role for a smaller refiner said new york based analyst nicole decker of bear stearns "there are a lot of independent refiners out there or a lot of want to be independent refiners out there who are still in a growth mode " she said
