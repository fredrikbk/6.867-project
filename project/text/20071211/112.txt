r o i discounted funds are wall streets best buy cheap closed end funds offer dividends at a bargain eaton vance is top choice online edition it rarely makes sense to pay full price for your investments particularly when the market is up sharply one day and plunging the next if you can get or even off you get a head start and right now its easy to do closed end funds are the biggest opportunity on wall street at the moment following last months shakeout many of them are simply a steal and this is the time to move closed end funds for the uninitiated are pooled and professionally managed investment vehicles much like ordinary mutual funds the one big difference they dont issue new units to new investors or redeem the units of investors who withdraw their money instead the closed end fund company issues a fixed number of shares when it launches and those then trade on the stock market like the shares of an ordinary company that small difference leads to a big opportunity because it means the actual share price of the fund can move differently sometimes very differently from the underlying value of the funds investments and thats pretty much the case across the board right now part of it is tax loss selling towards the end of the year as investors cash in losing investments to help offset some of their profits and part of it has been the stock market shakeout bottom line closed end discounts widened by the end of november to levels seen very rarely if ever the average topped says mariana bush a wachovia analyst who is widely followed on the topic theres been a modest rally since but there are still plenty of opportunities of course there are also caveats closed end funds can trade at a discount indefinitely and those discounts can widen as well as narrow that may be less than helpful if you need to liquidate suddenly especially if trading is thin one trick is to go for well managed funds with strong dividend yields and hold them in a dividend reinvestment plan that way you get full advantage of the discount as long as it persists your dividends just buy more new shares each month an illustration the eaton vance tax advantaged dividend income fund evt a conservatively managed diversified income fund run by boston based eaton vance expenses come in about a year this fund has traded at a discount to its net assets for nearly all of its four year existence so dont buy it expecting a snap back instead buy it because it can make you good money despite the discount our chart shows just how well youd have done if you held on

is in financials &lt ndash&gt where the dividends are big today but could be gone tomorrow as the sector get clobbered by losses from its subprime mortgage related lending yet the same weighting issue is true for many income funds and of course the financials have already been beaten up a lot more risk is in the price than a few months ago fund co manager judy saryan also explains that a good chunk of these financial holdings are in preferred stocks those conservative securities that have a lot in common with bonds preferreds are more stable than regular shares their dividends get paid first and in the event of a liquidation the owners get their money back before the common stock holders see a penny and while you get the fund at a discount saryans taking advantage of the market shakeout to find other bargains "were finding very good opportunity for dividend yields " she says "telecoms are particularly attractive " shes also buying some international utilities and some insurance companies the fund uses gearing to increase returns it borrows just over a quarter of its assets at short term rates in theory that does mean yields could be vulnerable to a spike in interest rates however this fund has managed to increase its payouts six times since it was launched even while short term rates rose all the way through and last i looked short term rates were heading back down again the fed rate cuts are actually a direct boost to many closed end funds evt is a great fund to tuck away in a portfolio knowing you are automatically getting extra yield a year thanks to the
