global economy youth wave tests mideast at creating jobs to avoid losing ground against unemployment nations try diversifying challenging attitudes to counter this trend the countrys army and ministry of labor have joined forces with the private sector in an initiative that provides young jordanians with incentives including cash and training to pursue careers in construction cairo egypt thanks to an oil fueled boom the middle east long plagued by high unemployment is generating lots of new jobs but a key test will be whether it can expand its work force fast enough to keep up with a demographic bulge of young job seekers between and overall unemployment rates in the middle east and north africa fell to an average from according to the world bank but a surge in population growth in the s and s means the region faces a tidal wave of young people who are entering the job market for those between the ages of and years old unemployment in the region stands at or above according to the middle east youth initiative an international research project that is nearly twice the world average of and a world bank report published this year estimates the region will need to create million jobs over the next years just to keep unemployment rates stable another worry many newly created jobs are low paying or in relatively low productivity sectors like construction and agriculture not the kind of employment that is likely to lift large segments of the population out of poverty the stakes arent just economic amid a tilt toward social and religious conservatism in parts of the middle east some extremist groups are swelling their ranks by tapping into the sense of alienation among economically frustrated youths "it tends to be more educated and young people who are having trouble finding jobs " says marcus noland senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington in egypt for example the unemployment rate among those with a secondary education was in much higher than the among those with less education but somewhat less than the among those with higher education according to the world bank "having a society in which large numbers of educated young people are unemployed and disaffected is a very combustible situation " mr noland says though the regions economy is enjoying its strongest expansion in a generation gross domestic product in the middle east and north africa expanded an estimated last year much of that growth has been more concentrated in the oil rich persian gulf job gains in the region also have been uneven jobless rates have fallen in eight of countries in the region studied by the world bank but employment has stagnated in jordan and joblessness has risen in kuwait and the united arab emirates as many of the jobs created by the oil boom have gone to foreigners part of the difficulty stems from the relatively isolated nature of the regions economies despite some headline grabbing forays abroad like the abu dhabi investment authoritys recent acquisition of a major stake in citigroup inc for &# billion economists say countries in the middle east have had trouble integrating their economies with the rest of the world "this is an area of the world that hasnt really integrated and used the global economy as a springboard for growth " says leslie lipschitz director of the international monetary fund institute a training arm of the imf many nonoil producing countries have launched efforts to liberalize and diversify their economies and that has attracted capital including from persian gulf investors who are scouting for opportunities closer to home but economists say the region needs to develop and expand labor intensive export oriented businesses and step up overhauls to attract more foreign investments to projects that can bring in new skills and technologies some countries in the region are grappling with a mismatch between their job markets and the aspirations of their citizens generally higher levels of education have led some middle easterners to shun menial jobs but many still lack the kind of high end skills required by the booming private sector like proficiency in a foreign language or the specialized training needed for financial services or information technology jobs in jordan where the unemployment rate hovers at most new jobs in the past five years have gone to foreign workers according to the world bank foreigners dominate the nations fast growing construction and manufacturing sectors partly because many jordanians want jobs with higher pay or more cachet some jordanians hold out for what they view as better jobs in the public sector to counter this trend the countrys army and ministry of labor have joined forces with the private sector in an initiative that provides young jordanians with incentives including cash and training to pursue careers in construction the countrys labor minister credits the involvement of the army which jordanians consider one of their most prestigious institutions with helping attract young people to the program who might otherwise spurn construction jobs despite saudi arabias oil wealth official unemployment among saudi citizens stands at though some economists believe the figure could be twice as high the country the worlds no oil exporter is bent on economic diversification and is building a number of "economic cities" to attract foreign investment and create jobs for saudis saudi arabia has emerged as "a magnet for businesses " says brad bourland chief economist at jadwa investment in riyadh but it also suffers from shortages of skilled job candidates "the number of saudi candidates who have educational credentials in finance economics and accounting are just not enough for the jobs that are available " mr bourland says in egypt the arab worlds most populous country the government has started a campaign to attract international business and high skills jobs it has ambitions to become a regional outsourcing hub but government officials are also pushing vocational training like welding and manufacturing they also urge egyptians not to hold out for the perfect job "its good to get an education and a college degree but that doesnt mean i say i will only take an office job " egyptian prime minister ahmed nazif said during a recent conference of the countrys ruling party "the job markets need people to work in factories hotels construction and many other fields "
