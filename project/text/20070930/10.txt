small business retirement plans to match your needs its tempting to think the growing value of your business will bankroll your retirement but dont count on it small business owners should also build up savings in retirement accounts that will protect you if the firm doesnt become the pot of gold youre expecting or if you cant sell the business when you need to whats more stashing away money in a retirement account can reduce tax bills right now and thats something most small business owners arent going to complain about but the alphanumeric soup of retirement plans available to small businesses can make choosing the right one a chore heres some help deciphering the options a simplified employee pension individual retirement account better known as a sep ira allows a business to make a tax deductible contribution of up to &# for the owner for capped at of income sounds great right it certainly can be and seps are relatively easy and cheap to administer but heres the snag employees whove worked at the business more than three years are entitled to have the same percentage of their incomes contributed by the business which could mean then shelling out a lot of money to fund employees retirement accounts "once you have employees whove been with you for four years or longer and youre putting away of your pay youre not going to want to put away for your employees as well " says jacob gold a financial planner in phoenix for this reason sep iras are generally best suited for one person businesses particularly those with net incomes between &# and &# a year mr gold says businesses with employees whove been around fewer than three years might fund a sep ira until those employee tenures start hitting four years he suggests one person firms should compare the sep ira with a solo k while the contribution limits are very similar to those of seps you can sometimes contribute more to a solo k and a k lets you take out a loan something a sep wont allow a business owner earning less than &# a year might want to opt for a so called simple ira a simple ira lets a business owner contribute up to &# annually capped at of income with a &# catch up contribution for people and older and because a business owner can contribute all of his or her income someone making less than &# annually can contribute more to a simple ira than to a sep ira because of the seps of income contribution cap the rules for simple iras are also more lenient than those for sep iras when it comes to employees unlike a sep employees can contribute their own money to an employer sponsored simple ira the business usually must either provide a dollar for dollar matching contribution on at least of all employee contributions to the simple ira or automatically contribute of employees salaries businesses with more than a handful of employees should be looking at a standard k plan though its more expensive to administer costing anywhere from &# to several thousand a year it gives employers more discretion over how much they contribute to employees accounts and unlike with sep iras employees can also put money in a traditional k lets all employees contribute up to &# for with a &# catch up contribution for people age and over there are some risks though that the k plan will not meet government regulations if the owners or high paid employees are contributing a large portion of their salaries and employees arent so its usually suggested that a business owner contribute at least of each employees compensation each year to avoid a problem mr gold adds another advantage to k s is you have the option of setting up a roth plan like roth iras which let you contribute after tax money congress now allows after tax money to be contributed to roth k s and unlike the ira counterparts there are no income restrictions on who can contribute to a roth k defined benefit plans or pensions are about as passe as you can get when it comes to retirement savings vehicles and they require a hefty amount of paperwork and money to administer yet there are some specific situations in which such a plan might still be useful the reason defined benefit plans let businesses make a tax deductible contribution of up to &# a person in depending on your age years until retirement and income a defined benefit plan only really makes sense now for a self employed business owner or partners who each earn six or seven figure salaries and want a retirement plan where the business might be able to contribute more than the &# typically allowed by sep iras and solo k s a doctors office or other professional practice might be an ideal candidate for such a plan says bill fleming managing director of the pricewaterhousecoopers office in hartford conn but beware he says the plans are quite restrictive and can be "a nightmare to end " you must commit to contributing for at least five years and how much you contribute is at the mercy of annual actuarial calculations that determine the amount needed to reach your promised payout in retirement "the problem is you have to put money in even if youre not making any money " adds mr fleming kelly spors covers small business
