eyes on the road the good news and bad news on u s fuel economy trends what will it take for americans to give up speed power and size online edition looking for some bedtime reading i have one for you "light duty automotive technology and fuel economy trends " j k rowling michael crichton and elizabeth gilbert have nothing to fear this annual environmental protection agency survey of the state of automotive technology and energy efficiency was published last week just as the united auto workers and general motors corp were battling toward their historic new labor agreement i caught up with it on about four hours of sleep i dont like warm milk and was grateful for the effective substitute still when congress returns to the subject of climate change energy security and automotive fuel efficiency reading this document prepared by the automotive technology experts at the epa will make you a smarter judge of the preaching and posturing to come bear with the dry prose and you will get a fascinating study of americas character we really are the bigger is better nation we are in love with speed size and power its not just a hollywood or madison avenue image our cars give us away compared with the average weight of the vehicle we drive has risen by pounds or the average time it takes for a vehicle to go from zero to miles per hour time has dropped to seconds the fastest since the epa started compiling this data in our average car or truck has horsepower and the most horsepower per pound on record there is some good news the year decline in the average fuel efficiency of americas new car fleet that began in appears to have stopped the epa forecasts that the average fuel economy of model cars and trucks will be miles per gallon the same as and slightly better than mpg measured for that would make three straight years when the new vehicle fleets fuel economy was no worse or slightly better than it was in using one epa measurement "ton miles per gallon " or the miles per gallon multiplied by the weight of the car vehicles are the most efficient on record this is a laudable achievement by the industry for which it will get little credit the average fuel efficiency of light trucks has increased by one mile per gallon since a shift that coincides with higher gas prices a turn away from heavy truck frame sport utility vehicles and sorry auto industry friends an increase in the federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standard to mpg in from mpg in why sympathy for the car industry folks because they dont want congress to get the idea that raising the cafe mileage standards is the only way to get them to produce more efficient vehicles unfortunately for them this report strongly implies thats the case the coming energy debate will be portrayed as greens vs "detroit " but in this case "detroit" is just about all the major car makers since only one major automotive group in the u s has increased its overall average fuel economy toyota and not by much all the big auto makers are down compared with true the detroit three have the lowest average fuel economy scores among the eight major automotive groups honda motor co is the overall best daimlerchrysler now chrysler llc is the worst my favorite part of this report is toward the end where the epa experts imagine what the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet would be if cars and trucks had stayed the same weight and size as in or in cars had the lowest average weight and horsepower while in the car fleet achieved its highest laboratory fuel economy recalculated that way if cars were as light on average as cars our national average car fuel economy according to the unadjusted epa lab figures would be better than current reality if model trucks were the same weight as the average for their fuel efficiency rating would be better who brought this about look in the mirror we bought cars and trucks that were safer and more luxurious and more powerful that tended to make them heavier which in turn increased our demand for power "all other factors being equal higher vehicle weight which supports new options and features and faster acceleration performance e g lower to mile per hour acceleration time both decrease a vehicles fuel economy " the epa authors write until about two years ago most of us werent that concerned regular readers will note that i drive a subaru impreza wrx which was rated when i bought it in the pre &# gas era at horsepower and has a curb weight of pounds that puts its horsepower weight ratio at about compared with the epa average of my stick shift cars epa rated mileage is mpg city mpg highway and thats with premium gas which these days i feed to my car on the same days i have caviar for lunch i could have bought a second hand toyota corolla or ford focus or even for that matter a chevy impala to get better highway mileage than my turbocharged street legal rally car the much larger impalas city mileage rating is only mpg worse than my car there was no one with a gun forcing me to buy a twitchy turbocharged all wheel drive japanese sedan i did it voluntarily with full knowledge that the only justification for my choice is my compulsion to rage against the constraints of middle age the question is what will persuade me and my countrymen and women to make different choices in the future michigan u s rep john dingell a long time friend of the auto industry recently proposed a bill that would raise the tax on gasoline but not diesel fuel by cents put a &# a ton tax on carbon and eliminate the mortgage interest deduction for mcmansions larger than square feet mr dingells bill cuts a wide swath in part because cars and trucks contribute of all u s carbon dioxide emissions according to the epa mr dingell calls attention to the other its pretty likely this bill will go nowhere but mr dingell already has made his point if you want people to change their behavior you have to make it worth their while or knock them on the head or both preaching alone wont do it send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
