love &amp money how homework is hurting our family i hate school yes i know thats a bit immature for someone years old but its true i hate school so much so that my wife amy and i have hired a college student to help our fifth grade son manage his schoolwork a few times a week its not that we cant do the work with him or that we dont want to just this evening we helped him study for a reading test and over the weekend i was quizzing him on customary and metric units of measurement one day and biological definitions the next no its that the volume of homework and tests that fill his docket is in a word ridiculous im not sure when it happened but at some point u s schools decided that if you cant teach em test em or pile on more homework the result is that my sons life and by extension our family life is a constant stress laden stream of homework and tests and projects it overshadows everything we do always hanging over our head it affects our weekends our meals our vacations our work time our playtime our pocketbooks and to what end maybe im missing something but when did schools determine that the best place for kids to learn math science and english is at their own kitchen table obviously learning is what school is about i have nothing against homework or school projects or a certain level of anxiety about it all how a student deals with those demands and that anxiety is great preparation for later life i hate school yes i know thats a bit immature for someone years old but its true i hate school so much so that my wife amy and i have hired a college student to help our fifth grade son manage his schoolwork a few times a week but the level of homework and anxiety my son deals with on a daily basis is well beyond anything healthy and from talking to other parents this problem is hardly unique to our family amy and i knew there was a problem several weeks ago when our son brought home a d and a c this was the first time that he earned anything less than a b and then a week later another d at first we were mad hes just not paying attention to the questions hes rushing through the tests hes being careless we quizzed him before the test and again afterward how is it that he can know the information before and after yet not during it turns out hes stressed out he told amy that he wishes he could do better but he already wakes up on school days between a m and a m panicked that he doesnt know the material he has already studied he wakes up amy to help him go over his notes one more time he studies in the car on the way to school some nights hes up past p m writing reading or memorizing he spends parts of many weekends reading and doing projects then he sees the ds and cs and gets dejected wondering how he could possibly study any harder or any longer the truth is he cant his childhood is already all but consumed by textbooks notebooks and flashcards compounding the problem as amy says is that this barrage of schoolwork "is killing our family " amy says it makes her "feel like the worst mom in the world " heres why many times our efforts to help our son lead to short tempers and blown fuses because at some point he simply has had enough of all this studying he just wants to be outside on a saturday but hes stuck inside on a project or reciting the synonyms and antonyms to justify villain and abandon one of amys colleagues calls it the bermuda triangle because first the child gets mad then the parent helping gets mad and then the parent listening to the meltdown gets mad our four year old daughter gets caught up in this bermuda triangle as well of course besides getting less focused attention from mom and dad she picks up on all the angst after a recent homework meltdown she went up to her brother and said "all you have to do is do your homework and mommy wont be mad " then theres the effect on our jobs im not saying work takes precedence over our sons education but lets be realistic at some point the ability of mom and dad to keep the family clothed sheltered and fed is relatively high on the things to do today list when im cutting interviews short to make a practice quiz or amys going to work late or rising at a m to help him prepare for a test somethings rotten with the system perhaps the worst part is that many parents weve talked to are angry because they face the same issue some have felt compelled to put their elementary age kids on medication for anxiety to cope with the stress of so much schoolwork how insane that because of an overabundance of studying prescribed as a way to prepare students for standardized tests that theoretically prove the schools are doing their jobs kids are popping pills to keep jangled nerves in check amy and i continue to help our fifth grader nightly he knows the material but he continues to awaken early worried about doing poorly he continues to get burned out by the volume of homework hes responsible for and the family continues to creak under the weight of all the stress beyond hiring someone to help our son and in effect us amy is meeting with our sons teachers to determine if theres anything else we can do to help him manage his load something we hope
