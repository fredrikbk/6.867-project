stock up on staples for a slowdown the housing market is shaky oil prices are soaring and economic growth is slowing time to shun all consumer stocks not necessarily while stocks have risen in recent weeks this is clearly an uncertain time for shares of companies whose sales and profit depend on the willingness of u s consumers to keep spending freely indeed last week discount retailer target tgt and home improvement retailer lowes low announced they are facing softer than expected sales and their shares tumbled also last week the conference board said its consumer confidence index fell to its lowest mark since late but so called consumer staples or the stocks of companies that make mundane everyday items like garbage bags diapers and soda can be a safe haven as the economy slows consumers after all will buy trash bags and drink their coke come boom or recession investors may want at least some exposure to this defensive sector which can offer stability at a time when financial markets are choppy and the u s economic outlook uncertain the stocks are attractive "because of their ability to grow earnings regardless of the overall strength of the economy " says daniel morgan a portfolio manager at synovus securities in atlanta even if the economy slows sharply "people are still going to have to go out and buy consumer staples goods the day to day stuff you buy when you are grocery shopping " according to standard &amp poors the consumer staples sector has risen so far this year ahead of the gain for the broad standard &amp poors stock index since midyear as concerns about the subprime mortgage market and the economy came to the forefront the consumer staples sector has gained while the s&amp p has risen mr morgan says his firm has an "overweight" position in consumer staples stocks in part because these companies usually have strong cash flows and pay good dividends among the stocks synovus owns tide and pampers maker procter &amp gamble pg soda company pepsico pep and tobacco giant altria mo procter shares are up for the year pepsi has added and altria has risen goldman sachs analysts recently said they expect the consumer staples group to do well over the next several months due to slowing gdp growth healthy fundamentals for companies in the sector and reasonable valuations for the stocks staples have historically been the best performing sector in the market when gdp growth surprised on the downside the goldman analysts said among goldmans top picks in the consumer space are direct seller avon products avp and beer producer molson coors brewing tap goldman also recently raised its rating on the beverage sector a subset of the consumer staples universe to "attractive" from "neutral " beverage stocks have done well this year with coca cola ko up and molson coors adding analysts however have mixed views on food companies that make products like cereal cookies and sliced cheese these companies tend to see steady demand for their products even when the economy weakens but at the moment high prices for commodities like wheat and grain are creating a headwind for the food sector kelloggs k stock has done well this year gaining as the company has been able to offset some of its commodity costs by raising prices for its cereals but investors and analysts are more cautious on kraft kft which is down for the year as it goes through an internal restructuring in an effort to revive several flagging brands another plus for some consumer stocks large consumer staples companies tend to do a lot of business abroad and could benefit from international growth even if the u s economy slows says bruce bittles chief investment strategist at robert w baird soft drink companies makers of personal care products like razors and sellers of household products like soap tend to benefit from global growth he says analysts are far more cautious on so called consumer discretionary stocks like those of department stores and apparel retailers which could be worse hit as consumers cut down on non mandatory purchases "the consumer is going to be squeezed not only by higher energy costs but also by higher food prices and falling home values " says mr bittles while the federal reserves recent interest rate cut is good news for many consumers mr bittles doesnt believe its enough "to stabilize consumer demand at this point " the consumer discretionary sector is down for the year and has lost over the last three months according to standard &amp poors shares of mid tier department stores like sears shld down for the year and kohls kss down reflect worries that middle and low income consumers will be worst hit in the economic slowdown home depot hd which is directly exposed to the housing market has seen its shares tumble but "consumer spending at the upper end has been very strong " notes edward jones analyst stephanie hoff she has a "buy" rating on tiffany tif which is up for this year high end retailers like tiffany and coach coh are benefiting from strong demand from affluent u s consumers and also because a weaker dollar has attracted more shoppers from other countries email forum sunday wsj com
