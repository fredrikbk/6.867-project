creating your own wiki web site program simplifies steps for entries nothing is private wikipedia com the encyclopedia web site created and operated with contributions from online users around the world is a resourceful tool though accuracy isnt guaranteed it reflects a collection of knowledge contributed and edited by many users a "wiki" is a web site or similar online resource that allows anyone to add and edit content collectively but while the idea behind wikipedia com and other collaborative sites is a good one the process of contributing content can be intimidating for nontechies instead many people opt to publish their writing and digital media on personal blogs or web sites yet these dont do much to encourage online communities and interaction this week i tested a free program from wetpaint com inc that helps regular users create wikis which encourage interaction because theyre constantly changed by contributors wetpaints wikis ease the process of adding web links digital images digital videos and additional text to sites made with wetpaint likewise your site can easily be adjusted and enhanced by anyone who views it compared with blogs or normal web sites my wetpaint wiki felt much more alive and exciting wetpaint has room for improvement nothing created on its site can be kept private from random viewers some of its functions like adding content at the same time as someone else can be a bit confusing and it has advertisements because its free but these arent overly intrusive the seattle based company has plans for upgrades including introducing more privacy options this summer but most of its features are overwhelmingly simple to use and built in tutorial videos demonstrate steps in less than five minutes my own wiki a site devoted to discussing television programs compiling digital photos and video clips from shows all of which could be added to or deleted by anyone at any time was up and running i noticed other wetpaint wikis for organizing sports teams assisting with dog rescues and discussing favorite books setup was divided into three steps playfully termed the easy part the fun part and the other part i named my wiki and its url and considered the options for who i wanted to contribute to it everyone even anonymously anyone with a wetpaint com account or only those whom i invited i chose to allow everyones contributions in order to get the full feel of a wiki twenty four style templates provide a starting point for the color and overall look i invited others to see my site so that they too could contribute their ruminations when inviting others you must designate how much authority youll give each invitee whoever creates the wiki is an administrator with the ability to change everything including the template and permission settings you can give others the same ranking or you might opt to make them moderators letting them move and delete pages but not change settings the least amount of power is given to registered users they cant move or delete pages but they like everyone else can still delete change or add content on each page by default every change made to the site is tracked in detail letting everyone see which page was altered and by whom the time and date of the change and the scope of each adjustment special views can compare how a page looked before and after changes so you know whether you liked the way you had it or the new version these details are important in the world of wikis where changes can be slight frequent and barely noticeable the home page of your wiki allows space for explaining what youd like to do i used mine to say how much i like chatting about recent tv show episodes and encouraged others to contribute anything relevant to the discussion including write in opinions photos of show characters and clips from favorite scenes each page has a section for navigation in the top left showing which page is currently in view and how it relates to home as a subcategory of home or a subcategory within a category and so on a toolbox on the far right offers one click help for editing adding attachments inviting others and emailing a page at the top of each page an easy edit tool can be expanded to help you add digital photos from your pc or from specific urls hyperlinks or short video clips from sites like youtube com i never saw any confusing jargon while adding content to my wiki i just followed suggested links searched for the right content online or on my computer and pasted that information into the right spot within a few hours the friends i invited to my wiki caught on and added content to my pages or created pages of their own to be listed under my wiki in addition to my pages for "greys anatomy " "the amazing race" and "friday night lights " others added pages for "american idol" and "battlestar galactica " i even got into a fun back and forth battle with a friend as he and i each posted pictures of our favorite doctors on "greys anatomy " each of us had the ability to delete the others posting or to add our own i ran into some trouble when i tried to save a post and was told that someone else was simultaneously changing content on the same page i chose to manually merge my content with the other persons content but couldnt figure out how to do so and lost my entire post this problem isnt likely to crop up often but its worth noting when i had questions about other sections a help section walked me through the wiki building steps i also watched how to videos that demonstrated the way certain aspects of wetpaint worked if youre tired of reading blogs that only let you post comments in an obscure section of the page the interactive community aspect of wetpaints wikis will appeal to you just be sure youre aware that until later this summer nothing on your wiki can be made private mossbergsolution wsj com
