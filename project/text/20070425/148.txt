tax report pressure mounts to crack down on those not filing tax returns if you ignored last weeks filing deadline you have lots of company but if you also happen to owe money then you may be asking for trouble the internal revenue service faces growing pressure from congress to do a better job of nabbing those who should be filing tax returns but havent among lawmakers leaning hard on the irs to improve tax collections is senate finance committee chairman max baucus a montana democrat "those who owe the irs a tax return but fail to file are doing more than just breaking the law " sen baucus says "theyre draining our economy of vital resources that we need to pay for health care education and even tax relief " president bush also is calling for tougher action in his budget earlier this year the president proposed stiffer financial penalties and longer prison sentences for many offenders who havent filed and owe money if enacted these changes would be effective for returns required to be filed on or after jan next year under the presidents plan an individual who willfully fails to file tax returns in any three years within a five consecutive year period would be subject to a new criminal penalty if the total tax liability is at least &# the treasury department says the presidents proposal would classify such a failure as a felony if convicted an individual could face a fine of as much as &# imprisonment for as much as five years or both if this proposal becomes law "it will raise the stakes considerably for those charged with failure to file particularly for professionals such as lawyers and accountants who have their licenses at stake " says mark matthews a former deputy irs commissioner who now is a lawyer at morgan lewis &amp bockius in washington sen baucus and others are especially concerned about the subject because the irs has estimated the nations tax gap the difference between whats owed to the government and whats collected stands at about &# billion for the tax year the biggest part of the estimated gap comes from underreporting of tax owed by people who do file returns says eric toder former director of the office of research at the irs and now a senior fellow at the urban institute in washington but the irs also has estimated that nonfilers of individual income tax returns cost the treasury department about &# billion a year says bruce friedland an irs spokesman why do so many people fail to file one explanation is a severe personal crisis such as an illness or a divorce or a financial crisis some people dont file because they claim theres no law requiring them to pay federal income tax or that filing a return somehow is voluntary or that their wages somehow arent taxable courts have routinely rejected these and other arguments a law enacted last year authorizes the irs to impose penalties of as much as &# for "frivolous" returns up from &# previously here are a few suggestions to consider for those who havent filed and should have above all the key lesson for nonfilers is to take action "before the government knocks on their door " warns charles rettig a lawyer at hochman salkin rettig toscher &amp perez pc in beverly hills calif "the situation is drastically different once the government is involved " also when you do file be sure to come clean "it would be unwise to file a delinquent return that is less than accurate " mr rettig says "that would only serve to compound a possible misdemeanor failure to file situation into a felony tax evasion situation " if you havent filed and cant pay what you owe consider filing anyway and try to arrange some kind of payment plan if you have no hope of ever paying your tax debts consider filing an "offer in compromise " which means asking the irs to accept less than you owe see irs gov for details on how to apply sometimes the irs agrees to compromise with people who can demonstrate they genuinely cant pay what they owe getting the irs to agree to such an offer typically is extremely difficult and takes a long time but irs officials have said they have taken steps to improve the program curiously many people who dont file for years may be eligible for a refund naturally theres no penalty for failing to file if youre entitled to a refund but just dont make the mistake of assuming you have an unlimited amount of time to file for that refund if you are due a refund but didnt file a return you generally have to file within three years of the date the return was due including extensions otherwise that money becomes the property of the u s government tomorrow is the tax filing deadline for many storm victims taxpayers affected by the major storm that slammed the northeast early last week have until the end of tomorrow to file federal returns the irs didnt provide a list of affected states because of "the widespread nature of the storm and transportation issues that could affect people located outside the northeastern corridor " this applies to calendar year federal individual income tax returns whether filed electronically or on paper it also applies to requests for six month tax filing extensions the irs said briefs president and mrs bush filed a joint return for reporting charitable donations of &# tax analysts a nonprofit group that publishes tax notes a highly regarded weekly has posted the bush and cheney
