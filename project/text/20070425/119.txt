politics &amp economics china moves to boost transparency but much is kept hidden new chinese regulations to increase government transparency could improve access to information and help central authorities curb local corruption but they stop short of shining a light on matters china considers sensitive the regulations on open government information require that local and national government bodies make information public through web sites news conferences and other means that information sporadically available now will include administrative rulings financial accounting compensation for land use and investigations into environmental and public health issues the rules are part of a broader effort to make the communist party led government seem more responsive to public concerns the effort got a boost in the aftermath of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome when local governments didnt share information about the disease and reporters were largely forbidden to write about it exacerbating the outbreak since then a number of embarrassing events have spurred public protest including a major government corruption scandal last year in shanghai the flagrant pollution of rivers and the illegal seizure of farmland for development china also has been seeking to demonstrate openness in advance of the olympic games in beijing which begin in august next year access to information is important in "establishing a sound system of preventing and punishing corruption " said zhang qiong vice minister of the legislative affairs office of chinas state council or cabinet but the rules scheduled to take effect may might do more to strengthen beijings sway over its bureaucracy than to crack open a secretive government culture they underscore that some information will remain off limits if it harms "state security public safety normal economic operations and social stability " mr zhang didnt specify what kinds of information would be considered too "sensitive" to disclose but said that the rules establish a "screening system" for protecting certain information last year the government began to consider a law that would have punished journalists who published information about emergencies without permission the new regulations stipulate that the government must share information on emergency contingency plans warnings and management the rules arent likely to make it much easier for chinese journalists to push the envelope on coverage because they are still subject to the orders of the communist partys propaganda department the regulations make no specific mention of journalists rights to gather and publicize information still the regulations could serve as the legal foundation for some news gathering activities in china "journalists rights dont need to be singled out they dont have more rights than citizens " said pu zhiqiang a prominent media lawyer "we have to take things step by step and this regulation will make a difference " mr zhang the vice minister said the regulations for ordinary citizens also covered journalists "the government needs to disclose information accurately and in time this serves the purposes of the media as well both of them are trying to deliver information fast and accurately " he said under the regulations bureaucracies will also have to establish systems through which citizens can request information that isnt already available they should receive an answer within days if a citizens request for information isnt granted he or she has the right to challenge the decision through administrative action though not in a civil or criminal lawsuit
