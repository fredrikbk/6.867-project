gm slips into toyotas rearview mirror japanese firm passes u s rival for first time in quarterly global sales the auto industry has a new no toyota motor corp now it faces the considerable challenges inherent in just being big the japanese auto maker surpassed detroit competitor general motors corp in quarterly world wide sales for the first time underscoring the profound shift that has occurred in the global auto industry once dominated by detroits big three surpassing gm albeit for one quarter caps a remarkable surge by japans no auto maker by output which had a little more than half gms world wide sales volume a dozen years ago toyota has had bigger manufacturing quality recalls in the u s its engineering staffs are straining to keep pace with a growing array of vehicles and it has become a target for criticism by some environmental groups moreover the battle for dominance in the world auto market going forward will shift away from the u s market where toyota benefited for years from a legacy of mistakes by detroits auto makers to emerging markets such as china and india where energetic local auto makers are learning how to compete by reading toyotas playbook gm has become a more muscular competitor in those markets particularly china and sees future expansion there it continues to face threats in the u s yesterday it told united auto workers negotiators that it put plans to roll out the successor to the chevrolet cobalt in on hold putting a question mark on part of its plan to tap the growing popularity of small cars in the u s gms sales in china rose to units last year and the company plans to launch new or upgraded models this year in the u s where toyota holds about of the market so far this year there are signs the japanese auto maker is becoming more cautious about the prospects for growth the company is trying to achieve a operating profit margin globally in the medium to long term an objective president katsuaki watanabe laid out last year toyota is pursuing a pricing strategy that as one senior executive puts it aims to squeeze out as much profit as possible from its product lineup one of toyotas most important new models the big tundra pickup truck has gotten off to a slow start despite large discounts masaki taketani a senior analyst at csm worldwide said toyota is facing a risk of falling short of meeting a relatively modest goal it set to sell tundras in the u s this year toyota has cited the competitive nature of the u s pickup market toyota has announced plans to build a u s plant in mississippi capable of producing vehicles initially toyota highlander sport utility vehicles starting in at one point however toyota had been considering a plant that would open a year earlier and build one third more vehicles mr watanabe said he is concerned about rising manufacturing costs in the u s a main reason toyota picked tupelo miss as a site for what will be an eighth north american assembly plant was the relatively lower wages the area offered he said in tupelo last week another concern he added is the relative inflexibility of assembly plants in north america while some plants in japan are capable of producing more than a half dozen different models on the same line most u s plants can produce a single model and its closely associated sister vehicles "its not an immediate risk but we need to drive down cost and pump more flexibility into our plants here " mr watanabe said toyota decided last year to delay introductions of some models by as much as half a year to slow the pace of product development so engineers could conduct more quality checks such as building prototypes mr watanabe in an interview last year said his engineers in some cases may have rushed products skipping checks and relying too much on computer simulations to assure quality he said toyota was ready to hire engineers globally in part to help conduct more of the quality checks and produce more prototypes gary convis a senior toyota north american manufacturing executive insists toyota vehicle quality in north america is staging a comeback toyotas overall defects per vehicles a quality measure toyota and many other auto makers use is down from mr convis says for gm toyotas sales coup could potentially be a plus as chairman and chief executive officer rick wagoner tries to accelerate cost cutting and improve north american profitability gm is on track to slash fixed costs this year by &# billion compared with but analysts say gm needs to cut nearly as much again for more than a year gm has pursued a strategy of cutting capacity and forgoing low profit sales to u s rental fleets effectively acknowledging that it was paying too a high price to be no "its better to sell four million vehicles at &# profit each than five million at no profit " gm vice chairman bob lutz said this year "we welcome the competition and the rivalry with our competitors but were not going to let that distract us from building the best cars and trucks that we can for our customers said john mcdonald a gm spokesman "its just not about whos no or whos leading " he added "we need to be a strong competitor " analysts say toyota has purposely been playing down its ascent to no in order to avoid a political backlash in the u s yesterday toyota said it doesnt comment on other auto makers sales "our only objective is to be no in terms of quality well let the numbers speak for themselves " a spokesman said world wide toyota sold million vehicles in the january to march period topping the million vehicles gm sold in the same period gm has been the worlds no auto maker for more than years analysts say it is just a matter of time before the japanese auto maker surpasses gm in its annual figures much of toyotas expansion in the u s during the past years has been driven by increasing north american production toyota has six assembly plants in north america with a total production capacity of million vehicles a year and it expects output to rise to million by as new plants come on line at toyotas launch of its tundra pickup produced at its plant in san antonio american toyota executives stressed that the pickup is "made in texas by texans for texans " john d stoll contributed to this article
