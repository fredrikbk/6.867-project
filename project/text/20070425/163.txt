is hardly golfing nirvana a small country roughly the size of indiana its mountainous terrain leaves room for only golf courses indiana has with green fees averaging over &# per round most players in south korea are politicians and businessmen out on the company dime men outnumber women on koreas courses by almost to yet in the past decade korean women have come to dominate the worlds top womens golf tour the u s ladies professional golf association or lpga in there were no koreans in the lpga now of the lpgas latest class of rookies first time tour players who have survived the sports competitive winnowing process hail from south korea and among the women golfers in the elite category who are automatically qualified to play in each lpga tournament almost a quarter are korean for the past few years south koreas media have offered many explanations for the phenomenon while some have attributed korean ladies golfing prowess to the thinness of korean chopsticks more have focused on a golfer named se ri pak south koreas answer to tiger woods nine years ago ms pak shocked the golf world by winning four tournaments as a lpga rookie some have since estimated her career earnings including sponsorships at over &# million ms paks success inspired thousands of korean girls to hit the greens and driving ranges one young woman inspired by ms pak is jin joo hong in even though she had only played golf casually for four years ms hong then and her father moved miles from seoul to daejeon where the golf star grew up ms hongs goal was to work with the same coaches and play on the same courses as ms pak did "koreans are persistent and determined " says ms hong now a year old playing her rookie season on the lpga today competition among girl golfers is so intense parents routinely pull their daughters out of school as early as the sixth grade to concentrate on the sport course and coaching fees typically amount to several thousand dollars a month some parents admit its too much but say theyre on a treadmill thats hard to get off "the girls have missed so many classes they cannot catch up " says kim jeong ho whose year old daughter hye yun has been playing for years "you just say ill invest a little more and its going to work " mr kim who previously sold telephones quit his job several years ago to oversee his daughters workouts with pros and drive her to tournaments he compared his familys life to a big bet in poker "you do an all in on your daughter " now a high school senior who attends classes once a week ms kim is playing in tournaments to qualify to become a semipro player a step to the korean lpga the korean lpga is modeled on the u s lpga but is smaller in scale the push by korean women is also driven by scarcity of opportunity at home now one of the worlds richest countries south korean society and business culture is still overwhelmingly dominated by men although nearly of korean women attend college only of working age women work compared with of working age women in the u s and the gap between median earnings of men and women in korea is the greatest of any developed country and almost twice the u s gap of in a country where successful entrepreneurs are scarce self created wealth by a woman is virtually unheard of except in entertainment and golf golf isnt nearly as popular a career choice for korean men only two koreans k j choi and charlie wi are in the upper echelons of the u s mens pga tour even though ms hong got a relatively late start by current standards her family has also invested heavily in her career an only child ms hong was introduced to the sport by her mother when she was "i noticed she was very good and seemed to enjoy it " her mother says the success of ms pak persuaded ms hong to get serious she and her father headed to daejeon a smaller city of million people to work with some of the coaches and pros who knew ms pak while her high school friends woke up at a m to study ms hong practiced at a driving range before school by early afternoon she was out of class and back at the range for a time the fear of disappointing her father who coached her after an illness left him unable to work motivated ms hong much later she learned to enjoy the sport herself "i began playing for myself and my mind became more peaceful and i played better " she says last year in her third season playing tournaments on the korean lpga ms hong performed poorly and missed the chance to earn money in four straight tournaments a handful of younger players were dominating the korean tour and ms hong feared her budding career had already peaked a new coach made some changes to her swing and in september ms hong won her first tournament as a pro then in october she won the only joint tournament of the
