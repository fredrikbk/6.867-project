name that war admiral william fallon has just made his first major move as central command chief hes begun his tenure by ostentatiously banning the term "long war" that was coined by his predecessor gen john abizaid yet so far at least he has not offered up any superior alternative to describe the "whatchamacallit" that were in the middle of the change of nomenclature was first reported by the tampa tribune centcoms hometown newspaper which quoted an email from a spokesman lt col matthew mclaughlin who wrote that the old vernacular gave the impression that the u s was planning to keep forces in the middle east for a long time this is at odds with adm fallons determination to make progress fast in iraq and presumably to start withdrawing asap any suggestion that the u s is in for the long haul has also been deemed offensive to muslim sensibilities "one of our goals is to lessen our presence over time and we didnt feel that the term long war captured this nuance " lt col mclaughlin explained trying to achieve results as fast as possible in iraq is all well and good at least in theory in practice however the "results now" mindset has led the defense department and centcom in the past to slight some time consuming steps such as conducting a census of iraqis or enlarging the u s army that would have borne major dividends by now because no one thought that we would still be in iraq in the reality as were learning is that there is no such thing as a quick counterinsurgency the average full blown insurgency takes years to defeat many last decades farc has been battling the colombian government since the mid s it would of course be possible to end american involvement in the iraq war in a few months time but only at the cost of defeat and american withdrawal wouldnt end the fighting it would probably expand it its hard to see why dropping the "long war" label would speed up the agonizing time consuming process of pacifying iraq in fact the more we speak of our desire to leave the less likelihood there is that we can do so because it causes friends and enemies alike to doubt our resolve this is something that senior administration officials and senior generals have a hard time understanding for years theyve been talking about plans to start withdrawing troops even though those plans are always shelved their very public existence does serious damage to american credibility talk about drawing down the u s presence in the entire region is just as counterproductive as talking about exit strategies from iraq just because the leaders of al qaeda and the islamic republic of iran call for our withdrawal doesnt mean that we will reduce tensions by taking their advice the gains from any such move would be ephemeral as we learned after we pulled troops out of saudi arabia following the liberation of iraq note that this didnt lead to any fall off in al qaeda attacks islamist propagandists simply found new excuses for their reign of terror the only result of a general drawdown of u s forces in the region would be to cause our friends to seek accommodation with our enemies if were serious about prevailing against islamist extremists of both sunni and shia cast well be in for a long difficult fight and its better to speak frankly of that unpleasant reality if only to prepare our own populace for the setbacks and sacrifices that lie ahead yet its hard to find the right words if you dont even know what to call the post period the administration started off labeling this the global war on terror even though we had no intention of fighting the ira eta tamil tigers or lots of other terrorists a more accurate appellation would have been something along the lines of "the war on international islamist terror networks " but that was deemed politically incorrect some conservatives such as eliot cohen and norman podhoretz lobbied for "world war iv " on the theory that the cold war was world war iii but that hasnt caught on while unpopular on the right for being too mealy mouthed "gwot" became even more unpopular on the left where the prevailing dogma is to argue that we shouldnt be at war at least outside of afghanistan the democratic controlled house armed services committee even banned the use of "war" to describe whatever it is were doing against al qaeda and its ilk its not clear what term the democrats would prefer but they obviously want to view this as police work or an intelligence operation in other words the pre mindset donald rumsfeld the lefts favorite villain was actually in agreement with the democrats on this point largely for parochial bureaucratic reasons he didnt like calling it a war because this implied that the primary role would be taken by the department of defense mr rumsfeld wanted state justice the cia and other agencies to step forward so he tried to call it the "global struggle against violent extremism " a clunky name with an even clunkier acronym gsave pronounced "gee save" that was promptly and mercifully deep sixed by the president that seemed to leave mr abizaids coinage "the long war " redolent of the "cold war " as the official term it was presumably more descriptive than "gwot" and less offensive to certain muslims than say the "war on islamofascism " but that decision has now been thrown into doubt because adm fallon apparently has concluded that even "long war" is too inflammatory perhaps centcom can sponsor a contest to "name this war " oops sorry cant call it that maybe "name this thingamajig" mr boot a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations is author of "war made new technology warfare and the course of history to today" gotham books
