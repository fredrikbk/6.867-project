tv drama as fraud case unravels executive is at large gemstars yuen said he destroyed evidence judge a no brainer on a march afternoon in henry c yuen the former chief executive of gemstar tv guide international inc sat alone in his pasadena office and installed a software program called eraser according to his own testimony he then deleted the contents of his hard drive committing a crime with the potential to put him behind bars mr yuen had reason to erase his tracks federal regulators say the securities and exchange commission was zeroing in on mr yuen as the primary player in a massive accounting fraud at gemstar the once highflying media and technology company he had built in partnership with rupert murdochs news corp his hard drive contained subpoenaed emails and accounting documents the sec suspected to be related to a meltdown that had wiped billions off gemstars market value with criminal prosecutors in los angeles also eyeing the unfolding saga and gemstars stock devastated shanghai born mr yuen seemed headed for a fall today gemstar marks a low point of mr murdochs career as an investor costing news corp about &# billion in write downs gemstar tv guides stock which once traded at &# a share languishes below &# so far however mr yuen hasnt joined kenneth lay bernard ebbers joseph nacchio and other members of the corporate elite humbled by criminal prosecutions in the accounting scandals of the new millennium last march the sec won its civil trial against mr yuen a u s federal judge ordered him to pay &# million for his role in fraudulently inflating revenues between and but so far the government hasnt collected any of it and doesnt know where mr yuen is and although mr yuen agreed to plead guilty to a felony for illegally destroying evidence during a federal investigation he has so far managed to avoid jail time or any other criminal penalties and currently faces no criminal charges mr yuens case so far marks an unusual black eye for the government in the high profile white collar crime cases of recent years prosecutors went after him on a coverup crime obstruction of justice instead of trying to prove complex financial wrongdoing in court the tactic which some legal experts liken to using tax evasion statutes to nail mobsters was used in the prosecution of martha stewart and other defendants in recent years but the short cut tactic has backfired with mr yuen in prosecutors struck a deal under which the former chief executive pleaded guilty to a single count of obstruction of justice in exchange for six months of home detention and a &# fine and a &# million charitable contribution but fresh details of the case found in hundreds of court papers raise new questions about the prosecutions decision to let mr yuen off the hook on accounting fraud "theres no doubt in my mind that there is a criminal case against henry yuen for securities fraud " says mike piazza who was lead trial counsel in the secs case against mr yuen and now is in private practice moreover the plea bargain deal collapsed after u s district judge john f walter in los angeles refused to enforce it saying the proposed punishment was too light considering the seriousness of mr yuens crime he warned the proposed sentence would create perverse incentives in the justice system "its a no brainer " he said in court "you destroy the evidence to avoid the more serious charges " prosecutors have continued to investigate and expect to refile charges against mr yuen according to a spokesman for the u s attorneys office in los angeles but the clock is ticking and its looking increasingly unlikely hell face more serious accounting fraud charges the five year statute of limitations on many accounting fraud charges has already expired technically there are ways for prosecutors to extend the statutes but people familiar with the matter say the government is not pursuing accounting fraud charges at this time and intends to recharge mr yuen with obstruction of justice the decision by prosecutors not to pursue the more serious crime remains a mystery several key players in the u s attorneys office left midway through the investigation debra wong yang the u s attorney who initiated the original case against mr yuen resigned last october and a permanent successor has not been appointed in an interview ms yang declined to comment on the yuen case but in general she noted that president bushs corporate fraud task force formed in made prosecuting coverups a priority partly to resolve cases quickly "in the old days we wouldnt have charged obstruction because we would have wanted to look at the entire crime " says ms yang who is now in private practice "we dont have that luxury anymore " bill mateja who oversaw the fraud task force in his role as senior counsel at the justice department agreed that moving cases quickly was a high priority "jurors quite frankly can understand obstruction of justice much easier than they can understand complicated fraud " says mr mateja who is in private practice since he was fired from gemstar in the year old mr yuen has pursued new business ventures in asia while hes collected over &# million in salary and attorney fees from los angeles based gemstar and sold at least &# million in gemstar stock lately hes come under new attack by the sec which has asked a judge to imprison mr yuen and charge him a daily fine until he pays the &# million he owes mr yuen appears to be "devoted to hiding his assets " the sec said in a court filing last month mr yuens lawyer brian maas declined to comment on mr yuens finances mr maas also said he was "not in a position to answer where mr yuen is " mr yuen who declined repeated requests through his lawyer to be interviewed for this article testified in the sec trial that his actions were "reckless " but his document destruction doesnt imply he is guilty of accounting fraud his lawyers have argued that so many accountants lawyers and other executives were involved in overseeing gemstars financial statements that mr yuen cant be held responsible the son of a shanghai lawyer mr yuen who grew up in hong kong came late to the world of business he earned a ph d in applied mathematics from the california institute of technology taught college math and worked for years as a research scientist with defense contractor trw inc mr yuens life as an entrepreneur began after a frustrating evening when his vcr failed to record a red sox baseball game he came up with a way to record shows more easily patented it then launched gemstar to market the technology in around his fortieth birthday in the mid s convinced that consumers would soon be using their televisions to surf the web email and order pizza mr yuen set his sights on the newly emerging field of interactive television technology he began acquiring patents related to the on screen channel guides used by cable and satellite providers figuring the guides would become a valuable destination for advertising gemstars patent portfolio caught the eye of mr murdoch whose company news corp owned a controlling stake in tv guide inc in july of gemstar merged with tv guide in a stock deal valued at &# billion mr yuen became chairman and ceo of the new gemstar tv guide international in which news corp eventually held a stake the merger sent the stock soaring at one point in gemstar had a market capitalization of &# billion and the value of mr yuens personal stake topped &# billion with his bowl haircut and owlish glasses mr yuen appeared on the covers of major business magazines and his techie turned billionaire story generated frequent comparisons to bill gates the former math teacher spent time at his new mountaintop home in pasadena where the outdoor pool had panoramic views but in the clubby cable industry he remained an outsider mr yuen was known for his sharp elbows and litigiousness in both his professional and personal lives other cable executives nicknamed him the "patent terrorist" for his willingness to sue cable companies to protect his companys intellectual property in his messy public divorce battle which has now spanned nearly one decade his ex wife accused him of secretly divorcing her in by forging her name on divorce papers in an effort to shield his fortune from her mr yuens lawyer mr maas declined to comment on the divorce case after the merger mr yuen clashed with executives from the tv guide side of the company they were irked by his arrogance and his top down management style according to testimony in the sec trial but gemstar faced bigger problems as mr yuen began making seemingly untenable promises to wall street in the fall of mr yuen publicly predicted advertisements on the cable channel guides developed by gemstar would bring in more than &# million in revenue for colleagues warned mr yuen that his projections were unrealistic joe kiener who had been president of tv guide before the merger and became co chief operating office afterward wrote his new boss an email in august that said he doubted the ad sales staff could meet his ad revenue targets "we are in danger of setting ourselves up for the potential of significant failure " mr kiener warned in the email which was introduced as evidence in the sec trial mr yuen defended his projections saying in an email anyone with doubts should leave the company several months later mr yuen fired mr kiener mr maas defended mr yuens action saying he was simply pressing mr kiener to do better which "is not an indication of anything except for good management " over the next year the sec says mr yuen began to manipulate gemstars financial results to make it appear that the company was meeting its revenue projections the company used a range of improper tactics according to the sec including recording "phantom" revenue under expired contracts and overpaying for businesses that used the excess proceeds to buy advertising from gemstar mr yuens main collaborator in the fraud according to the sec was elsie m leung a hong kong born accountant who joined gemstar in and became gemstars chief financial officer after the merger the two often spoke chinese in front of colleagues at gemstar in its battle against mr yuen news corp at one point hired a private detective to determine whether they had a romantic relationship according to people familiar with the matter mr yuen denied in court testimony he and ms leung were romantically involved the sec presented evidence that ms leung was named in a draft of his will and was the beneficiary of some of his life insurance trusts last february ms leung paid more than &# million to settle fraud charges brought by the sec ms leung through her lawyer declined to comment for this article the largest fraudulent transaction alleged by the sec involved over &# million in phantom revenue booked under an expired contract with scientific atlanta inc a lawrenceville ga company that makes set top boxes for cable companies a deal requiring scientific atlanta to pay patent royalties to gemstar expired in scientific atlanta now a unit of cisco systems inc stopped paying and the two companies went into litigation with gemstar claiming scientific atlanta was still using its patented technology at the direction of mr yuen and ms leung according to the sec gemstar continued booking the revenue as if the contract hadnt expired between and gemstar recorded &# million in revenue from scientific atlanta that was never actually billed for or collected kpmg gemstars auditor raised questions about the uncollected revenue according to court testimony in the sec trial after receiving written assurances from mr yuen and ms leung that scientific atlanta had agreed to pay the revenue kpmg signed off on the transactions bryan palbaum a kpmg partner told sec lawyers that that he relied on these written statements and that he now believes mr yuen and ms leung "may have misled me about the status of the settlement negotiations with scientific atlanta " in early as a wave of accounting scandals swept wall street kpmg said it wouldnt sign off on the companys filings to the sec for its financial results unless the company told shareholders that the revenue in the scientific atlanta transaction hadnt yet been collected among other conditions kpmg which agreed to pay &# million to settle sec charges declined to comment for this article on april gemstar informed shareholders that revenue had been inflated the stock plunged in a single day erasing &# billion in market value over the next few days mr yuen closed a deal to dispose of gemstar stock valued at &# million but that disclosure was just the beginning and the sec says mr yuen knew what was coming over the course of the next year gemstar issued four restatements reversing a total of &# million in revenues connected with roughly a dozen transactions the judge in the sec trial later ruled that &# million of the &# million mr yuen pocketed was ill gotten gain by september gemstars stock had fallen from its tech bubble highs and nasdaq threatened to delist the company for being late in filing its quarterly reports bitterness grew between mr yuen and news corp executives as he and ms leung refused to resign in october the two agreed to step aside and take nonexecutive roles at the company in exchange for a hefty package of cash payments and stock options mr yuens deal included a termination fee of &# million &# million in unpaid salary and million shares of restricted stock the sec estimates that mr yuen reaped more than &# million in total proceeds from gemstar and sales of its stock from to because of the extraordinary severance deal mr yuen negotiated before stepping down he continued to collect millions of dollars in salary and benefits from gemstar including a monthly car allowance until last year in january an arbitration panel ordered him to pay gemstar &# million including salary legal costs and &# million that the company incurred in settling shareholder lawsuits relating to the accounting improprieties mr yuens attorney says he plans to appeal the ruling once its finalized in november the sec alerted mr yuen that it was opening a formal investigation and requested a broad range of documents stored on his office hard drive mr yuen immediately deleted documents that he knew were covered by the subpoena according to the plea he struck with prosecutors he deleted more in december the plea states mr yuen visited his office and ran the eraser program on march just before he was slated to testify before the sec it permanently deleted any electronic traces of the documents he had erased earlier according to his plea then he asked his assistant to put his hard drive into a sealed envelope and deliver it to his home gemstar fired mr yuen and ms leung after he failed to show up for scheduled testimony before the sec flouting a subpoena mr yuen finally showed up after the sec asked a federal court to have him jailed and fined &# a day until he agreed to appear the sec built its case against mr yuen partly on documents recovered from servers but sec officials to this day say they dont know what other evidence might have existed on mr yuens computer stanley arkin mr yuens main trial lawyer in the sec case described his client as "frightened maybe paranoid" and said mr yuen simply made a mistake in erasing his hard drive that shouldnt be read as an admission of guilt in the accounting fraud case last march a u s federal judge said she didnt find mr yuens testimony "persuasive or credible " she ordered mr yuen to pay &# million in the sec civil case finding him liable for securities fraud lying to auditors and falsifying gemstars books mr yuen is appealing the ruling the criminal case against mr yuen has taken a different path prosecutors in los angeles had a promising felony case against mr yuen for obstruction of justice since his empty office hard drive revealed he had run the eraser program criminal prosecutors pursuing accounting fraud charges must meet a higher burden of proof than the sec and show that the defendant acted with criminal intent and is guilty beyond reasonable doubt in september of ms yangs office struck its plea deal with mr yuen quickly drawing protests in an unusual public rift with the justice department the sec which normally works collaboratively with criminal prosecutors submitted a letter to the court objecting to the plea deal and describing how mr yuen had "intentionally and willfully destroyed key evidence" during a government investigation gemstar which paid &# million to settle sec charges against it also filed documents with the court objecting to the deal calling the proposed sentence a "slap on the wrist " ranee katzenstein assistant u s attorney defended the sentence before the judge she said a low end guideline sentence was appropriate considering mr yuen had accepted responsibility for his document destruction was a first time offender and had agreed to a felony conviction but judge walter seemed baffled at the hearing by the light sentence prosecutors had settled on "how do you view this as a significant sentence " he asked prosecutors then he took the highly unusual step of refusing to enforce the governments plea agreement "it seems to me this sentence sends the wrong message to corporate america " he said thom mrozek a spokesman for the u s attorneys office in los angeles says mr yuen is still under investigation and prosecutors expect to file new charges at some point in the future typically defendants convicted of obstruction of justice face sentences of less than two years in prison a major accounting fraud involving over &# million in losses and thousands of victims could result in a sentence of as much as years
