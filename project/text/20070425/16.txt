big rivals move in on salesforce coms turf salesforce com inc chief executive marc benioff never hesitates to mock his much larger software rivals as he points out his companys success in pioneering the market for on demand business applications delivered over the internet "we like to have a little fun here at the expense of the established giants like microsoft and sap and oracle " mr benioff said during a february conference call the brash former oracle corp executive went on to describe those companies products as from the "last" century because theyre manually installed according to long term licenses it was one of many times mr benioff has derided the relatively slow pace of the larger companies into the on demand market yet some analysts are starting to wonder whether mr benioff may soon regret goading those larger companies theyre moving further into his turf on april oracle unveiled on demand versions of a number of software applications it acquired when it bought rivals peoplesoft and siebel microsoft corp and sap ag also are expected to release on demand products this year the entry of powerful rivals will add to the challenges for salesforce com which has made little headway in expanding its offerings beyond customer relationship management or crm software the software helps businesses track customer accounts "its the one trick pony problem " said jim shepherd an analyst with amr research as salesforce com has moved to expand beyond crm it has struggled to maintain profitability posting break even results or losses in its past four quarters despite those difficulties salesforce coms share price has nearly tripled during the past two years and some on wall street are questioning such bullishness "the street has really been caught up in the salesforce dream " said peter goldmacher an analyst with cowen &amp co who last week downgraded his rating on the companys stock to "neutral" from "outperform " "it seems investors have lost healthy skepticism " mr goldmacher said mr goldmacher said strong competition for salesforce com should come not only from oracle but also from microsoft which is releasing its on demand crm product called titan later this year to be sure salesforce com has been posting remarkable growth in the otherwise mature business software industry in its most recent quarter salesforce coms sales rose to &# million it says it has nearly paying subscribers and its main market is still relatively small more so than most investors who have listened to mr benioff speak publicly might guess global equities research analyst trip chowdhry estimates that of every &# spent by companies on information technology recently "on demand is not to of that yet " mr chowdhry said he believes salesforce coms attempt to expand beyond crm by becoming a "platform" onto which others build applications is the right move "for long term investors salesforce has all the strategic ingredients to be successful " mr chowdhry said while salesforce com has successfully positioned itself in the public mind as a giant killer the reality is that its biggest fight is ahead its appexchange software platform which lets smaller companies build applications on top of its technology has had limited appeal mr shepherd of amr research said because many customers are wary of depending so much on a relatively small unproven companies to provide software as it struggles to make good on initiatives such as appexchange salesforce com has posted financial results that place it far behind its chosen competitors while salesforce com reported a drop in operating margin in its most recent quarter oracle reported a operating margin in its most recent quarter and microsoft reported meanwhile salesforce com reported &# million in cash from operations in its most recently completed fiscal year while oracle reported &# billion and microsoft reported &# billion in their most recently completed fiscal years sap reported &# billion in cash from operations in its most recently completed fiscal year it is sap mr shepherd said that will provide the broadest test of on demands appeal later this year sap is slated to release its as suite of software products which include on demand capability for enterprise resource planning with the as product "well get a better read on whether this is a crm only phenomenon or a significant new buying trend " mr shepherd said fbr research analyst david hilal said in a note released to clients wednesday that oracles on demand offerings will also provide a crucial test for on demands appeal mr hilal said oracle which gives customers the option of storing and managing their own software has an edge over salesforce com which aims to store as much customer data as it can on its own servers "we think oracles ability to offer both on premise and on demand gives the company a strategic advantage " mr hilal said adding that he estimates oracles revenue from on demand software has grown in the past year as a high profile youngster salesforce com is "a threat to sap and oracle and microsoft because the company is taking some crm business those guys would have otherwise gotten " shepherd said "but they dont represent a threat in terms of taking away account control no one says my major core application vendor is salesforce com " thanks to mr benioffs tireless salesmanship however salesforce com has been placed in the public imagination among some of the biggest players in the software business more equivalent comparisons could likely be made with smaller on demand companies such as closely held netsuite inc or rightnow technologies inc netsuite has not yet completed an often rumored ipo according to mr chowdhry it also has not done as good a job as salesforce com at "talking through where it wants to be years out "
