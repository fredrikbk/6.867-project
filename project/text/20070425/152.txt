colorful and well known plaintiffs lawyer filed a motion in state court seeking to question the editor and reporter of the paper the southeast texas record mr coons motion alleged the pair distributed the paper to potential jurors in an effort to influence one of his asbestos cases and may have committed a "criminal act " judge donald floyd granted mr coons motion which requested to "interrogate" the reporter and editor the publisher has objected a hearing is set for today brian timpone the newspapers publisher says mr coons effort is a "soviet style intimidation tactic" designed to harass staffers mr coon called the newspaper a "propaganda machine " the paper is one of three launched in recent years by the chamber through its legal arm known as the institute for legal reform out of concern that the mainstream media has either largely ignored coverage of civil suits or is pro plaintiff mr timpone says the papers dont indicate their affiliation with the chamber it appears the venues the chamber selected madison county ill charleston w va and beaumont werent picked out of a hat in the american tort reform association named all of them "judicial hellholes " areas where
