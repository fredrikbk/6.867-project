employers k retirement plan in late he didnt sign up he was too busy to select investments he says and wasnt sure he wanted a k contribution taking a bite out of his take home pay but his employer law firm bradley arant rose &amp white llp in birmingham ala had other ideas last year the firm automatically enrolled mr blythe and other employees who werent participating in the k plan now the year old associate attorney is happy they did "i knew i needed to be putting more money away " he says traditionally saving in a k retirement plan was a decision for employees to make but recent regulatory changes and a growing awareness that many americans arent saving enough for retirement are prompting more employers to call the shots as a result employers increasingly are signing up more workers automatically moving employees assets to make sure their k investments are diversified and boosting how much some employees contribute employees are allowed to opt out of such employer directed moves but few do and that means employers actions can dramatically change how workers savings are invested there was more than &# trillion invested in k plans in financial firms that administer k plans and

move all employees in their s for example into the same target date funds even if some are planning to retire at age and others at age also employees are sometimes given only a narrow time window which can be as little as days to opt out of automatic investment changes meaning hands off participants need to pay close attention and some employers are making wholesale shifts into default investment options that can add layers of expenses among these target date funds and managed accounts which automatically manage a participants investments often tack on additional fees usually a fraction of a percentage point on top of the expenses of the underlying fund holdings some companies are choosing investments for employees even if participants have already picked their own funds

director of employee services national grid also last year changed the k s default investment from a stable value fund which is similar to a money market fund to a managed account mr powers says some
