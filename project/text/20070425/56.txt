fiscally fit change annuities or not terris uncle asks is it a good idea to upgrade his variable annuity online edition not long ago my uncle al hit me up for advice about his variable annuity his investment adviser had been "on him " he said to roll the funds in his current variable annuity into a new annuity that offered better benefits i told my uncle the best thing to do whenever he feels pressured to make a financial decision is to hang up the phone but uncle al was interested in some of the benefits of the newer policies including a guaranteed minimum income stream a guaranteed death benefit and long term care insurance to help him make the right decision ill take a look at the latest variable annuity products and what the potential drawbacks might be first the basics a variable annuity is a tax deferred investment account thats wrapped in an insurance policy you give an insurance company a lump sum or periodic payments and in return you get a steady stream of income for life annuities are marketed mainly to retirees who worry about outliving their savings an "immediate" variable annuity starts making payouts right away while a "deferred" annuity puts off payouts until an agreed upon later date the payouts are taxed as personal income and withdrawals of earnings made before age may be subject to a federal penalty with a fixed annuity youre guaranteed a certain rate of return variable annuity payouts change depending on the performance of accounts investments some insurers allow you to choose between fixed and variable payments most variable annuities also come with a guaranteed death benefit heirs receive the remaining balance in the investment account or some guaranteed minimum lump sum uncle al purchased his annuity when he retired years ago at the time his biggest concern was making sure his savings would last but insurance companies have been adding new benefits to their policies to attract more customers and persuade annuity owners like uncle al to upgrade to newer annuities that carry higher fees federal regulators have also cracked down on financial advisers who change jobs and move to a different insurance company then urge their former clients to switch to the new insurers annuities a practice known as "churning " regulators charged that advisers were doing this primarily to generate commissions which can add up to or more what are the newer benefits being offered for a higher fee some annuities offer a so called stepped up guaranteed death benefit the guaranteed benefit may be higher than your original account balance thanks to strong investment performance minus withdrawals in essence youre guaranteed a certain level of investment performance even if a stock market slide trims your account that said higher expense fees erode the value of that benefit another rider is a minimum income benefit which guarantees a pre set lifetime income payment even if you dont have enough money left in your investment account the annuity my uncle is considering has a rider that wraps in long term care insurance which pays for health care at home or in a nursing home uncle al saw the need for such coverage after he was seriously hurt in a fall off a ladder a number of insurers now offer annuities that have no "surrender charges" a penalty fee for making early withdrawals from your investment account some insurers are also offering no load annuities which dont charge commissions on investment transactions so what are the costs in addition to account maintenance fees and mutual fund expenses youll pay mortality and expense risk charges essentially the fee insurers charge to cover their risk that you may live long enough to cost them money the total cost of the fees and investment expenses of variable annuities average compared with average expenses of just for mutual funds excluding municipals according to a survey the latest available by morningstar then there are surrender charges the fees can be steep up to of the account balance in the first year but that percentage gradually declines until the surrender charge period expires generally by the seventh or eighth year of the annuity to offset surrender charges insurers typically offer an incentive of between and of the account balance if you switch annuities accounts with additional guarantees and riders charge even steeper costs than plain vanilla variable annuities do to find out how much more expensive a new policy might be i encouraged my uncle to look at web sites such as annuityfyi com and insure com uncle al has had his current annuity for years so hes passed the surrender charge phase but if he upgrades to a new annuity hell be locked into another long surrender period because the surrender charges are so steep i cautioned him to reconsider switching if theres even a slight chance hell need to make a withdrawal from his account within the next years if my uncle decides to upgrade his annuity the move should be tax free swapping annuities without paying tax on investment gains is allowed under so called exchanges the name is derived from section of the u s tax code but the swap must be handled carefully the exchange must be a trustee to trustee transfer if my uncle cashes out the annuity and then buys a new one hell have to pay taxes i urged him to talk to his tax adviser before making any changes when considering buying any annuity its essential to know the financial strength of the insurer my uncle needs to make sure the insurer is going to be around and making payments as long as he is you can find ratings of insurers financial strength from companies such as a m best moodys standard &amp poors and thestreet com be careful some lower rated insurers may offer better rates of return than their more financially sound competitors that could lead to problems down the road should these insurers fail to price their products to account for americans living longer as this marketwatch column explains a recent study found insurers may not be charging enough for the new slew of guarantees theyre offering that could force financially troubled insurers to boost mortality and risk expense fees down the road before purchasing a policy be sure to ask whether there are any caps on fees because of the additional costs involved its not a good idea to switch annuities to get new benefits if youre not certain you need those benefits before buying an annuity or switching to a newer one sit down with a financial adviser and evaluate your overall financial picture to make sure youre choosing the right investment ask whether the adviser is compensated in any way by insurance companies who should seriously consider swapping annuities individuals who were sold annuities with a bunch of expensive bells and whistles consider exchanging your high cost variable annuity for low fee annuity offered by discount brokers such as vanguard group or t rowe price just be sure to wait until the surrender charge period has passed and before buying any annuity look into less costly alternatives having a guaranteed source of income may help you sleep better at night but it might be possible to get the
