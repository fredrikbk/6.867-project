if greens persist that incandescent glow may flicker and dim your april editorial "green light districts" correctly illuminates the folly of incandescent light bulb bans in favor of compact fluorescent lighting or cfls coiled tubes that excite a gas with electric current lets not forget however that general electric ceo jeff immelt is partly to blame for the incandescent backlash by its participation in the u s climate action partnership uscap a coalition of rent seeking corporations and self proclaimed "environmental" organizations lobbying for regulation of greenhouse gases ge is contributing to the very global warming hysteria that it now ironically needs to combat in order to defend its own product for this reason we filed a global warming shareholder proposal with ge that seeks information about the economic consequences of global warming regulations shareholders will vote on our proposal at ges april annual general meeting global warming panic is also causing some to call for a ban on the construction of coal fired energy plants which jeopardizes ges investment in advanced coal technology such as integrated gasification combined cycle igcc all too often companies seek to ride the waves of public opinion and cozy up to government regulations only to see these efforts backfire on company earnings leaving shareholders and employees in the dark thomas borelli ph d steven milloy free enterprise action fund potomac md weve bought some of the compact fluorescent light bulbs drawn by their lower energy use as well as a newspaper coupon no government coercion needed the bulbs work great but wont their higher cost be a pinch to poor families budgets besides if al gore wants to ban the older incandescent bulbs he must come to our house and replace all the globes fixtures and lamps the cfl bulbs are simply too long for some of them if it doesnt fit it wont be lit j p green burke va before your readers laugh too much about "how many politicians does it take to screw in a light bulb " they should consider whether it is true as you assert that "consumers are surely capable of evaluating for themselves the tradeoffs between energy savings and price as well as other considerations " they would be if they were given all the relevant information if electric utilities charged prices reflecting the full cost of their service including the cost of future environmental damage resulting from todays carbon emissions consumers would surely make informed decisions about lighting and about electric usage generally but electric utilities generally charge prices that cover only current and embedded production costs in other words consumers face a false tradeoff that promotes the use of inefficient light bulbs and many other bad energy choices consequently we are left with a set of second best social policies such as penalizing the use of inefficient light bulbs and subsidizing the production of renewable electric energy that would not be necessary or even helpful in the world where consumers could evaluate those tradeoffs properly government coercion is always a second best choice in economic matters how to achieve optimal resource choice and allocation in the presence of price signals that fail to include the cost of negative externalities from pollution remains the legislators and the regulators most vexing problem john a bohn commissioner california public utilities commission san francisco for homes in the warmer regions especially those with air conditioning on most of the year use of fluorescent lighting is sensible however in colder climes heat from incandescent bulbs is not wasted here in maine even summer nights can be cool and a little heat from the reading lamp bulb obviates need to turn the furnace on my home is well insulated has high tech windows and doors plus passive solar heating any heat generated indoors including from "obsolete" light bulbs lowers consumption of carbon based fuel so will the green busybodies kindly back off and allow citizens to make their own economic decisions clearly decisions in california will be different from those in maine i have a life time supply of v incandescent bulbs that give off a nice orange glow on v and useful heat however i will dispose of these when the climate warms sufficiently to offset the coming ice age ivan hills rockland maine see related letter letters to the editor utility regulation is a form of tyranny" wsj may
