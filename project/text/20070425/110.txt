old friends find their niche in search related marketing questions for joshua stylman and peter hershberg company reprise media title managing partners googles first quarter earnings reported last week showed the search giants revenue surging demonstrating that search related marketing is continuing to establish itself in the ad world a growing number of companies including some mainstream marketers are taking advantage of the technique which helps to drive consumers searching for specific keywords to their web sites indeed there is evidence that companies are shifting money out of other forms of digital advertising such as banner ads into search among the digital marketers helping advise companies on search is new york based reprise media whose clients include capital one financial corp usa today and martha stewart living omnimedia inc reprise was recently acquired by ad holding giant interpublic group of cos or ipg which like other traditional ad concerns is beefing up its web expertise "integrated offerings are a reality today it is no longer just a nice thing to have the marketplace is demanding that we bring that to the table " says michael roth chairman and ceo of interpublic reprise will operate as an independent unit within interpublics recently created futures marketing group working with agencies throughout the holding company and seeking out its own clients joshua stylman years old and his childhood friend peter hershberg founded reprise media in and will continue to serve as managing partners below they talk below about the sale and about changes in the search marketing space the wall street journal with interpublic recovering from earnings restatements management turnover and the loss of several key advertising accounts why go there mr hershberg i think the fact that theyve had to deal with these series of issues in recent years makes them more open to change than perhaps some other companies are ipg felt as strongly about our independence as we did meaning that we should absolutely be a shared resource for the different ipg agencies but we should have our own identity we should not be rolled into an existing ad agency i could give you a hundred examples of where thats failed wsj how long have you been shopping yourselves mr hershberg and mr stylman we werent mr stylman weve been getting phone calls about people acquiring the company literally since about a month after we opened doors which was bizarre because we literally were working out of our apartments and had two clients we felt at this stage there were a few things that really stood out for us that made it really important one of them being properly resourced so we were out on a fund raising initiative and it turned into an acquisition alliance with advertisers was absolutely critical we know that by virtue of the fact that these large holding companies have these relationships with advertisers and it becomes harder and harder for a truly independent shop to compete for those relationships wsj does growing competition in the ad world from tech companies like google affect your ability to compete independently mr hershberg google in particular at this stage definitely has a lot of control over the marketplace theyve got upwards of advertisers ranging from the dry cleaner on the corner of th and third to the biggest companies in the world and certainly they have aspirations of establishing direct relationships i dont necessarily want to go so far as to say that is why we did what we did because it is not but it is definitely something that we are conscious of aligning ourselves with a multibillion dollar international holding company probably makes life a little bit easier for us going forward and probably protects us to some extent wsj for the past couple of years reprise media has analyzed the search marketing tactics of super bowl advertisers and often criticized big brands for failing to understand how to connect search marketing to their larger campaigns which companies are effectively using search marketing mr stylman companies who primarily have their business rooted either in some kind of digital strategy and or companies that have metrics that are accountable did very well in our analysis of super bowl search marketing so sales genie was the company that outperformed everyone this year in our super bowl scorecard the advertising community didnt necessarily gravitate toward sales genies ad and didnt really like their creative approach we were judging their ability to integrate search marketing into their overall mix they got that notion of making a link between the analog and the digital world they had a very strong call to action in their tv commercial which they knew intuitively would send people to the internet the result they drove customers through the funnel so they knew they were spending &# million on a second spot plus costs of production literally for micropennies on the dollar they could find people who were putting their hands up saying "i want to learn more " mr hershberg on the flip side of that we actually saw a category of advertisers do worse this year than they did in years past the auto category last year a lot of manufacturers ranging from gm to ford really stood out in the study they had strong calls to action they had value added content on their web sites this year they didnt do quite as good a job in terms of the level of integration its interesting it is a category that spends as much if not more than any other yet they seem to have forgotten what those best practices look like wsj are there any industries in particular that are starting to understand the value of search mr stylman we do a lot with news organizations there is this opportunity to get in front of consumers at the moment they are looking for information given the world we live in of fast breaking information search gives an unprecedented ability to get that message in front of someone literally at a millisecond after they expressed interest
