crunchtime for bonzo the nfl draft bonzo the monkey has never written a word about football but judging from his success at picking winners he knows the game as well as some pundits bonzo is the stuffed mascot for the iconoclastic web site cold hard football facts coldhardfootballfacts com in whose name a coin was flipped to chose winners against the point spread every week during the season his picks were matched against those of four cbs sportsline experts bonzo with a record of beat them all with the national football leagues annual draft of college players coming up this weekend bonzo has been called out of retirement "nfl general managers expound about their draft philosophies " says chff publisher kerry byrne "given the results you wonder if they wouldnt do as well picking names from a hat " perhaps an appalachian state baseball cap which bonzos masters used mr byrne says most of the prognosticators are wrong about of the time about what team will pick who and when "weve been keeping score for years and many experts dont make a single correct call beyond round one " bonzo mr bryne is convinced can do as well the staff at chff is making only one selection themselves jamarcus russell the lsu quarterback who everyone concedes will be taken as the first pick by the oakland raiders after that its bonzo against the world one thing that can be predicted with accuracy is that wide receivers and the men who cover them will be the most heavily drafted positions in the first two rounds another is that few interior linemen will be drafted early besides kicker the regular positions with the fewest no picks since have been guard and center no one is sure exactly why this is so but the numbers are undeniable in the past years there were cornerbacks drafted in the first round the highest of any position followed by wide receivers just one fewer than the number of all offensive linemen taken in the first round over that period mr byrne calls it "the outside in theory in baseball the strength of a team is supposed to be up the middle meaning catchers pitchers middle infielders and centerfielders in pro football somehow its the opposite teams use most of their top picks on outside positions " this is particularly puzzling because pro football coaches tell us that games are won down in the "pits" or "trenches " yet nfl front offices generally opt for the guys out on the flanks and this despite the fact that wide receivers have very little impact when it comes to turning a teams fortunes around of the wideouts drafted in the first round since only eight have made as much as a single pro bowl appearance russell levine who covers college football for footballoutsiders com thinks there might be some justification for drafting so many defensive backs in the first round "the college game doesnt put a lot of emphasis on tight man to man coverage pro scouts place a premium on corners who display that kind of skill because theyre a relatively rare commodity " what explains the high number of no picks given to wideouts "wide receivers get the most plays in the highlight films " explains steve sabol of nfl films who ought to know this doesnt mean that there arent a lot of talented wideouts on the contrary as long ago as former san francisco ers coach bill walsh told inside sports magazine "theyre all good thats the problem its hard to find one that is so much better that hell make a difference " mr walsh found one jerry rice went in the first round back in "yes " mr walsh reminds "but jerry is probably the best ever and dont forget we had joe montana to throw him the ball " mr walsh might have been saying its ok to draft a wideout no if you already have the components of a winning team walshs role as the impetus of a revolution in football namely more emphasis on the passing game was highlighted in michael lewiss last book "the blind side evolution of a game " the counter to flashy passing attacks proved to be swift powerful pass rushing linebackers who could quickly get to a quarterbacks "blind side" usually the left side since most quarterbacks are right handed pro offenses countered with huge agile left guards and offensive tackles who screened out blitzing linebackers the question then is why are offensive tackles taken in the first round since and guards just more popular with nfl coaches and gms "there are obvious social pressures " says mr lewis "to draft players the fans have heard of and they seldom hear about college guards or tackles and scouts find it easier to evaluate players who work in isolation cornerbacks and receivers than guys down in the interior of the line " quarterback of course is the most important position and the one hardest to find a great player at so mr russell and notre dames brady quinn will be among the first few picks this weekend but after that its bonzos guess mr barra writes about sports for the journal
