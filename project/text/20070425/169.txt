financial results monday some customers appreciate the convenience of radioshacks smaller and more accessible stores and avoid trekking to big box stores to buy items like cords and batteries enabling radioshack to reap high margins on those products but the relatively small size of radioshack stores limits the types of fast growing products it can sell such as flat screen tvs bulls counter that
