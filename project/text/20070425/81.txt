in january suggests that there are serious communication gaps inside beijings policy making apparatus that should raise serious concerns say two foreign policy analysts about the countrys ability to become a reliable global partner there are signs that chinas military didnt confer with some civilian government officials before launching the test say bates gill and martin kleiber of the center for strategic and international studies a washington d c think tank nearly two weeks elapsed before china acknowledged the test which was criticized by the u s and its allies over the potential risk to other civilian and military satellites some china analysts have suggested the missile test was carried out as a symbolic challenge to u s military power but the authors say a more disturbing possibility is that the left hand in beijing didnt know what the right hand was doing it is possible that the peoples liberation army proceeded without talking with key officials in the government who deal with security and foreign policy it wouldnt be the first time the pla has acted on its own in when a chinese fighter jet and a u s reconnaissance plane collided the pla didnt fully inform officials in beijing and in early the pla didnt share information with the rest of the chinese government during the initial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars nonetheless president hu jintao who heads the pla and is general secretary of the chinese communist party likely knew about the test the authors say whatever the motivation for the test the move doesnt bode well for chinas relationship with other major powers especially the u s the test probably threw into orbit a large amount of space debris putting at risk chinas own satellites and those of other countries for decades the authors say the test also comes at a time in the u s election cycle when u s partisans are likely to criticize beijing for its human rights record and demand tough responses from the white house to any military aspirations foreign affairs may june careers networking makes people uneasy for good reason if humans are inherently social beings why do most job seekers find networking so difficult barbara ehrenreich a journalist and advocate for the working poor and unhappily employed says job hunters who struggle to reach out to potential professional contacts generally arent socially impaired instead networking feels awkward because it involves a predatory aspect that has little to do with making connections that people crave while it might come naturally to some individuals for many it represents a violation of peoples innate sociability "you arent meeting people because you want to make friends or find allies but because you want something from them " she says that is why job seekers often rely on scripts provided by career advisers and networking gurus in the reverse calculus of networking a job seeker who finds herself enjoying a pleasant conversation at a professional event needs to reprioritize each minute spent with one person amounts to a lost opportunity with another prospective contact adding to the sense of fakeness mr ehrenreich says are the little fibs the jobless are encouraged to tell during their search why admit to being "unemployed" when any number of less negative euphemisms or dodges would suffice job hunters are discouraged from hanging out with other unemployed people since they arent in a position to make offers gatherings and organizations of job seekers sometimes are dismissed by motivational gurus as "pity parties " ms ehrenreich says even though most people welcome mutual support during hard times ms ehrenreich who conducted an undercover job search while researching the book "bait and switch the futile pursuit of the american dream " says that for the unemployed connecting with one another might be the best thing to lift them out of their isolation forbes may arts why challenging poetry has a lasting appeal april the cruelest month is also national poetry month what better time then to make a case for the desirability of keeping contemporary poetry difficult writing in slate former u s poet laureate robert pinsky challenges the notion that contemporary works should be easy to understand the allure of talented athletes and artists is precisely that they succeed at difficult pursuits if videogames were easy their appeal would be limited the poems of wallace stevens and marianne moore are still read today perhaps because they require intellectual heavy lifting complex poems can be rewarding even when they arent fully understood but it helps to bring some knowledge to the table as robert frost wrote "it takes all sorts of in and outdoor schooling to get adapted to my kind of fooling " slate april see
