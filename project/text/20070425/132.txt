search engines seek to get inside your head google others start to comb users online habits to tailor results to personal interests search engines have long generated the same results for queries whether the person searching was a mom mathematician or movie star now who you are and what youre interested in is starting to affect the outcome of your search google inc and a wide range of start ups are trying to translate factors like where you live the ads you click on and the types of restaurants you search for into more relevant search results a chef who searched for "beef " for example might be more likely to find recipes than encyclopedia entries about livestock and a film buff who searched for a new movie might see detailed articles about the making of the film rather than ticket buying sites google has been enhancing and more widely deploying its search personalization technology within coming weeks google users who are logged in will begin having their search results re ordered based on information they have provided to google for instance they may have entered a city to receive weather forecasts on a personalized google home page as a result a user in new york who types in "giants" might see higher search results for the football team than a user in san francisco who might be more interested in the giants baseball team consumers who use its web history service to track previous search queries currently get results that are influenced by those queries and the sites they have clicked on the company plans eventually to offer personalization based on a users web browsing history including sites people visited without going through google when users agree to let google track it also within three to five years google will start serving up personalized ads to searchers says marissa mayer googles vice president for search products &amp user experience another possibility reflecting a users interest in watching videos or searching inside books meanwhile smaller companies are adopting their own approaches to personalization search service collarity inc which licenses its personalization technology to third party web sites also offers a personalized search on its own site collarity com users who register with an email address can have their search weighted towards things they have searched for by moving a slider bar toward a "personal" setting as opposed to a "community" or "global" setting ilor llcs prefound com recently launched a new version of its search site that allows searchers to create profiles describing their interests and to specify the degree to which they want their search results to reflect those interests still efforts to personalize search results have flopped before largely because they asked the user to do too much heavy lifting such as voting on the relevance of their results often too the services werent widely enough used to draw any meaningful results yahoo inc says it has experimented with using search histories to tailor results for individuals but it doesnt favor this approach at least partly because the results didnt differ enough for users to see a big impact eckart walther yahoos vice president of product for web search says the companys research shows there are perils to personalizing search results "if you get it right people really like it " he says "if you get it wrong they dislike it even more " also some people are reluctant to share information in response to fears that the search companies or others who got their hands on the data could use them to send them unwanted ads or even find out intimate details like a home address with personalization "your search history is really tied to you " says search engine expert danny sullivan the editor of industry publication search engine land owned by third door media inc "and there is a chance it could backfire " companies stress that they take users privacy seriously "we know we need to maintain user privacy and make the privacy tradeoffs very clear to the user " says googles ms mayer collarity doesnt even collect ip addresses "we are young " says levy cohen chief executive of palo alto calif based collarity com "we know we have to establish as much trust as possible " the companies are betting that as technology improves the results for example discounting a previous search for a gift which doesnt reflect a users own interests personalization will take off new technologies could also help companies make more money off search traffic since users are more apt to click on ads pegged to results that match their interests some users are finding that the new services save them time kim dees a year old health care administrator says the interests she loaded into her prefound profile helped her find what she wanted faster when ms dees of ghent ky sought information on solar panels she found what she was looking for classes on how to install them not big commercial vendors which she attributes to having stored her zip code and phrases like "do it yourself " ms dees says she doesnt mind sharing her interests with prefound as long as she gets something in return other companies are trying different models of personalization yahoo is pursuing what mr walther calls personalized search based on social factors one service called myweb provides users with links to sites flagged by themselves their friends or their friends friends when they search yahoo says it addresses privacy concerns by requiring users to indicate theyre willing for others to see what theyve flagged search engine eurekster offers swickis self customized search engines that can be embedded for free on any web site publishers and individuals can create swickis on any topic and eureksters technology customizes the search results based on those topics and the search behavior of those who use it says steven marden eureksters chief executive "its somewhat personalization but based instead on the communities you are visiting "
