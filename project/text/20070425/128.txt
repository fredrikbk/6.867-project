politics &amp economics mccain gears up to make his case war stance could erode support but campaign sees flawed rivals charleston s c in a state that has celebrated the lost cause since the civil war john mccain met last week with reporters amid the old confederate defenses of this citys waterfront with the senator plainly tired and suffering from a cold south carolinas house speaker bobby harrell provided the energy he introduced the arizona republican as the one presidential candidate who "will make sure that what i think is the most important issue in this campaign" the war in iraq "gets the treatment it needs " today mr mccain travels north to new hampshire to begin a five state tour officially launching his presidential campaign even as some in both parties are wondering whether his is a lost cause given the senators identity as chief supporter of the bush administrations unpopular war policies mr mccain is scornful of the naysayers in fact the former vietnam prisoner of war is gearing up to make the election a referendum on the iraq war with himself as the candidate best able to bring it to an honorable end "i believe the transcendent issue of the primary and the general election will be who is best equipped to fight this new challenge from radical islamic extremism i dont need any on the job training i dont need time to develop ill hit the ground running " he said in an interview "i may not be the president for all times but im the president for these times " and "over time " he added enough voters will see that mr mccains optimism meanwhile stems from a more basic and compelling calculation for all the talk of his demise it takes someone to beat someone and each of mr mccains rivals has vulnerabilities lately much of the attention has been on mr mccains at he looks older than in when he lost to george w bush his face is scarred from major surgery that year for skin cancer mr mccain refused some advisers urgings to have cosmetic surgery and his skin is pasty from his zealous avoidance of the sun the senator has lost his lead in national polls of republican voters to former new york mayor rudy giuliani and was well behind former massachusetts gov mitt romney in first quarter fund raising yesterday mr mccain replaced his finance director of more long term damage republicans and democrats said were mr mccains much publicized comments earlier this month that things were better in baghdad as he strolled in a market there with military protection he has lost the popular "straight talk" brand of his campaign strategists said as an antiwar electorate hears double talk "thats life which isnt fair " mr mccain said "it is ironic " he added that for several years "i was the greatest critic of the way the war was being conducted " and among the first republicans to call for defense secretary donald rumsfeld to go but now president bushs strategy of adding troops in baghdad "is showing signs of success even though weve only got three of the five brigades over there " mr mccain said he wont mute his defense of it hours later at a mansion fund raiser he tells several dozen republicans "if we withdraw from iraq there will be chaos and genocide in the region and they will follow us home when we lost the war in vietnam they didnt want to follow us home " he closes "if we fail in iraq well have a whole lot more things to worry about than whatever happened to my political ambitions " yet he and his advisers make the case instead for a mccain victory "every other campaign would trade places with us " chief strategist john weaver says the campaign says it has the best organization in early nominating contest states and republicans there agree true mr mccain trails mr giuliani in national polls of republicans to the mayors with for mr romney and for the undeclared former tennessee sen fred thompson in a new wall street journal nbc news poll but mr giulianis standing has been eroding in recent polls while mr romneys is static more important mr mccain leads or is in a dead heat with mr giuliani in the early contest states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina mr mccains war stance though it has dragged down his overall popularity remains an asset among republican voters the rub is that republicans also want an electable nominee and many are unnerved by mr mccains identification with iraq as for his fund raising mr mccain said that will improve in the second quarter as the senator himself gets more personally involved "im not very good at asking" for money said the co sponsor of the mccain feingold campaign finance law fund raising can be fixed said south carolina sen lindsey graham a mccain ally but "its hard to fix a record that isnt conservative " mr mccain has a quarter century conservative record against abortion rights gay rights and gun control while messrs giuliani and romney have been on the other side on each though mr romney recently has switched many republicans are just learning this youtube and similar internet sites are particularly troublesome for the men with their links to old video clips of mr romney boasting of his abortion rights beliefs and mr giuliani espousing public funding of abortions some conservatives loathe mr mccain for his authorship of the campaign finance law limiting their groups spending on election advertising as well as for his bipartisan work on issues such as global warming the war issue aside he is also seeking their support based on his longstanding reputation as a scourge of pork barrel spenders yet the social issues are the litmus tests of the republican electorate and with those his rivals are on the defensive mr giulianis recent divorce and mr romneys mormonism also are problems for some party conservatives helen mims an year old charleston republican was at the waterfront to see mr mccain "that man has been tested tried and proven" in war she said mr giuliani "i dont have any good opinion of him " as for mr romney "oh my gosh are you kidding never let us fall in that category" she means his mormon religion but said she wont say it "it is a dangerous cult " with roughly a third of republican voters telling pollsters they are dissatisfied with the field others weigh late entries mr thompson privately has told republicans he is getting in and former house speaker newt gingrich has left the door open but each man likewise has liabilities "i continue to believe mccain is in a better position to be nominated and elected than any of the others " said longtime republican strategist charlie black who had considered remaining neutral but recently allied with mr mccain "hes still a great campaigner especially now that theyve gone back to the bus tours his position on the issues fits the caucus goers and primary voters more than the other guys " and unlike the other men mr black added "hes totally known and vetted he may make a mistake but youre not going to learn anything new negative about him "
