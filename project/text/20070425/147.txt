timing market with thresholds is rewarding champagne corks were popping again on wall street friday after the dow jones industrial average closed at a new record was it just eight weeks ago that the average plunged points back in february i promised that the nasdaq composite would again reach my selling threshold of above it hit that target on feb and hovered at that level for a such a brief time that many investors failed to take advantage of it but i urged you to be prepared for the next time last monday the nasdaq again closed just above the window had closed by wednesday with the nasdaq again below then on friday came a broad based rally and the nasdaq broke through again whats the magic of on the nasdaq anyway that number represents a gain on the nasdaq from its most recent interim low i use a simple disciplined system of buying and selling i sell at intervals of gains and buy at intervals of declines these easy to compute thresholds are based on the historical gains and losses in the nasdaq during bull and bear markets this is a modest approach to market timing one that works remarkably well friday was a red letter day for another reason the call options i sold on devon energy last september were set to expire and they promised to be a cliffhanger on monday crude oil futures rose above &# a barrel this would ordinarily be deemed bearish for the market which seems to be shrugging it off but it has vindicated the energy strategy i recommended last fall a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price my strategy then was to sell devon calls the may s for &# each and buy chevron calls the january s for &# each for a while i thought it likely id have to deliver the devon shares or buy back the options since they traded above &# several days last week i only sell covered calls meaning i own the underlying shares and can deliver them if necessary but despite fridays rally they closed just under &# i kept the proceeds and my shares meanwhile thanks to rising oil prices my chevron calls have soared and were recently trading at &# more than double what i paid for them with oil prices approaching &# and gas prices near &# a gallon it soon may be time to take some profits in the oil sector or sell more calls on energy stocks but not yet with the nasdaq over there are other candidates to sell this time i again sold calls if the call premiums were rich and sold shares as before i targeted stocks with high price to growth ratios i sold cytyc p f chang and monaco coach i sold calls on cymer ive sold so many calls over the years on cymer without ever delivering shares that i think of it as my leading cash cow i looked into selling flir systems calls but didnt find any at attractive prices i still may reduce my flir position i also sold agilent comverse technology and symantec shares as well as calls on network appliance and goldman sachs in the case of goldman a stock ive recommended repeatedly it has done so well that it has become significantly over weighted in my portfolio i sold the october s for &# each still i feel comfortable maintaining goldman as a core holding in other words its been a busy and gratifying week this is unusual since i advocate a buy and hold approach that minimizes transaction costs i was a little wistful parting with stocks like cytyc and p f chang that have done well and ive owned for many years i hope they and their shareholders continue to prosper
