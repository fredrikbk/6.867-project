the yeltsin legacy in boris yeltsin transformed into a larger than life figure like most such characters his legacy is inevitably a mixed one mostly because no one could have controlled the forces unleashed during the collapse of the soviet union nor could anyone have lived up to the expectations of the tens of millions of soviet citizens expecting positive and immediate change even today his harshest critics from disparate political quarters fail to achieve anything resembling a consensus on what yeltsin should have done differently perhaps the most important thing yeltsin did was something he did not do when he took power after the blackest pages of post communist russian history had been turned in october and after several bloody days in moscow yeltsin declined to do what his opponents almost surely would have done wipe out the other side for the first time in russian history the new ruler did not eliminate the losers to consolidate control whats more eventually they were integrated into the political process yeltsin called for immediate elections and accepted an independent parliament out of nowhere the career bureaucrat leapt to the front lines armed with an instinct for breaking down barriers and opening doors long closed and yet yeltsins inconsistency was boundless he allowed regional leaders to have more power but then dived into the tragic war in chechnya he waged battle against special privileges for the elites but later opened the floodgates for the oligarchs to loot the country he promoted free and fair elections but in the end he couldnt accept that popular will could decide supreme power yeltsins presidency was always a struggle between his democratic instincts and an entire life spent in the nomenclatura he owed his power to the street but he was bred an insider an autocrat yeltsins nature mirrored the duality of the system openness versus secrecy free will versus control in the end the devil won out with the appointment of vladimir putin the rise of a kgb lieutenant colonel to the presidency only completed yeltsins fall from grace it was the logical final step after a long slow slide the start of the chechen war was the first obvious step away from guiding moral principles decisions started to be made behind closed doors among the inner circle the poisonous atmosphere of secrecy began to spread yeltsins second term was a nightmare on almost every front by he had outlived his moment and it would have been best for a democratically elected successor to follow him at that point but so many of us were afraid afraid of a return to communist rule even by democratic means we because i was among them put ideology ahead of the process and we are still paying the price today that year marked the change from open democracy to managed democracy it was clear yeltsin couldnt stay in power with fair elections and the abuses quickly mounted from that point on the putin police state was all but predestined mr putin only had to follow his own instincts and carry through what was already in motion yeltsin failed the final and most important test the fragile democratic structures he allowed to form could not survive his own need for power he failed to create lasting institutions the structure relied on his leadership and the freedoms that existed were there only because he allowed it there was no way such a system could withstand the failure of the ruler who created it worst of all his collapse poisoned the minds of the russian people against what they saw as uncontrolled capitalism and democracy the oligarchs who took power prevailed over the good of the people russians saw no benefits from the supposed blessings of elections and the free market the new ruling elite was formed out of the old bureaucrats and the new technocrats united in their indifference to the values of liberal democracy the fights among them at the end of the s to find yeltsins successor could have gone differently but democracy was sure to be the loser they quickly recognized that elections and a free media could only threaten their grip on power it was no coincidence that yeltsins hand picked successor came from the kgb missed opportunities were inevitable considering the magnitude of the changes and problems that confronted yeltsin its still early to analyze what he could have done better but it is relatively simple to compare how things have gone since mr putin took over in there was chaos but yeltsin never attacked individual freedoms mr putin has built his entire presidency to be the opposite of the yeltsin years with a great deal of success the entire government has been brought under the direct control of the president the parliament attempted to impeach yeltsin at one point now it is a puppet show the corruption of the oligarchs has been moved inside the kremlin walls where it has expanded to staggering levels the media which was free to criticize yeltsin is entirely at the service of the putin administration the economy is is the biggest difference although most of the credit must go to the simple fact that during mr putins tenure the price of oil went from &# a barrel to nearly &# and even with these untold energy riches the average russian is seeing little improvement in his standard of living yeltsin had more than his share of faults but he was a real person he had virtues and vices in his flesh and blood we exchanged him for a shadow of a man who wants only to keep us all in perpetual darkness the long lines of russians waiting to pay their respects to yeltsins coffin at a moscow cathedral demonstrate that despite his many failures people sensed the possibility for good in what he attempted boris yeltsin is gone and precious little remains of the freedoms he ushered in his spirit however will not die with him daylight is starting to show through the cracks of the kgb facade as the system runs out of resources to plunder soon it will again be time for building and rebuilding in russia mr kasparov former world chess champion is a contributing editor at the wall street journal and chairman of the united civil front of russia see related letter "letters to the
