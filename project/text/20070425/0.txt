a cultural conversation with martin amis both fiction and journalism are fertile territory for him new york martin amis excels at descriptions of creepy men sweaty misogynists soused lowlifes and thugs take as an example this passage from his recent novel "house of meetings" about a brute in a soviet gulag "his eyes were positively flamboyant looking at those eyes you felt not just fear but also the kind of depression that would normally take a week to build " the book is narrated by an introspective rapist and set mostly in a labor camp humiliation starvation and violent competition for shovels and bunk space set the scene for of all things a love triangle involving two prisoner brothers after reading the book it was a relief to meet mr amis in person he is easygoing flawlessly polite britannically correct in accent and physically meager and there seemed no need to worry that hed been mining his own character for his fictional villains im small but as he approached me in a new york hotel i felt pretty sure i could take him out in a pub brawl he ordered wine for himself i suspect just so i would not feel awkward doing so he barely touched his glass he rose from our table twice to ask a waiter to turn down the music so that my tapes would later be audible mr amis now staring down and the father of five children no longer resembles charles highway the hormonal oxford cramming protagonist of his first autobiographical novel "the rachel papers " since his flashy literary debut at age when he wore a groovy shag haircut and was best known as the prodigious son of kingsley amis making him predictably a target of gossip and envy he has produced a dozen novels including "money " "london fields " "the information" and "times arrow " but he has slipped back and forth over the border that separates journalism and fiction and has been drawn lately to dark historical themes "house of meetings" is his second book on stalinism the first a work of nonfiction was "koba the dread " the two forms fiction and journalism inform each other he says "as often happens you look into something as a journalist and then a couple of years later you write your immediate response which is your rational response then it trickles down into some other part of you where your novels come from usually known as the unconscious the subliminal " the "house of meetings" of his recent title was an out building where gulag prisoners were allowed on rare tormented occasions to see their wives "it was a kind of holdover from the ridiculous ideas of the bolsheviks they liked to be very modern and hip and thought it would be very adult they were very puritanical the bolsheviks but they had this idea that the prisoners should be able to see their wives imagine having conjugal visits in auschwitz it wasnt as bad as auschwitz though i believe it wasnt as bad " mr amis is often praised for his "mastery of the english language " which shouldnt be considered noteworthy in one who writes books for a living in english but his virtuosity becomes glaring in conversation he does not so much talk as assemble flawless paragraphs in the air fielding subjects from tax cuts to teen fashion sometimes in sympathy with the left mr amis doesnt hew to any ideological orthodoxy but is disturbed by the moral mushiness of some britons on the subject of islamist extremism he has been called islamophobic but says "islamismophobic" would be a better though still imperfect term "its islamismophobia the situation in britain is ridiculous and contemptible some left wing people its a bit insulting to the left to call them that see someone with a grievance who hasnt got white skin and they think well we must have done something really horrible to them theres this masochistic view that we cant be right about anything the woozy left has made itself an apologist for a creedal wave that is racist misogynist homophobic totalitarian imperialist and genocidal but at least theyre not white "the guardian is a great paper but they print osama bin laden on the op ed page with a byline and ive said islamismophobia is not the right word either because a phobia is an irrational or exaggerated fear and it is neither irrational nor exaggerated to fear a movement that wants you dead and has said it wants you dead this great gust of irrationality coming from the middle east we meet it with another gust of irrationality " while mr amis is tough minded on islamist extremism he thinks the war on terror has been badly bungled and he has distinctly mixed feelings about president bush "im not an automatic bush hater there is a vast plurality of people in europe who thirst for the failure of iraq just because they hate george bush i was against the war but the minute it started from the opening salvo of shock and awe i wanted it to work " mr amis famous son of a famous writer now talks about mr bush son of a president as one might a literary character "im very interested in how his whole persona has changed do you remember around and his body language was that of someone looking for a fight even his walk was very drunk with power now his upper lip has stopped working he cant smile im glad to see it think of the difference between lincoln at the start of the civil war and lincoln at the end this beautiful man emaciated by war by the distress and pain of it and bush is showing it in his sinews and his glands its taking a very heavy toll on him and so it should " the narrative mr amis spins is tragicomic "no human being in history had a power rush like bush did on september the th american hegemony up until then had been a matter of graphs and pie charts on september the th it became a matter of possible boots on the ground america was revealed as the most powerful country that had ever been so far ahead of the next countries combined so thats a mitigating factor you wouldnt expect any human being to be able to absorb that kind of elevation he was a tax cutting seat warmer until september the th then he was the war president it was a huge rush of power " it couldnt have happened in europe "in the european culture the political class they school them on the corrupting effects of power the reason it was inculcated in the political class in old europe wasnt just mental hygiene it was because a corrupt mind makes corrupt decisions " in a deeper deconstruction of the presidents soul however mr amis gives him credit for exceptional social courage "in one veterans hospital alone bush has made visits to severely injured troops and thats a lot if i were president id try to keep it down to three or perhaps two or maybe one or maybe not visit at all i mean its so impossibly painful some people have said to me that they think its very emotional and that hes addicted to that but id give him the benefit of the doubt and say thats brave to do that to go and confront the results of your policies " martin amis knows how it feels to be criticized he has been accused of demeaning women in his fiction yet he puts such alleged misdemeanors into perspective when he speaks in quaint s slang about islamic fundamentalists "they hate us they hate chicks too " he refers to bernard henri levis journalism on the subject "at the training camps you hear about in afghanistan and pakistan if you go to one of those if youre a young jihadi in the morning its suicide bombs in the afternoons its ieds and in the evenings its hating women thats what they hate about the west they say its all this other stuff but what they hate is the equality of women because theyre a patriarchy and thats their last fiefdom heres what a fundamentalist muslim feels when he sees you driving a car he feels dishonored its hard to get your head around that isnt it its a psychology which has been solidified over centuries generations " modernity produces its own share of irrational behavior mr amis believes and in "house of meetings" he touches upon the prison fashion body cutting and anorexia of prosperous american youths they are a ghostly echo he suggests of the horrors of past centuries of the gulag for instance where one didnt have a choice about being starved or wounded divorce he says is another way in which we do to ourselves what wars and slave labor camps once did it separates men from their women and children he theorizes that it is a way of "punishing yourself for your privilege for not having had to endure the sufferings of history its the numbness of advanced democracy and the market state " when asked about tony blair mr amis smiles tolerantly as if at a hopelessly slow pupil "my dear it doesnt matter what anyone thinks of blair in any but the local bitchy gossip sense in british politics you go along with americans because it gives you influence at the top table " but on the genesis of that special bond a churchillian flourish or two slips into his language delivered with oxonian confidence in that "masterpiece theatre" voice "when england ceased to be a great power after the second world war broken by the war and pauperized by the war it turned to america the fantasy was we were greece to your rome we would advise you our wisdom as an ex colonial power would guide the young turk the young bull of america " things didnt work out that way though "our influence has been shown to be practically nil blair had one thing that he could offer bush on the run in to iraq bush needed didnt need it absolutely but it was awfully nice for bush that the american people heard approval for the war in an english accent " ms finnerty writes for the journal on culture and the arts
