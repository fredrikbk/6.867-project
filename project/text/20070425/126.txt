republican residue the fbi raided two republican congressmen earlier this month and we cant muster much sympathy their misbehavior is the residue of the gops lost arrogant congressional majority which allowed its principles to atrophy if the republicans hope to retake congress in theyd do well to eliminate the habits that created these scandals in the first place on april the fbi raided the north virginia home of california representative john doolittle as part of its investigation into lobbyist felon jack abramoff mr doolittles wife julie received tens of thousands of dollars in payments from mr abramoff for consulting work that remains "undefined " mr doolittle subsequently petitioned the bureau of indian affairs on behalf of an iowa tribe one of mr abramoffs clients that was seeking a federal go ahead for a casino mr doolittle is also under investigation for helping to steer millions of dollars in military funding to and accepting thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from a defense contractor implicated in the duke cunningham bribery imbroglio in a separate case the fbi searched the family business of rick renzi looking into allegations that the arizona representative profited from a federal land swap as a quid pro quo for his support for the deal mr renzi allegedly insisted that a mining company buy a acre alfalfa field owned by a former business partner and may have received kickbacks in return neither congressman is yet under indictment and both deny any wrongdoing if they eventually are charged theyll be innocent until proven guilty like anybody else still the fbi does not conduct raids against sitting members of congress without probable cause to their credit john boehner and the house gop leadership acted decisively messrs doolittle and renzi resigned from their prominent committee posts at appropriations and intelligence respectively at least until the matters are resolved the move was a promising sign that the republicans are serious about changing their ways but we wonder why similar pressure wasnt exerted against others suspected of ethical transgressions exhibit a is california representative jerry lewis despite a federal probe into allegations that mr lewis directed hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarked funds to his friends and political allies he was nonetheless reappointed to appropriations as ranking member given the earmarking scandals the gop needs someone on that committee who is above suspicion and not involved in the "favor factory" culture mr lewiss fellow california republican gary miller also hasnt been properly disciplined by the house leadership the fbi is investigating whether mr miller failed to properly report several lucrative land deals hence avoiding millions in taxes like mr lewis mr millers presence on the financial services committee erodes the gops fiscal bona fides he was the ringleader behind weakening rules to rein in fannie mae and create an "affordable housing" fund that devotes another &# million per year to congressional favors no doubt there are other instances of lax ethical enforcement which is precisely the sort of passivity that cost the republican majority in the last election the gop has the opportunity to reclaim the congress next year but this is a perishable fruit it will rot fast if the party is still in thrall to the status quo ante see related letter "letters to the editor accusations based on partisan politics" wsj april
