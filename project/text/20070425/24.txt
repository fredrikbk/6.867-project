business bookshelf the retirement that roared where have all the leaders gone by lee iacocca with catherine whitney scribner pages &# to borrow a movie phrase from the s the anachronism seems strangely appropriate lee iacocca is mad as hell and hes not gonna take it anymore he thinks you shouldnt either "where the hell is our outrage " mr iacocca demands to know on the first page of "where have all the leaders gone " "we should be screaming bloody murder weve got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff weve got corporate gangsters stealing us blind " forget his mixed metaphor about a ship and a cliff the real head scratcher comes a few dozen pages later when after all his opening vitriol mr iacocca offers this advice to the nations leaders "lets start by toning down the rhetoric " the man should heed his own counsel but consistency never was mr iacoccas strong suit when he ran chrysler between and he loudly griped about imported japanese cars only to order billions of dollars of japanese made parts for use in chrysler cars in this book his third mr iacocca continues to rail about imports and about lots of other things among them president bush "things change and you get creative you adapt maybe bush was absent the day they covered that at harvard business school " manly character "a leader must have courage im talking about balls that even goes for female leaders " complacency "its not too late but its getting pretty close so lets shake off the horse and go to work lets tell em all weve had enough " by this point in the book i had had enough alas i was only on page of a roughly page diatribe the thought occurred to me that mr iacocca now should calm down and take up golf like other rich retirees no chance the books penultimate chapter is titled "get off the golf course and do something " but lets give credit where credit is due mr iacocca was a brilliant executive and effective leader chryslers improbable revival in the early s stemmed largely from the force of his personality as well as from the talents of the executives he persuaded to join a company close to death "pick good people and set the right priorities " he now writes describing his management mantra and he did it remarkably well back then he also produced a riveting autobiography "iacocca " in it described his modest roots his rapid rise through the ranks of ford motor his celebrated sacking in by henry ford ii and the chrysler comeback it was a delicious tale spiced with gossip insider knowledge and a lust for revenge the comeback the book and mr iacoccas ubiquitous television commercials made him the prototypical celebrity ceo and even spurred talk of his running for president in "where have all the leaders gone " mr iacocca assesses the current crop of presidential candidates john mccain has courage and character he says but might lack political conviction rudy giuliani has courage but might lack character hillary clinton has common sense and competence but "theres a question mark about character and conviction hanging over her head " barack obamas competence is unproved and so on and so what there arent any special insights here likewise mr iacoccas prescriptions for an ailing detroit are both familiar and wanting he still demands that the government help the u s auto industry by addressing "the trade imbalance especially japans manipulation of the yen and its closed markets " but then he concedes that detroit has ignored the small car market and has been "shamefully late" on hybrids he also declares that "closing saturn should be a no brainer" for general motors while ford should dump jaguar land rover and maybe even mercury so it seems that detroits wounds are largely self inflicted and thus beyond government help theres that consistency thing again more interesting is the chapter that mr iacocca devotes to his former company chrysler is now part of daimlerchrysler and the german corporate parent is looking to unload its money losing american subsidiary its a sorry mess for which mr iacocca blames himself indirectly admitting that his hand picked successor bob eaton shouldnt have made the deal with daimler "ill always believe that if i hadnt chosen bob eaton to succeed me as chief executive at chrysler it would still be a strong profitable american car company " he writes "that was my mistake eaton was my call and i screwed up " a few years after his retirement at age mr iacocca tried to regain the chrysler throne he allied himself with billionaire kirk kerkorians attempt to take the auto maker private mr iacocca now says that this move inadvertently panicked mr eaton into accepting daimlers takeover offer after all this maneuvering mr iacocca tried to find other ways of spending his time he joined the board of a california based restaurant chain called no kidding koo koo roo he tried selling electric bicycles to aging yuppies but that went nowhere "i flunked retirement " he writes mr iacocca really deserved his hero celebrity status when he saved chrysler a quarter century ago now he deserves to relax mr ingrassia vice president of news strategy for dow jones won a pulitzer prize in for his reporting on the auto industry for this newspaper
