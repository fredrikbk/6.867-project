the daily fix bulls rout heat for a win suns do the same to the lakers online edition it seems like old times for the chicago bulls strong performances from ben gordon points and luol deng points in the fourth quarter led the bulls to a decimation of the miami heat and a lead in the series in the chicago sun times jay mariotti starts out in "braveheart" mode but quickly tosses readers a curve "between raging human lungs clacking giveaway thunderstix and a relentless blitz of jock rock the big cave on west madison hasnt been this loud in oh nine years " he writes "all the losing all the angst all the jerry krause screwups all the michael jordan separation anxiety all of it was drowned out tuesday night by fans who finally were able to let loose about a legitimate basketball team they did because the bulls still growing and quite unpredictable finally cleared a competitive hurdle putting it bluntly they did not choke " in assigning credit mr mariotti notes that the bulls "play a team game spawned by coach scott skiles system for the first time after more than our share of questions we can declare its working to the point the league is buzzing excitedly mute any talk about dwyane wades injury limitations shaquille oneals officiating complaints home cooking or a fluky youthful uprising after two games the bulls are simply the better team " sticking with the sun times greg couch looks at ben wallace perhaps headed for a showdown with his old team the detroit pistons mr wallaces job has been to harass oneal and so far hes done so superbly "shaq was determined to get the ball and get in position to impose his size " mr couch writes "and wallace was pushing into his back slapping at the ball harassing him other bulls would collapse to help out of course and at times when oneal had position wallace knew to get out of the way and not to foul see wallace didnt dominate the game he cant do that anymore thats why the detroit pistons didnt want to give him the huge bucks the bulls did and for all that money the bulls got a role player a &# million role player and as ridiculous as that sounds if this is the role and that was the cost it took to get him then thats good enough " in the miami herald dan le batard reminds readers that these same heat trailed the dallas mavericks last year and came back to win a title but are these the same heat he doesnt sound so sure "miamis season feels about as fragile as dwyane wades shoulder today " he writes adding "the heat revolves around a solar system named shaquille oneal and the intergalactic wade both are extraordinarily efficient players but they werent tuesday each missed more than half his shots together they turned the ball over as if it were covered in mayonnaise as many bad things happened when they touched the ball as good things nobody in the game lost the ball as much as shaq and wade seven times each " maybe youve heard shaq used to play on a team with a guy named kobe bryant the two are no longer teammates but they were united in futility last night bryants los angeles lakers also got steamrolled by the phoenix suns and also find themselves in an series hole in the los angeles times bill plaschke begins with bryant driving to the basket near halftime and drawing a foul "it was the kind of tough play the lakers had been avoiding " he writes "it was the sort of effort the lakers had been missing yet as bryant walked to the foul line he walked alone no teammate slapped his hand no teammate patted his back no teammate even behaved remotely like a teammate not only didnt the lakers seem to care about the phoenix suns they didnt seem to care about each other " which leads mr plaschke to a harsh question "how much longer can bryant stand to be a laker " in the east shaun powell of newsday looks at another restless superstar lebron james whose cleveland cavaliers have a edge in their series against the undermanned washington wizards "two days ago after he drove to the hoop and landed awkwardly james clutched his ankle and somewhere in the nba offices david stern no doubt clutched his heart " he writes "the one player the nba simply cant afford to lose certainly not this early in the playoffs was wincing and the commissioner probably held his breath fortunately for stern and the league james kept playing therefore theres no reason to cancel the postseason " king james is also on the mind of the washington posts mike wise who looks at what the nbas franchises might call the "superstar problem" one personified for the wizards by their own star gilbert arenas "try appeasing a moody year old multinational conglomerate " mr wise writes of mr james "try begging your homegrown meal ticket akrons own who brought back the fans and legitimacy not to exercise an opt out clause in his contract in the summer of try convincing the kid that cleveland should always be bron brons nesting place besides winning a championship keeping a franchise player happy and making him believe he should spend the most productive years of his career in your city has become the primary goal of many teams in a league in which stars have more leverage than any other major team sport clevelands problem is a window into the nbas dilemma and washingtons " the philadelphia phillies are finally starting to come around after a dismal start but while their fans have pilloried the likes of manager charlie manuel and left fielder pat burrell shortstop jimmy rollins has escaped criticism despite putting a bulls eye on the phils with his spring comment that they were the team to beat in the nl east why because as sam donnellon writes in the philadelphia daily news he "wears a bulls eye well " "rather than retreat from his prediction or even redefine the debate on fairer terms rollins response has been pretty basic and simple bring it on " mr donnellon writes wondering "should the phillies ever find their way into the postseason what type of reputation would he build would he seize the moment or be swallowed by it would he provide big swings as lenny dykstra did here in and in new york in is rollins a red light player in waiting or yet another philadelphia would be icon whose bark is worse than his bite " "he introduces himself as a forensic pathologist which means he is trained to examine dead people " writes les carpenter in the washington post "he explains that hes also a neuropathologist which means he is trained to examine dead peoples brains he says all this through a thick accent that is the result of a childhood spent in nigeria then there is the matter of what he is seeking in those calls the brains of recently deceased professional football players coming over the phone in slightly broken english with a complicated explanation of a medical phenomena that most coroners have never heard of or believe to be true the request to have the brain pulled from the freshly deceased players head and shipped here to be studied might as well come from mars " the "he" in this case is bennet omalu what hes looking for is evidence that repeated concussions in football lead to early onset dementia a cousin of the boxing ailment known as "punch drunk syndrome " and while what he says hes found in the brains of three dead nfl players isnt universally accepted by others in his field its more frightening evidence of a crisis football looks like
