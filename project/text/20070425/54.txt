ex finance chief says jobs misled him on options apple ceo may face new questions on role in backdating grants apple inc s former chief financial officer in a striking public statement asserted that chief executive steve jobs misled him about board actions on stock options awards and that he told mr jobs the computer maker might have to take a charge against earnings if it backdated stock options grants which the company didnt do the allegations by fred anderson a partner in a silicon valley private equity firm could complicate efforts by mr jobs to stay above the options backdating fray which has swept up apple and more than other companies in federal investigations and forced about corporate executives out of their jobs an option gives its holder the right to buy a stock at a fixed price typically translating into profit only when the stock rises backdating an option which provides more profit potential to the recipient violates securities law when shareholders are told as they were at apple that grants were made at the market price on the date of grant apple has acknowledged backdating options grants and said mr jobs helped select dates for some of the backdated grants but the company has steadfastly contended that he isnt guilty of any wrongdoing in part because he didnt "appreciate the accounting implications" of backdating options in deciding whether to bring criminal or civil charges over possible securities law violations prosecutors often focus on the question of intent which includes whether potential defendants knew their actions were wrong in other options cases the government has attempted to show intent by citing evidence that executives knew earnings charges should be taken and took action to avoid that mr anderson speaking through his attorney after settling securities and exchange commission charges related to his own alleged role in backdating at apple contradicted the defense of mr jobss role the former apple executive said he warned mr jobs in late january while apple was in the process of backdating a grant that apple might have to take an accounting charge if apple didnt price stock options to its executive team based on the date the board approved the grant the cupertino calif company didnt take a charge at the time but later restated earnings to account for backdating the attorneys statement also alleged that mr jobs had misled mr anderson by telling him that apples board "had given its prior approval" to the grant when in fact it hadnt mr andersons allegations about his former boss came as the sec as expected also filed civil charges yesterday in federal court in san jose calif against former apple general counsel nancy heinen for her alleged role in backdating options and falsifying company records to conceal the fraud ms heinens attorneys denied she backdated options or committed fraud and vowed to fight the charges mr jobs referred a request for comment to katie cotton an apple spokeswoman who said the company had no comment on the statement by mr andersons attorney the sec yesterday said it was taking no action against apple itself because of its "extraordinary cooperation" in the agencys investigation apple has previously said mr jobs recommended "favorable" dates for some options awards but the secs page complaint provides new details on jan it says ms heinen provided mr jobs with a list of the closing share prices of apples stock for that month and suggested the company use an earlier date to grant options to six senior executives including herself and mr anderson two days later the complaint alleges she told mr anderson "that jobs had agreed to use apples closing price on jan for the executive team grant " yesterdays statement from mr andersons camp was especially surprising because his settlement with the sec over his role in backdating options at apple appeared to put a painful chapter in his career behind him his agreement with the sec allows mr anderson to continue serving as a director and officer of public companies in addition to being a partner at elevation partners a high profile private equity firm in silicon valley mr anderson currently serves on the board of ebay inc and heads its audit committee its ceo meg whitman said in an email yesterday that he "absolutely" would remain there mr anderson agreed to pay about &# million in disgorgement of options profits plus a &# civil penalty without admitting or denying the secs civil fraud allegations sec officials appeared caught off guard by the statement by mr andersons attorney marc fagel head of enforcement for the secs san francisco office declined to comment on the allegations concerning mr jobs but said of mr anderson "no matter what he may have discussed with steve jobs and were not commenting on whether or not that actually happened " mr anderson "had documents in front of him showing that these options were granted with hindsight at that point he the cfo should have taken steps to assure that the financial statements were accurate and he failed to do so " it remains unclear whether mr andersons new allegations will prompt the sec or the san francisco office of the justice department which is conducting a separate investigation of apple to take any action against the apple ceo who has played a crucial role in his companys success although apple shares declined cents yesterday to &# investors appeared to take the sec actions as a sign that mr jobs isnt in any legal jeopardy mr andersons attorney jerome roth declined to address whether his client is prepared or able to provide evidence against mr jobs to the justice department which also is investigating apples backdated options asked about apples previous statements that mr jobs wasnt aware of the accounting implications of backdated stock options mr roth said "were definitely not commenting on steve jobss state of mind what he did or didnt know or what he appreciated or didnt appreciate were simply indicating our understanding of the factual circumstances related to the grant " mr roth said mr anderson made the statements about mr jobs "because it was important that people understand our view of what occurred here and that people not speculate that fred did things he didnt in fact do " how aggressively the u s attorneys office in san francisco will pursue its probe into apple remains unknown in part because the office is in the midst of some turmoil u s attorney kevin ryan recently was dismissed another prosecutor working on the apple case has left and another is on leave according to a person familiar with the matter a spokeswoman at the san francisco office declined to comment the sec complaint against mr anderson and ms heinen focuses on two instances of options backdating at apple in one grant to six senior executives and another to mr jobs that resulted in significant boosts to the companys bottom line and improperly enriched executives in the first case apple in early february finalized a grant of million shares to senior executives including ms heinen and mr anderson when apple shares were trading at &# prior to a subsequent stock split the sec complaint says ms heinen "caused" apple to backdate the grant to the apple executive team to jan when apples share price was substantially lower at &# further the complaint says "heinen also directed her staff to prepare documents that falsely indicated apples board had approved the executive team grant on january " mr anderson was aware of the manner in which the grant was selected and "its impact on apples reported compensation expense should have been clear to him " the complaint says the upshot of the date change for fiscal apple failed to record extra compensation from the options grant which because the stock price had risen above the grant date price caused apple to understate its net loss by according to the sec as recipients of options from that grant ms heinen and mr anderson personally "reaped improper benefits of approximately &# million and &# million respectively " the complaint says ms heinen also played a central role in a grant of million shares to mr jobs later that same year the sec says the complaint says she backdated the grant to mr jobs to oct when apples shares closed at &# though terms of the grant werent finalized until dec when apple shares were at &# that resulted in apple improperly failing to record &# million in compensation expense related to the grant to mr jobs a move that caused apple to overstate its net income by for fiscal the sec complaint provides vivid details of how the backdating process allegedly worked at apple and how ms heinen who was also apples corporate secretary allegedly falsified documents to enable it the problems with the grant to mr jobs began after the board agreed on aug to award him million options and mr jobs became dissatisfied with the schedule that determined when he could cash the options in as the boards compensation committee negotiated with the ceo over the next several months ms heinen became "increasingly concerned about the delay" because apple had missed a november deadline for reporting the specifics of his grant to the sec the complaint says the company also hadnt disclosed the grant to its auditor kpmg the complaint says ms heinen worried that the original august grant date would no longer "withstand scrutiny " suggested that apples compensation committee pick a new grant date for the award in october or november after finalizing the terms of the grant to mr jobs on dec when apple shares close at &# the committee agreed to backdate the options to oct when the stock was at &# according to the sec the complaint accuses ms heinen of directing her staff to prepare fictitious minutes for a "special meeting" of apples board on oct that never occurred and later affixing apples corporate seal to the phony documents the complaint says ms heinen also allegedly caused meeting minutes from actual board and compensation committee meetings in august and october of to be altered to conceal the backdating in response to the sec allegations one of ms heinens attorneys miles ehrlich said "to suggest that ms heinen engaged in fraud is to misunderstand the facts of what happened nancy did not backdate stock options and she didnt deceive anyone either inside or outside the company every action nancy took was fully understood and authorized by apples board of directors was consistent with the interests of the shareholders and consistent with the rules as she reasonably understood them "
