how verizon might avoid ruckus over ceos pay verizon chief executive ivan seidenberg has reason to worry some of the same shareholder activists who targeted former pfizer chief henry mckinnell and former home depot chief robert nardelli for excessive pay last year now have the telecom boss at the top of their hit list messrs mckinnell and nardelli lost their jobs largely as a result will mr seidenberg go as well in todays tumultuous corporate environment thats not an easy question to answer nor is this one who runs the corporation a decade ago most chief executives were firmly ensconced at the top of a corporate hierarchy and only the grossest misdeeds were likely to dislodge them today they seem susceptible to the judgments of a host of outsiders then theres this thorny question whats a ceo worth executive pay has emerged as the achilles heel of the corporate elite the scandals and turmoil of the past half decade have taught corporate chieftains that they need the goodwill of the public to survive and thrive but persuading joe six pack that a chief executive needs to make &# million a year for ho hum performance is no easy task which brings us back to mr seidenberg his total compensation last year was &# included was &# for personal use of the corporate jet and &# to pay a financial planner to help keep track of all that money for investors that pay was for mixed performance anyone who bought the stock when mr seidenberg became sole ceo in april has lost money anyone who bought it at the start of earned a return last year well above the average for s&amp p companies but below others in the telecommunications industry by contrast at&amp t provided a return to shareholders last year and chief executive edward whitacre took in &# million in pay mr seidenbergs critics tend to focus on the lousy five year track record "verizon this year is the poster child for pay for failure " says afl cio secretary treasurer richard trumka the afl cio is trying to convince shareholders to withhold votes for six directors at verizons annual meeting on may thats threatening because the company last year bowed to another shareholder demand and adopted a rule requiring directors to win a majority of votes cast before that directors could be elected with a simple plurality the unions have considerable clout in these elections they not only control their own pension funds but have outsize influence with the large public employee pension funds and even without majority support they can have a big impact last year only a third of shareholders withheld votes from targeted home depot directors and only a quarter withheld votes from targeted pfizer directors but those "no" votes were large enough to send a message the boards subsequently heeded dan pedrotty who runs the afl cios office of investment says another big issue is the fact that verizon "took conflicted advice from a compensation consultant who was doing an enormous amount of business with the company itself " the verizon board dumped that consultant hewitt associates last year after an article in the new york times highlighted the conflict but the union has its own conflicts mr pedrotty argues the campaign against mr seidenberg is about getting better returns for pensioners but the communications workers of america also slated a rally in pittsburgh for may the same day as the verizon annual meeting there which it says will "set the stage for verizon bargaining " mr seidenberg declined to comment his defenders argue he is a transitional ceo who has had to make costly investments in fiber optic lines and other technology that hurt earnings in the short term to enable it to win in the long run moreover two proxy advisory services have come out at least partly defending mr seidenberg in the battle institutional shareholder services has recommended to most of its clients that they oppose the effort to dump verizon directors and glass lewis has recommended withholding votes from just two not all six directors so will he survive at the end of the day thats a decision shareholders have to make after all its their money paying his salary the battle will give them a chance to express their views albeit in a very messy and indirect way verizon shareholders will also have a chance next month to vote on a proposal to give shareholders an advisory vote each year on executive pay an idea thats already in place in britain and that was backed recently by the house of representatives you have to wonder wouldnt that be a simpler way to give shareholders a say
