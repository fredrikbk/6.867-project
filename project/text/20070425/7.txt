more varied interests mr bezos for example used his parched land in the far reaches of west texas last year to test a developmental vehicle for his space flight company blue origin llc while roxanne quimby co founder of cosmetics and candle company burts bees has acquired acreage in the northwoods of maine for conservation to be sure the nations rich have long owned large tracts of land but population growth and urban development have made far flung property more desirable while advances in transportation and communication have made it more accessible that combined with the sort of

dallas based land report llc publisher of the magazine believe the phenomenon merits monthly coverage with a circulation of the land report is distributed free to of the nations largest landowners and to some industry professionals such as real estate brokers "there is an enormous niche that was completely underserved " says eric okeefe the magazines editor but the concentration of land in the

jimmy busque a member of the millinocket town council and a steam plant operator at the local paper mill no on the land report list ms quimby agreed to allow a year of hunting and motorized access on

latest acquisition came in in nebraska where he bought almost acres for about &# million russ miller general manager of turner enterprises inc which manages mr turners land says the profound economic and demographic change under way in the great plains have enabled mr turner to assemble such a large swath why so much "its the only thing that lasts " says mr miller its a declaration mr turner has made in the past echoing the famous line from "gone with the wind " mr kelley who was raised on a farm says he amassed about half of his landholdings before selling his cigarette manufacturing company the land report says he has acres but he puts the total at about million acres since he has redoubled his efforts to build a ranching empire acquiring cattle operations across the country and breeding
