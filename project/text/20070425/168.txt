when it makes sense to buy an actively managed fund fund managers who aim to beat the broad stock market are having a tough time these days thanks to the proliferation of exchange traded funds low cost index tracking vehicles now cover nearly every sector of the stock and bond market and the strong performance of broad market benchmarks last year made many managers look like laggards indeed the year winning streak of one particularly well known index killer legg mason value trusts bill miller came to a screeching halt in when the fund lagged the standard &amp poors stock index now one of investors most cherished mantras about active managers is being challenged by new research it goes like this active managers dont add much value in market segments covered by an army of wall street analysts and heavily traded on exchanges such as u s large cap stocks because their research cant unearth much information that the market doesnt already know but in dustier corners of the market like small cap stocks such managers can pluck undervalued securities from obscurity sounds plausible enough but two recent studies suggest the notion is based on flawed comparisons between active managers and indexes a large cap value index for example is composed mostly of large cap value stocks those that look cheap based on measures such as price to earnings ratios but the average large cap value fund is composed of only about large cap value stocks according to investment research firm morningstar inc the rest is a hodgepodge of other large midsize and small companies including growth stocks when compared against a standard benchmark the large value managers look sluggish only of them beat the morningstar large value index over the five years ended dec but those results might tell us more about the fact that value trounced growth during that period than about active managers skill to better compare indexes against active managers morningstar built benchmarks that more accurately reflect how stock pickers invest its custom large cap value index for example is composed of about large cap value stocks still in a study by morningstar director of fund research russel kinnel stock pickers proved decidedly so so against the custom benchmarks in nine domestic stock fund categories beating the indexes just to of the time those large cap value managers beat the tailor made index of the time a more respectable but hardly awe inspiring record a recent study of active small cap managers by index fund giant vanguard group found a similar pattern when compared against the russell small cap indexes the long term performance of the active managers looks pretty good but the results change substantially against some other widely used benchmarks vanguard found the managers performance even before fees is close to morgan stanley capital internationals small cap indexes for example but after accounting for fees the managers lag the indexes yet strong active managers can be found in almost any market segment the morningstar study compared mutual funds five year annualized returns against their "best fit index " or the index that most closely correlates with their returns sure the winners included small cap funds like buffalo small cap and baron small cap but they also included tcw dividend focused a large cap value fund and fairholme a midcap blend portfolio instead of picking active managers based on sector you should look for low costs and a long term consistent track record since fund expenses reduce returns lower fees mean managers must clear a smaller hurdle to beat the index as the editor of a newsletter about vanguard funds investment adviser daniel wiener knows a thing or two about indexing but he doesnt use index funds as core holdings for clients because hes confident he can find active managers who will beat the market consider buying the active funds that you have "the greatest confidence in " suggests mr kinnel "and use passive index funds in the slots where you cant find anything super compelling " jonathan clements is on vacation
