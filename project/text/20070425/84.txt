lazy europe kolding denmark kolding prepares for german invasion " screamed the headline in denmarks jyllands posten this time around the "invasion" is nothing more threatening than an army of job seekers from south of the border attending a job fair some drove all night others were so desperate to find work that they sneaked in an hour before the fair started only to be expelled when the gates finally opened it was very hectic about germans had signed up for the event but showed up besieging employers the job fair in late january was the first in the region dedicated to attracting german workers giving new meaning to the word gastarbeiter usually reserved for foreign workers coming to not from germany the scene in southern denmark dispels a couple of popular myths about europes labor market the first is that the continent cant change denmark did through innovative reforms going from chronically high unemployment to a labor shortage the other myth is that western europeans wont cross the eus open borders to find work from as far as berlin leipzig and frankfurt germans took to the road in search of employment in denmark hundreds were bused in by fair organizers one of the newly mobile is january polewka a year old mechanic from wolfsburg some kilometers away he arrived in hamburg the night before the fair to catch one of the free buses "because i didnt have money for a hotel i walked around all night until the bus left in the morning " he told me having been unemployed for two years hes ready to travel for a job "ive applied all over germany and even in the netherlands " despite recent improvements german unemployment remains close to in denmark its in the kolding region itself unemployment is the event there was so successful that more fairs are scheduled for this and next month how did denmark become a job mecca much of the credit goes to former prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen no relation to the current prime minister of the same last name mr rasmussen led the government in copenhagen between he now heads the socialist group in the european parliament when mr rasmussen came to power unemployment stood at the economy wasnt growing and the budget deficit was spiraling out of control "there was a terrible mood in the country that nothing could be done " he told me at his office in brussels so the left wing prime minister fast privatized state companies and advanced denmarks "flexicurity" system this neologism describes the combination between the security of scandinavian welfare with the flexibility of a modern market economy "the danish tradition was never focused on long dismissal notices " mr rasmussen said but under his tenure dismissal rules were further loosened about of the danish work force now changes jobs each year while the unemployed continue to enjoy generous benefits his government increased the pressure on them to retrain and accept job offers or loose those benefits "i made the people a sicilian offer so to speak one they couldnt refuse " he jokes about his reform program "its all about rights and duties "once unemployed danes have to be flexible enough to retrain and change career paths mr rasmussen says there is a nixon in china quality to mr rasmussens reforms maybe only a socialist and union man from an underprivileged family of fishermen could have pulled it off "we were so poor that youd think its a lie if i told you everything " he says as the unions former chief economist before becoming prime minister he led the danish workers movement to an understanding of basic economics that still eludes many european policy makers "i had a long struggle to convince the unions that wages cant rise higher than productivity if we want to stay competitive " but his reforms werent easy to implement he remembers a meeting with union members where they had set up four coffins in front of the building "when i passed by one of the guys asked me so poul danes are very informal in which one do you want to be buried in " he recounted with a big smile "lets decide that after the meeting i answered " the basic bargain he struck with the unions was to give him a couple of years to show that his plans would work "if we deliver you deliver " he told them he delivered unemployment fell to and the economy averaged annual growth rates of about between his successor has largely continued his polices with similar success mr rasmussen sees a few lessons here on how to push through politically difficult reforms "start at the beginning of your tenure " is the first commandment he says otherwise the reforms will be hard to push through as lawmakers might balk at supporting unpopular policies close to new elections the reforms must create jobs he also says otherwise they get a bad name that was gerhard schroeders "big mistake " according to mr rasmussen the former german chancellor tightened unemployment benefits but failed to put people to work "explain discuss and take your time to present your ideas " is another rasmussen dictum denmarks flexicurity system may not be a model that the rest of the continent could simply adopt in whole but the direction of the reforms and the way mr rasmussen went about them certainly are until his colleagues south of the border figure that out many more germans checking out those danish job fairs will find his "sicilian offer" hard to refuse mr schwammenthal is an editorial writer for the wall street journal europe
