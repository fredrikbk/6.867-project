sitting in the backyard a bird in my pocket i dont know if scrub jays plan ahead but they are very smart "experiments suggest birds may be capable of planning ahead " marketplace april a few years ago i was sitting in my backyard in california reading a book and eating peanuts in the shell suddenly i had a visitor who eyed the peanuts and me very carefully the scrub jay crept closer until it got the peanut eventually i put the peanuts on my hand and the scrub jay would land and take them i couldnt go outside without a pocket full of peanuts which the bird would see and go in after them the scrub jay became so trusting that its head was completely in the pocket and it allowed me to stroke its breast with the back of my forefinger scrub jays leave the nest to the young at the end of the parenting so i had to start all over with a new group every spring i live in arizona now and havent yet seen any scrub jays i sure miss the little guys patty hughes casa grande ariz
