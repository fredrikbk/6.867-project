beyond parody john conyers democratic chairman of the brand new house antitrust task force worries about the consequences of approving the proposed xm sirius merger on grounds that satellite radio doesnt just compete with itself but with other forms of audio entertainment "if we are to define america as broadly as merger supporters advocate what sort of precedent are we setting for other businesses " he fretted during a hearing on the deal yes please an unlikely precedent against a plague of intellectual corruption and political predation in antitrust mr conyers puts his finger on the source of the trouble market definition federal agencies have two choices when presented with a merger they can find a "problem" in which case their budgets are justified and their walls fill up with scalps or they can find no problem guess which they do take the federal trade commission lawsuit to block a proposed merger of office depot and staples a close parallel to sirius xm the two would have accounted for just of the office supply market but of the market for office supplies purchased from office depot or staples take ftcs failed attempt to block a deal bringing haagen dazs and dreyers under the same roof which in a better world would forever have deprived its promoters of the respect of their peers the agencys case was built on the premise that "superpremium" ice cream doesnt compete with er ice cream and so on with oracle peoplesoft echostar directv blockbuster hollywood video worldcom sprint etc we dont use the word "corrupt" lightly even when modified with the adjective "intellectually " antitrust battles may depend on the illusion of fierce debate about economics but theres only one antitrust establishment in washington whose pre emptive interest is keeping the charade going of course it is hilarious to imagine with democrats holding more sway in washington that theres much hope of this trend being reversed in the case of sirius xm mr conyers need not worry about any precedent never mind that years ago the satellite radio industry didnt exist whereas conventional radio sprawling across the am and fm dials has been around for a century and more motorists can listen to their ipods cds cassettes and dvds too and dont forget the mobile broadband revolution and high def radio revolution just around the corner in the home to treat xm and sirius as an entertainment "monopolist" would make a mockery of the concept to fuss about the distribution technology at all the use of satellites as opposed to terrestrial transmitters is utterly beside the point the business model for both is pay radio in a universe of free radio neither has made a profit naturally leading the opposition is the national association of broadcasters that competitors would lobby against a merger as "anticompetitive" is now accepted without a guffaw even one or two normally sentient commentators have fretted that if the justice department and federal communications commission which have joint custody fail to challenge the merger the nations inventory of antitrust "principles" and "precedents" might be rendered null but those principles and precedents are mostly bunk the fruit of the self interested exertions of the antitrust professionals themselves such whimsies and brainstorms make a poor excuse for brushing aside the rights of companies and their owners rights that are rarely acknowledged in antitrust discussions anymore heres an example with an ingenuity no doubt born of a healthy consulting fee a reputable economist who shall remain nameless recently produced an "analysis" arguing that satellite radio is a distinct marketplace for antitrust purposes because get this "indecent audio content has gravitated" to satellite radio as a result of federal indecency rules were guessing that with the "gravitation" of howard stern to sirius radio listeners can still find plenty on the dial that would qualify in their ears as "indecent " never mind the sociopolitical pathology here is the willingness to provide such arguments in the first place "market definition" has become a kafkaesque cornucopia of pliable concepts to maximize the antitrust enforcers opportunity to tyrannize over the private sector but theres a tsunami coming of which the least is antitrust even the alarm over sarbanes oxley and its effect in driving listed companies offshore or into the hands of private equity is akin to fretting about tennis elbow when the arm may be amputated not when you have congress eagerly promoting bills to put congress in charge of deciding foreign investment inflows to punish energy consumption to prop up a dying private sector labor movement and regulate ceo pay not when you have rampant lou dobbsism among the freshmen democrat class and the partys presidential candidates theres much ruin in a nation quipped adam smith our saving grace is that we still make it attractive for americans to make a living rather than burying them under taxes and enticing them to give up the gainful life in favor of collecting unemployment retirement and disability subsidies as many european societies do we would be unwise to assume however that its our birthright somehow to avoid this policy error among all the others
