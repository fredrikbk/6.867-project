politics &amp economics japans consumer prices may threaten economy tokyo japans economy is growing and its companies are reporting fatter profits but many economists are worried because japanese consumer prices which had been expected to rise are barely budging and that could mean trouble last year as japans economy continued to recover from a more than decade long slump consumer prices rose snapping a seven year string of declines those increases seemed likely to continue helping the country escape deflation or generally falling prices in february however the countrys gauge of core consumer prices slipped from a year earlier mainly due to a decline in oil prices although the oil price decline was expected to be temporary other prices have been falling too holding a tight lid on inflation analysts widely expect the bank of japan when it issues its semiannual economic outlook friday to forecast a rise of just or in japanese consumer prices for the fiscal year ending march that would be down from previous forecasts of in october and in april such near zero inflation could have serious consequences it would put japan at risk of falling back into deflation though most economists think thats unlikely for years falling prices acted as a brake on japanese economic growth by discouraging borrowing and spending economists generally agree that modest inflation helps an economy run more smoothly because companies can expect steadily increasing revenue while costs such as wages are often fixed for several years thats why most of the worlds central banks aim for annual price rises of about or the bank of japan said last year it would regard prices as stable if they rose from zero to a year the lack of inflation here means interest rates will probably stay very low the bank of japans target for short term interest rates is just compared with the federal reserves target for the u s and the european central banks for the euro zone the low rates have encouraged investors to borrow cheap money in japan and invest it elsewhere depressing the value of the yen "it will be very difficult for the boj to raise interest rates when prices are below the range it defines as stable " says teizo taya special counselor for the daiwa institute of research and a former boj policy board member one reason japans lack of inflation is puzzling is that its economy is growing at a healthy clip and such growth normally leads to higher prices in the october december quarter the japanese economy expanded at an annualized pace of faster than the growth pace in the u s "it has almost been perfect conditions for an acceleration of prices " says richard jerram an economist at macquarie securities in tokyo "its very interesting things didnt turn out the way the boj expected " the answer appears to be rooted in demographic shifts such as the aging of japans population as well as long term changes in the japanese economy globalization and other forces have increased the competition for jobs and deregulation has given shoppers more alternatives to mom and pop retailers the biggest long term price declines in japan are in technology related goods and services thats partly because consumers who used to shop mostly at small stores where prices tend to be higher increasingly are shopping at large discount stores or on the internet the shift helped drive down the price of pcs and peripherals by in japan last year compared with in the u s in addition services and housing costs have held steady in japan tracking the overall rise in property prices last year average rents in the u s rose in in japan rent has been flat for two years in a row low interest rates have encouraged landowners in and around big cities to build rental apartments that has added supply in a time of little new demand meanwhile the number of young people in japan is declining and more are choosing to remain single or childless increasing demand for smaller cheaper apartments which pushes down the average price another factor limiting price increases corporations are holding down wages to boost profits which have increased on average every year since that gives workers less money to spend and it means producers need to keep a tight rein on prices one tactic has been to hire more part time workers and temps the ratio of non permanent staff reached of all employees last year up from in
