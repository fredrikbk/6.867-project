big disappointment jack obrien directs puccini il trittico metropolitan opera through may the metropolitan operas new production of puccinis "il trittico" directed by jack obrien harks back to the days when franco zeffirelli held sway in the house its all about being big big sets big voices big gestures douglas w smiths enormous meticulously representational scenery provoked spontaneous applause each time the curtain went up it was all pretty to look at which was a good thing since little else was happening on stage puccinis triptych comprises three quite different one act operas "il tabarro " a verismo shocker in which a jealous barge owner murders his wifes lover "suor angelica " the tale of an aristocratic nun who commits suicide when she learns that her illegitimate child has died and "gianni schicchi " a comedy about a crafty florentine who helps a greedy family collect an inheritance while securing a good chunk of it for himself mr smiths set for "tabarro" was the fanciest the barge the warehouses the quay the high bridge overhead the seine a glimpse of notre dame de paris in the background plus stunning lighting by jules fisher and peggy eisenhauer which moved the time from a brilliant sunset to full darkness with twinkling lights unfortunately most of the principal singers while imposingly loud offered no such subtleties directed by mr obrien whose other recent work includes "the coast of utopia" at lincoln center theater and "hairspray" on broadway they played generic verismo types frederick burchinal who replaced the indisposed juan pons portrayed michele the barge owner as the murderously jealous husband maria guleghinas giorgetta was the unhappy wife and salvatore licitras luigi was the frustrated lover the exception was stephanie blythe who sang frugola the scavenging wife of one of the barge hands paul plishka ms blythe while plenty loud knows how to use her voice to create a character rather than a type she was hopeful affectionate and a bit eccentric one was riveted to her when she was onstage when she left we were back in opera land the overall lack of dramatic specificity was mirrored in the musical performance throughout the evening james levines conducting was loud rhythmically vague and uninflected an imprecise cushion of hazy sound rather than a driving shaping force the usually splendid met orchestra is capable of much better than this and showed it in the following afternoons broadcast of "giulio cesare" under harry bicket "suor angelica" unfolded in a similar manner there was the big set a stone cloister with a church and a lighting coup at the end when rays from heaven symbolizing the virgin marys forgiveness of angelicas suicide poured down and the image of the virgin and child on the church facade became suddenly three dimensional and weirdly lifelike the opera starts with a lot of busy exposition among the nuns and it was hard to tell from the directing who was talking to whom barbara frittoli handled the vocal challenges of the title role easily but her acting was fitful rather than organic and her aria "senza mama " in which she grieves over her sons death didnt touch the heart once again it was left to stephanie blythe to wake things up as angelicas stony aunt the princess she was icily composed as she gave her niece the news she is unforgiven and disinherited and her child is dead mr obrien was on surer ground with "gianni schicchi " he kept the comedy lively aided especially by baritone alessandro corbelli who gave a smoothly calibrated idiomatic and very funny performance in the title role the gaggle of relatives all had their own comic bits as the matriarch zita ms blythe kept swigging wine and trying to dominate the conversation as ciesca patricia risley tried a little seduction jess goldstein the costume designer also had more fun here than he did with the barge hands and nuns with the opera updated to the dress options included ms blythes shapeless italian widow outfit ms risleys outre lavender hat a natty jacket for massimo giordano rinuccio and mr corbellis bohemian scarf and rakishly tilted fedora the costumes worked nicely with the set the dead miser buoso donatis grand but dilapidated bedroom with its ragged bed curtains faded renaissance decoration large portraits of cardinals buoso actually planned to leave his money to the church and a rabbit eared television set at the foot of the bed the cast handled both the ensemble work and their cameos well in addition to ms blythe some standouts included the young lovers mr giordano a lyrical tenor and olga mykytenko lauretta whose warm agile soprano made the operas hit tune "o mio babbino caro " a properly memorable moment but even here the set and the mets famous stage elevator got the last word for the final moments the bedroom dropped from view and the roof terrace with a spectacular panorama of florence and lauretta and rinuccio celebrating their imminent marriage descended to take its place franco zeffirelli would have approved ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
