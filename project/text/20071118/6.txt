getting going im a loser and i couldnt be happier im lovin it my portfolio has lost a boatload of money in recent weeks and i couldnt be happier the reason this sort of market turmoil scrambles valuations and creates opportunities here is a look at some key market sectors including which appear to be good values and which dont in the late s the big blue chip companies in the standard &amp poors stock index posted plus gains for five consecutive years the index has been paying the price ever since in fact the s&amp p today remains slightly below where it stood at the march bull market peak but this dismal performance has a silver lining valuations now look pretty reasonable the s&amp p is at times trailing month reported earnings not much above the historical average indeed blue chip stocks appear to be far more appealing than u s small company shares and i wouldnt be surprised to see them outperform in the years ahead if you want to boost your blue chip exposure check out index funds like fidelity spartan fsmkx vanguard vfinx and the exchange traded ishares s&amp p ivv emerging markets shares have been on a tear for the past five years including returns of around in both and this year is shaping up as another big winner emerging markets were up through the end of october before falling back in recent weeks dont expect these big gains to continue share prices have clearly raced far ahead of economic growth and that isnt sustainable over the long run what to do if you own an emerging markets fund you should have a target portfolio allocation you might for instance earmark of your stock market money for the sector thanks to the big gains of recent years youre likely way above that target and you might want to rebalance back to a allocation meanwhile if you dont own emerging markets i wouldnt be in a hurry to build up a full position others of course are rushing into emerging markets funds and foreign stock funds generally in part because they are convinced the dollar will continue sliding in the foreign exchange market this may indeed happen but whenever there is a strong consensus that something will occur its time to get cautious after all if everybody is already betting the dollar will fall that raises the question who will do all the additional selling that drives the dollar lower since early i have been touting inflation indexed treasury bonds that recommendation drew a sharp rebuke from readers who noted that the bonds had lately performed poorly but that was what made the bonds attractive as the price of inflation bonds slumped their yields rose so that by early june the year inflation indexed treasury note was yielding more than on top of that yield buyers also receive increases in their bonds principal value to compensate for inflation today unfortunately the attractive yield is history inflation bonds have rallied and yields have fallen so that the year note now yields a mere its hard to get enthusiastic at current levels while investors have been flocking to the safety of treasurys especially inflation indexed treasurys they have shunned bonds that appear riskier including tax free municipal bonds this is odd given that municipal bonds are considered one of the markets most conservative investments but whatever the reason you can now buy year munis yielding around barely below the yield on conventional year treasury notes because it pays tax free interest a muni is more valuable than a treasury among funds check out low cost offerings such as fidelity intermediate municipal income fltmx schwab tax free bond swntx vanguard high yield tax exempt vwahx and vanguard intermediate term tax exempt vwitx corporate high yield junk bonds also look increasingly attractive yielding around or almost five percentage points more than conventional year treasurys problem is if the u s economy slows junk bonds will likely suffer further and thus even higher yields may lie ahead real estate investment trusts were possibly the current decades most dazzling investment notching seven consecutive years of market beating gains but that winning streak came to an end this year with reits getting dinged for double digit losses i dont consider reits a screaming bargain still equity reits those that buy apartments offices warehouses and other buildings and then rent them out are currently yielding around if reits score even modest share price increases you could have yourself a decent total return one buying strategy earmark maybe of your stock portfolio for reits if you dont have a position today purchase a small stake in a fund like vanguard reit index vgsix and then add to it gradually over the next months
