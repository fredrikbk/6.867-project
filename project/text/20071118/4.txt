eyes on the road what will the car of the future look like sen clintons push to double autos average fuel economy is possible but complicated online edition during the s bill clinton and nobel laureate al gore led an administration that did nothing to increase the federal fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks but if there is a second clinton administration led by sen hillary clinton she plans to push to double the fuel economy of u s cars and trucks to miles per gallon by sen clintons ambitious energy platform is just one sign of how the auto industry has lost control of the fuel efficiency debate after two decades of successfully spinning demands for tougher mileage standards as assaults on safety jobs and freedom it was a great v powered ride now its over industry executives may harbor private skepticism that carbon dioxide pumped out of cars is to blame for melting polar ice caps or threatened polar bears but theres no doubt the political climate has gotten hotter for car makers from the campaign trail to congress to the federal courts to the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change auto makers are getting knocked on the head to do more to curb automotive oil consumption and co emissions could car makers meet sen clintons challenge to double in years the fuel economy of the average car sold in america sure they could thats not the real question cars that get miles per gallon or more can be found as antiques in museums or on the internet right after world war ii for example european car makers built a variety of mini mobiles such as the messerschmitt kr later called the kr that carried one person on three wheels and averaged some miles to the gallon you could say the messerschmitt is a cartoon design no serious person would consider as a response to todays transportation needs what about the company called aptera www aptera com which is promoting a vehicle with three wheels that will be powered by some kind of batteries aptera one of a number of electric car upstarts says it will offer this super efficient transporter for about &# the toyota prius and the honda civic hybrid you could buy today are rated at about miles per gallon and miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving and the numbers that would be used for corporate average fuel economy compliance are higher a new generation of lithium ion batteries and some tweaks to the computers in their gas engines probably get them to mpg a more sober analysis of whats possible in advanced automotive design comes from a group of mit researchers including john b heywood a professor of mechanical engineering and director of the sloan automotive laboratory at mit the paper "factor of two halving the fuel consumption of new u s automobiles by " assesses three basic scenarios for boosting the average fuel economy of u s vehicles to miles per gallon by first car makers could channel future improvements in vehicle design toward boosting fuel efficiency instead of using them to goose power or performance second they could increase the use of diesel turbocharged gasoline and gas electric hybrid technology third they could reduce the size and weight of vehicles "over the next three decades consumers will have to accept little further improvements in acceleration performance a large fraction of new light duty vehicles sold must be propelled by alternative powertrains and vehicle weight must be reduced by to from today " the mit scientists write for example todays toyota camry accelerates to miles per hour in seconds weighs about pounds kg delivers horsepower and averages about miles per gallon liters per km according to the mit study a hypothetical camry that weighed pounds kg and had a liter horsepower engine could accelerate to miles per hour in seconds but would average miles per gallon liters per km the same exercise applied to a ford f pickup would produce a vehicle that weighs pounds less than todays vehicle gets around on a horsepower engine and averages mpg compared with mpg today unfortunately the scientists at mit have not come up with a formula for providing a free lunch depending on how various technologies are applied the total costs of re engineering cars to get to an average of mpg which is short of miles per gallon of course would be &# billion to &# billion some of that cost would reflect the expense of designing small cars to be safer although the researchers argue that by eliminating the heaviest vehicles from the road overall safety would be improved at a conservative fuel cost of &# a gallon the mit team estimate it would take four to five years to recover the initial costs not counting the possibility that people would "spend" the fuel efficiency increase by driving more putting full emphasis on boosting fuel efficiency would increase the average cost of a car by about &# by and the cost of the average truck would go up by about &# the mit researchers conclude so now we have the real question posed by sen clintons mpg proposal it isnt whether miles per gallon is possible its who will pick up the tab sen clintons proposal calls for offering the auto industry detroits three or all the auto makers with factories in the u s isnt clear &# billion in low interest bonds to "retool the oldest auto plants to meet her strong efficiency standards " that &# billion sounds like a lot except when put against the auto industrys capital needs for that sum you could design and tool up about new cars and new engines for the whole industry gm alone sells more than models in the u s car makers fret that without higher gas taxes or other government subsidies to drive consumers toward smaller less powerful more expensive cars theyll wind up losing money "the whole concept of "retooling" is naive " gm vice chairman for product development bob lutz wrote in an email sent from the los angeles auto show last week "thats not the problem the problem is the thousands and thousands of dollars worth of expensive technology added to every vehicle to achieve those cafe numbers " as candidates and lawmakers battle to get more mileage out of the discussion of mileage consumers should remember that whats really being discussed are big changes in economics and expectations "what we are struggling with today is not so much a technology question but do we have context and political will to make this happen " says john decicco an automotive expert with the environmental defense fund mr decicco says the u s could adopt a system that puts caps on c emissions and give companies credits for beating those caps so for example the credit gm gets for a chevy volt plug in hybrid could be sold to an oil company which could then pass on the cost to consumers by way of prices for petroleum products meanwhile unless gm finds oil under its headquarters in detroit or develops a way to refreeze the greenland ice cap a modern day rip van winkle who falls asleep in an auto dealers waiting room will awake in years to see a very different fleet of cars for sale who knows maybe the messerschmitt will make a comeback send comments about eyes on the road to joseph
