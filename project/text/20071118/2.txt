come to you if you havent used your card in a while "ive gotten three letters from capital one " says edgar dworsky founder of consumerworld org "theyre saying give us a call in some cases youre being invited to get a better deal do it " when youve found which card has the lowest rate put the rest of them away in a drawer and use the one thats left for the next few months then make a new years

cash back or other rewards you prefer one new card the citi cashreturns mastercard pays of all purchases back to you during the first three months after that the refund falls to though theres no cap on what the bank will pay back each year no annual fee and no expiration date on the refund if youre doing a lot of shopping at one retailer it may make sense to take the store up on its offer of say off purchases that day if you open a credit card account with the store and its bank partner some cards offer interest on new purchases as opposed to balance transfers under various circumstances read the fine print carefully however consumerworld orgs mr dworksy recently saw a card that requires customers to pay the interest for the entire promotional period on certain purchases if they dont pay the whole balance off in the introductory period if youre going to need a mortgage or other large loan in the next year or so think twice about opening new credit card accounts of any sort sometimes

when youre traveling or busy with holiday plans that makes now a good time to set up automated payments from your bank account so that the card company pulls a set amount or the full credit card balance from your bank on the due date each month most credit card companies will do this though they dont necessarily shout it from the rooftops once you set this up your odds of paying late and paying fees go down dramatically its one less thing to worry about and it gives your card company a little bit less to celebrate this holiday season
