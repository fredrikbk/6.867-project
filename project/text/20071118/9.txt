love &amp money he gambles she doesnt place your bets let me lay my cards on the table so to speak i like to gamble my wife amy does not normally this isnt an issue but it is this week because amy and i are away for a long weekend something we try to do two or three times a year a few days without kids jobs or housework this time were in las vegas and though i am a saver and investor at heart i do enjoy risking a few dollars at craps or baccarat for her part amy enjoys risking a few dollars on the slot machines but thats where the similarity ends amys idea of a "few" is &# once she loses or wins more than that her day is done i go higher much higher after all these years with me amy is well aware of that fact she isnt always happy about it particularly when i lose so for this trip she made a pre emptive strike when we talked about our trip she said were not going to las vegas to gamble but just to relax my response was effectively "wanna bet " before readers start accusing me of being a problem gambler let me assure you i am not though even writing that makes me sound guilty and defensive the fact is i never gamble at home though i live minutes from a local casino i dont buy lottery tickets though im in a state that sells them i never go to the horse track though several are nearby i confine my gambling to those rare occasions when amy and i spend a couple of days in a place like las vegas or the mississippi gulf coast at that point i see no reason not to gamble if im in vegas not spending a little time and money in the casino seems unfathomable dropping money at the craps table is for me an entertainment cost built into the trips budget no different from paying several hundred dollars to see a play on a trip to new york or london except theres a chance ill win back all i spent maybe more if im lucky if i win big or even small all the better if i lose every dollar earmarked for the casino well i had fun doing so amy has a different take shes not against gambling and shes not against me gambling but she is dumbstruck by the need to venture more than say &# thats her price of entertainment "but i know you " she says "you dont gamble with just &# or &# you gamble with much more and if you run out of money and still feel like gambling you go to the atm at a m to go play baccarat " shes right i lost several hundred dollars playing craps in january when we spent our anniversary weekend at a casino in nearby mississippi later that night i pulled another few hundred from the atm for a go at baccarat which i lost as well it never bothered me i wasnt risking money we needed for the mortgage or groceries or our kids tuition payment it was disposable income that i disposed of having my version of fun that gets to the heart of this matter gambling is one of those activities often serving as a bright line divide in a relationship to the one who gambles and this assumes youre not addicted the activity is just another form of playtime you get to do infrequently to the one who grumbles gambling as entertainment is ludicrous an absurd waste of the familys hard earned income the kind of money amy knows i want to play with in vegas "matters huge to me " she says shes looking ahead to a christmas vacation with the kids and says the money i want to risk at craps "is money that we could use for christmas " "if we have an endless amount of money that im not aware of " amy says "then go ahead and drop some of it at the craps table otherwise i think theres a problem wasting this money on gambling when there are other things we can pay for id love to go see a show or go to the hotel spa for the day but i would rather do without because i also know thats money i can spend on the kids on our vacation over christmas " its hard to argue against putting family enjoyment above self gratification but i think its an unfair way to frame the issue you can always argue that family comes first but doing so means you forever deny yourself any individual pleasures i dont work simply to give everything to my kids they are doing just fine as it is i work in part to make my ride through life enjoyable too and for me wagering some money in las vegas wont affect christmas one iota but another point amy makes does resonate her desire to do something for herself she works hard during the week as well and this getaway is in large part about giving her some relaxation to that end ive gladly given up a chunk of dollars i would have spent in the casino and weve budgeted it for amy to spend in the spa on herself thats a sure bet that well both be happy with the trip
