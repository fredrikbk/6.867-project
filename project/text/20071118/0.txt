ask dow jones q i was wondering if you can deduct sales tax on a vehicle purchased in d b stockton calif a the short answer is yes but only under certain circumstances this is an important question because studies have shown widespread confusion among taxpayers about who is eligible to deduct sales taxes and how to do it one government study showed many people who could benefit from the deduction didnt claim it probably because they didnt realize they were eligible or couldnt figure out the mechanics im not surprised as with so many other tax laws the rules can be very complex here are the general rules if you itemize your deductions you have a choice you can deduct your state and local sales taxes instead of your state and local income taxes you cant deduct both the sales tax deduction is an especially popular choice for people who live in florida texas nevada washington and other states that dont have a state income tax but you dont have to live in one of those states to be eligible anyone who itemizes no matter where he or she lives can choose the sales tax deduction option to figure your deduction you can use the actual tax you paid for your nonbusiness purchases as long as you kept good records such as credit card receipts or you can use tables that the internal revenue service provides if you use the irs tables you typically can add to the amount shown in those tables what you paid in state and local sales taxes on certain big ticket items such as a car motorcycle or boat that you bought for your personal use "do not include sales taxes paid on items used in your trade or business " the irs says if you lived in more than one locality during the year see the irs instructions the sales tax deduction is available for but its scheduled to expire at the end of this year the house recently voted to extend it but the legislation includes other items unlikely to be approved by the senate unless this provision is extended you wont be able to deduct state and local sales taxes on your return for "however an extension is quite likely " says "j k lassers your income tax "
