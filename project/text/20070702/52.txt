politics &amp economics sensing the next peril in lebanon u s puts heat on syria as militants rearm political fractures worsen and the threat of conflict grows washington the bush administration fearing a rupturing of lebanons political system is ratcheting up pressure on syria and its lebanese allies ahead of what the u s believes could be a bid by opponents of prime minister fuad siniora to set up a parallel government in beirut by the fall on friday president bush signed a proclamation blacklisting from u s travel any syrian or lebanese individuals seen as threatening beiruts democratically elected government it also listed people who the u s believes are playing central roles in seeking to overthrow the current government the u s moves come as the united nations reports an unimpeded flow of weapons into lebanon from syria part of an apparent campaign by damascus and iran to rearm the shiite militia hezbollah after last summers war with israel u s and lebanese officials say these arms are also reaching a growing number of palestinian and sunni militant groups in lebanon challenging mr sinioras control in the north and south of the country this mix of arms and political polarization is infecting lebanon with rising sectarian tensions and the threat of a return to all out civil war said u n and lebanese officials it is also stoking concern in washington and tel aviv of another major conflict erupting between lebanon based militants and israel in the months ahead "i am deeply concerned that lebanon remains in the midst of a debilitating political crisis and faces ongoing attacks aimed at destabilizing and undermining its sovereignty " u n secretary general ban ki moon wrote in a report released friday mr ban said he was particularly alarmed by last months bombing in southern lebanon that killed six spanish u n peacekeepers as well as the firing of three katyusha rockets into israel from the same region among the individuals who the u s believes are playing central roles in seeking to overthrow the current beirut government are assef shawkat who is the brother in law of syrian president bashar assad as well as the countrys and intelligence chief hisham ikhtiyar one of the syrian leaders top advisers and rustum ghazali former head of syrian intelligence inside lebanon six former lebanese ministers who are viewed as working as proxies for damascus inside lebanon are also on the list u s officials acknowledged that the u s travel bans are unlikely to have much direct impact on syrian leaders but they say they are more focused on dissuading lebanese politicians from siding with the syrians against mr siniora senior bush administration officials say some of these lebanese officials have significant numbers of family members as well as financial assets in the u s of particular focus are christian politicians who have joined into a formal political alliance with hezbollah in a bid to unseat mr siniora some of them such as retired gen michel aoun have in the past coordinated closely with the u s on lebanon policy particularly on the need to reduce syrian influence they also have presented themselves as potential allies to washington if any new government is formed in beirut "a lot of people are opposed to siniora and might try to bring him down but still want to present themselves as friends with the u s " said a senior bush administration official working on the middle east "we want to convey to them that theres a price to pay" for their actions some of the lebanese politicians on the white houses watch list called it an example of the u s interfering in their countrys domestic politics they also called mr siniora a lackey of the u s "the decision is a dictatorial measure by the u s targeting democracy in lebanon " said assad hardan a former lebanese labor minister beirut is scheduled to hold elections in september to replace president emile lahoud who was installed by president assad before syrias military withdrawal in early lebanons president is elected through a parliamentary vote and mr lahoud is constitutionally barred from serving another term beiruts legislative body has been shuttered for more than six months as hezbollah and its political allies have taken to street protests to try to unseat mr siniora many lebanese and u s officials fear that mr lahoud with hezbollahs and gen aouns backing is preparing to unilaterally establish a rival pro syrian government in beirut arguing mr sinioras mandate has expired lebanon was similarly split between competing governments in east and west beirut during the height of the countrys civil war in the s "the two state government is a real concern for us " said the senior bush administration official mr lahoud is "trying to create an alternate government thats going to challenge siniora " in addition to trying to stabilize mr siniora politically the bush administration is increasingly seeking ways to help lebanons security forces seal its eastern and northern borders with syria a u n report released last week said arms and militiamen were transiting into lebanon from syria all but uninterrupted these porous borders have allowed hezbollah to restock much of the rockets and artillery spent during last summers war with israel particularly in lebanons central bekaa valley according to the u n and the weapons flows have allowed damascus based militias like fatah intifada and the liberation of palestine general command to refortify their military posts inside lebanon these militias as well as an al qaeda linked sunni army fatah islam have clashed with lebanons armed forces near the cities of tripoli and sidon in the past month killing hundreds the katyusha missile attack on israel last month was also believed linked to one of these private armies according to lebanese officials and members of mr sinioras government fear even greater confrontation between the states security apparatus and these pro damascus militias if lebanons political crisis intensifies the u n is calling for improved intelligence sharing and military equipment to aid lebanons policing of its borders but many u s and u n officials working on lebanon say much more drastic measures are being considered privately to head off a potential escalation of violence in lebanon one would seek to redeploy some of the u n s peacekeeping contingent to the syrian border from its current base in lebanons south another would be for mr siniora to seek troops from neighboring arab countries to assist lebanons policing of the syrian border both actions however are likely to meet stiff resistance inside the u n security council president assad has already said he would view any deployment of foreign troops on syrias border as a hostile act "lebanon is now on a very narrow and difficult path " said a u n official working on its disarmament "for the moment the syrians think they are winning "
