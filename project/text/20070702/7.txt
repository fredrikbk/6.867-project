ahead of the tape subprime flu sheds a light on derivatives the subprime mortgage crackup is casting a bright light on an often dark corner of wall street derivatives as the name suggests derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from underlying securities such as stocks or bonds a stock option for instance is a derivative that gives investors the ability to buy or sell a stock at a specified price to cash in on future price movements there are derivatives linked to interest rates inflation and the weather there are even derivatives of derivatives a rising concern is that many derivatives are "illiquid " or dont trade very often making it hard to value them accurately this can pose a problem for hedge funds which generally need to place a value on their holdings every few months or so the value might not always be accurate think of it like the housing market where valuation can be difficult if each house on a street of identical houses is worth &# but then one sells for &# you can bet that when the neighbors talk about the price of their homes the valuations will be closer to &# the same is true for hedge fund managers except that they are playing with investors money a recent study by paris risk management firm riskdata shows that roughly of hedge funds that invest in illiquid securities smooth out returns with price estimates for these securities that are potentially self serving compared with just for funds that invest in highly liquid securities such as stocks the implication is that these funds arent using market prices to adjust holdings values in other words a number of hedge funds have been tinkering with results making them look less volatile if and when these funds are ultimately forced to put an accurate price on the holdings the outcome could be messy fears of just such an outcome shot through wall street recently when the mortgage backed securities held by two bear stearns hedge funds briefly came to market at fire sale prices the chief concern was that hedge funds holding similar assets would need to adjust the value of their holdings sharply downward there are well known benefits to derivatives they can help spread around risk potentially making systemic breakdowns less common derivatives also give investors sophisticated tools to protect themselves against market downturns when one bet turns sour another perks up that is why derivatives are often seen as a form of portfolio insurance credit default swaps for instance can give investors protection against borrowers defaulting on their loans as a result investors dont get so jumpy during times of stress that has helped trigger a significant decline in market volatility in recent years stocks bonds and other securities dont bounce around as much as they used to due in part to these powerful shock absorbers the decline in volatility has allowed investors to take on more risk but what happens if the shock absorbers dont work the way they are supposed to as was the case at bear stearns investors thinking they are driving a hot rod could suddenly find themselves at the wheel of a clunker "shock absorbers get broken too and once they get broken you can have a pretty hard landing " said mark zandi chief economist at web site moodys economy com email scott patterson wsj com
