among those who saw it a popular theory was that it was the work of a jilted girlfriend in fact the sign was paid for by steven singer jewelers a employee retail store on philadelphias historic jewelers row the ad is part of a long process to cultivate the stores image as an irreverent and fun place for guys to buy diamond jewelry over the years the business has marketed itself with humorous ads and gimmicks that while offending some people tend to appeal to its coveted younger male audience along with the billboards efforts include spots and giveaways on radio shows that have a mainly male following including shock jock howard sterns sponsorship of chicken wing eating contests and hosting what it calls the worlds largest bubble bath in the store each year where lingerie clad women wade through bubbles this lower brow style is a sharp departure from the soft music and romantic imagery traditionally used by jewelry retailers and has set the business apart from its competitors such strong differentiation can be crucial for a small business that has to compete against many and often much bigger rivals for a small firm "if youre not different than your competitors youre not going to get the awareness " says derrick daye managing partner at blake project a branding company in tampa fla says steven singer the stores owner if you can make buying that diamond ring "a little more relaxing and a little more fun its a home run " mr singer the architect of the stores image started in the jewelry business with a summer job at age and stayed with it in he opened his first store in a converted stairwell advertising as the smallest shop on jewelers row his first marketing attempt was in the early s when he paid &# for a local television commercial that showed him behind the store counter "we got no business from it " mr singer says for eight or nine years he adds his store lacked a compelling message to bring in customers and relied mainly on customer overflow from the big retailer next door then in the late s mr singer a fan of mr sterns talk radio show noticed that advertisers on the show seemed to generate buzz particularly among young men to advertise on the show which had recently expanded into the philadelphia market mr singer says he mortgaged his house and opened more than new credit card accounts the ads cost about &# a minute he says some weeks he could afford only two or three spots his wife and his accountant thought he "was nuts " mr singer says but both went along grudgingly "i made it my business to get in good with that show " he says aside from the commercials mr singer also offered the show jewelry giveaways for listeners and guests in exchange for mentions on the air "when they needed to coerce someone into doing something crazy they called us " says mr singer it took two or three years but eventually his presence on mr sterns show where he continues to advertise translated into sales as people who heard his name on the show went to the tiny store a billboard campaign in the late s built on the guy humor theme the store was cultivating "after years of telling her size doesnt matter in jewelry talk this is big " the ads read showing a small space between a thumb and a forefinger "we knew it was good because we got some complaints" from people who found it offensive mr singer says in the company also became a sponsor of philadelphias preston and steve show on wmmr fm a local morning radio show that has a heavily male audience the hosts make regular references to steven singer jewelers implying for instance that a gift of steven singer jewelry leads to sexual conquest along the way mr singer also discovered that it has helped to add an air of mystery to his ads in his quest to persuade people that buying a diamond at steven singer is a different experience take the "i hate steven singer" ads mr singer says the campaign was born when a longtime customer joked that he hated him the customer said he had given his wife a piece of jewelry and the romantic gesture eventually led to the birth of their third child the campaign began with a radio spot featuring a mans voice saying "i hate steven singer" and inviting listeners to find out why by visiting the store next came the billboards followed by graffiti style "i hate steven singer" stickers on store windows the phrase also is still plastered on an array of promotions from coasters for the beer the store serves to customers while they shop to philadelphia eagles miniature footballs while campaigns like mr singers can attract attention marketing experts say theres also the risk that the humor will turn off big numbers of potential customers "hes not appealing to the upscale upmarket segment " says indrajit "jay" sinha an associate professor of marketing at temple universitys fox school of business in philadelphia "those who would rather go to harry winston" would probably not appreciate the sometimes crude humor and gimmicks he says internet chat boards and blogs offer a glimpse into the range of reactions some people who post claim theyll never set foot in the store because of the marketing or the use of the word "hate " a
