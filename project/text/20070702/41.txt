murder she texted wireless messaging used to fight crime three weeks ago when police in the hague in the netherlands got a report that a boat had been stolen they sent out a text message about the case to residents who had signed up to receive neighborhood crime alerts on their cellphones an hour later a woman bicycling along a canal who got the message notified police via a phone call that she saw a boat that met the description the boat was found and the thief arrested "theyre the eyes on the street " says a spokesperson for the hagues police department text messaging a form of wireless communication thats gaining traction in the u s is turning into an effective crime fighting tool around the world police agencies from beijing to boston are encouraging citizens to use it to report crime or inform on criminals in china about a dozen cities have established text message crime reporting systems residents are encouraged through government announcements to use it when calling police could endanger their safety situations such as kidnapping theft on buses or burglaries at home in late a man in hefei capital of anhui province in eastern china text messaged the police "i was kidnapped " within minutes the police found him at a public bathhouse and arrested the two kidnappers even the u s which had lagged in adopting text messaging is catching up in using it to combat crime in june the boston police department launched a new "text a tip" program to increase cooperation with police among young people who are heavy text message users says commissioner ed davis text messaging provides them a more discreet way to communicate with police than phone calling he says under the program witnesses can text the word "tip" to the number crime they will receive automated messages that ask specific questions regarding crime categories physical description of suspects weapon types and other useful details witnesses can provide the information by replying to the messages cellphone numbers are completely blocked to ensure anonymity says a spokeswoman in the six days following the programs launch the department received tips from witnesses on alleged crimes ranging from drug dealing to homicide the police declined to confirm if any tip has helped them in solving any case police in some cities around the world have used text messaging as a rudimentary crime fighting tool for years in amsterdam police began a so called "text message bomb" program to curb cellphone theft after thefts were reported the police would bombard the stolen phone every few minutes with messages saying "this cellphone was stolen bring it back to the police " the annoyance made the stolen cellphones virtually unusable and therefore less attractive to thieves says a spokesman for the amsterdam police department local news reports suggest that the program did put a dent in such crimes last year police in the hague started using text messaging to send out mass alerts when fighting serious crime after a murder case went unsolved for months police sent out text messages to about cellphone numbers that were believed to be in use near the murder scene asking for potential witness tips the case remains unsolved the police used the tactic again in another murder case in and although it again failed to generate a useful tip they will continue to use it in the future says a spokesperson for the hague police department each time they first get permission from the district attorney as the people who are being contacted arent voluntary participants crime fighting organizations private and governmental also have begun to use text messaging to alert people about missing persons or suspects on the loose thousands of text messages are sent for example as part of "amber alerts " urgent bulletins that are broadcast throughout a region to catch child abductors soon after they strike the program operates only in the u s and the alerts are sent to law enforcement officials and people who sign up for the program whats unclear is how far police agencies will go in using text messaging currently messages in most u s anticrime programs are "opt in " meaning they are sent only to people who sign up to participate technologically it would be possible for police to broadcast text alerts to practically every cellphone in a neighborhood or region regardless of whether they opted in or not but doing that would raise numerous thorny issues regarding privacy and cost "people have to elect to do it otherwise it could be deemed spam " says joe farren a spokesman for ctia the wireless association a trade body for the wireless industry the cost of the transmission is typically borne by consumers who pay a small fee every time they open a text message usually about cents the nationwide emergency alert system in the netherlands however is government sponsored and phone users dont pay for those messages interest is growing among police and safety agencies in several countries in using text messaging as a general emergency warning system in the past two years the netherlands has been testing a nationwide text warning system by using a technology called cell broadcasting it allows operators to broadcast uniform text warnings to all phone users in a defined region because the technology uses the maintenance system of wireless networks it wont jam up systems that handle the commercial traffic the advantage of cell broadcasting messages is that unlike traditional sirens which only alert people of emergency situations it also tells people what the situation is about and gives evacuation instructions says an official at the ministry of interior affairs in washington d c westchester n y and some other regions residents can register to receive text alerts ranging from severe weather to neighborhood crime activities on their cellphones the alerts are sent by emergency agencies some states and the federal communications commission also are looking at ways to broadcast terrorism crime and natural disaster alerts einstein wireless a small rural operator in wisconsin is offering an emergency broadcasting text message service in cooperation with the department of homeland security and the federal emergency management agency in california lt gov john garamendi proposed to the state senate in may a statewide emergency alert system that will include broadcasting text messages to any cellphone in the area in which an emergency situation has occurred the fcc has formed an advisory group looking into a nation wide emergency alert system that could use text messaging in similar ways but the privacy and cost issues related to this type of alert system could prove challenging the text message bomb program in amsterdam was dropped in after wireless carriers in the netherlands became reluctant to cooperate with the police "it cost too much and there wasnt enough in it for them " says the spokesman for the amsterdam police department discussions in california and at the fcc are still in early stages officials havent decided which technology they will use or who will pay for the text message programs operators of cellphone services want to ensure theyre cleared of potential liabilities such as privacy intrusion officials also are trying to determine under what circumstances mass alerts should be sent out and which agency should make those decisions mr farren the ctia spokesman said his organization supports the creation of a nationwide emergency alert system but the system is voluntary under a congressional bill so carriers can decide whether or not theyll participate he says
