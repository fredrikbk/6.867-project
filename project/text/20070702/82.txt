trade becomes route for money tied to terrorism illicit commodity deals are hard to spot trace a trail of sugar to gaza paris after a long and intense crackdown on cross border money laundering authorities say terrorist supporters narcotics syndicates and sanctions busters have adopted a new method of sneaking funds past the watchful eye of the law the global commodity trade the practice known as "trade based money laundering " was pioneered by latin american drug smugglers in the s now it is spreading to europe and the middle east heres how the practice works instead of wiring money directly from one country to another a would be money launderer buys foodstuffs like sugar or vegetable oil or other goods those goods are far easier to deliver to restricted destinations like iran and the palestinian territories because they often look like legitimate aid when they arrive local merchants transfer the goods on or simply sell them for cash a portion of the proceeds end up with local terrorist groups or criminals the illicit trades are often blended in with legitimate ones which makes them difficult to single out and the source of their funding hard to trace authorities say the scope and prevalence of the practice is tough to determine with any precision but it is clearly on the rise one such case recently surfaced in europe when french authorities discovered that a paris based charity the u s officially designates as a sponsor of terrorism has been buying large lots of commodities for delivery to the palestinian territories while much of the goods constitute legitimate aid a portion of the shipments ultimately ends up with terror groups officials allege funds for the original goods purchases by money launderers increasingly come from iran israeli officials say some of the funds and goods allegedly end up with palestinian islamic jihad and hamas both groups are seeking to disrupt the palestinian peace process with israel and often sponsor terrorist attacks for at least two years israeli and european counterterrorism officials allege supporters of the palestinian groups have been using donations raised in europe to purchase sugar and other commodities u s officials have been warning about such swap deals since the state departments release of its international narcotics control strategy report "as both the formal international financial system and money service businesses become increasingly regulated scrutinized and transparent criminal money launderers and terrorist financiers are increasingly likely to use fraudulent trade based practices in international commerce to launder earn move and integrate funds and assets " the report said now u s officials say the trade based model is being adopted across the persian gulf region u s sanctions on iran and tehrans own rigid financial controls promote the practice the state department said in a recent report "the trade and smuggling of goods into iranian commerce leads to a significant amount of trade based money laundering " according to the departments annual narcotics control report released in march "there is no reliable estimate on trade based money laundering because no authorities are looking systematically at their trade activities " says money laundering expert nikos passas of northeastern university in boston "the vulnerability is gigantic though and undermines all other financial controls we have in place no matter how well these may be implemented " much of the money in question is laundered in the united arab emirates the primary conduit for iranian imports trade based laundering in the emirate of dubai also helps finance the booming afghan iran heroin trade according to u s italian and u a e law enforcement officials in february u a e officials arrested people on charges of commodities based money laundering for narcotics traffickers many of the trades were placed through at least different accounts at man financial inc in new york u s officials said the firm wasnt accused of any wrongdoing in the palestinian territories french and israeli police are scrutinizing several commodities transactions involving goods either paid for or purchased on behalf of the comite de bienfaisance et de secours aux palestiniens or the committee for palestinian welfare and aid since the paris based charity has been listed by the u s treasury department as a supporter of terrorism the cbsp denies any wrong doing it is a legal organization in france which has declined u s requests to list the group as a supporter hamas a spokesman for the paris prosecutors office said the cbsp is the subject of a preliminary money laundering inquiry french police declined to comment in march a paris court convicted the simon wiesenthal center a jewish international human rights organization of defamation after one of its employees accused the cbsp of sending funds to palestinian suicide bombers the center was given a

in to carry out the trades for a local gaza charity the national association of moderation &amp development for which cbsp had agreed to finance food distribution under terms of the deal mr abu aker agreed to deliver crushed lentils jam jars and macaroni from the u s he produced a receipt for the final contract showing a value of &# he also faxed pictures showing vegetable oil and other foodstuffs being delivered to a large refugee camp in gaza during the ramadan holiday in counterterrorism officials allege that some of the proceeds from these deals were passed on to terrorists either directly or through a third party officials with access to financial records say some of the cbsp commodity deals were financed by an iranian group called the organization for supporting the intifada which is based in tehran intifada is the name given to the palestinian uprisings in israeli occupied territories youcef benderbal a cbsp spokesman says his group is devoted strictly to the welfare and relief of palestinians and is "a completely independent association" with no ties to terror groups he said his group does pay for food aid to palestinians as do many charities but denies it has received any iranian donations he said the group gets money solely from individuals in france bauche sa a french sugar trading company said it received a transfer from cbsp to pay for goods shipped to abu aker last year the cbsp transferred more than euros or more than about &# to bauche to buy goods say mr abu aker and jean marc sebag a sugar trader at bauche french police blocked the transaction say people familiar with the matter mr sebag confirmed he received orders for sugar cargoes from mr abu aker and even met with him mr sebag also said cbsp paid for the goods in one instance he said he stopped dealing with the gaza trader after a warning from french authorities mr sebag said bauche repaid the more than euros to cbsp after the transaction was blocked other companies which have entered into deals with abu aker include a british coffee concern and a sri lankan tea company simon wakefield managing director of london based coffee company d r wakefield &amp co says he had dealings with abu aker but stopped them after being warned off by authorities the iranians paid for the sri lankan tea counterterrorism officials say which was then transferred to abu

with mr abu aker the oil was paid for by palestinian charities in europe in late february israels tax police and the military intelligence agency shin bet raided two israeli companies shintraco ltd and maayan ltd for carrying out similar commodities deals with mr abu akers company the two israeli concerns share an address shalom hatuka general manager of shintraco denied any wrongdoing and said he was the victim of a "misunderstanding " much of the trades in question allegedly end up with the main islamic jihad charity the el ehssan charitable association which is designated as a terrorist entity by the u s el ehssan and islamic jihad spokesmen denied conducting any business with abu aker to be sure many suppliers in the operations appear to be unaware of any links to terrorist activity english farmer anthony byass for example began supplying seed shipments to palestinian firms in mr byass who sells produce from his farm in york through a company called lanwin pulses ltd began delivering legumes to the palestinian territories after responding to a british government trade bulletin in november three containers of seeds from lanwin pulses were confiscated by israeli authorities in the west bank after the israelis concluded the commodities were intended for the abu aker firm and were purchased with money from cbsp some of the donations came from tehran
