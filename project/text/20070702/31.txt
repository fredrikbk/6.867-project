jihad in britain barely hours on the job britains new prime minister gordon brown got a lesson in the realities of the post world terrorist plots in london and glasgow pushed the u k s security alert up to the highest level "critical" for the first time in a year in fortunate contrast to the london subway bombings two years ago this july neither attack came off as planned two cars packed with gasoline gas cylinders and nails were discovered early friday in the british capital and defused at glasgow airport a similarly rigged suv crashed into security barriers barely failing to get inside the departure hall except for an attacker who set himself ablaze yelling "allah allah " no one was seriously hurt police arrested five suspects whoever plotted these staggered bombings is according to mr brown in general terms "associated with al qaeda " the u s along with british and other allies have badly disrupted osama bin ladens global network nothing nearly on the scale of and no attack on u s soil has taken place in the past six years but small local cells whether in bali madrid or casablanca directly or indirectly inspired by bin laden are aiming at soft civilian targets with crude means the conspirators in britain on the weekend didnt seem to know how to wire a bomb properly that may not be the case for others plotting to bring the era of the car bomb a la baghdad to other western cities the changing nature of this threat is if anything harder to address britain is home to a large muslim community mostly from south asia and british intelligence struggles to weed out the kinds of home bred terrorists who carried out the subway attacks last year police broke up a plot to bring down trans atlantic flights with liquid explosives among or so the u k says it has foiled since the head of british intelligence last year estimated that around terrorist networks are active in the country critical to winning this fight are technology such as londons ubiquitous surveillance cameras and the infiltration of extremist cells france neutralized its french born algerian terrorists in the s with robust policing and better intelligence the other front is inside the muslim communities themselves so far in britain muslim leaders prefer to pin the blame on israel or the u s led war in iraq than resolutely condemn and fight the terrorism in their midst american muslims are better integrated in u s society but that was no insurance against the recently uncovered plots against new yorks jfk airport and fort dix in new jersey most britons understand that terrorists wage war on them and their freedoms and are not per the fashionable left voicing opposition to british policy in their own way this weekends plotters intended to kill partygoers at popular nightclubs in londons west end and school children departing glasgow for summer holiday these cities are thriving cosmopolitan tolerant and open which is a main reason the islamists want to bomb them on thursday his first full day in office the prime minister sought to distance himself from just retired tony blairs unpopular commitment to the "global war on terror" by unveiling a cabinet with prominent blair critics but mr brown appears to be a quick study yesterday in an interview with the bbc he was nothing if not resolute "we will not yield we will not be intimidated and we will not allow anyone to undermine our british way of life " welcome to the fight
