stock market quarterly review buyouts steal underwritings limelight rising stock market lifts volume fees pipeline is strong a tidal wave of debt issues many of them financing a record level of private equity buyouts threatened to swamp the markets by the end of the second quarter the buyout financing surge helped send the volume of new stock and bond issues up to &# trillion in the quarter compared with &# trillion in the second quarter of according to thomson financial which tracks new issues the level was a slight slowdown from first quarter volume of &# trillion fees collected by wall street underwriters in the second quarter rose even more up to &# billion from the same quarter of thomson said reflecting the greater proportion of stock and high yield bond deals which carry higher fees for most of the first half there was a "frothy" market for the risky high yield bonds used to finance buyouts said richard byrne head of global capital markets americas at deutsche bank ag "a significant number of big deals were announced everything that came to market pretty much sold " he said as the latest quarter ended mr byrne said "the market has been getting tested a little because theres a lot of supply" meaning bond issues planned for sale "theres probably more supply in the pipeline now than theres ever been there are deals over &# billion thats the tone of the supply even in the healthiest markets thats a lot to absorb " underwriting executives arent ready to concede that a recent spate of pulled or scaled back bond deals for buyouts such as ahold nvs u s foodservice inc or thomson corp s thomson learning spells doom for the buyout boom the market jitters followed a recent rise in interest rates overall an even greater surge in interest rates for high yield bonds and concerns about bonds backed by subprime mortgages or loans to borrowers with poor credit ratings jim merli global head of debt syndicate at lehman brothers holdings inc said in recent weeks that "we have seen a bit of volatility back in the credit markets " he said some of that may have been because of a combination of the big supply and even such factors like the july fourth holiday falling in the middle of this week meaning fewer people are around to make decisions "its not clear to me how much of the recent heaviness in the market represents a sea change and a shift in market psychology or a short term technical phenomenon " mr merli said despite recent increases he said the spread or difference between yields on junk bonds and comparable risk free treasury debt issues remained lower in the middle of last week than it was at the end of a good sign one important factor driving the healthy environment for new issues has been a rising stock market the dow jones industrial average and the standard &amp poors stock index both set records in the second quarter after a steep downdraft in early march although they slipped later some underwriting executives who specialize in stock issues say market fundamentals remain strong although at the start of the quarter there was some concern about the economy slowing down "as the quarter progressed the economy seems to be doing better than people thought " said carlos hernandez global head of equities at j p morgan chase &amp co the "pipeline is strong " and "high quality stories will continue to work but if markets get choppier it gets harder from here " said ted pick co head of global equity capital markets at morgan stanley he said the volume of global stock issuance is at a "record pace " up in the first half from as strong as u s stock markets have been some markets overseas have been even stronger while the &# billion initial public offering of buyout giant blackstone group lp on june got the most attention the largest global stock issue of the quarter was the &# billion ipo of vtb bank of russia the next three largest issues came from companies in britain india and china according to dealogic which tracks new issues the emergence of buyout firms and hedge funds as issuers of securities has been one of the most significant trends of the year fortress investment group llc became the first major u s hedge fund and private equity manager to go public in the first quarter that was followed by a private stock sale in may by alternative investment manager oaktree capital management llc and then blackstone group "that set in motion a trend that a lot of people expect will continue " said stephen scherr head of the americas financing group at goldman sachs group inc which led the oaktree offering some bankers say deals like fortress oaktree and blackstone are a sign of the proliferation of vehicles giving public market investors more exposure to private equity investing "the lines are blurring and there is a convergence of public and private equity as asset classes " said tyler dickson head of global equity capital markets at citigroup inc it is the market for debt that has been rocked by adverse events the stronger than expected economy has fueled a run up in interest rates a steep downturn in the market for debt backed by subprime mortgages owed by less credit worthy borrowers led to the near collapse in june of two mortgage debt hedge funds run by bear stearns cos which once controlled roughly &# billion in assets spooking some bond investors three big banks citigroup inc j p morgan chase and deutsche bank led the ranks of the busiest underwriters in the first half thomson said reflecting the banks dominant role in debt issues which account for most new securities sales citigroup j p morgan and merrill lynch &amp co led in fees j p morgan was the leader for global high yield bonds used to finance buyouts in the first half as the volume of such risky junk bond issues rose to &# billion from the first half of according to thomson financial "high yield issuance has been up huge " said chad leat co head of global credit markets at citigroup among the largest high yield deals of the year have been issues of &# billion by freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc &# billion by realogy corp and &# billion by community health systems inc according to dealogic some of the deals waiting in the wings are even bigger they include issues of about &# billion for txu corp &# billion for first data corp &# billion for harrahs entertainment inc and &# billion for sallie mae according to mr byrne another sign of froth in the new issue markets was the greater proportion of offerings sometimes known as blind pools earmarked for acquisitions or business development such new issues accounted for roughly of u s initial public offerings in the quarter said jeffrey bunzel head of equity capital markets in the americas at the credit suisse securities unit of credit suisse group last week a prominent london hedge fund manager glg partners lp announced plans to sell a stake in itself for &# billion to a public special purpose acquisition vehicle freedom acquisition holdings inc freedom plans to seek a listing on the new york stock exchange under the glg name citigroups mr leat expects the volume of debt issues to decline in the second half partly because he expects "more volatility in credit spreads " the margin by which interest yields on corporate bonds exceed those of risk free treasury debt "i think its too early to draw any firm conclusion about the credit markets outlook on buyouts " said goldmans mr scherr "weve hit a moment in the credit markets which is unsettled a confluence of market volatility and significant supply that volatility would impact any investors view on a deal thats in the market " whether or not it is for a debt financed buyout
