the great circle of history and the re examination of fdrs legend amity shlaes asks why it has taken so long for us to focus on two important meters flunked by franklin roosevelt the unemployment rate and the dow jones industrial average "the real deal " editorial page june it seems fair to add some other meters that she did not three points for consideration if i may first banks and bonds few would deny that the american banking system was struggling in march when roosevelt entered office and at the time banks not the dow jones industrial average were the repository of most peoples wealth further those of less humble means gravitated to bonds not common stocks roosevelt restored systemic confidence an important force in the credit markets surely roaring twenties stock market giants such as rca never really recouped their bull market overvaluations because they were the dot coms of their day a time when the djia was as speculative as the nasdaq circa what did roosevelt have to do with this second national politics ms shlaes skirts the fact that the republican party spent most of the s in the political wilderness alf landons ill fated campaign for the presidency in symbolizes republican political haplessness of the era moreover republicans in congress like arthur vanderberg inspired the isolationist movement prior to december arguably with republicans marginalized demagogues like father coughlin and huey long were able to achieve more political success than they deserved roosevelt successfully navigated both of these threats which was no mean feat third ms shlaes skirts the fact that the global depression of the s secured the rise of national socialism germany fascism italy and spain and militarism japan it also resulted in political paralysis in the united kingdom and france and it made communism more appealing than deserved did roosevelt employ some communists in government no doubt he did but if his tenure despite unemployment periodic forays into public choice theory and the absence of new djia highs spared us the fate of large swaths of the industrialized world we should be very grateful indeed i believe arthur schlesinger would caution us to beware revisionist commentary and to be mindful of the cycles of history jonathan brecht brooklyn n y ms shlaes is mystified that fdr is so revered she fails to see the basic idea that fdr institutionalized that our government is intended to protect our welfare the first roosevelt teddy promoted this fresh idea in his new nationalism speech in then progressive republican tr supported progressive democrat fdr because he knew his ideas would finally be institutionalized that is why tr is on mount rushmore and fdr is revered they made government provided welfare a reality bill decker san diego ms shlaes states that unemployment was five years into the new deal that figure is approximately correct but needs some context to be understood fdr inherited an unemployment rate of some by it was down to however disturbed by the rising deficit roosevelt cut government spending in causing a particularly sharp recession and raising the unemployment rate to roosevelt was mistaken in not consistently following the keynesian prescription for the recession robert hammer pittsboro n c ms shlaes makes some odd arguments against the new deal does she really think that the invention of social security wasnt a major step toward economic stability does she deny that when an economy sinks government spending is necessary dont we all agree that it was the heavy spending in world war ii that finally put our economy into recovery in my book "a history of the economic analysis of the great depression in america " called by arthur schlesinger "an indispensable contribution " i argued that the prosperity of the s was very real unfortunately it gave a lead role to consumer borrowing to buy durable goods such as cars and houses this brought us a greatly heightened cyclicality milton friedmans argument that the fed should have eased interest rates much more is quite correct but it doesnt explain the historic collapse of our economy we not only needed easier money but also a much quicker move to major federal spending total government spending was only of our economy in the s now even under president bush it is around thats why we nowadays worry sometimes about recessions but never about depressions william e stoneman dedham mass we were taught that roosevelt skillfully led a reluctant nation into world war ii for example in britain had been at war for more than a year before the u s congress passed its first peacetime draft by a margin of one vote is it possible that roosevelt so depressed the economy during the s that isolationism was the only meaningfully available policy choice until pearl harbor forced our hand would we have had greater freedom to oppose hitler earlier and perhaps helped to save millions of lives if we had a stronger economy with the benefit of hindsight if we together with our allies had reoccupied the rhineland after hitler remilitarized it and suffered a thousand fatal casualties per year as the cost of removing hitler would subsequent historians have called those actions a fiasco ms shlaes is very right to re examine roosevelts legacy and expose it to fresh critical thinking the process may have a long way to go eric singer new york in her attempt to challenge fdrs reputation for vision and leadership ms shlaes pictures a feckless president constantly changing the stakes of policy she is of course right that fdr experimented constantly but that may have had a lot to do with how little anyone really knew about how to cope with the great depression also its interesting that ms shlaes never mentions that the voters liked fdr enough to elect him in and re elect him in and that electoral record has something to do with his stature in our collective memory richard m valelly swarthmore college department of
