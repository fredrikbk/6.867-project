seeking hope in chinese stem cells treatments may not work or even be safe but dozens make the trek each month shenzhen china christina bogert has spent years seeking ways to help her year old son douglas who is severely autistic after little success with other treatments she brought him here to try something he cant get in the u s stem cell injections ms bogert a year old aerospace engineer for lockheed martin corp says she has to try different approaches even when they involve unproven medical procedures if she doesnt take chances she says "that means my son will never get better " so in june she and doug flew from their home in california to a shenzhen hospital for about four weeks of injections at a cost of &# dozens of foreigners a month many of them children have been flying to a handful of hospitals in china seeking stem cell injections for a variety of conditions there is no widely accepted scientific evidence that the procedures work or are even safe nonetheless desperate patients are spending thousands of dollars hoping to find cures for brain injuries cerebral palsy and even autism a developmental disorder with uncertain origins and a range of symptoms from the failure to develop language skills to the inability to sense the feelings of others some stem cells have the potential to turn into different cells including muscle blood and brain cells leading scientists to believe that they may be useful in treating medical disorders in the u s embryonic stem cells have been hugely controversial because researchers must destroy a days old human embryo to harvest them chinese doctors use different more mature stem cells from umbilical cord blood brain tissue of aborted fetuses and other sources these types of treatments arent allowed in the u s the national institutes of health supports research on adult and embryonic stem cells as therapy for a variety of disorders but naomi kleitman program director for the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke notes that the cells "are still being investigated at a basic level in animal models " last march bruce dobkin the medical director at the neurologic rehabilitation and research program at the university of california los angeles published a report in a peer reviewed medical journal on the work of a chinese spinal cord researcher who has offered stem cell therapies to foreigners for years dr dobkins study said none of the seven spinal injury patients who were observed experienced significant improvements and five suffered potentially dangerous complications thomas k koch chairman of the neurology section of the american academy of pediatrics is also skeptical about stem cell use in china partly because cells intended to repair function in the brain are injected into the patients back "thats like saying theyre going to fifth and mission in san francisco and taking them to california and dropping them off " dr koch says "to just all of a sudden say we can cure all neurological disease with stem cells is a bit grandiose " but in china sean hu a doctor who is chairman of beike biotechnology co shrugs off skeptics "they underestimate the ability of the cell " says dr hu whose company prepares the cells to be injected into patients and then hires doctors to perform the procedure at several chinese hospitals and mao qunan a spokesman for chinas ministry of health in beijing which regulates the procedures says "the stem cell treatment is safe and it has been used in many countries " at shenzhen nanshan peoples hospital where ms bogert took her son the treatment is provided by beike which pays the hospital for the use of its facilities according to jonathan hakim a year old minnesotan who works for beike recruiting patients from overseas about foreigners have made the trip since beike began offering stem cells to foreigners in october of the patients who came in mr hakim adds have come back for a second round of treatment so far chinese patients also get the treatments from beike or other providers ms bogerts quest to treat her sons autism began soon after he was diagnosed when he was almost three she says she and her husband have taken him to about doctors and have tried behavior therapy putting him in a pressured chamber filled with pure oxygen and injecting him with medicine to try to remove heavy metals such as mercury from his blood doug is nearly mute he can understand only simple sentences and has difficulty staying focused for more than a few seconds at a time his mother says the kisses he showers on her sometimes give way to bites and she worries that his erratic behavior may turn violent as he grows bigger in an online discussion group ms bogert read about the possibility that stem cell injections could cure autism she made up her mind to try it but had to convince her husband howard who also works at lockheed in addition to worrying about the risk to doug he was concerned about the cost which insurance doesnt cover other parents have similar concerns "is it really working that great " catherine nguyen wrote in an online discussion for parents of kids with brain injuries "i hope its about improving the technology and not because they want to and can squeeze as much money out of loving dedicated parents like ourselves " ms nguyen a year old mother of three from cupertino calif took her year old son lukas to china for the injections in october hoping to repair brain damage stemming from a head injury he suffered as a baby she says she saw subtle gains he could understand his name and rather than mainly eating porridge he ate some solid foods like hamburgers and vegetables "if i asked my extended family members do you see anything " she concedes "they probably wouldnt see anything " ms nguyen took her son back to china in april for a second round of treatments and she says she has seen more improvement lukas was able to stand by himself for two minutes just by holding onto her hand ms nguyen says "i dont want to be looked at as a mother who is experimenting on her son " she says "but now looking back i really regret listening to the doctors because i feel as if i had taken my son sooner rather than later more things could have happened " ms nguyen plans to return for a third round of treatments in january the bogerts eventually decided to chance the trip doug received a total of five stem cell injections each carrying million to million stem cells according to mr hakim spaced about a week apart after the month of injections ms bogert and doug waited for their flight home in hong kongs airport doug was running circles around his mother somehow he had lost his shoes ms bogert was hopeful the treatments would help but unsure if they would return for more "ive played guinea pig so many times with my kid already " she said "i dont really want to do it again " back home in san jose calif she watched her sons behavior closely looking for hints of progress there were some hopeful signs dougs handwriting which used to be barely legible began to improve according to his mother when his parents tried to teach him his telephone number they figured they would have to break it into three parts but the first time they showed him the number in full they say he memorized it immediately after those encouraging surprises though ms bogert along with dougs six therapists and two doctors began to conclude that the stem cell therapy hadnt worked she says they havent seen progress in the months since and she doesnt plan to go back to china "im moving into the gee it hasnt cured my kid kind of place "" she says sadly
