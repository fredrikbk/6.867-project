bancroft trusts lawyers hold key to dow jones the bancroft family may own a controlling stake in dow jones &amp co but the final decision on whether to sell the publisher of the wall street journal to rupert murdoch could well be made by a small circle of longtime family lawyers in downtown boston lawyers from hemenway &amp barnes sit at the center of dozens of overlapping trusts that hold power over most of the bancrofts voting stake in the company those lawyers occupy two of the three trustee seats on a number of key trusts with the third held by a family member on one of the biggest trusts lawyers from the firm are the only trustees and the fact that the large bancroft clan is divided over whether to sell further deepens the firms influence "the vote really resides with them " says one family member who is leaning in favor of selling the company hemenway &amp barness involvement could make approval of the deal swift if negotiators for mr murdochs news corp and dow jones agree on price even with adult bancroft family members still squabbling over whether to sell less than half of the familys shares would likely be required to win approval for a deal thats because holders of most of the shares not in family hands about of dow joness voting power will likely want to take advantage of the rich premium and cash out approval would require a simple majority of the outstanding shares the ottaway family which controls about of the shareholder vote is expected to oppose a sale some shareholders will likely not vote at all meaning that mr murdoch can probably count on non bancrofts for to of the total vote hemenway &amp barnes lawyers sit as trustees on funds that control a majority of the familys stake in dow jones the familys remaining share is held in other trusts or by individual family members last week dow jones and news corp agreed on a framework to safeguard the editorial integrity of the journal and the companys other publications price negotiations remain to be completed and the family is expected to be polled sometime after that mr murdoch has said that he wont go above his &# a share offer a premium above the stock price before the offer became public michael b elefante a senior hemenway &amp barnes partner who serves as the familys lead trustee and represents them on dow joness board and in the news corp talks is perceived as a "seller" by some other company directors his position on the sale will be crucial because a number of family members rely on him for guidance "if elefante tells them that the agreement on editorial independence can be enforced and the principles are protected theyll support him " said another family member who is leaning in favor of a sale mr elefante has disputed the notion that he has already decided to sell noting that there is a difference between listening to mr murdochs offer and supporting a sale to the media tycoon "there are adult family members who have points of view " mr elefante said "weve tried to be fair to all the family members by giving each of them all the information they need to make a good decision " as the familys legal representative mr elefante likely would be reluctant to go against the familys wishes if a large portion of them oppose the deal while trustees dont legally have to consult the beneficiaries of a trust before acting ignoring their wishes might expose them to litigation whats more the hemenway &amp barnes trustees do not have to vote in concert mr elefante is expected to poll the family before deciding how the trusts would vote on a sale a person close to him said the earliest bancroft trusts date back to the mid s they were established for the three grandchildren of clarence barron a dow jones correspondent in boston who purchased the company in for &# in many cases trusts are used to protect the property interests of minors until they reach maturity or to protect an asset from being sold but they are also employed by wealthy families to pass businesses and other assets from one generation to the next without incurring a big tax bill the legal instruments that hold most of the bancrofts shares in dow jones are so called generation skipping trusts a structure used to protect assets from taxation since mr murdochs offer the original trusts and their offshoots are valued at more than &# billion according to people familiar with the situation over the years the trusts have been diversified and today less than half of their assets are invested in dow jones each of the three branches holds about one third of the supervoting class b shares that ensure the family control of the company the children of the original beneficiaries known as the "upper generation " are entitled to automatic disbursements from the trusts which come mainly in the form of annual dividends from dow jones stock and other investments eight of the nine original members of the upper generation are still living and range in age from their s to their s much of the cash disbursed to the children of the upper generation however is at the discretion of the trustees in most cases this "lower generation" is entitled to the principal after their parents die and will be free to sell the assets it is primarily the members of the lower generation ranging from their s to their s who have agitated for a sale of dow jones they have chafed at the disparity in the income from the trusts and other money issues the family fortune is divided by branch so some heirs are entitled to a much smaller piece of the pie than others for example leslie hill who has six siblings will inherit just about nd of the total her cousin hugh griffiths who has no siblings stands to inherit th some in the lower generation have been pushing for changes in the way the trusts are managed according to people familiar with the matter one issue is the composition of the trustees for years charles a meyer a now deceased sears executive and longtime family friend served on the main trusts that gave the bancrofts a family member and an ally running many of the trusts after mr meyers retirement in the s however he was replaced by a hemenway &amp barnes trustee or not at all no one complained at the time hemenway &amp barnes which specialized in trusts was hired by the family in the s the only way a trustee can be removed is through the courts while mr elefante and his colleagues have shown a willingness to take the wishes of the lower generation into account the voice of the upper generation has carried more weight some in the family say members of the upper generation sit as trustees on the key trusts with the votes to decide dow joness fate
