barring the door court under roberts limits judicial power conservative shift sets hurdles for litigants businesses get a break washington newly refashioned by president bush the supreme court this term delivered a score of decisions conservatives have long yearned for upholding abortion restrictions silencing insubordinate students and abolishing school integration programs but the biggest change under chief justice john roberts might not involve who wins on the merits rather it may be who gets through the courthouse door in the first place in case after case the court shifted toward what chief justice roberts has previously referred to as "judicial self restraint " as it addressed issues large and small in civil disputes and criminal justice alike the courts resurgent conservative bloc repeatedly found that the question didnt belong before a judge at all taken as a whole the supreme court term that ended last week reflected conservatives antipathy to what they label judicial activism courts making decisions they believe are best left to an elected executive a legislature or the rough and tumble of the free market that runs counter to much of the past years during which the nations highest court saw litigation as a way to reshape american society leading to rulings that outlawed racial segregation recognized individual privacy rights and curbed police misconduct as such the advent of the roberts court may mark a diminished role for a federal judiciary whether adjudicating societys most divisive issues or overseeing the everyday machinery of government from the s through the s there was "a different sense of what the courts are there to do " says a e dick howard a constitutional scholar at the university of virginia courts were viewed as "a place you go to solve problems" where liberal justices such as william brennan sometimes "would play fast and loose" with traditional doctrines so courts could act conservatives he says liked neither the results nor the process by which the liberals achieved them "it was a mixture of political theory and objection to particular decisions " prof howard says while it still falls to the supreme court to resolve major constitutional disputes as in last weeks decision prohibiting school boards from including a pupils race in school assignment formulas much of its work this term dealt with winnowing out cases that it ruled never should have proceeded even todays liberal justices sometimes have moved toward limiting access to the courts in business cases in particular large majorities of justices continued a string of recent decisions restricting lawsuits from antitrust claims to shareholder litigation reining in the judiciary has long been chief justice robertss ambition reflected in memorandums he wrote as a young lawyer in the reagan administration through his tenure on a federal appeals court and at his confirmation hearings in his rationale to retain their authority to give orders to the elected branches or persuade the public to obey unpopular decisions courts must exercise their power only when absolutely necessary testifying then before the senate judiciary committee then judge roberts suggested that the federal judiciary had overstepped its bounds making too many decisions in too many cases involving too many issues that simply did not belong before the courts he pledged to promote "a modest approach to judging which is good for the legal system as a whole i dont think the courts should have a dominant role in society and stressing societys problems " as the courts leader the chief justice is showing what he meant in case after case often employing narrow and technical analyses he has argued that courts have limited authority to act to reach that end the courts conservatives have turned to differing judicial arguments sometimes finding that the plaintiff had no right to sue other times that courts lack jurisdiction to hear the claim when interpreting statutes the conservatives have strictly interpreted deadlines and procedural requirements to bounce claims out of court and when reviewing the actions of lower courts they have taken a narrow view of a trial judges discretion last month for example the court ruled to overrule two s precedents that let defendants pursue claims despite missing filing deadlines the cases had carved out an exception if the petitioner could demonstrate that "unique circumstances" justified the delay in the june case bowles v russell a federal judge mistakenly told a convicted murderers lawyer that he had days to appeal a decision denying his habeas petition instead of the actual deadline of days the lawyer filed the appeal on the th day and prosecutors asked that the case be dismissed justice clarence thomas one of the courts reliable conservatives wrote the opinion extinguishing the appeal saying that the "court has no authority" to waive the rules the decision anguished the courts liberal minority "it is intolerable for the judicial system to treat people this way " wrote justice david souter "there is not even a technical justification for condoning this bait and switch " the modern supreme court began to expand its scope most dramatically under chief justice earl warren in the s and s which asserted jurisdiction over civil rights election law criminal procedure and other fields where prior courts had been reluctant to tread "with the growing complexities of government " justice william o douglas wrote in the judiciary "is often the one and only place where effective relief can be obtained " the warren courts redoubtable conservative justice john marshall harlan encapsulated objections to this position in when he dissented from a decision that forced alabama to redraw its legislative districts to ensure they were equal in population so that each voter would have equal weight such decisions he wrote advance the "current mistaken view that this court should take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act " conservatives have yearned to narrow the scope of judicial authority ever since in a law review article chief justice roberts then in private practice wrote approvingly of an opinion written a year earlier by justice antonin scalia the ruling denied two environmentalists "standing" the legal term to sue the government for failing to comply with the endangered species act congress had authorized private suits to enforce the act but the court said the constitution also required plaintiffs to show they were personally injured by the alleged violation without standing a suit is dismissed preventing "the court from reaching and deciding the merits of the case " chief justice roberts wrote "standing is thus properly regarded as a doctrine of judicial self restraint " the chief justice has found ready allies in the courts veteran conservatives justices scalia thomas and his fellow bush appointee justice samuel alito in a sign of how the court has changed justice alitos predecessor sandra day oconnor tended to address issues on a case by case basis rather than consistently voting to limit the judiciarys role one possible stumbling block lies with justice anthony kennedy a maverick conservative who has occasionally infuriated republicans with opinions limiting application of the death penalty and recognizing gay rights only justice kennedy was in the majority of all of the courts decisions this term underscoring how conditional his support for chief justice roberts is justice kennedy appeared to split with the chief friday when the court reversed an april decision and agreed to hear the appeal of guantanamo prisoners who say congress unconstitutionally stripped them of their right to challenge their detentions although the order was unsigned it takes five votes to reconsider such a decision strongly suggesting that justice kennedy joined the courts liberals for much of the term however justice kennedy has been on the same page as chief justice roberts a week ago he joined the other four conservatives in ruling that a taxpayer group cant sue the director of the bush administrations "faith based" programs office limiting the scope of a decision that had allowed lawsuits over the issue of government funding of religion typically citizens cant file suits alleging that the government is spending money illegally but the decision flast v cohen carved out an exception for suits based on the constitutions establishment clause the basis for the separation of church and state "because that clause plainly prohibits taxing and spending in aid of religion every taxpayer can claim a personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the support of a religious institution " justice potter stewart explained at the time the court last week stopped short of overruling flast only justices scalia and thomas would go that far calling it a "blot on our jurisprudence " but the courts decision by justice alito found that flast applied only to congressional allocations not expenditures the executive branch made from general funds the ruling immunized the white house from taxpayer suits over promotion of religion chief justice roberts hasnt always won the battle over access to the courts justice kennedy joined the four liberals to find that state governments could sue the u s environmental protection agency for failing to implement the clean air act a decision that was perhaps the chiefs most significant loss this term several states led by massachusetts argued that the clean air act required the epa to evaluate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant a move that could lead to regulation of auto emissions as a way to tackle global warming while the clean air act allows private lawsuits to enforce its provisions the bush administration argued that states couldnt sue because global warming was a universal phenomenon and didnt cause a particular injury that could be the basis of a suit justice john paul stevens joined by justices kennedy souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer disagreed writing that massachusetts had standing because its coastal territory allegedly faced submersion under sea levels that rise as polar icecaps melt in dissent the chief justice joined by justices scalia thomas and alito scoffed at the judicial "sleight of hand" based on a "speculative" danger to massachusetts beaches global warming might be a problem he wrote but "the constitutional role of the courts is to decide concrete cases not to serve as a convenient forum for policy debates " even when theres no question of standing chief justice roberts has tended to read statutes so as to deny a litigant a chance for redress in may the court had to decide how to construe a day deadline for filing employment discrimination claims did the clock start when the employee discovered shed been underpaid compared with male employees or did it begin decades earlier when the decision to underpay her allegedly occurred in ledbetter v goodyear tire &amp rubber co a opinion by justice alito found that the stricter earlier time limit applied even if there was no way for the employee to know she was underpaid "experience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law " justice alito wrote pointedly quoting justice stevens from a opinion this time however justice stevens joined the other liberals in justice ginsburgs dissent justice ginsburg argued that unlike termination or refusal to hire pay discrimination was likely to remain hidden from an employee such a "cramped interpretation " she wrote "is totally at odds with the robust protection against workplace discrimination congress intended to secure " its not only conservatives this term who have moved to deny access to the court often large majorities of justices crossing ideological lines have done so particularly in business cases as the justices repeatedly have limited lawsuits they fear could interfere with the interplay of the market over the past term at least seven justices voted to protect some business practices from antitrust suits require greater evidence of collusion to allow some cases to proceed and immunize wall street banks and brokers from antitrust suits relating to activities regulated by the securities and exchange commission an court likewise voted to require plaintiffs to state allegations in greater specificity to proceed with securities fraud cases these decisions all set out rules that will bar some future claims from being heard at least once this term it was the courts liberals who concluded the law required a claim be dismissed over the conservatives protest that the plaintiff deserves another shot in february a court denied a petitioner a second chance to file for bankruptcy the petitioners first filing under chapter of the bankruptcy code had been dismissed for bad faith because he had concealed some of his assets the debtor then tried to convert his petition to a different form of bankruptcy chapter which chapter filers normally are allowed to do the bankruptcy code was intended to give a "fresh start" to the "honest but unfortunate debtor " justice stevens wrote in marrama v citizens bank of massachusetts joined by justices kennedy souter ginsburg and breyer because the debtor was barred from a chapter filing due to his bad faith he was not eligible to refile under another chapter the majority held in dissent justice alito joined by the chief justice and justices scalia and thomas argued that congress had not indicated any bad faith exception to the filers "absolute" right to convert his petition the majoritys reading he argued gave too much discretion to the bankruptcy judge standing room when a courts authority to hear a claim is at issue the roberts court has tended to say no some examples from the two terms under the new chief justice lawrence v florida thomas state convicts federal habeas claim dismissed under tight new interpretation of filing deadline daimlerchrysler corp v cuno roberts citizens have no standing to challenge ohio tax credit to keep businesses in state even if it violates the constitutions commerce clause but not always massachusetts v epa stevens state can sue over federal governments refusal to regulate carbon dioxide because global warming possibly could raise water levels over coastal property
