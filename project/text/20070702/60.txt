small business link brewer makes the rounds to revive brand when mark hellendrung took the reins at narragansett brewing co two years ago the brew sold in ounce cans had earned the nickname "nasty gansett " it was the official beer of the boston red sox for much of the s s and s and was once the best selling beer in new england named for a seaside rhode island town narragansett "was part of the fabric of new england " says the year old mr hellendrung then the recipe for the brew changed when the brand was bought out and production moved out of the region and that alienated some fans the brand "slipped almost into obscurity " over the past two decades mr hellendrung says due in part to a lack of marketing so when mr hellendrung bought the rights to the brand from pabst brewing co in he started working to revive the old favorite and differentiate his brew from the big national brands his approach like that of many small businesses that embark on brand revivals has been to play on nostalgia and local allegiances while simultaneously attracting new consumers who never knew the brands glory days mr hellendrung mostly shunned traditional advertising and instead took an approach that was a lot less expensive but a lot more time consuming he set out to personally talk to bar and restaurant owners and beer drinkers persuading them to taste narragansett and spreading the word that the brew is once again locally owned going into dozens of bars a week and shaking hands with the owners and the bartenders "we may not reach as many people but we develop passionate relationships " he says such "listening tours" are useful tools for smaller companies trying to market a new brand because unlike at many huge companies most senior managers at the company can be a part of the process in order to gain credibility with consumers says lois kelly managing partner at foghound a marketing and communications consulting company in providence r i "just get out into the market and talk to people " she says "it shows you really care about customers " the approach seems to be working mr hellendrung estimates that narragansett based in providence with eight full time and part time employees was bringing in about &# in annual revenue when he took over last year it posted &# million in revenue he says and is expected to exceed &# million this year the first step in the revival was bringing back as a consultant bill anderson its former brewmaster now in his s to re create the old flavor the brew had been altered several times as it fell under different corporate ownerships and production moved elsewhere mr anderson is well known and highly regarded among new england beer aficionados so his return which mr hellendrung touted to bar owners helped revive narragansetts regional credibility mr hellendrung says the beer which was brewed in wisconsin under pabst brewing is now brewed in rochester n y mr hellendrung hopes to open a rhode island brewery in the next year he then enlisted the help of duffy &amp shanley inc a marketing and branding firm in providence he felt "understood the brand from the gut " the firm helped redesign the packaging and graphics reincorporating slogans from the beers past while stripping off the label a picture of a ship that consumers told the company they didnt like in fall of the company started its marketing in bar after bar mr hellendrung introduced himself and said he was bringing back narragansett "there was a whole generation of new englanders who grew up on narragansett beer " he says "i felt confident that we would reconnect with older people " he visited between and bars restaurants and liquor stores each week assembling displays hanging banners and buying people beers he began putting as many as miles a week on his car a comptroller and a promotions manager handled the day to day business in his absence still mr hellendrung says at first his approach was "cookie cutter " he didnt really think about the different audiences he was trying to reach so he brought the same t shirts and banners bearing the half century old "hi neighbor" slogan to each bar no matter the clientele so "we said forget the program lets listen to the bar owners and figure out what they want to achieve " he recalls what mr hellendrung says he didnt know was that a group of younger narragansett drinkers had already adopted the old timers beer as their own drawn by its regional appeal when a local distributor took him along to meet a group of college students who were narragansett enthusiasts mr hellendrung realized that another market existed talking to that group he says he learned that "the language to speak to these people is different " take the "hi neighbor" slogan younger people he spoke with thought it was "pretty dorky " mr hellendrung says so banners he brings to college bars now often read "brewed just right for drinking " another vintage slogan younger people said they liked better the "hi neighbor" signs are put only in mens clubs and bars catering to an older crowd he says he also learned to focus his promotions games trivia contests band performances and discounted draft nights to target fewer bars more often instead of five different bars in one night "we would get really excited do a promotion and sell a lot of beer " he says but without a return visit "over the next two or three months sales would trickle off " certain establishments he says have become "epicenter bars" for the company with strong relationships with the owners and regular promotions or events in addition to promotions it also sponsors a local adult kickball team an ultimate frisbee team and a motorized scooter club vincent hemmeter who owns vincents bar and ralphs diner in worcester mass says the beer appeals to the same something clientele who once drank pabst blue ribbon at his bar "its anti cool so its cool " he says mr hemmeter says he sells bottles of the lager for &# each and he estimates that he sells nearly three times as much narragansett as pabst blue ribbon narragansett also courts bar owners with personalized messages printed on the underside of caps "theyll put ralphs diner rocks or thanks vincent " mr hemmeter says "theyre really getting the bar owners involved "
