why an expected rebound in growth wouldnt be without risk economic growth in the u s is likely to recover as the year goes on but that might not be an entirely good thing according to the latest wall street journal survey of forecasters having run a veritable gantlet of threats to its health the nations economy is in a better place than it was just a few months ago forecasters however also see a mounting risk thanks to longer term shifts in the u s and global economic landscapes even a little growth could lead to a resurgence of inflation which would be painful for american consumers and could cause the federal reserve to ride the brakes by keeping short term interest rates higher "were closer to a sustainable recovery " says stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital in greenwich conn "but any given pace of growth is more inflationary than we would have thought six months ago " the economists who took part in the survey conducted in mid june offered a mostly upbeat outlook for an economy that has recently sustained declines in both manufacturing and business investment and that still faces a deepening housing slump with consumer spending holding up a weaker dollar propelling u s exports and a pickup in production and investment they expect real gross domestic product a broad measure of economic activity adjusted for inflation to grow at an annualized rate of in the second half of this year and in that is down from in but much better than the pace of the first quarter of in the consensus forecast the moderate rate of growth will generate an average of almost jobs a month over the next year that wouldnt be enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising slightly by november to from the current after which it would hold steady through june forecasters put the probability of a recession over the next months at down from six months ago what the outlook for growth will mean for inflation though has become a major point of disagreement an increasing number of economists worry that the battle with inflation isnt over despite the benign message sent by recent data as of may the feds preferred measure of inflation the "core" index of personal consumption prices excluding food and energy was up only from a year earlier that compares with as recently as february in the survey one in five forecasters saw a resurgence of inflation as the greatest risk facing the economy that is more than twice the proportion who saw it as the no risk six months ago as a result they now see little chance that the fed will lower its target for short term interest rates from the current by december they do however lean toward a cut to by june six months ago they were betting the fed would cut rates to by december economists fret about inflation in part because the prices of food and energy have been rising so fast for so long on average forecasters expect overall u s consumer prices including food and energy to be up in december from a year earlier marking the fifth straight year in which the broadest measure of inflation has exceeded the core measure preferred by the fed joseph carson chief economist at investment management firm alliance bernstein in new york sees the persistent divergence between headline and core inflation as evidence of a longer term trend in which the emergence of new industrial bases and consumer demand in developing nations such as china are driving up global energy and food prices food and energy prices are also increasingly linked in the u s government efforts to promote homegrown ethanol as an alternative to imported oil have driven up the price of corn as well as the price of meat from animals that eat it "its time we rethink the way we look at globalization it gives us lower goods prices but higher energy prices and in this case higher food prices as well " mr carson says "at the end of the day food inflation is something that hits the average consumer pretty hard as does energy so we cant just ignore them " according to the survey one in three economists believes that globalization long perceived as an anti inflationary force is now on balance pushing up prices in the u s together with rising wages the higher food and energy costs are putting pressure on all kinds of businesses to raise their own prices tom douglas who owns six restaurants in the seattle area says his gas bill at one location has more than doubled over the past three years the price of the beef he buys is up from a year ago and the wages of workers such as line cooks have risen about over the same period as a result he plans to increase menu prices this year but not enough to keep his profit margin from falling to about from last year "at this point were trying to split the difference with the customer " he says mr douglass story illustrates a second reason economists worry about inflation businesses are having a harder time offsetting rising costs by squeezing more output out of each worker in recent months productivity growth has waned in part because businesses have kept hiring at a brisk pace even as the economy has slowed in the first quarter output per hour at nonfinancial corporate businesses was up only from a year earlier its slowest pace since in the longer term forecasters expect nonfarm labor productivity to grow at an annual rate of down from almost during the decade ended in if they are right it means the rate at which the economy can grow without fueling inflation has fallen too on average forecasters set the economys new "speed limit" at growth though several put it as low as that would make managing the economy more difficult for current fed chairman ben bernanke than it was for his predecessor alan greenspan "in the late s the boom in productivity allowed you to have stronger growth without inflation " says ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers in new york "now the fading of productivity means that even if we have moderate growth we may get some acceleration in inflation " eking out productivity gains could prove particularly difficult in some service industries that have been creating the most new jobs such as health care over the past five years catholic healthcare west which runs hospitals in california arizona and nevada has managed to shave the number of full time employees per occupied bed to five from now though chief financial officer michael blaszyk says further efficiency gains will be harder to achieve that is not only because regulations call for a certain ratio of nurses to patients but also because serving an aging and more diverse population puts a greater strain on resources if they cant pull off a resurgence in productivity businesses face a tough choice raise prices or live with reduced profit margins judging from their outlook for corporate profits the forecasters believe that many like mr douglas will choose to split the difference on average they expect corporate profits as calculated by the commerce department to grow in and in down from a pace in in other survey findings much as they did six months ago almost one in three forecasters see a deeper housing slump as the biggest risk facing the economy over the next twelve months "i think its going to take a while for the lack of housing wealth creation to really sink in to the consumer psyche " says steve east chief economist at friedman billings ramsey in arlington va
