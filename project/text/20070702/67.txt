stock market quarterly review abreast of the market this stock car needs help after racing to records market is at mercy of interest rates investors entered the quarter full of hope now they are full of anxiety the engine that drove the dow jones industrial average up from mid june last year through early last month has suddenly begun to sputter the culprits a booming world economy that has raised the specter of inflation and a sagging u s housing market that is fueling fears of blowups at hedge funds that invested in securities linked to home mortgages during the past year stocks have surged higher than nearly anyone forecast amid hopes that the federal reserve would achieve what economists call a soft landing the hope is that the fed has raised interest rates enough to stave off inflation but not so much as to cause a recession people became so optimistic earlier this year that interest rate futures reflected hopes that inflation would be low enough this summer for the fed to start lowering rates that "goldilocks" scenario an economy not too hot not too cold is starting to look less likely interest rate futures no longer forecast a rate cut anytime soon some investors have begun to worry that a hotter economy will keep inflation high enough that the fed could be forced to raise rates which would be bad news for stocks in that scenario consumer spending and business investment could suffer hurting corporate profits higher rates also would make bonds and money markets an attractive alternative to stocks and corporate buyouts by private investment funds which have been fueling a good part of the market euphoria would suffer as loans that make the buyouts possible become more expensive some think the buyout binge is weakening as if that isnt enough to worry about others fear that the ailing housing market will cause a sudden financial shock that could upset markets they worry that more hedge funds in addition to the two at wall streets bear stearns cos that nearly collapsed last month could be forced to acknowledge big losses in mortgage related investments and other hard to trade securities some investors and financial institutions are pulling back from riskier investments pushing up the cost of loans to finance buyouts and also of junk bonds for corporate borrowers developing country stocks and bonds are beginning to suffer because of strong gains in april and may the dow industrials finished the quarter ahead their best quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of although the indexs peak came june when it hit its record finish of since then the industrial average has fallen about "the risk if interest rates pop up higher is that the summer could become a rocky period " says david kotok president of money management firm cumberland advisors in vineland n j other indexes endured similar june swoons the standard &amp poors stock index which hadnt seen a record close since march broke through to its own new highest close in may and continued to set records until june it has been slumping since it was up for the quarter indexes representing small and midsize stocks followed similar patterns the nasdaq composite index filled with technology stocks that collapsed during the bear market would have to nearly double to return to a record it was up in the quarter the yield of the year treasury note at early in may surged in the quarter amid the mounting inflation fears it fell back a bit as the month ended but finished friday at not everyone expects a sharp stock pullback now of course although some surveys suggest investors as a group are turning more fearful many money managers still believe in the soft landing scenario noting that the strong world economy and low interest rates have helped the u s economy avoid a much feared recession corporate profits have kept rising although no longer at the double digit rates that had wowed investors in previous years as long as profits keep rising and inflation and interest rates dont soar and as long as the world avoids a geopolitical crisis these money managers say global economic strength should keep any stock pullback temporary "i dont believe that this is going to be a contagion that spreads through the entire market and brings us down substantially " says ernest ankrim chief investment strategist at russell investments which oversees &# billion in investments in tacoma wash although he doesnt rule out violent short term swings he says "by years end i think stocks will be slightly higher than they are now " it has been four years since the dow industrials fell as much as from a high an unusually long time without such a "correction " with the bull market itself getting closer to its fifth birthday some analysts have been warning for months that a correction is overdue some fear it could be more than although those forecasting a true bear market a decline of or more remain in the minority one of the most important engines of the current bull market if not the most important has been the exceptionally low level of world interest rates low rates have fueled investment and consumption and made it highly attractive for private investors to use borrowed money to arrange corporate buyouts with rare exceptions the yield of the year treasury note has stayed below since mid that is a level it had rarely been below since the s a year ago it briefly pushed to only to fall back amid hopes of fed rate cuts now it has moved above again the low rate low inflation environment was one of the main pillars of the bull markets that americans enjoyed for most of the s and s hopes for another long running bull market depend in large part on a perpetuation of that environment that helps explain why investors are so nervous to see the year yield threatening to push higher some worry that the stock market could face trouble if inflation fears or other uncertainties push the yield as high as or a level not seen since "we are in the late stages of the stock market rise that started" in says edgar peters chief investment strategist at panagora asset management in boston who sees stiffer head winds coming as yields push toward he and mr kotok both have cut back on their stock exposure and mr peters worries that stocks may have seen their highs for the year one reason investors havent abandoned stocks in greater number is that many believe stocks remain reasonably priced measured against corporate profit gains the price of the broad standard &amp poors stock index is about times member companies earnings over the past months only slightly above the average of about in recent decades during the technology stock bubble of that price earnings ratio was close to since the u s invasion of iraq when markets hit some heavy weather stocks have bounced back strongly each time they faced trouble the resilience has taken many investors by surprise and has left people hopeful that the market will do the same now stocks face plenty of threats in addition to bond yields and hedge fund exposure to risky investments oil prices have been on the rise and world unrest threatens in iraq iran lebanon and the gaza strip the markets ability to withstand this uncertainty could depend heavily on the quality of second quarter profit reports due to begin flooding the market in the next few weeks as was widely predicted stocks have turned more volatile in recent weeks with the kind of sharp up and down moves that seemed almost to have disappeared last winter investors are hoping to get reassuring news in some of these areas which would tamp down the market lurches but just in case they are bracing for trouble
