quartets contend with disharmony in the barbershop kibbers and the new kids differ a lot about style how to enliven the genre for years the barbershop harmony society has worked as it says to "keep the whole world singing" preferably in the style of unaccompanied four part harmony but these days the organization has its hands full just keeping itself together the trouble stems from recent efforts to reverse declining popularity by getting younger singers to join in to make barbershop seem less like grandpa music the society loosened the rules for its annual competition allowing contestants to sing modern songs with hipper contemporary arrangements beatles songs for instance once taboo in competition they are now just fine that hits a sour note with the societys traditionalists or "kibbers " which stands for "keep it barbershop " "theyre screwing it up " snaps purist marty mendro years old and a barbershop legend mr mendro of twisp wash sang lead in the mid states four the champion quartet of many consider the group one of the greatest of all time tom neal who made a fortune in hot tubs has set up a separate organization that allows only old time barbershop "a lot of guys really hold a grudge against the society for what theyve done " mr neal says yet the modernization effort seems to be working quartets of guys in their s once rare in the societys championship now regularly vie for the title and won in and at this years contest set to open wednesday in denver the westminster chorus a group of men almost all under is favored to win the barbershop chorus championship it was featured on the nbc television series "americas got talent" last month in the quartet category a group of young men called o c times is a top contender for its run at the gold medal this year the quartet has been working on "surfer girl" and "fun fun fun " both beach boys songs shawn york the foursomes year old tenor thinks the older guys need to lighten up "theyre so outraged that wed do this yeah were trying to push the envelope but its not like were doing rap " he shrugged after a recent rehearsal "were trying to sing the songs we heard when we were growing up you cant just keep singing songs from the s over and over " ed watson a retired navy pilot who became the societys chief executive in says barbershop has to evolve or die "if you dont change anything then youll end up losing everything " mr watson says but he also worries about the discord in the society "this dichotomy threatens to split us in half " he says barbershop dates back to the early part of the th century and is believed to have roots in a style developed by african american singers hanging out on street corners and in barbershops it is a very precise type of a cappella the four voices tenor lead baritone and bass are supposed to sing the same words almost all the time in other types of choral music the tenor the highest pitched voice sings the melody with the other parts blending in in barbershop the second highest voice the lead sings the melody in the best of these groups the four voices create ringing chords with an overtone that sounds like a fifth voice which singers call the "angels voice " on a sunny afternoon at his home overlooking lake mead in boulder city nev mr neal cranked up the volume on his stereo to get the full effect of an old recording of mr mendros group the mid states four each time the quartet hit a brilliant chord he punched the air then pointing to the skin on his forearm he said "it gives me goose bumps " kibbers like mr neal argue that the barbershop style only lends itself to songs with simple lyrics and melodies like "my gal sal" or "hey look me over " songs that have been around for a while "elvis this rock n roll stuff thats not barbershop " he grouses pounding a fist into his knee the society was founded in when two dozen barbershop fans gathered to sing on a rooftop garden in tulsa okla as a lark one of the organizers a missourian named o c cash told a reporter the group was called the society for the preservation and encouragement of barber shop quartet singing in america the unwieldy name and the less than melodious acronym spebsqsa pronounced "speb squa" stuck in the s and s champion quartets were regularly invited to perform on the "ed sullivan show " the hit broadway show "the music man" featured the champs the buffalo bills back in those days contests were all business quartets had six minutes to perform two songs and were scored strictly on their singing how well the voices blended how true the chords were but by the s after the arrival of rock heavy metal rap and other types of pop music most people heard the word barbershop and thought of "four old guys warbling in striped shirts and fake mustaches " mr watson says with barely any younger members joining only gray haired seniors remained in most spebsqsa chapters and they were dying out a few years ago as more and more pop groups began performing a cappella the society thought it might be able to ride its wave of popularity the trick was to somehow make barbershop cool the organization changed its name to the barbershop harmony society and dropped the idea of preserving old time barbershop as its primary mission it started working with music teachers to introduce high school singers familiar with a cappella to the barbershop style and expanded its collegiate contest to be closer to the music industry it decided to move its headquarters from kenosha wis to nashville "the music city " mr watson says "thats where the recording studios are and the marketing opportunities " in competitions judges started allowing elements of jazz doo wop and gospel into performances and gave points for entertainment quartets do two songs and can pause for jokes gags or brief dance steps in this weeks contest the westminster chorus will embellish one song with stomping and clapping of hands and thighs a few years ago burt szabo a well known barbershop arranger became so fed up with the jazz rock and disney songs that were being sung in competition that he started posting a list of "barbertrash" numbers on the internet one example "abc " the s hit by the jackson which caused a heap of controversy when it was sung by a quartet in last years competition mr szabo who lives in orlando fla acknowledges that many of the younger quartets are great singers but he says "if we let things evolve too far then the real barbershop will disappear " mr neal the leader of the breakaway group is resolved not to let that happen for years he has gathered a hundred or so kibbers together each year to sing the old way they dont have a competition but theres a parade of quartets and plenty of "woodshedding" when four guys just happen to get together and knock out a few numbers over a few beers after shunning mr neals group the society this past winter agreed to let him organize a sanctioned contest for quartets singing the old style he put up half of the &# in prize money himself fourteen quartets competed not as many as mr neal had hoped the society hasnt decided whether it will sanction another traditional contest next year undeterred mr neal already has another gathering of his group planned for september outside chicago "we want to bring barbershop back so people will be aware of what it was " he says
