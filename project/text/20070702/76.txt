the daily fix as mariners reel off win streak manager delivers his resignation online edition seattle columnists watched mariners manager mike hargroves surreal press conference announcing his resignation citing his ebbing passion for baseball they heard the departing skipper his players and team officials make apparently sincere remarks to the effect that this was a well considered sad decision and no one harbored any ill will and the columnists left utterly befuddled "asked specifically if he was a victim of burnout loss of passion or changes in the game hargrove offered an unequivocal no to each " art thiel writes in the seattle post intelligencer "but he never truly explained himself to his bosses players fans or himself " mr thiel acknowledged that mr hargrove had many critics including star ichiro suzuki who may be easier to re sign in the offseason now that john mclaren has taken over the managerial reins but mr thiel adds "criticism becomes part of the jobs furniture " and that criticism was muted lately as the mariners reeled off eight straight wins to move to games over "he left as the favorite for manager of the year " jerry brewer writes in the seattle times "he left just as some of his veteran pitchers were about to come off the disabled list he left while even the pessimists were wondering could this team be for real hargroves hot seat had turned tepid so he torched it himself maybe after all these years of climbing back to prominence hargrove couldnt see how high he was " mr brewers seattle times colleague steve kelley says the abrupt departure at midseason doesnt square with mr hargroves career including four years of perseverance as manager of peter angeloss dysfunctional baltimore orioles "hargrove made his reputation in the game as a grinder and real grinders dont walk away in the middle of the season " mr kelley writes "real grinders dont leave the game when theyre only they dont leave before the job is done real grinders dont cause this kind of distraction for their team at this point in the season they demand their players never quit on them and they never quit on their players " confused mariners fans can take some consolation in this comment from the blog u s s mariner "managers just dont really matter all that much " thats apparently not the view in cincinnati where jerry narron has been canned as reds manager a weak bullpen did in mr narron lonnie wheeler writes in the cincinnati post "narron was two innings short of a pretty good manager not a great one the great ones inspire nobody ever accused the reds of looking inspired nobody ever charged them with playing the game the way jerry narron desperately wanted them to " a week ago mr narron managed against mr hargrove when the reds visited seattle there mariners fans warmly welcomed former seattle star ken griffey jr who has his best slugging percentage since he was hitting home runs for the mariners in "in seattle its simple " gregg doyel writes on cbs sportsline "ken griffey jr returned last week to the city where he played for years where he was named player of the decade for the s where he is credited with saving baseball in that town he returned last week for the first time since being traded to the cincinnati reds in and he was treated as a visiting dignitary there was a video tribute a pregame ceremony and a small speech from griffey himself people in the crowd actually cried " but cincys relationship with mr griffey is much more complicated mr doyel writes in part because the reds havent come close to their dream of winning a world series with him in the lineup mr griffey did get voted into the all star game as a starter presumably with some help from fans in seattle and cincy hell start alongside the san francisco giants barry bonds as he did in and bonds undoubtedly deserved to make the team as he gets on based in of his plate appearances and leads the majors in on base percentage plus slugging percentage but several writers were surprised to see the supposedly unpopular slugger voted in by fans who gave him a late push after the giants launched a campaign on his behalf "its a strange decision by fans this one is " john donovan writes on si com "you cant see it any other way its stunning its fascinating its maddening im sure to some its sweet redemption id guess to anyone who has believed in bonds all these years but remember the all star game is and should be a game for fans theyre allowed to pick whomever they want to see and evidently they want to see bonds in san francisco " san jose mercury news columnist ann killion isnt stunned "jokes aside and its pretty clear that giants employees were encouraged to vote early and often and then to repeat the process this is a fully appropriate outcome for the extravaganza that will be hosted by the giants on july " ms killion writes "this is an all star game and never has one franchise been so defined by a single star as the giants are by their man bonds he dwarfs everything else about the team including for the past few years the concept of winning " there were naturally some unjust selections and unfair snubs si coms jacob luft rounds them up while tim sullivan takes a close look at the most worthy omission chris young of the san diego padres mr youngs era third in the league couldnt get him in past ben sheets and cole hamels who each have yielded at least one more earned run per nine innings "when such a pitcher as young is passed over for one with a era hamels it suggests logic has lost out to lunacy " mr sullivan writes in the san diego union tribune "that the players also chose colorado reliever brian fuentes who has been removed from the rockies closers role after four straight blown saves speaks to a baseball culture less attentive than most fantasy leagues " the death of doubles tennis has been exaggerated greg garber writes on espn com venus and serena williams accepted a wild card in the wimbledon draw and helped add some excitement to an event already revitalized by rules changes "after facing something akin to extinction two years ago the new and improved doubles game seems to have survived " mr garber writes the guardians david ornstein examines one womens doubles pairing that has attracted outsize attention at wimbledon "if the all england clubs system of court allocation was determined by size of fan base sania mirza and shahar peer would have automatic rights to centre and court one " mr ornstein writes "women in saris men in turbans and scores of spectators of south asian and israeli origin squeezed into court three on friday evening to catch a glimpse of the most talked about pairing on the womens tour and the supportive noise they drummed up was arguably in breach of wimbledon etiquette " the pairing of the israeli jew and indian muslim is a reunion after they split up in under pressure from religious authorities in the international herald tribune john branch profiles bob and mike bryan the no mens doubles pair on the tour "they have been together years since the moment bob emerged two minutes after mike " mr branch writes "they do not like to be apart and have no plans to be apart even during those feisty private moments when one lashes out at the other they share everything three houses an e mail account hotel rooms meals postmatch ice baths prize money inside jokes nearly every minute of their days " lexington herald leader columnist mark story has observed all the recent instances of the phrase "the least watched ever" in connection with major sporting events and how technology has made it easier to follow just your favorite team and he proclaims the near extinction of the general sports fan "if you can totally obsess over one sport year round is the experience of being a fan ultimately as rewarding as when people all but had to follow a wide range of athletic events " mr story writes "i dont think so yet i hardly practice what i preach there " tip of the fix cap to readers john falck and don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix
