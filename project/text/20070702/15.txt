democrats and u s intellectual property henry waxman and other house democrats wrote a letter to u s trade representative susan schwab late last month demanding that she rescind her decision to put thailand on the "special " priority watch list of nations violating intellectual property rights their protest demonstrates an uncanny instinct for getting things wrong reducing important protections for trade and intellectual property on behalf of an authoritarian government installed by military coup meanwhile damaging american companies working to cure hiv aids coronary artery disease and other threats to world health if their intervention is not rebuffed it would also undermine the rule of law technology and trade have been the engines of economic progress over the last six decades advancing technology allows us to communicate better travel faster and combat even eradicate diseases that brought widespread death and disability to rich and poor nations alike international trade has given us access to more goods at lower prices opened new markets and spurred efficiency standards of living have risen dramatically and life expectancy has increased almost two thirds in just a century these changes owe much to legal protections for those who invest in innovation and production with a bipartisan consensus including democrats from harry truman to john f kennedy to bill clinton the u s has led a global coalition in forging agreements lowering trade barriers inhibiting new trade restraints and securing benefits of investment in innovation by protecting intellectual property rights patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets the integration of trade and intellectual property law was a major step forward in the s congress with a democratic majority instituted the special process for the u s trade representative to identify countries whose failure to protect intellectual property harms the u s making potential trade sanctions leverage for better protection in the s the u s and europe secured world wide assent to greater ip protection through the trips trade related aspects of intellectual property agreement that brought these issues within the world trade framework ever since however a reactionary coalition composed of unions in declining u s industries companies threatened by changes in the global economy health activists seeking free or heavily subsidized access to innovative drugs and ralph nader acolytes financed by george soros and left leaning foundations who reflexively prefer government control to markets and private property rights have endeavored to reverse protections for trade and ip rights like buggy whip makers of the late s theirs is a desperate fight against the future unfortunately elements in the democratic party have become their allies rep waxmans behavior is a case in point after following the process prescribed by law ms schwab named thailand among countries least protective of intellectual property rights elevating them to priority watch status there is history here thailand has been on one or another ustr list of nations violating ip rights since the first special report in and it still has staggeringly high rates of piracy in trademarked and copyrighted goods the international intellectual property alliance reports that or more of the software sold in thailand is pirated as are more than of the motion picture works and of the records and music idc global estimates u s losses last year from thai software piracy alone exceeded &# million more than doubling in just two years while putting the country on the priority watch status ms schwab also noted thailands summary announcements of compulsory licenses for drugs used to fight heart disease and hiv aids thailands military backed government reasoned this would save &# million while raising top officials pay by &# million per year and its military budget by one third &# billion these moves by the worlds th largest economy by nominal gdp reflect new spending priorities not a health crisis or extreme poverty and appear to violate trips requirements regarding negotiation and compensation mr waxman doesnt deny thailands rampant piracy but he asserts that thailand is being punished for its compulsory license decisions which he further claims comply with trips and promote health in so doing he follows the line of anti trade anti ip activists who incorrectly but incessantly proclaim that trips provides an open door for unilateral compulsory licensing this practice could swallow trips protections whole mr waxmans demand that thailand be taken off the list should be of especially grave concern as a one off the intervention is bizarre worse it sends a signal that the u s would be making a disastrous turn to policies that discourage innovation reduce productivity and lower economic growth unfortunately too many democrats by making increasingly strident objections to trade initiatives and the protection of u s intellectual property rights are sending just that signal they now insist that ms schwab broadly support compulsory licensing for any nation wanting lower costs for patented drugs in the short term even if that violates trips reduces incentives for drug companies to invest in new drugs all of us will need and takes away a bargaining chip useful to future negotiations this dramatically mistaken approach that would sell out the nations future in a futile effort to please groups wedded to the past worst of all allowing a few congressmen to override the process established by law undermines the rule of law congress is not institutionally equipped nor constitutionally empowered to exercise executive authority if mr waxman and his colleagues get to remove countries they like from the priority watch list what is to stop them or others from adding countries they dislike however satisfying this is today all of us will pay in the long run lets hope ms schwab who has until july to reply to mr waxmans letter can explain this if mr waxman and his colleagues cant get the easy case right theres little hope theyll do better on harder ones yet to come mr cass former commissioner and vice chairman of the u s international trade commission and dean emeritus of boston university school of law is chairman of the center for the rule of law
