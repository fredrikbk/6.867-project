the drive a toyota act the next time democratic leaders lament the decline of american industry please refer them to the current congressional brawl over auto fuel efficiency standards nancy pelosi harry reid and most of their colleagues are siding with upscale environmental lobbies over american carmakers and workers call it their drive a toyota act foreign automakers were cheering in june when senate democrats muscled through energy legislation to raise corporate average fuel economy cafe standards requiring that automaker fleets hit an average of miles per gallon by up from todays mpg gm ford and chrysler all warned congress that this would add to their financial burdens making their vehicles even less competitive with those made by toyota honda and other automakers the united auto workers warned that even a small mileage increase could cost more than jobs yet senate majority leader reids response was to scold detroit for opposing him and to assert that if the u s carmakers had only signed onto cafe sooner they wouldnt be in their current predicament had they "joined us instead of fighting us these last years over cafe standards they might not be in the financial mess theyre in today " he said his apparent point is that if only gm and ford had invested in new technology and smaller cars the way toyota and honda have they wouldnt be losing market share this is a bizarre reading of recent automobile history detroit has made its share of mistakes but refusing to compete with smaller more fuel efficient cars isnt one of them gm tried and failed with its saturn project and one reason for that failure is that the main competitive reality facing detroit for a generation has been the burden of its worker pension and health care costs the consensus is that those costs add about &# per vehicle compared to japanese or korean competitors the best way to recoup those costs is by making larger vehicles that earn more profit per sale than smaller cars do making trucks protected by a u s tariff and suvs was entirely rational and failing to do so would have meant more financial trouble earlier mr reid also forgets that until this decades surging gasoline prices those larger u s made cars were what americans wanted to buy the ford explorer suv was a huge consumer hit with gas prices as low as cents a gallon during the s u s drivers preferred the safety and power of suvs pickups and large sedans we dont recall bill clinton proposing a cent a gallon gas tax to spur gas conservation or for that matter lecturing detroit to stop making those vehicles amid todays much higher gas prices more americans are choosing more fuel efficient cars a market phenomenon that will do far more to reduce fuel consumption than any washington mandate as most economists understand mileage mandates are an inefficient way to limit fuel use they dont reduce the number of cars on the road and owning a car that gets more miles to the gallon often encourages people to drive more miles if mr reid truly cared about cutting gas consumption he and his party would increase the gas tax but voters are already steamed about &# a gallon gas and mr reids commitment to lower carbon consumption doesnt go as far as the personal sacrifice of losing democratic senate seats cafe is a way to appease the green lobby immediately while taxing detroit its workers and american consumers indirectly but significantly over time technology exists to further increase fuel efficiency but that technology costs money the big three will have to pass those costs along to consumers which will make their products less competitive while yielding a smaller profit margin on those they do sell ford lost &# billion last year as it is one democrat who understands all this is michigans john dingell the house energy and commerce chairman who has so far refused to include sweeping new fuel efficiency standards in his energy bill he prefers the more modest flexible standards favored by the bush administration and u s carmakers ms pelosi has refused to budge from her plan to pass standards like the senates however and so the house cafe showdown has been postponed until the fall or until enough democrats and wealthy sierra club donors can beat mr dingell into submission journalists and greens are starting to highlight this debate as a test of ms pelosis political manhood saying she needs to show the venerable mr dingell whos boss but its more accurate to say this debate is a test of who has more clout in todays democratic congress the men and women who work in american factories or the affluent greens on both coasts who can afford to pay a premium to own a prius to indulge their concern about global warming see related letter "letters to the editor gasoline tax reflecting our national concerns" wsj july see related letter "letters to the editor its as simple as this detroit is not delivering the goods" wsj july
