tax hike mike you cant open a newspaper or turn on the television without the mainstream media swooning over new york city mayor michael bloomberg though the medias latest political darling disavows an independent run at the presidency the former democrat turned republican recently traded in his republican badge for an independent affiliation and took time out of his busy schedule to speak at a los angeles political conference featuring white house aspirants the big apple mayor has been touted as the ideal candidate a nonpartisan ceo and the perfect combination of a social liberal and fiscal conservative but even a cursory analysis of his five year record demonstrates the absurdity of the "fiscal conservative" moniker mr bloomberg began his first term with a firm pledge not to raise taxes declaring in his inaugural address "we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past we cannot drive people and business out of new york we cannot raise taxes we will find another way " seven months later mr bloomberg raised taxes on cigarettes from eight cents to &# followed by another cent increase in mr bloomberg followed the initial cigarette tax hike by proposing a whopping property tax increase eventually reduced to by his democratic city council in the "fiscally conservative" mayor added insult to injury by piling on a raise in the citys income and sales taxes although mr bloomberg offered tax rebates and is now implementing property and sales tax cuts this relief is small compared to the additional burden imposed on homeowners and businesses in his first term a study by new york citys independent budget office published this year concluded that the tax burden is higher than the average of other major cities amazingly mr bloomberg appears indifferent to the effect his fiscal policies have on beleaguered taxpayers justifying them in part by arguing that new york city is "a high end product maybe even a luxury product " naturally these tax hikes went hand in hand with a dramatic increase in city funded spending over his first term spending increased by an average of per year according to new york citys independent budget office wildly outpacing inflation and population growth easily surpassing the average during rudy giulianis two terms and even beating out david dinkinss four year spending spree mr bloombergs concern or lack thereof for new york city taxpayers was further evidenced throughout his first term desperate to build a stadium on new yorks west side in order to bring the olympics to the city in the mta at mr bloombergs urging agreed to sell city owned land to the new york jets for considerably less than the appraised value and even less than a competing bid mr bloomberg also thumbed his nose at many of his predecessors cost cutting achievements he has shied away from privatizing government services and scrapped some of mr giulianis plans to sell off government assets that the city has no business owning like u n office buildings and off track betting what kind of fiscal conservative believes that new york city should be in the real estate and gambling business the big government liberalism didnt stop there mr bloombergs paternalistic policies reveal a father knows best conceit that gave birth to the quip that "if bloomberg wants to be my daddy then he better put me in his will " ironically the man described by the press as a consummate businessman devoid of the ideological zeal plaguing national politics at times exudes the aura of a missionary bent on reforming misbehaving hordes most famous is mr bloombergs law banning smoking in all public gathering places including bars restaurants and offices the ban went so far as to outlaw ashtrays lest they encourage people to smoke unleashing an anti smoking brigade to raid public gathering places and issue "ashtray violations " three years later mr bloomberg banned all artificial trans fats in restaurants bestowing on the big apple the dubious honor of being the first city in the country to do so more recently the one time political novice who poured &# million of his own money into two mayoral races is now pushing for the strictest city wide campaign finance laws in the nation when questioned about the obvious irony mr bloomberg defended an individuals right to self finance a campaign as being upheld by the supreme court too bad mr bloomberg couldnt muster the same concern for the free speech rights of individuals not blessed with his billion dollar bank account now that john mccain has lost his magic the mainstream media is in desperate need of a new maverick who better to fill those shoes than a big government businessman who has the luxury of shunning party labels but calling mike bloomberg a fiscal conservative doesnt actually make him one as a presidential candidate the independent mike bloomberg may not bear a party name but his ideology is pretty hard to distinguish from the democratic party to which he belonged not so long ago mr toomey is the president of the club for growth
