monster firm handling the sale its one of hundreds of little known under the radar brokerage shops that are fast gaining currency and notoriety in the energy trading strongholds of houston and new york even as commodities brokers at exchanges languish with the rise of the do it yourself electronically traded markets a growing number of banks hedge funds and commercial traders are increasingly paying top dollar for the very human services of these small over the counter brokers whose ability to match anonymous bids and offers for maximum windfall has accorded them unprecedented wealth and power "while brokers these days are being disintermediated across exchange floors theyve never had it better in the over the counter market " said javier loya chairman and chief executive of choice

the heels of a groundswell in off exchange transactions these commodities brokerages from midsize firms to tiny backroom basement operations are suddenly acquiring riches and clout they never dreamed of the role that such off exchange brokers play has been cast in a harsh spotlight of late with the dual implosions of energy hedge funds amaranth advisors llp and motherrock lp last year concerns have cropped up that these brokers and their customers may hold too much sway over a market with too little oversight the findings of a report released last monday by the senates permanent subcommittee on investigations appeared to suggest as much noting that yawning holes in a "broken" regulatory system may be making it easy for well capitalized funds like amaranth to game the market the commodity futures trading commission proposed a new rule friday that would give the watchdog agency greater oversight over market manipulation "what weve found is that all this speculation seems to be driving up prices " said howard gantman spokesman for sen dianne feinstein d calif one of the legislators leading the charge to increase regulation "what were asking for here is some transparency " traders and brokers who trade energy products over the counter maintain that the government would find it nearly impossible to track every off exchange transaction given the diversity and density of its broadly varied deals these people also say that greater oversight of the market could lead to greater volatility by cutting trading volumes and market liquidity according to the

a continuing hunt by hedge funds for off the grid lucrative investments improved access to secure third party trade clearing and perhaps most of all the inability of electronic trading screens to effectively handle the full spectrum of complex or "exotic " options and derivatives transactions favored by some ambitious energy risk takers while the off exchange brokerage business has matured and consolidated in the past few years the fact that there is no licensing or certification system for its participants means banks and funds must exercise extreme caution when choosing a broker in april the bank of montreal found that out the hard way when it lost more than &# million on natural gas options bets many of which were arranged by rising star otc broker optionable inc which has since lost the bulk of its business after selling a stake to nymex in january the briarcliff n y firms market capitalization surged to &# million before returning recently to penny stock territory "thats not even the worst of it " notes a high level u s exchange executive familiar with the otc market "most people dont realize theres a guy out there with an internet connection and a rolodex putting together barge deals in his underwear hes got six guys on the line who want to do a tanker swap and about more on hold " still in a market brimming with deep pocketed traders wary of revealing their positions the well connected otc broker can be the gatekeeper of market efficiency and trusted sentinel of neutral ground reporting back to clients on real time price movements and trading opportunities amy gasca years old chief executive and president of houston based ampro energy wholesale said standardized exchanges have yet to offer the kind of elaborate risk management arrangements or hedges she can secure easily in the off exchange market "if i need a megawatt block of power at night off peak hours only for a certain period of time at a certain price i can just call choice or any of my other brokers and theyll match me with a seller " she said "by calling one brokerage shop i can get the same information that i might have had to call different companies to get " mr loya a first generation mexican american began brokering in his mid s to earn money for law school he ended up doing so well that he ultimately abandoned his legal aspirations to buy a controlling interest in choice energy in notably banks and funds dont limit their big ticket orders to private midsize firms like mr loyas or large interdealer brokers like icap plc theyre just as likely to retain boutique firms such as elite brokers a four man shop in houston that conducts customized natural gas options trades for institutional market players "we arent in a luxurious high rise building were in a small square foot space on the outskirts of chinatown " said anthony policastro president of elite and a former nymex energy trader "i wear shorts a t shirt a baseball hat and sneakers to work every
