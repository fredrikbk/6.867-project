data tracker thomson financial that is a increase from the same period in which racked up a full year deal making total of &# trillion the best on record with deal volume in the first quarter of this year rising to just under &# trillion that record would be easily shattered if the pace of the first half of is sustained the second quarter could end up being a high water mark as the flood of cheap credit that has lubricated the buyout boom shows signs of ebbing bond and loan investors in recent days have forced a raft of companies that are going private to pay higher interest rates and agree to more lender friendly contract terms if the recent bout of volatility proves to be the beginning of a more drastic reduction in the availability of credit bankers say the days of the record merger run could be numbered "were starting to get to the point where we may not be able to sustain this breathtaking pace " says paul j taubman the head of the global m&amp a group at morgan stanley the no adviser on deals in terms of value after goldman sachs group inc this year "the m&amp a marketplace is going to have a meaningful correction if all of a sudden easy credit disappears " after going into a deep freeze following corporate governance scandals and the bursting of the technology stock bubble early this decade merger activity roared back in late with deals such as the &# billion purchase of at&amp t wireless by cingular wireless which is now part of at&amp t inc besides the explosion of private equity buyouts the boom has been fueled by ample cash on corporate balance sheets and the rising confidence among executives that comes with increasing profits and share prices fittingly for a quarter in which the value of deals struck in europe exceeded those in the u s the largest acquisitions announced in the past three months were in europe the biggest was the announced takeover of dutch bank abn amro holding nv by british bank barclays plc that offer valued at about &# billion when it was announced was later topped by a &# billion bid by a group including royal bank of scotland group plc it remains to be seen which of the two offers both announced in april will prevail next on the list was the &# billion acquisition of spanish electricity company endesa sa by italian utility enel spa and spanish conglomerate acciona the april agreement ended an month takeover battle that pitted enel and acciona against e on ag of germany and gas natural sdg sa of spain the third biggest deal was unicredito italiano spas may merger pact with rival italian bank capitalia spa for nearly &# billion underscoring the contribution of private equity firms to the m&amp a boom in the u s were three leveraged buyouts valued at more than &# billion each they are the purchases of wireless phone company alltel corp student lender slm corp and credit card processor first data corp according to thomson buyout firms accounted for of u s m&amp a activity in the quarter

offerings that had become a hallmark of the good times for borrowers companies including ahold nvs u s foodservice unit that have agreed to be acquired abandoned slices of debt offerings that were to be so called pay in kind toggle notes the bonds can pay cash interest or not based on the issuers preference some bankers predict that such bonds are a thing of the past "weve seen the froth come off private equity " says h rodgin cohen chairman of new york law firm sullivan &amp cromwell llp which is the no law firm adviser on deals in the first half by total dollar value according to thomson "but at the same time there are still a lot of good private equity deals theres no reason that should slow down i suspect well see a pretty good third quarter " a number of bankers agree that psychology among lenders will be crucial in determining how much longer the good times last a "sentiment shift" among credit investors could endanger the health of the credit markets goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein said at a conference last week in new york sponsored by the wall street journal some bankers say it is too early to sound alarms about the end of the buyout boom jimmy elliott co head of global m&amp a at j p morgan chase &amp co says the credit market tremors arent enough to sap private equitys interest in buyouts "there would need to be a significant shift in the cost of debt to dampen the spirits of financial sponsors " mr elliott says using bankers parlance for private equity firms he said share price declines that accompanied losses in the debt market will lessen the cost of acquisitions for private equity firms and might offset higher borrowing costs "i dont think were on the way down yet " he says "i believe were on a plateau " dennis k berman
