the evening wrap a maine event online edition president bush tried to use personal time to thaw frosty relations with an increasingly assertive kremlin as its occupant visited the bush familys kennebunkport compound on the coast of maine on sunday former president george h w bush collected russian president vladmir putin at a nearby airport accompanying him by helicopter and then limousine to the stone and shingle compound that has been in the family for over years president bushs invitation to mr putin was the first time he opened the door of his familys summer home to a foreign leader a move that may assuage some of the anti u s feelings sweeping through russia mr putin for his part has recently racheted up anti american rhetoric including likening the u s to the third reich and accusing the administration of stoking a new nuclear arms race and while bush administration officials contend that such comments are meant for mostly for russian consumption others argue that mr putins rhetoric mirrors deep seated disappointment in what the kremlin sees as washingtons unwillingness to take moscows interests into account "do i trust him yes i trust him " mr bush said about mr putin who stood alongside him on the lawn of the family estate "do i like everything he says no and i suspect he doesnt like everything i say " washington and moscow have butted heads on everything from kosovos independence from longtime russian ally serbia to mr putins consolidation of power at home currently the kremlin is steaming over a u s plan to build a new missile defense system based in poland and the czech republic mr putin saying the u s "overstepped its national borders" in every way has proposed using a soviet era site in azerbaijan as an alternative today mr bush called the idea "very sincere" and "innovative " for its part the u s clearly has been perturbed by russias tortoise like approach to dissuading iran from its perceived nuclear ambitions recently united nations security council members began discussing a u s proposal for sanctions against iran because of its refusal to stop enriching uranium and mr bush expressed appreciation for russias cooperation for his part mr putin predicted that "we will continue to be successful" working through the u n security council personal politics have always figured prominently with the presidential pair it was after their first meeting in slovenia in june that mr bush made his famous comment that by looking mr putin in the eye he had been able "to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country " even at the time critics said mr bushs praise intended by most accounts as a tactical attempt to connect with mr putin and speak of hope as reality was nonetheless naive given a crackdown on civil society groups in russia and moscows brutal war in chechnya there have been other memorable meetings between the two including the time a grinning mr putin put mr bush behind the wheel of his prized volga at his dacha outside moscow mr bush also made mr putin the first head of state to visit his texas ranch but six years of such gestures appear to have done little for u s russian relations especially as oil riches have emboldened the kremlin geopolitically indeed observers say the relationship has reached its lowest point in recent memory and doubt that what amounts to three meals and a meeting can give it a lift stocks gain on deal activity a flurry of deal making eased wall streets worry about the potential end of a lucrative buyout boom sending stocks
