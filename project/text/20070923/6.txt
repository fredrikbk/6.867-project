getting going harder than building wealth keeping it its easy to get rich but its mighty hard to stay that way want a hefty retirement nest egg with regular savings and reasonable investment returns even ordinary investors can garner surprising wealth that wealth however probably wont last the fact is it is tough to keep a nest egg intact through a long retirement let alone preserve it for multiple generations most folks of course reach retirement withprecious little saved but if you are determined to accumulate wealth it isnt inordinately difficult suppose your income is &# and you sock away of your pretax income every year for years at retirement you would have almost &# this assumes a annual investment return which might seem modest but i am also assuming inflation to have a good shot at earning that sort of return eschew the foolish pursuit of market beating performance instead sit quietly with a mix of low expense stock and bond index funds that way you will capture the underlying markets performance without losing much to investment costs in truth if you sock away of your income every year you will likely end up with far more than &# the reason if you stash savings in your employers k plan you might snag a matching contribution which could be worth cents for every &# you invest but easy as it is to amass wealth its hard to hang onto at some point you will retire and thats when the math turns ugly lets say you quit the work force with enough cash to cover your first years expenses plus you also have &# million in stocks and bonds you reckon your investments will clock a year while inflation runs at that first year your portfolio would grow to &# if you then withdrew &# to cover your second years expenses that would leave your portfolio up at &# in year two you would earn on that &# that means you could withdraw &# at the end of the second year a increase from the prior year and still have a portfolio worth more or &# result it seems like youve achieved a neat trick both your portfolio and the income it generates are keeping pace with inflation yet this trick isnt as neat as it seems you cant be sure you will earn a steady or that inflation will hold at moreover investment costs will eat into your performance and then taxes will take a bite out of whatever remains maybe more important the whole strategy overlooks a fundamental problem even if you could collect a stream of income that rises with inflation and even if you could maintain your portfolios inflation adjusted value you arent holding your own instead you are falling behind how so while the cost of living may rise with inflation the general standard of living rises somewhat faster as a growing economy drives up salaries wages and other sources of personal income typically incomes climb roughly two percentage points a year faster than inflation so that if inflation runs at the general standard of living might rise suppose once again that your investments notch a year if you want both your &# million portfolios value and the income it generates to match the general standard of livings annual increase you would need to limit your first withdrawal to a mere &# what if you spent more freely if you withdrew &# at the end of the first year and thereafter increased annual spending at so your lifestyle kept pace with the general population you would have a wonderful years and then you would be broke fortunately for most retirees that dreaded moment never arrives because they are more cautious with their spending so their money lasts longer than they do in all this there are three key lessons if you are retired and you feel like you arent keeping up with the joneses theres a reason you probably arent even if your income is increasing with inflation you are still falling behind most other folks this slippage likely wont seem like a big deal except for those who take early retirement if you quit the work force in your s you might spend four decades in retirement and your standard of living could start to seem distinctly inferior even if the estate tax disappeared family fortunes will always be difficult to preserve if the beneficiaries try to live off the familys wealth that wealth and the income it generates wont grow along with the general standard of living unless family members are content to spend only those gains in excess of the national growth in personal incomes thats unlikely to happen unless the family fortune is huge or the beneficiaries are awfully parsimonious this highlights how valuable our "human capital" our ability to earn income really is while we are collecting a paycheck our standard of living should climb as the economy expands once we retire keeping up becomes far tougher unless were willing to spend down our savings a separate "getting going" appears each wednesday in the wall street journa e mail jonathan clements wsj com
