love &amp money sometimes a parent needs tough love about a year ago my mom received a lump sum settlement and asked me to manage the money i agreed now im questioning my judgment in the year that ive been directing her cash a mid five figure amount my mom has frustrated my efforts to expand what is essentially her nest egg aside from her social security income this settlement is all the money she has to live on for the rest of her days and yet her account value is down by thats not poor investment performance mind you the government bonds and blue chip dividend paying stocks ive bought for her are doing well no the account has fallen because she has withdrawn money for what are to me questionable reasons recently she said she wanted to dip into the account once again drawing it down to a level that would effectively leave her with just half the amount she started with a year ago i was near apoplectic when i received her request her decisions are destroying what little wealth she has and my exhortations to refrain from raiding the nest egg seem little more than whispers in a windstorm as i was stewing over this the other day i began to wonder what obligations you have as a child when your parents request that you handle their affairs and then regularly undermine your efforts does the better part of valor require you to simply accept that they dont do things the way you do is it just a cosmic role reversal with our parents thwarting our wishes just as we did theirs so many years ago or can you do as im considering and essentially quit your job of helping your parents it seems harsh to wash your hands of your parents but in some ways thats not so different than what parents do when a grown son or daughter continues down some misguided path tired of putting up with their childs pursuits tired of funding a childs persistent mistakes parents simply walk away that doesnt mean the love stops or that you dont care but it does send the ultimate message i refuse to watch you ruin what you have and i will not be a participant thats how i felt when a recent email arrived from my mother she lives in india now having relocated there last fall for a variety of reasons including the fact that her social security check goes a lot further there since leaving however she has called me several times to sell assets so she could have extra cash to use in ways i thought unwise a couple of months ago for instance she withdrew several thousand dollars to help a local businessman resurrect his struggling enterprise i tried to dissuade her but she insisted that this was how she wanted to spend her money so out went the stable dividend paying bank stock that promised long term growth and a steady stream of income in came an iou for a business that may never survive to repay the debt though she says the loans working out so far but then came her latest missive and for me it was the tipping point if i dont stop her i thought no one will and i cant just let her mess up her life my moms email said she wanted another several thousand dollars from her account to help a distant relative get her life back on track an altruistic motive yes but the sum she wants to give away represents about one fifth of all the money my mom has remaining certainly she has the right to use her money as she wants but shes only years old and she has asked me to take charge of her financial life i cant do it if she is going to make my efforts moot and in a way that i think is detrimental to her future and thats effectively the message i sent to my mom in a long email after her request "im trying to help you preserve spending power in the future " i wrote "and your actions undermine that i just cant do this anymore too frustrating " so i told her to take back her money and do with it whatever she deems right my aim was a bit of shock therapy i dont normally confront my mother in such a manner this time though i felt like i had no choice her response surprised me days after our exchange my mom sent me an email that given the tone of my message to her i was a bit leery to open turns out it was a thank you note "i am very grateful to you for stopping me from doing a stupid thing " she wrote my mom said that having been in a situation similar to this relatives at one point she felt sorry for the woman however she agreed with my comment that you cannot always step in to solve everyone elses problems when you have your own to deal with "if it wasnt for you i dont know where id be now " she wrote "thanks for being there to stop me when i needed you most " so im still managing my moms money largely because given its diminutive size i can do it cheaper and better than shed get with a pro who would have little time for or interest in such a small account in short ive changed my mind about quitting for now
