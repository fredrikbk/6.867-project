getting going its time to be tax smart for next year sure youre starting to worry about filing your taxes by the april deadline but if you really want to help yourself financially look a little further ahead to april the fact is there isnt a whole lot you can do to trim your taxes for but if you want to pay less to uncle sam for the tax year theres a fistful of smart strategies available and now is the time to act intrigued heres how to slash your tax bill interest from taxable bonds and most dividends from real estate investment trusts are taxed as ordinary income which means losing as much as to federal taxes by contrast dividends from stocks typically qualify for a lower rate which in is for those in the and income tax brackets and for those paying federal income taxes at marginal rates of and higher the implication stick with stocks in your taxable account while stashing bonds reits and other less tax efficient investments in k plans individual retirement accounts variable annuities plans and similar tax sheltered accounts as you build up your taxable accounts stock market holdings pick your stocks and stock funds with care not only do you want qualified dividends but also you should strive to avoid short term capital gains these short term gains are taxed as ordinary income while investments held for more than a year qualify for the lower or long term capital gains rate with that in mind select stocks and stock funds for your taxable account that you will be happy to hold for the long haul in addition when picking stock funds favor index mutual funds exchange traded index funds and tax managed funds which dont distribute a lot of short term capital gains if youre like most investors you hate to sell at a loss and if you do any tax loss selling you probably wait until year end these capital losses are first used to offset capital gains if your losses exceed your gains you can use the additional losses to reduce that years taxable income by as much as &# "you should be using this concept throughout the year not just in the last few weeks of december " advises brendan okeefe a financial planner in orleans mass "if you need cash out of your taxable account in april or may you may want to review your portfolio and harvest your tax losses then possibly the smartest way to cut your tax bill is to contribute the maximum possible to your employers k or b plan you will amass more money for retirement you might snag a matching contribution from your employer and you will enjoy both an initial tax deduction and tax deferred growth want to max out your k its a lot easier if you salt away a steady or of your salary starting in january rather than waiting until late in the year and trying to play catch up the tax year may be over but mr okeefe says there is still one way to cut your tax bill fund a tax deductible ira in fact you might be able to fund a tax deductible ira for cut the tax bill thats payable by april and then put your refund toward your ira contribution even if you dont qualify for a tax deductible ira you may be eligible for a roth ira which will give you tax free growth in both and the maximum ira contribution is &# unless you are age or older in which case you can sock away &# as an added bonus your ira will allow you to tap into market sectors that arent available in your k "if you have an ira you can buy any asset class you like " notes glenn frank a financial planner in waltham mass "rarely have i seen reits as an option in a k plan you also wont see emerging markets small cap international or high yield bonds " while you are boosting your after tax investment returns also aim to trim your after tax debt costs to that end take out a home equity line of credit and use it to pay off your credit card balances a home equity line of credit will likely charge less interest plus the interest levied should be tax deductible mr frank says it sometimes also makes sense to use your credit line to pay for car purchases rather than taking out an auto loan but he cautions against tapping the credit line too casually "ive seen people who get the home equity line of credit and then their spending habits change " mr frank says "it can be a little scary " dont just cut your taxes also look to cut your tax hassles start by avoiding troublesome investments in your taxable account such as limited partnerships or any strategy that involves a lot of trading next create a folder for the tax year and use it to store tax related information such as charitable contributions estimated tax payments ira contributions and property tax payments "anything that could possibly be a taxable activity put it in there " mr okeefe suggests "then at the end of the year you dont have to go hunting for it " finally be sure to file away your year end investment statements which will list your purchases and sales as well as any dividends interest and fund distributions you may need these statements to calculate the cost basis for investments you sell in your taxable account this is particularly important with mutual funds because figuring out your cost basis is so tricky true many fund companies and brokerage firms now provide cost basis information but if you move your account from one brokerage firm to another the cost basis information may not get transferred over result you will face a heap of headaches if you sell fund shares unless of course youve kept good records jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall
