love &amp money a plan spend and spend some more this may be an expensive year my wife amy and i spent last saturday morning planning our finances for laying out what we want and need to accomplish with our discretionary income this year and what we determined was something unusual for us instead of looking to save more as we typically do our priority for is spending this is an exercise weve undertaken every january for the past few years our own family financial summit these summits have opened our eyes to the money we waste each day each week each month by forcing us to examine what we want to do with our money ahead of time instead of just assuming well find a way to make our finances work in the moment it helped us build a larger emergency account that we deemed necessary one year for instance and pushed me to finally begin funding a college savings account for our young daughter this year we expect to redirect money that otherwise would go into savings because of several financial needs that must be taken care of as well as one financial want certainly were not eliminating our savings effort through our k plans at work and the online savings account we contribute to each month well continue to save a meaningful piece of our take home pay nevertheless for us is the year of the expense heres a look at what came of our financial summit in the hope that it might spur others to consider how they too want the year to play out financially our year old daughter is a primary focus this year we adopted her from china in and shes struggling with her language skills while she understands everything we say her command of speech lags well behind her peers for the past six months she has participated in a speech therapy program that has been quite affordable now however our little girl is reaching an age where shell soon move out of day care and into pre k at her school as such she needs to be able to better pronounce words so that she can express herself to teachers and classmates that means were looking at the expense of hiring a professional speech therapist later this year the therapists were considering charge between &# and &# an hour were not sure how many sessions our daughter will attend each month but if its once a week thats upward of &# monthly that we have to begin working into our spending plan at some point a new roof and a remodeled bathroom and kitchen are priorities this year as well though well likely do only one of the remodeling efforts some rough thunderstorms blew through town in recent weeks and the next day amy noticed water stains on a wall in our living room a hallway and a bedroom ceiling roofers told us the entire roof looks battered and likely needs replacing insurance will cover some of the cost but not an entire roof that means were on the hook for a big expense if we choose to replace the roof later this year it also means we must now re examine plans to redo both the master bath and kitchen we want to make both of those rooms more functional and in the case of the bathroom operational the faux marble garden tub cracked more than a year ago and rather than rush to replace it we decided to save that money and put it into a bathroom makeover the kitchen is generally fine just ill designed for our family ultimately we will remodel both rooms and each promises to cost more than &# the question is can we afford both now that the roof issue has cropped up that answer we both agree is no and so at some point this year well have to chose between kitchen and bath if it turns out our roof wont need replacing then well redirect that cost into whichever project we sidelined those previous expenses are generally necessities this is where the one want comes in a weeklong trip next fall for the family to finland i know odd choice but ever since my son has been able to understand christmas ive wanted to take him to the santa claus village in northern finland he loves the christmas season and while hes still a believer i want him to experience the aura of santa in a somewhat authentic semblance of the north pole a trip that amy and i know will leave a lasting impression on him ive been pricing airfare and hotels and a trip to finland for four will set us back about &# more than weve ever paid for any single vacation but to both of us this is a trip that most likely can only happen this year since our son will soon stop believing it is a once in a lifetime trip for our family elevating it into a different category than a standard family vacation our daughter who will be at the time may be too young but waiting until shes old enough pushes our son well past the age of belief for that reason were willing to spend more to make this a reality not just for our son but also for me and amy we both want this memory with him heres what all of this means in terms of our family finances for a long time weve built into our monthly spending plan an amount of money that is allocated to nothing money that goes into a special savings account that we can draw on as needed for big one time expenses so we do already have some money set aside but its far from enough to cover these three big costs so were beginning the new year by diverting an increased volume of money into that slush fund the trade off is fewer dollars going into our traditional savings account even with the extra infusion the slush fund wont cover the kind of spending were talking about to cover the difference we will probably have to resort to that all american standby debt for us however that doesnt mean credit cards we have a home equity line of credit we opened a few years ago just in case we ever needed access to cash for these sorts of issues the interest rates are far cheaper and we can write off on our taxes the interest we pay that strategy ultimately means we might have to continue redirecting potential savings into paying off any debt we accumulate possibly into depending on the amount we must borrow but the way we see it we can manage it because weve already planned for it jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
