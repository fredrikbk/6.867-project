when buying a stock plan your goodbye added a new stock to your portfolio its time to think about selling no we dont mean you should unload that promising new holding tomorrow but what you should do before any more time goes by is think carefully about when you might sell down the road choosing when to let go of a stock can be tricky investors are often reluctant to admit they were wrong and tempted to hang on to losers in the hope of a turnaround judging when a winning stock has peaked can be just as perplexing a well thought out game plan for when to sell raises the odds that your decision will be rational rather than emotional that may help maximize your returns "the sell decision is the most important decision you can make" in investing says barry james president of james advantage funds in xenia ohio "even if you buy randomly and have a good sell discipline you can probably outperform the market over a period of time " heres a look at a few selling strategies professionals rely on a sharp earnings disappointment can be a good signal to sell because it is often followed by more bad news says david kovacs a senior portfolio manager at turner investment partners in berwyn pa "its easier to sell and move on to another idea rather than holding on to the stock and seeing potentially significant further declines " he says in he and other holders saw shares of ebay ebay soar from &# to around &# by year end but in january the stock plunged to almost &# on a weak financial forecast and thats about when mr kovacss firm sold the stock tumbled further back into the low s over the next three months these prices are adjusted to reflect a stock split "when the first chunk of bad news comes out dont just sit there " concurs daniel morgan portfolio manager at synovus investment advisors in atlanta this can be particularly applicable to smaller fast growing companies that trade largely on expectations of future growth still mr morgan cautions investors to sell only if the news reflects a fundamental shift in the business remarks from television pundits or analysts are usually bad reasons to sell a stock he says vince gallagher co portfolio manager of needham growth fund in new york says that when his fund buys a stock the managers usually have a target sale price based on the earnings outlook and the potential for the company to grow its business for instance they bought disk drive company seagate technology stx at around &# a share when it went public at the end of the team decided to reconsider their position when the stock got to about &# because they felt at that price the stock would be trading at a hefty multiple to expected future earnings in late the stock crossed &# and the fund did sell some of its shares but not all in hindsight mr gallagher wishes the fund had sold more because the stock started falling soon after "you can get carried away with a stock when it does well " he notes "the lesson weve learned is that you should have a target when you buy a stock and you should stick to the target " mr gallagher does however suggest investors rethink their price target if there is a big change in earnings or sales investors need to be very clear on why they bought a stock they should review their rationale periodically and should also rethink the position when the reason no longer holds says craig hodges co portfolio manager of the hodges fund in dallas in simple terms he says "if the story changes for the worse get out of the stock " about four years ago his fund bought xm satellite radio xmsr at around &# a share mr hodges initially thought the stock was worth &# to &# but raised his target as he saw xm wasnt just signing up individuals but was also brokering deals with car companies he figured the subscriber growth would eventually lead the company to profitability mr hodges sold at around &# in early sometime after an annual meeting at which executives of the still unprofitable firm "spoke about subscriptions but said nothing about making money " his thesis of how subscription levels would help the firms financials hadnt played out as expected the stock seemed pricey his decision to sell proved astute since he bagged a tidy profit and the shares started sliding soon after xm satellite closed friday at &# a share mr hodgess firm recently repurchased the stock at a much cheaper &# if the market appears to be trending lower investors may want to pare their positions slightly suggests mr morgan of synovus but "you dont want to sell out completely " he says "you want to take some money off the table to preserve capital and then re examine the market at a later date " at such times investors may want to first pull out of their smallest riskiest and most volatile holdings says scott billeadeau director of small and mid cap growth strategies at fifth third asset management in minneapolis that said some professionals believe investors can generate solid returns by focusing solely on finding promising stocks and not trying to "time" the market "a lot of times when things look the bleakest is when the market does well " says mr hodges "weve given up on the market prediction business and just focus on individual companies " investors should consider selling a stock if its price to earnings ratio rises well above its historical levels says mark coffelt chief investment officer for the texas capital value funds in austin but a slight overvaluation may not be a sure reason to sell he has found mr coffelts firm bought employment services concern manpower man in at a p e ratio of lower than its historical average of about and sold last year at around &# when the ratio was the stock rose about over that period and the holding period was long enough to qualify for long term capital gains tax treatment still the stock has risen further closing friday at &# "it wasnt severely overvalued and we could have held it a little longer " mr coffelt
