give parents control for the children national education association president reg weaver in his feb letter to the editor claims that vouchers divert public funds from public schools subsidizing students in "elite" private schools and leaving public schools with dwindling resources really he didnt mention that vouchers are for less than half the amount that would be given to a public school per student and that public schools pocket the difference mr weaver claims the public has rejected the voucher concept at the ballot box he didnt mention the large amount of union money and member time expended to defeat those measures nor did he invite close scrutiny of those oppositional tactics the blunt fact is that the nea is a union and acts to get as much pay and benefits for its members in return for as little work as possible its not "for the children " the way to end this pernicious monopoly is to give parents control of the money by giving them a voucher for the full amount per student that a public school would receive to be spent at a school public private or parochial of their choice competition improves the breed and current public schools would be free to compete there will be just as many teaching jobs they just wont all be under union control count on the nea and its subsidiaries to fight this to the death stanton r brown lakewood wash
