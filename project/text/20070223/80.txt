the daily fix columnists mourn sudden death of legend for celtics and sonics online edition dennis johnson a key member of the boston celtics dynasty of the mid s died yesterday at mr johnson had just finished running a practice for his team the austin toros of the nbas development league when he collapsed outside the austin convention center paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he died without ever regaining consciousness an autopsy is planned mr johnson won an nba championship with the seattle supersonics in he was named finals mvp and also played for the phoenix suns but hes best known as a member of the supporting cast for larry bird kevin mchale robert parish and company in boston it was mr johnson who hit the basket after bird stole the ball in the last seconds of s eastern conference finals game against the detroit pistons "he was the guy who would miss straight shots then come down the court with everything on the line and drill the game winner without blinking " the boston globes jackie macmullan recalls of the man she calls a "freckle faced bulldog " adding that "johnsons career averages of points and five assists per game dont begin to explain his value he was an unorthodox point guard a below average shooter who was a tenacious defender during critical moments who used his strength moxie and high basketball iq to make exactly the right pass at exactly the right moment or drill the big jumper when his team needed it " bird repeatedly called mr johnson the best teammate he ever had a point considered by jack mccallum on si com "one of the things bird liked about d j i suspect was that he was a pure ballplayer not an athlete much like bird himself " he writes "d j didnt have a cut physique never mind that he was a freckle faced african american and he walked kind of gimpily like a middle aged man after a pickup game at the y one thing or another was always wrong with him he would take off a game or two during the season and he never ran into walls during practice but then the game would begin and d j s cold bloodedness was exceeded only by birds " aside from an interim stint running the los angeles clippers mr johnson never got to be an nba coach but his determination to reach that goal stuck with steve bulpett of the boston herald who saw how mr johnson took a job as a celtics coach and asked for help learning how to scout games "the respect for him had already been at a high level " mr bulpett writes "on that day it grew exponentially its one thing to be good at being a star its another to be so willing to dig in to a job generally reserved for more common folk d j had enough ego and arrogance to fight his way to the top of the nba and enough grasp on reality to work for what he wanted afterward even when many would have felt an entitlement to a loftier position " on espn com bill simmons dissects mr johnsons reverse layup after the famous bird steal doing a beautiful job of explaining how extraordinary the play was and how mr johnson gets too little credit for it the fix loves mr simmons lampshade on the head goofs but hes never better than when hes digging into basketball mechanics if your image of the sports guy is predominantly pop culture riffs read this without prejudice in the seattle times steve kelley mourns a man he salutes as "a hardcore gym rat who always treated basketball as if it were life sustaining as if it gave meaning to everything else he did " "he was sly and sardonic and fearless " he writes "d j never ran away from a game winning shot and always asked to guard the other teams best player he had his flaws but d j was a great basketball player he knew how to play he knew how to crawl inside the heads of the players he defended he knew how to win and seattle related to him he was the freckle faced rogue on a team with multiple personalities he was huck finn always in the referees faces always tugging at an opponent as he fought through a screen always looking for an edge d j wasnt a saint that was part of his attraction " but mr kelley also mourns a vanished basketball era "the impact he had on seattle is difficult to believe now because the league has changed so much gotten bigger and richer and less in touch with the true fans " mr kelley writes "but back in the day when the sonics were the best team in basketball and the toast of this city fans used to hang out after games in places like dukes or f x mcrorys and wait for the players to come in it was a simpler time in seattle sports the city was less sophisticated and more than a little naive " the fix will give the final word to the seattle post intelligencers art thiel "from a perspective of his seattle days here is the most unexpected description he became a man in full " he writes "few of us who came to know the tough ass kid from compton who invented moody before ken griffey jr patented it would have imagined such a flourish back in the day he seemed on his way to squandering his splendidness things change people grow the dennis johnson rule never assume a person in his or her early s is the finished product " earlier this week brothers chris gee and mike echols faced off on the basketball court in suburban maryland with chris playing for gaithersburg high and mike for seneca valley if that sounds hard think again heres alan goldenbach of the washington post describing what happened months ago his brothers foot smacked loudly against the wall as he hoisted himself out of the first floor window thump mike echols heard it the brother chris gee heard it what they feared was that their father eddie in the next room watching television had heard it too they had decided to run away from the two bedroom apartment on rd street in harlem and their neighborhood of boarded up townhouses and dilapidated apartments with kids their own age on corners selling drugs it was a week before christmas they had each packed two small duffel bags with their most precious belongings they called their aunt and asked her to pick them up when her car finally appeared they slowly quietly unscrewed the iron bars from the window first mike climbed out then chris thump chriss feet quietly hit the ground but the noise had given them away denny matthews the radio voice of the kansas city royals won the ford c frick award the highest honor accorded baseball announcers and

posnanski of the kansas city star opens with a gibe about the announcer not having call waiting adding that theyre considering starting a collection at kauffman stadium "of course once they raise enough money they will still have to teach denny how to use it " mr posnanski writes "and they also might have to buy him a touch tone telephone so it really might not be worth the effort what can you say denny matthews is an old fashioned guy an old fashioned announcer and thats why it is such a wonderful thing to see him honored by the baseball hall of fame we live in a flashy time a modern world and if theres one thing you can say without any argument its this denny matthews is neither flashy nor modern hes been calling baseball games quietly in kansas city since its easy to get lost in this
