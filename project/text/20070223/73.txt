studies take measure of how stereotyping alters performance its a good bet that even cavemen noticed that emotions can impair your ability to think and perform at your best anxiety or fear during a mammoth hunt probably meant roots and berries for dinner noticing however isnt the same as understanding after years of studying situations such as choking under pressure or succumbing to "stereotype threat" in which you perform worse if youre reminded that your sex race or age group tends to muff the test youre about to take scientists are learning how emotion combines in the brain with memory attention and other cognitive skills to make your spear miss the mammoth at the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science last weekend researchers gave the lie to the belief that brain structures that think and ones that feel emotions are walled off from the other instead emotion and cognition mingle activity in a particular brain region reflects the integration of cognition and emotion explained jeremy gray of yale university and it isnt so simple as pleasant emotions being good for thinking and negative ones impairing it instead the mingling brings surprising results in one study prof gray and colleagues had volunteers watch a comedy video then the volunteers tried to keep three words in mind they saw three words in a row and when they saw a fourth they mentally deleted the first word and indicated whether the deleted word was the same as the new word for lock river ladle key the answer is no feeling amused improved verbal working memory the volunteers got more answers right but it made spatial memory tested with faces worse horror videos had an opposite effect the mild anxiety they induced improved spatial memory but hurt verbal memory why the switch maybe when our ancestors felt threatened it behooved them to remember what their allies looked like or how to hide spatial tasks rather than to talk their way out of it in this case natural selection would sculpt brains so that anxiety sharpens spatial ability an explanation for the amusement memory connection is up for grabs a curious thing about emotions and thought is that stars are at greater risk for tripping up than also rans finds research psychologist sian leah beilock of the university of chicago who organized the aaas session she studies how performance pressure affects the ability to do math in your head which requires ample "scratch pad" memory under pressure good mental mathematicians choke more than math dunces the reason seems to be that the first group owes its prowess to excellent scratch pad memory pressure wipes out this advantage how the first study to use brain imaging to probe stereotype threat provides some clues maryjane wraga of smith college followed the usual script for stereotype threat comparing in this case how women do on a test of spatial ability when they are reminded of the girls are spatially challenged stereotype female volunteers were shown a tetris like shape and asked if they stood behind an object to the right what would they see some of the were told that women do better on this than men because theyre better at taking others perspectives questionable others read that men do better true reprising what piles of other studies have found women reminded of the negative sex stereotype did worse than the other women making more errors an fmri brain scan showed why women in the "girls cant do geometry" group had higher activity in a region called the right orbital gyrus the site of social knowledge such as stereotypes and in the anterior cingulate home to negative emotions such as anger and sadness they had lower activity in high order visual areas and in regions that handle complex working memory anxiety triggered by stereotype threat it seems can quash activity in brain regions that do spatial reasoning strikingly of the women said the instructions women are good or bad at spatial math didnt influence them "that shows how powerful the effect is " says prof wraga whose study was just published in the journal social cognitive and affective neuroscience "even if you say the stereotype is rubbish it has an effect on an unconscious level " educators have been skeptical that stereotype threat although amply documented in psychology labs matters in real life to see if it does scientists had students in a college calculus class take a "practice" test women who were told the test is gender neutral got on average answers right compared with for men women reminded of the "girls cant do math" stereotype got right joshua aronson of new york university and colleagues will report in the journal of applied developmental psychology speaking of the real world a study about to be published examined the effect of the "what is your sex " question that appears on standardized tests if it were moved from the top of the advanced placement calculus ab test to the end more girls in a typical year out of about female students who take it would score high enough to receive ap credit you can email me at sciencejournal wsj com
