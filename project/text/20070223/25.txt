face the music waking up from dreamgirls the movie reflects the supremes career but with the addition of a happier ending online edition a few years ago i got the opportunity to interview diana ross the occasion wasnt the most auspicious one she was co starring in a tv movie with the actress singer brandy but i didnt want to turn down the chance to talk to a key figure from the heyday of motown i thought of my face to face with ms ross as i listened to my copy of the soundtrack to the oscar nominated movie musical "dreamgirls " a fictional film that draws inspiration from the nonfiction story of diana ross and the supremes during my interview some years ago ms ross had told me she had trouble finding substantial roles in hollywood now her life has helped spin off juicy roles for a pair of younger singer actresses beyonce knowles and jennifer hudson but as the real life stories of the performers who inspired "dreamgirls" demonstrate success and failure in the music industry is a more complex business than is often portrayed on screen its the parallels that first grab the eye and ear certainly many of the songs on the "dreamgirls" soundtrack echo numbers made famous by ms ross and her bandmates in the movie the girl group is called the dreamettes before changing its name to the dreams the supremes were originally called the primettes as an in joke an mc in the movie confuses the names of the two groups as has been widely noted the movies storylines loosely follow the lives of real life people associated with the supremes in "dreamgirls " jamie foxx plays a businessman who builds a music industry empire much like berry gordy founder of motown records mr foxxs character puts out a record featuring the oratory of martin luther king just as mr gordy did ms knowless character tries to become a movie star just as ms ross attempted to do in the s with movies such as "mahogany " and ms hudson plays a singer who gets pushed aside in part because shes supposed to be less attractive than ms knowless character the obvious comparison is to florence ballard one of the original members of the supremes who was eclipsed by ms ross a messy situation but real life was messier in "dreamgirls " ms hudsons character mounts a successful comeback ms ballard was replaced by cindy birdsong in the supremes lineup and suffered through poverty and problems with alcohol ms ballard never found her way back to the top of the entertainment industry she died at the age of in the film ms hudsons character is booted from the group because of what others see as her erratic behavior and weight gain its later revealed that she was secretly pregnant in real life mary wilson one of the original supremes has offered another possible reason for the changes in ms ballards personality in her book "dreamgirl my life as a supreme " a title that further blurs the line between the real group and the fictional one ms wilson writes that ms ballard was raped by a man who gave her a ride home after a sock hop writes ms wilson "id see flos basic personality undergo a metamorphosis from being reticent and shy with a sassy front to being skeptical cynical and afraid of everyone and everything the man who raped flo killed part of her that night my friend was never the same " to be sure comparing a fictional film to the facts that inspired it can be a fools game not every real life detail can be packed into a two hour movie and a films pacing and cohesion often demand certain things get cut and other things get added these are difficulties that ms ross has had to confront herself she starred in a film about the life of billie holiday "lady sings the blues " which earned her an oscar nomination but drew criticism in some circles for playing with the facts james baldwin wrote that the film "has absolutely nothing to do with billie or with jazz or any other kind of music the script is as empty as a banana peel and as treacherous " he did concede that ms ross "does much more with it than the script deserves " a number of critics found fault with the music of "dreamgirls " which started out as a stage musical and features such songs as "and i am telling you im not going " the new york times for one wrote that the movie "dreamgirls" was "undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs " of course it would be quite a challenge for songwriters on broadway or in hollywood to replicate the songcraft of the height of the motown era mr gordy wrote this about his record companys success in the s in his autobiography "to be loved" "i am often asked how did you do it how did you make it work at a time when so many barriers existed for black people and black music there are many answers to those questions but at the base of them is atmosphere hitsville had an atmosphere that allowed people to experiment creatively and gave them the courage not to be afraid to make mistakes in fact i sometimes encouraged mistakes everything starts as an idea and as far as i was concerned there were no stupid ones " ms hudson and ms knowles have been doing the rounds on talk shows and award shows singing songs from "dreamgirls" such as ms knowless "listen" and ms hudsons "i am changing " ms hudson is working on an album ms knowles has a fashion line and is on the cover of the sports illustrated swimsuit issue at least so far ms hudsons career fortunes have been very different from those of her character in the movie ms hudsons character is booted in favor of ms knowles in real life ms knowles was passed over for oscar consideration while ms hudson scored an oscar nomination for best actress in a supporting role and shes already won a golden globe which she dedicated to ms ballard write to christopher john farley at christopher farley wsj com
