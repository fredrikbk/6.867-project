weekend journal review television a question of truth early in november actress director adrienne shelly was found hanging from a shower rod in the bathroom of the manhattan apartment she used as an office with no signs of forcible entry or evidence of a struggle initial police reports suggested a suicide a conclusion the dead womans grieving husband persistently rejected he was proved right a week later when diego pillco an illegal immigrant from ecuador working in the building confessed to the murder of the year old woman and described in unforgettable detail how he had staged the suicide scene by hanging her the way he had learned to hang pigs on the farms he worked in ecuador enraged by her complaints about construction noise and her threats to call the police he followed her to her apartment hit her and concluded that he had killed her then unaware that she was still alive he decided on the suicide ruse the hanging that in fact did kill her to the producers of "law &amp order " famous for ripping its themes from the headlines it seemed clearly their kind of story an urban murder with the potential to reflect all the latest in hot social themes the shows basic fare there is by now little that can surprise anyone about the way those themes play out on the series or what certain characters represent who can work up any suspense about say any well to do businessman who figures in a "law &amp order" plot case closed color him guilty "law &amp order" isnt alone in this to be sure a report from the business media institute published last june noted that businessmen in prime time dramas seemed to be "a greater threat to society than terrorists gangs or the mob " all that said the rewriting of the adrienne shelly murder presented as last fridays "law &amp order" episode was something of a new extreme in crude falsification all of it ideologically driven something like the kind though of different political origins that also now threatens to undermine the stature of the estimable " " in the "law &amp order" version of the shelly case introduced like all episodes with the disclaimer that this show is fictional we had not only a pitiable illegal immigrant as a suspect an earnest sensitive youth bent only on supporting his impoverished mother and family back in colombia but a young muslim sound engineer who worked for the fictional dead woman in short a perfect storm of the kind of victims now perceived on prime time as chief objects of maltreatment by government police and a malignant society generally as it turns out neither of these persecuted and open hearted youths were to be charged the real killer was none other than the rich businessman owner of the construction firm having discovered that his worker the sensitive youth from colombia had hit the actress and caused he thought her death the boss decided to stage the suicide to protect his millions gained from exploiting undocumented laborers were not altogether unprepared for this fanciful denouement as an assistant da notes just before shes given up focusing on immigrants its time to focus on "good old fashioned american greed " it is of course futile to expect plots on prime time to adhere to the requirements of reason and the spirit of truth at least still it took a lot for a viewer aware of the actual murder of adrienne shelly to sit through the falsifications in this version that exculpates the confessed killer it cant have helped that the embittering story dick wolf and company ripped from the headlines had and still has a peculiarly raw power the life of adrienne shelly a woman a mother of a year old a new yorker had come to its sudden ghastly end because she did what people do every day they go downstairs or upstairs to complain about construction noise and even threaten to call the police it is a poignantly familiar picture that touches any number of raw nerves this confident woman could scarcely have imagined that she was going down to confront a man incapable of tolerating a complaining woman but who would be capable of slugging her and of everything else that followed in the "law &amp order" version the worker only gets to push the "lady " as he calls her that it would seem is not the kind of truth and not the kind of perpetrator that interests the creative minds at "law &amp order " over at a still vitally creative " " political considerations of a different sort are becoming more pronounced specifically in the shows increasingly obvious efforts to deflect charges that it unfairly targets muslim radicals as terrorists first came the minor but still noteworthy piece of silliness when the cast members appeared on the larry king program to offer their reflections on their shows meaning most of which boiled down to assurances that this was just a work of fiction one cast member reflected on how terrorism was just like love in the eyes of the beholder for another kiefer sutherland the shows meaning is all about relationships terrorism he explained is just the backdrop it was always somehow clear that it would be better not to hear what mr sutherland thought about anything better just to sit back and enjoy him but all this was trivial stuff compared with the shows writing this season notably in the increasingly obvious effort to ensure that every islamic jihadist conspiracy to murder americans comes with non islamic allies early seasons of "" at least managed to make plausible plots about white american radicals and europeans engaged in similar conspiracies in the current season we have an entire international brigade of plotters thrown in with jihadists the writers have indeed now even resorted to that hoariest of cliches the russian ultranationalist general dreaming of vengeance for the cold war loss that convenient character well known to hollywood producers interested in making films about terrorists that dont run into trouble in muslim markets no one will miss the political point of this nationalists emergence on " " or the reason this mastermind gets to recite triumphant lines about how nuclear destruction will take place and "everyone will blame the arabs "
