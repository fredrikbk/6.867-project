a pitch for change in europes auto ads worry over the climate regulation has group backing shift in focus frankfurt europes car makers are coming under pressure to clean up another area of their business their ads amid growing alarm over climate change and a trend in europe toward faster heavier cars a group representing europes leading advertising agencies has drafted guidelines covering issues such as safety and the environment that if adopted would establish basic principles for ad agencies to follow when promoting cars the move reflects a bid to get ahead of potential regulations following increased government scrutiny of the auto industrys contribution to global warming the guidelines build on existing voluntary codes that apply to car ads in the netherlands and belgium dominic lyle director general of the european association of communications agencies in brussels which is drafting the guidelines emphasizes they would be voluntary and says he doesnt expect them to radically affect car makers ads why bother "i dont want my industry to be in a position where we look as if were not on top of an issue which is a public matter " he says "what were trying to do in this new legislative environment is say here are some things you should be aware of " among the suggested principles in his groups draft guidelines "speed or acceleration claims should not be the main message of an advertisement " adds mr lyle "weve seen regulation on tobacco were beginning to see it on food advertising if the discussion on climate change carries on we may see something on car advertising as well " to many americans the notion that government might control car ads as tightly as those for cigarettes might seem far fetched a spokeswoman for the european automobile manufacturers association also based in brussels declined to comment on the draft guidelines from mr lyles group but added that "if theres a proposal from european union regulators well look at it " mr lyle said the guidelines would demand little more than common sense for example that "you shouldnt show someone driving a car without a seatbelt on or breaking the speed limit or driving recklessly " the effort to set basic guidelines on auto makers ads comes as scrutiny of the industrys advertising practices is growing in europe a survey of newspaper advertisements in the united kingdom by friends of the earth an environmental group found more than half were for cars that produce grams ounces or more of carbon dioxide per kilometer well above the european unions stated goal of reducing average co emissions from new cars to grams per kilometer mile carbon dioxide is the gas associated with global warming produced whenever fossil fuels are burned a similar study published last year by friends of the earths german affiliate found car advertising in that country is more likely now to emphasize speed sportiness and adventure than a decade ago eu regulators are noticing a report last year by consultants for the eus executive policy making arm the european commission found auto makers marketing strategies "are often at odds with and overshadowing" the commissions attempts to educate consumers about the effect of their purchasing decisions on climate change "at a minimum a code of conduct for advertising on environment and sustainability grounds should be considered " the report concluded industry officials say their ads play off of customers desires rather than create them "you can only sell cars to people when theyre convinced its something they want " says torsten muller otvoes director of central marketing and brand management at bmw in the case of sport utility vehicles one of europes fastest growing segments mr muller otvoes says customers are demanding versatility though he acknowledges that "very few of our suv customers leave the road except maybe to go to the ski chalet " the u k s society of motor manufacturers and traders said its own survey of newspaper ads over a three day period in found more than half were for cars whose co emissions were equal to or less than the average for the new car market as a whole in germany europes largest car market some of the more outlandish tv car ads lately have featured volkswagens touareg sport utility vehicle in one a touareg is shown pulling a boeing as part of a demonstration of its strength a more humorous ad features a couple using their touareg to outrace a buffalo stampede across a rugged landscape environmentalists and their allies arent impressed last month a regional court in daimlerchryslers hometown of stuttgart germany ruled the companys mercedes benz unit violated a new german law requiring auto makers to reveal the fuel economy and co output of their vehicles whenever they promote the performance of their engines in print ads the ruling which centered on a single advertisement last fall in spiegel one of germanys biggest magazines arose from a lawsuit filed by environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe after mercedes officials neglected to disclose the fuel economy performance of the new mercedes cl coupe in the ad as required by german law a daimlerchrysler spokeswoman says the ads failure to provide the cars fuel economy was an oversight and said that the auto maker already routinely discloses the fuel economy of its cars in advertisements almut
