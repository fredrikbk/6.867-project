weekend journal tastings wines new wave stores with shtick novel techniques target new buyers service with a parka tom geniesse used to help develop movies and television series he left that to start an internet business education company and not long ago sold that all the while he was a wine lover so we suppose it was natural given his creative bent that he would decide that there had to be a better way to design a wine shop so last year he opened bottlerocket wine &amp spirit in new york city there are different wines in the store one for every day of the year all are lined up on the right side of the store alphabetically by country from argentina to the u s then down the middle of the store the same wines are organized around kiosks by theme theres wine to have with seafood for instance which is then broken down into heavier and lighter fish dishes theres even a kiosk marked "gifts " with subheadings including "third date " "the traditional store does nothing to help the consumer buy intelligently and learn other than provide a knowledgeable salesperson " mr geniesse says "wine is a confusing but very rewarding subject so i thought gee there must be a way that this complex world can be presented to folks in such a way that they can be intelligent and learn and grow confident " call them stores with shtick or better yet lets identify them by the generation many of them seem to covet lets call them y stores all over the country y stores are opening up with all sorts of new ideas to make the wine buying experience more fun and less intimidating some are already franchising their ideas and others hope to do so in the future some stores will make it and some wont some ideas will last and some will die but right now is a particularly good time to be a wine lover because there are more interesting stores and wines out there than ever joshua wesson co founder of the best cellars chain was way ahead in this trend beginning in in manhattan with an easy to navigate store the wines are organized in eight style categories fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet there are seven best cellars now in six cities "i do think that we lit the sparkler its kind of great to see " he says of the explosion of interesting stores that followed his innovations and in some cases went beyond them "our goal was to make shopping for wine as much fun as drinking it " to be sure the new wave hasnt reached everywhere yet some areas still have state stores or laws that inhibit modernization of the wine buying experience while other places just havent yet been touched by the trend in addition and we cant emphasize this strongly enough nothing will ever replace a store with an interesting ever changing selection fair prices and friendly passionate knowledgeable merchants whether the store has shtick or not all that said though here is a mixed case of interesting trends weve seen recently we have focused on stores around new york city which is a hotbed of y stores but these trends are apparent in many places smaller selection it would seem that consumers would want as much choice as possible thats why we love giant stores like sams wines &amp spirits in chicago but many y stores believe that less is more that a limited number of good bottles makes the experience less intimidating a franchise chain called vino which now has stores in states offers an average of about wines at each store such a concept is related to the idea that some stores seem focused more on people buying a single bottle for immediate consumption than on acquiring mixed cases to lay down for a while that also means they place more of an emphasis on drink now wines stores that offer pricier well aged wines and focus on collectors and moneyed wine lovers have little to fear from most y stores wines by weight or taste profile at quite a few new stores such as pour in new york city wine is grouped by taste such as "bright " "plush" and "mellow " at others such as vino vino in new york wine is arranged by weight from lightest tasting to heaviest keeping cool wine should be stored well at a temperature around degrees some y stores keep the store temperature around there moore brothers in new york offers coats to customers when they walk in moore brothers which also has stores in wilmington del and pennsauken n j also promises that the wines were handled from the winery to the store under temperature controlled conditions another store in new jersey is so proud of its temperature controlled environment that its named degree wine food pairings the new wave merchants realize that wine goes with food and that most people pick up a bottle for dinner that night so some stores specifically have areas for say asian food some provide recipes customers who walk into pour are greeted with the question "what are you having for dinner tonight " some stores such as who cut the cheese in maui hawaii focus specifically on selling cheese and wine do one thing well with americas increased interest in wine some merchants think nows the time to make a go at a store that sells the wine of only one country or region wine stores have specialized in this region or that forever but there now are more stores that sell only wines from one place tinto fino in new york for instance sells only wines from spain this means consumers can go deeper into certain regions than ever before because these stores tend to find unusual stuff from small producers mani dawes owner of three month old tinto fino and part owner and wine director of tia pol a tapas bar majored in spanish in college and lived in spain for three years "i just fell in love with it and couldnt get it out of my system " she says the all spanish inventory with labels and a focus on sherries is she says "my way of getting closer to the country " kids areas some stores are providing small sections in the back or off in a corner with books or crayons to keep kids busy while mom and dad shop this is inevitably controversial some people surely think that kids and wine stores dont mix and not allowed everywhere but mr geniesse who has a small kids area at bottlerocket says "i think that all retail is really on some level a neighborhood phenomenon and a service and it just seemed so logical to provide for the little people too so they can enjoy their experience and then their parents can enjoy their own experience " tasting notes its hard to believe this has been so long in coming but many y stores display their own tasting notes for every bottle in the store and in many cases include a copy of the notes with purchased bottles at discovery wines in new york consumers scan the bar code of any bottle at one of many computers and the screen displays all sorts of information about the wine including tasting notes and food pairings remember me at the greene grape in manhattan and brooklyn the stores computers keep a record of every wine you buy yes this sure seems simple in this day and age we wonder why it took so long amy bennett the owner in brooklyn says the computer file was inspired by her tech savvy partner and by her experience being in a large store next to a woman who approached a clerk and asked "i had this great spanish red do you remember which one it was " "handpicked" wines many of the y stores use this exact expression to explain that the stores are filled with small production unusual wines that you probably wont see anywhere else with costco total wine &amp more trader joes and other big players selling all of the common stuff like yellow tail y stores are more likely to offer the unusual "enomatic" machines these machines give customers a chance to try a wine for a small price or in some cases for free if theyve built up a kind of frequent buyer points from a machine in the store that keeps quite a few wines in good condition using gas put in your card and get a taste at the seventh street wine company in fort lauderdale fla managing partners mark darley and chris skillicorn have eight enomatic machines with a total of wines reds and whites the store sells debit cards with a minimum of &# credit that are inserted to purchase a one ounce pour among the offerings is opus one for &# a taste the two year old store also has a champagne bar and wines for sale the conventional way "we call ourselves the tasting place " mr darley told us "the idea is that you taste buy and linger a while " according to enomatic company representatives there are dozens of these machines all across the u s in at least wine stores from sugar land texas to escondido calif meeting tasting or lounge space y stores often have a separate area where people can sit and read wine books making the store seem a little more like a lounge than simply a retail space the space is often also used for book signings and tastings and by the way y stores generally offer tastings with real wine glasses for decades when we were growing up in wine we never tasted a wine at a wine shop in anything but a plastic cup now many of these tastings include food once again focusing on the simple idea that wine and food go together quiet education put together many of the things above printed tasting notes books in the store regular tastings book signings and you see an emphasis on a very gentle kind of education no one wants to go into a wine store and get pounded with information or wants to be told that you have to study wine to enjoy it but the y stores understand that the more people enjoy wine the more they will want to know about it and the more they know about it the more they will enjoy it cova in houston offers what it calls the "monsterville wine experience " a series of classes tastings and dinners organized by the stores owner monsterville horton iv in fact cova embodies many of the current y store trends it is a restaurant and a wine bar and wine store stocked only with wines mr horton has tasted and selected the wine experience mr horton offers has many features including a wine boot camp hours of intensive study and tasting and progressive dinners mr horton says that for the progressive dinners participants ride "a rock star motor coach the size of a greyhound bus " over six hours usually from p m to midnight the diners visit three or four of the "finest restaurants in the area" and sample a
