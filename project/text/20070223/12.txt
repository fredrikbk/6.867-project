census plays six not so easy questions who knew that asking people their age gender and how theyre related to the folks they live with could be so complicated three years before the next census just around the corner by the deliberate pace of the u s census bureau the nations enumerators have come up with the six seemingly simple questions they want to ask everyone in the country on april simple it seems is quite hard the bureau has spent years developing and field testing questions to make them so user friendly that everyone understands them and answers "you only get one chance with the census " says preston waite the associate director of the decennial census "if the wording isnt right its more years before you can ask that question again you only get one chance at bat " the old long form census questionnaire with its queries about house size commutes to work and other details about daily life is out spun off in to the new american community survey which questions million households a year for the census every member of the countrys million households will get a one page form asking for information that congress has said it wants to know the final form of the questions is subject to congressional review question no is simple enough name which the census bureau will use if it needs to call for clarification about the other five questions census workers will make an estimated million call backs in the bureau estimates but question no "how is this person related" to the head of household gets quickly complicated respondents can choose among possible answers but to the dismay of some child advocates a th answer foster child has been deleted since the census counted william ohare of the annie e casey foundation which helps disadvantaged children says researchers were counting on the question to tell them more about the size composition and relative wealth of the families caring for foster children who frequently have been taken away from abusive parents by the government but that extra line made the question so long that it extended into the page fold and tripped up the optical scanners that read the answers "real estate is always a big problem " mr waite says the remaining relationships include spouses in laws housemates and biological adopted step children and two choices for "other " related and nonrelated the census asked about "natural born" instead of biological children but in a test that sent alternative questions to households the census bureau reported some people took that to exclude children born by caesarean section under anesthetic or out of wedlock question no asks gender with the admonition to "mark one box" male or female whether the census bureau included that instruction or left it out in the field test the results were the same either way of those asked that would mean in a population of million still checked both but the instruction made the question longer and more visible and fewer people skipped it question no asks age and for a computer double check date of birth because so many people seem to get it wrong adding instructions to "report babies as age " when theyre less than a year old offends some people census research suggests but in the trial it improved the response rate among people who otherwise couldnt decide how to answer for a six month old the national headcount required by the constitution once a decade to apportion congressional seats and redraw congressional districts has become hugely important to government agencies that distribute taxpayer funds businesses trying to identify markets and policy planners with an eye on the future for example the government uses age data to determine how many eligible voters are in each precinct but policy makers use it too and if respondents round up to take account of an upcoming birthday they could throw off school construction planning actuarial tables social security and health care projections and more says terri anne lowenthal who publishes a census newsletter rounding throws things off "not a few months but a full year " she says questions no and no are about hispanic origin and race and are typically politically touchy congress requires both in large part to assure that congressional districts arent gerrymandered to prevent blacks and hispanics from winning public office but businesses and social service providers also want a detailed picture of the countrys ethnic makeup so question no asks if the respondent is hispanic and if so to check off mexican puerto rican or cuban or to fill in a line for any other latino ethnicity "salvadoran spaniard and so on " the instructions read question no asks respondents to check off one or more races white black american indian plus any of six asian and three pacific islander ethnicities and a fill in line for any other asian nationality hmongs pakistanis and tongans are among the others suggested for the fill in line arturo vargas a los angeles activist who sat on an advisory committee that reviewed the census questions says its important to know where immigrants are from because their experiences differ mexicans tend to come from rural areas and may need intense schooling central americans may have fled civil wars and could need counseling he suggests but in trial tests the census bureau also found that asian and hispanic immigrants could be baffled when asked to lump themselves with other nationality groups "the whole concept of being latino is a very american construct " says mr vargas "people might not know whats being asked of them " under a order from congress question no also allows people to call themselves "some other race" and identify that race on a fill in line in census tests respondents declared themselves creole aryan rainbow and cosmopolitan among others other federal data users like social security and the federal education department dont recognize those races though so in data that the census bureau will send to those departments the bureau will impute a race "maybe i get it right and maybe i get it wrong its not something i like to do " says mr waite finally there are three questions that will be asked of heads of households only one is written so far do you own the home "free and clear " hold a mortgage or home equity loan rent or live rent free that question gives data users some idea of a familys wealth and is a broad survey of national housing patterns but because renters and especially young single male renters are less likely to return the census than are homeowners the question also tells the bureau where to focus its follow up resources about million households wont answer the form on census day census workers will pay them a home visit to get the information theres plenty the census isnt asking u s citizenship for one thing because the constitution requires a count of all "free persons " not citizens even so bills floating around congress would require the census not to count illegal immigrants the form also doesnt ask national origin of anyone except hispanics and asians in part thats because of space but field trials also determined that in a polyglot society many people didnt fill in the blank when asked their heritage "either they couldnt figure out what they were or it wasnt important to them" says mr waite "their ancestry is united states " inquiring minds proposed questions for the census  name of person how is this person related to person what is this persons sex what is this persons age and what is this persons date of birth is this person of hispanic latino or spanish origin what is this persons race note person is defined as the head of the household source census bureau
