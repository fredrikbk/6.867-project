weekend journal review theater the third installment of stoppards masterpiece new york the third panel of "the coast of utopia " tom stoppards triptych of history plays about the th century russian thinkers who laid the foundations for the coming of communism has now been rolled into place at lincoln center with the opening of "salvage " it becomes possible to sum up what mr stoppard has achieved and to make a few preliminary speculations about its long term prospects for revival for my part i am in no doubt whatsoever about the merits of jack obriens production it is a sublime work of theatrical art a commingling of play and performance so complete that no one lucky enough to see it will ever again read mr stoppards words without remembering how mr obrien and his colleagues brought them to hot blooded life small wonder that lincoln center has carried off the dazzling trick of making a box office smash out of a sequence of plays about a cabal of obscure intellectuals who talk at intimidating length about ideas of considerable complexity "the coast of utopia" is many things but first if not foremost it is a rattling good show and what of the plays themselves the three installments of "the coast of utopia" can be performed separately but you really have to see them in sequence to fully grasp what theyre all about for this reason it seems unlikely that "the coast of utopia" will be revived anytime soon other than in a festival setting perhaps its unexpected success will inspire other theater companies to try and make lightning strike twice and if that happens it will be interesting to see how well it holds up in a simpler production mounted on a smaller scale insofar as it can be presented more simply the lincoln center theater production employs actors many of whom play multiple roles on the other hand it could be that mr stoppard has written an all but unstageable masterpiece that my generation of playgoers will not see again in our lifetimes and judging by a single viewing of the complete trilogy i think "the coast of utopia" might well be a masterpiece to be sure mr stoppards penchant for making his plays out of the ideas of other men has led some to wonder whether he might be less a playwright than a kind of journalist albeit one of genius but "the coast of utopia" is far more than just a brilliantly pointed primer on the historical significance of alexander herzen and his contemporaries by interweaving the revolutionary notions of his characters with the mad disorder of their private lives mr stoppard has contrived to give us that rarest of plays a pageant that has real emotional depth i confess to wondering whether i would have been quite so impressed with "the coast of utopia" had i first seen it in a less memorable production and it may also be that i responded to it so strongly because i share its authors antiutopian vision of the tragedy of modernity but countless other viewers who feel otherwise have been no less deeply moved suggesting that mr stoppard has succeeded in transfiguring the unpromising raw material of politics and turning it into high art the climax of "salvage " and of "the coast of utopia" as a whole is the grimly eloquent curtain speech in which herzen brian f obyrne sums up the hard won disillusion of a lifetime "the people wont forgive when the future custodian of a broken statue a stripped wall a desecrated grave tells everyone who passes by yes yes all this was destroyed by the revolution the destroyers wear nihilism like a cockade they think they destroy because theyre radicals but they destroy because theyre disappointed conservatives let down by the ancient dream of a perfect society where circles are squared and conflict is canceled out but there is no such place and utopia is its name so until we stop killing our way towards it we wont be grown up as human beings " one rarely hears such talk on a broadway stage or any other kind of stage if this be political theater let us have more of it speaking of political theater it can i think be safely taken for granted that the motives of the producers of the broadway revival of "journeys end " r c sherriffs once famous world war i drama are not wholly artistic though sherriff insisted to his dying day that his play about the horrors of trench warfare was not meant as a pacifist tract the fact that it has been brought back to new york at a moment when america is fighting an unpopular war is surely no coincidence "journeys end" was last seen on broadway in september when it ran for just performances i suspect that american audiences didnt much care to be reminded of one world war just as another was getting under way back then it was considered a landmark in theatrical realism one of the first attempts to portray combat on stage in something like a reasonably honest way and we have no shortage of testimony indicating that its impact on those who first saw it was overwhelming but eight decades of increasingly frank and grisly war movies many of which have drawn wittingly or not on the dramatic devices originally used by sherriff have leached away its harsh immediacy despite the stalwart efforts of a top notch cast led by hugh dancy and boyd gaines all that is left is an earnest overlong period piece whose remaining interest is purely historical i was glad to have the chance to see "journeys end " but i dont expect that very many other people whatever their opinion of the war in iraq may be will care to do likewise mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater
