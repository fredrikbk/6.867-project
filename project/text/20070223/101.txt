weekend journal taste de gustibus dealership dude wheres my car brussels do you hate car shopping despise those pesky aggressive salesmen who hound you the moment you set foot on the lot wish you could just browse through a selection of vehicles without being bothered well has brussels got a deal for you its not uncommon for americans in europe to experience culture shock when they go shopping store hours tend to be much shorter salespeople are often so reserved that an innocent abroad could be forgiven for thinking that they would prefer not to make a sale after two years here i understood this all too well but surely i thought those hardest of hard sellers the kings of cha ching car salesmen would be different understand that i come from a family that loves to go car shopping my father reads the colorful sale sale sale automotive ads in the paper whether he needs a new ride or not were not really the sort of folks who will swing by a dealership just to test drive some new model were not going to buy but if theres a free hot dog involved we just might let me assure you there are no free hot dogs awaiting potential car customers in brussels nor waffles there might be salesmen if youre lucky my wife and i were not that fortunate when having decided to give up our complete reliance on public transportation we visited our local volkswagen lot one saturday we overheard a man taking sandwich orders from some of the employees and then watched him leave just moments after we and another couple had walked in the door one of the sandwich orderers was helping another couple the other spent the next half hour chatting away with either a schmooze thirsty client or his best friend another couple walked in the door shortly after us and then a fourth apparently we were all rendered invisible upon walking inside we chalked up that experience to bad timing and proceeded to a toyota shop a friend of ours had bought a minivan from this dealer before and assured us that wed find a friendly salesman to help us when we found him laurent was indeed friendly he was also about to clock out my suspicion that salesmen here didnt work on commission only grew he passed us off to a co worker who also seemed friendly a little too friendly smarmy even he tried to up sell us to a larger more expensive model this was more like it i felt a shot of adrenaline as i warmed up for the negotiations i wondered what sort of price i could throw out there and not be laughed out of the place the price on the sticker it turns out "you mean theres no room for negotiation " i asked he shrugged giving me the kind of look youd expect from a cashier at wal mart if you tried to haggle over the price of chewing gum "we have already taken off the standard discount " he responded flatly no sale there though i asked him to fax me a quote on the cost of leasing a particular vehicle im only mildly surprised that the quote never came what was going on according to bernard lycke secretary general of a belgian automobile dealers group called gda some belgian car salesmen receive extra pay if they hit annual sales targets but others dont perhaps i simply ran into the unincentivized or maybe these guys had already hit or given up on hitting their targets another possible complication because so many expats live in brussels about half of its cars are either rentals or company cars that means dealers here depend on poor saps like me who actually have to go look for and pay for their own wheels for a relatively small portion of their business still undeterred we headed to a citroen dealer no one rushed to help us but by this point we were used to that after circling scanning opening poking crawling around and sitting in one particularly appealing car for about minutes without apparently attracting the attention of a salesperson we decided this might be the one the only way to know for sure was to test drive it when we found an employee and asked to take the car for a spin his eyes bugged and a gust of breath buzzed through his lips "i do not think it is possible " what did he mean it seems that the car did not have license plates on it so wed have to make an appointment to give the dealership time to rustle up a set before it would be street legal youd think that car dealerships might have gotten together with the belgian government to find a solution to this problem in oh i dont know the first years that people have been driving and presumably buying automobiles mais non at this point it seemed self defeating to refuse to do business simply on the principle that one ought to be able to show up at a dealership and test drive a car we made the required appointment and when the time came were afforded a leisurely excursion to try it out we decided to take it maybe the belgians know what theyre doing after all best of all since we were buying a vehicle already in stock rather than ordering one as most people have to do we wouldnt need to wait months for the car to be built and shipped but even here came the unexpected we could not drive off with the car until we had the license plates in hand a process that would take about a week according to the salesman who with the deal completed suddenly became the most friendly person weve ever met our business already won he was all smiles even willing to vouchsafe his cellphone number and offer his help should anything come up maybe ill give him a call one day and ask if theyre going to be giving away hot dogs anytime soon see related letter "letters to the editor easy going
