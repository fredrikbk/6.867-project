wal mart presses suppliers to enhance their diversity wal mart stores inc says it wants its suppliers to hire more women and minorities but it is still figuring out how it will compel them to do so the worlds biggest retailer has begun informing its major suppliers that it wants their help "in bringing more diversity to the team of supplier representatives" who provide merchandise to the retailer according to an internal memorandum that chief merchandising officer john fleming circulated last week wal mart which tallied &# billion in sales last year does business with suppliers globally wal mart has had a series of public relations black eyes in recent years including a massive class action lawsuit leveled by current and former female employees who allege they were denied promotions by the retailer and paid less than male counterparts the lawsuit filed in was upheld this month as a class action case by a federal appeals panel and could result in a settlement that some analysts estimate in the billions of dollars wal mart has appealed the ruling and wal mart general counsel tom mars said wal marts expanding diversity initiatives have "nothing whatsoever to do" with the lawsuit many aspects of the diversity program remain undetermined by wal mart including how many suppliers will be asked to comply and what if any requirements will be binding "i think this could be a discussion with any supplier we work with in much the same way we discuss price leadership and supply chain initiatives " mr fleming said yesterday in an interview the financial times earlier reported on the diversity program the initiative which wal mart has titled the "supplier diversity program " stems from a similar effort undertaken since by wal marts legal department at its headquarters in bentonville ark wal mart expanded its legal department to lawyers this year from in partly by recruiting at events hosted by minority bar associations the departments ranks now consist of female lawyers and of minority lawyers up from and respectively in in mr mars took the initiative a step further by informing wal marts top outside law firms that they would be graded not only on price and performance but also on the diversity of their staffs serving wal mart in the wake of that mandate wal mart has fired three outside firms and reduced the workloads of two others for failing to show progress on diversity matters the new mandate isnt the first request wal mart has made of its suppliers in recent years the retailer has asked a growing number of suppliers to affix radio frequency identification tags to their products to allow for better tracking and wal mart said last year it would begin granting preference to suppliers who make their products more environmentally friendly but mr fleming isnt worried that the latest initiative will cause fatigue "our stated merchandising strategy is built around customer relevance " he said "i think this is just another way we can ensure we have a very good understanding of customers we serve " though wal marts works with suppliers across the globe boosting diversity could be a challenging goal in its home of benton county ark where wal mart employs an estimated people and its suppliers in benton county the percentage of african americans latinos and asians fall below the national averages of and respectively according to census data wal mart declined to divulge the ethnic composition of its headquarters staff on a national basis of wal marts employees were female and minority in while several of wal marts suppliers have staffs in bentonville of more than and shuffle employees in and out of the office every year or two others employ smaller local staffs composed primarily of longtime residents of the area such diversity requirements have precedent among major u s corporations both ford motor co and general motors corp have for decades required that their primary suppliers purchase a certain percentage of their supplies each year from minority owned firms
