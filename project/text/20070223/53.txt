non union jobs if apple ceo steve jobs had praised teachers unions as the backbone of public education in the u s it would have made the front pages instead at an education conference in austin texas mr jobs offered some constructive criticism of teachers unions and barely anyone noticed sounds like news to us "i believe that what is wrong with our schools in this nation is that theyve become unionized in the worst possible way " said mr jobs during a q and a session on technology in the classroom "this unionization and lifetime employment of k teachers is off the charts crazy " the real crisis in public education he noted has nothing to do with the amount of technology in the classroom its the fact that union work rules prevent principals from firing the bad teachers and rewarding the good ones "heres the problem " said mr jobs using a business analogy "what kind of person could you get to run a small business if you told them when they came in they couldnt get rid of people they thought werent any good in the first place or they couldnt pay people three times as much when they got three times as much work done " regular readers of these columns will find nothing particularly shocking in mr jobss broadside still its nice to hear such sentiments coming from a titan of industry especially his the latest national assessment of educational progress naep report was released yesterday the dismal results are what weve come to expect from an elementary and secondary public education system in the vice grip of the national education association and its political acolytes according to the naep survey nearly of high school seniors scored below basic level on the math test and fewer than a quarter of th graders rate proficient except for high skill immigrants this would be apples future labor pool mr jobs is right to point the finger at the union stewards of public education and fellow business leaders who have as big a stake in this matter would do well to lend him public support
