pay bosses more on a recent visit to the floor of the new york stock exchange president bush saw fit to decry the rising inequality in america complaining that corporate salaries bonuses and stock options were part of the problem "we need to pay attention to the executive compensation packages that you approve " he told the audience with all due respect nonsense excessive executive compensation harms no one but perhaps the stockholders who put up with it and stockholders put up with it because theres good reason to believe that sizable ceo compensation packages help not harm corporate performance which redounds to their benefit and that of the firms workers a study by harvard economists brian hall and jeffrey leibman examined years worth of data relating to ceo pay and corporate performance messrs hall and leibman found that for every additional dollar given to a ceo translated into an average return of &# for the company while subsequent studies have highlighted the ambiguities associated with studies like this the evolution of ceo compensation arrangements strongly suggests that corporate boards are increasing compensation packages for a reason to improve performance it helps to step back and think of the salaries bonuses and stock options offered to corporate executives as simply one of many inputs required to produce goods and services in this case its a subset of total labor costs now ask yourself what difference does it make to you if target overcompensates its clerks applebees its line cooks ford its auto workers after all executive pay as a percentage of total labor costs is small potatoes compared to these line items in the average corporate budget if companies overpay for labor and dont get more productivity as a result they provide a competitive window of opportunity for rivals that dont companies that spend inefficiently to deliver goods and services will be forced to adjust policy or die so the problem if it exists is self correcting if youre a stockholder its certainly worth worrying about your companys labor costs but if youre not getting worked up about that companys executive compensation package is little different than getting worked up about the fact that some company is paying too much for copy paper maybe so maybe not but whats it to you but doesnt exorbitant executive pay harm employees if corporate boards throughout the economy are inclined toward extravagant compensation packages so the reasoning might go the price for executive talent goes up and if corporate dollars are fixed more money for the boss means less money for you intrafirm compensation is not a zero sum game if high compensation could improve executive job performance by even a little bit say by attracting better executives or providing incentives for better management then the difference to a companys bottom line could be huge thats obviously what corporate boards are hoping to accomplish with these lavish executive compensation packages and if it works as intended it makes lower income employees richer as a consequence the better a corporation performs the more it can pay employees the more labor it can employ and the more job security it can provide companies pay workers what they must to deliver their products and services to the market and supply and demand establishes executive compensation packages the same way it establishes consumer prices any overcompensation comes out of the firms bottom line at a loss to the shareholders not the workers the inference from mr bushs statement that rising ceo pay is fueling income inequality thus begs the question about whether rising ceo pay is improving corporate performance if it is then workers might well be better off if ceos were paid even more and if it isnt then the market will either punish firms that are overpaying for executive talent or shareholders would lose to us the only excess here is the attention politicians are "paying" to the issue messrs taylor and gokhale are senior fellows at the cato institute see related letter "letters to the editor just how did ceos become superhuman " wsj march
