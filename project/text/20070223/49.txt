micromanagement faltering family m d s get technology lifeline doctors think small to revive solo role for primary care rochester n y after eight years as a staff doctor at a hospital owned medical practice gordon moore began to really dislike his job to increase revenue the hospital pressured him to see more than patients a day usually for minutes each many patients couldnt get appointments for weeks dr moore determined it took separate actions and feet of corridor walking to order a prescription refill he says he was so rushed he often failed to provide the best medical care and once mistakenly prescribed a blood pressure drug for a toddler so in early dr moore took a risky step he borrowed about &# to start a solo medical practice in a tiny space with no nurse receptionist or waiting room he bought computer software to help him track patients appointments illnesses and medications and to process insurance claims patients at his "micropractice" can call or email to get appointments the same day visits last minutes dr moore can be reached day or night on his cellphone to refill a prescription he walks "zero feet " he says and taps a few keys on his laptop "i was able to build a norman rockwell practice with a st century information technology backbone " he says dr moore belongs to a small but growing number of physicians converting to high tech low overhead practices to try to preserve a disappearing style of care often provided by lone family doctors they are working to counter a sustained decline in primary care medicine long the mainstay of the u s health system primary care doctors family physicians general practitioners pediatricians and obstetricians address patients health comprehensively and usually over a long period of time aiming to catch problems early on their numbers have dropped by half in the past decade according to a series of surveys by the american academy of family physicians a series of surveys of several thousand doctors by the center for studying health system change a nonpartisan washington d c group found that primary care physicians made about &# in about a third less than most specialists and were losing ground their inflation adjusted average income dropped by in the previous eight years the survey found while specialists income was stable today only about a third of doctors in the u s are primary care physicians compared with roughly half in most other industrialized countries studies have shown that primary care tackles many medical problems early on before they turn into difficult and expensive to treat conditions that partly explains why other countries spend far less per patient often getting similar health results some physicians and institutions are trying to harness technology to make family practices more manageable and profitable for doctors in april the american academy of family physicians attracted applicants when it offered to put primary care physicians in a pilot project to help better manage patients and their ills in washington state a dozen family health practices have linked up on a private high speed network they all use electronic records give same day appointments and offer patients email consultations for a &# monthly fee in a blog called solo practitioner vincent pedre exhorts fellow micropractice owners to "automate automate automate that is the name of the game make everything automatic including billing " going solo isnt always an easy sell some doctors arent keen to give up the financial security of belonging to a larger salaried practice many arent tech savvy or good at organizing things for themselves most who take the plunge initially find it hard to sign up patients and many make less money than they did before gary seto author of the blog solodoc quit his job at kaiser permanente three years ago and started a one man practice in south pasadena calif after losing money for two years he scaled back to part time and only makes a fraction of what he used to in a recent blog he writes "thats the tradeoff but its much more enjoyable to me and my patients " dr moore years old says he has persuaded about physicians to officially adopt his model he doesnt charge doctors to use his idea but a year ago he received a two year &# grant from the physicians foundation for health system excellence in boston to promote the approach a local business group in st louis has been pushing his model to doctors there as his evangelizing takes up more time he has cut his own practice down to part time dr moore never intended to go solo in the early s he started at a physicians group practice owned by highland hospital in rochester two years later he says the hospital asked the doctors to increase revenue by scheduling patients a day up from an already high "we were given monthly sheets showing how much money we were losing individually and collectively " recalls dr moore noting that other hospitals adopt similar measures "it felt extremely uncomfortable " the practice wasnt a big financial success because it was inefficient he says for example if a patient called and asked for an appointment three separate staff members receptionist nurse and then doctor would often have to be consulted on the urgency of the complaint before a date and time could be set he figured out that medical files were stored in different places the highland owned practice like many others also paid or more of its gross revenue to an outside firm to process medical bills and still wrote off a large number of claims that insurance companies rejected doctors at the highland practice agreed to see more patients but things got worse the phones rang constantly though dr moore worked hour days he says his patients began to complain about being hurried through appointments he sometimes dispatched patients with minor ailments to the hospitals emergency room one day dr moore intended to give a fluoride supplement to a toddler but instead prescribed a blood pressure drug called florinef a pharmacist caught the error but the incident rattled dr moore who took responsibility for the mistake but felt the constant rush of patients was taking a toll the doctors compensation plan changed from a guaranteed salary to a share of the practices revenue making it less secure "it seems that all of the conversations in our office were about money " dr moore later wrote in a medical magazine family practice management "a good doctor it seemed was one with high visit volume " the network to which highland belongs strong health acknowledges inefficiencies dr moore pointed out and says computerizing records has helped address them "is micropractice a way to further simplify we agree its a concept worth testing " raymond mayewski director of the center for primary care at strong health said through a spokeswoman in the summer of dr moore attended a talk on how technology could be used to improve medical "work flow " and another by a massachusetts institute of technology professor who talked about how a local bike shop got lean by cutting its area by and still thrived the professor suggested similar stripping of overhead would work in other fields in early after considerable anxiety about the decision dr moore opened a solo practice in an airless square foot room in a small office building by keeping a tight lid on overhead costs he hoped to see fewer patients no more than about a dozen a day and provide them better care and still earn a decent wage for a doctor on his first day the office phone rang in the middle of a patient appointment he says he didnt know whether to answer or let it ring in his lunch hour he ran out and bought an answering machine the early days were tough to keep things simple he even considered being a cash only business neither of those addressed his biggest worry business was slow even though the overloaded practice at highland was happy to send his former patients over "there were days in that first year when the phone wouldnt ring " he recalls "i would wonder what have i done " dr moore says his overall income after overhead costs was about &# that first year half of it from his quality of health projects that compares with about &# he made in the group practice his most expensive purchases for medical equipment were a new exam table for &# and an electronic thermometer for &# he paid &# to buy used furniture while many doctors spend hundreds of dollars on wall mounted eye and ear examining equipment dr moore says he pulled out hand held versions that he used in medical school his total outlay in that area was &# for a rechargeable battery "i advise other doctors to buy the minimum of what they need " he says initially he didnt want to handle his own billing and insurance paperwork because it would reduce time with patients but he decided to pay &# a month for five years to use software that combines electronic health records patient scheduling and electronic billing he also bought off the shelf "disease management" software called docsite to track how well his patients are doing on key measures such as cholesterol blood pressure and blood sugar levels for example the software easily generates a list of patients who failed to follow through on a blood pressure checkup alerting dr moore to call or email those patients to come in once or twice a year dr moore asks his patients to complete a free web survey called "hows your health " developed by john wasson of dartmouth medical school the minute survey is a series of carefully formulated multiple choice questions about the patients symptoms medications diet past tests emotional issues and habits such as smoking and drinking the survey evaluates the answers and converts them into a one page snapshot of the patients health it also suggests links to relevant health web sites and can tell the patient how to track blood pressure cholesterol or weight the snapshot gives dr moore a head start before the patient steps into his office the surveys wording leads many patients to indicate signs of trouble that they often wouldnt during a face to face visit dr moore says giving him more clues to take action when one heart patient wrote that he had begun drinking heavily for instance dr moore referred him to a local alcohol dependency center about a year ago susan arazy filled out the survey and scheduled an appointment for a sore throat dr moore knew that diabetes ran in her family and her latest health snapshot indicated that she wasnt following a healthy diet or exercising enough it led to a discussion of her lifestyle and habits recalls ms arazy and prompted her to join weight watchers and lose pounds ms arazy has multiple sclerosis on a recent january morning she emailed dr moore to schedule an appointment and got it for the same afternoon she wanted dr moores opinion on whether early intervention with a drug called avonex would slow her disease some research dug up on the internet by ms arazy herself suggested it could sitting across from ms arazy dr moore quickly confirmed her findings by logging into several web sites from his laptop including one run by the national institutes of health that gave his patient confirmation that her question was worth asking a specialist dr moore then tapped out an electronic fax on his laptop and sent it to a neuro opthalmologist to arrange an appointment for ms arazy in dr moores office there are no paper records letters from insurance companies and other documents are scanned into the electronic record then shredded all prescriptions are dispatched electronically to the pharmacy in dr moore expanded by renting a former storeroom next door that he now uses mainly to examine patients he also hired a nurse to help him with his practice and grant work but many micropractice doctors manage their own records several years ago linda lee quit a group practice and started a micropractice in a one room office next to dr moore while shes happier now dr lee says she makes about less she also misses the paid vacation and free trips from her previous job at a group practice which attracted more vendor sponsored junkets and paid expenses for doctors to attend conferences when one of her daughters became ill she fell far behind in her practices paperwork "i was worried whether i could keep it together " says dr lee eventually a patient who knew of her backlog was so concerned she sent her own daughter to help the doctor out dr moore estimates that his overhead costs make up of his revenue that compares with a figure of about for other small primary care group practices according to medical group management association an englewood colo based professional association for doctors practices a few weeks ago dr moore asked patients to rate the medical care they receive by using the online survey "hows your health " about or three quarters of his patients responded about said they had received the care they wanted and at the time they wanted it the national satisfaction rate based on the same survey is about
