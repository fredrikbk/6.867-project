senator lott floods the zone one big question when democrats took over congress was which industry would be first to feel the new majoritys populist rage oil pharma banks corporate america just got its answer direct from the angriest man to have been empowered in the past election republican sen trent lott the mississippian was "infuriated" by the insurance industrys refusal to shell out for certain katrina claims most notably his own so mr lott is spearheading a ferocious campaign of political revenge that would make even henry waxman envious replete with investigations voracious trial lawyers ambitious state attorneys general and threats of punitive federal legislation and like most personal grievances that get morphed into policy battles its ending badly for consumers mr lotts beachfront property in pascagoula one of three homes he owned was swept away entirely by hurricane katrinas waters like many gulf coast residents mr lott was soon reminded by his insurer state farm that his policy only covered wind damage not flood damage the senator surely knew that which is why hed also purchased federal flood insurance according to his flood policy that was in effect when katrina hit he was covered up to &# in flood damages and he presumably collected in full sen lotts office didnt return my call state farm however refused to cough up inspiring mr lott to embark on a campaign ripped straight out of the democratic playbook first was to pay a call to the favorite mob squad of the left the plaintiffs bar quicker than you can say "tort reform " dickie scruggs the legal kingpin who engineered mississippis tobacco shakedown was representing mr lott in a high profile lawsuit against state farm mr lott probably didnt have to do much special pleading since mr scruggs is his brother in law and had also suffered katrina damage mr scruggs is also a pal of mississippi attorney general jim hood who within a few weeks of katrina had filed a lawsuit against insurers over their "unconscionable" decision to not pay for damage they didnt cover by december of the lott scruggs hood triangle was proving a gale force storm for insurers for his part mr lott has been busy cranking up the pressure in washington not that he didnt give fair warning in july of last year he placed a call to chuck chamness the ceo of the national association of mutual insurance companies to let the industry know what was coming mr chamness later sent a letter to mr lott summing up the call the key passage "your comment that you will dedicate your next term of office to bringing down state farm and the industry through all means available to you including legislation designed to harm the property casualty insurance industry was very unsettling to say the least " mr lott has proven as good as his word since katrina hes slipped legislation into a homeland security bill requiring the inspector general of that agency to investigate insurers hes put forward a bill requiring insurers to "state clearly" on their policies"front page" what they dont cover hes dropped another bill that would compel insurers to release more information about vehicles damaged by katrina word is hes even been looking into the industrys tax rates but his big bomb came last week when he introduced legislation that would end the insurance industrys exemption from certain federal antitrust regulations mr lott suggests this is to keep big insurance players from conspiring to do evil things though the reality is that the exemption mainly benefits small insurers who use it to pool statistically reliable data so in his wrath mr lott may end up kneecapping many of the hundreds of small insurers who offer some real competition to the so called conspiring giants democrats have been only too happy to assist in this fight given their own ambitions of turning the katrina mess to their political advantage mr lotts been getting his biggest help from fellow mississippian and democrat gene taylor who also has a beef with state farm and was part of the scruggs lawsuit in january mr taylor asked financial services committee chief barney frank for an investigation into insurers katrina practices mr frank was only too happy to take the first step and next week mr taylor will be the star witness in a subcommittee hearing about insurers decision not to pay claims next up subpoenas congressman taylor in a conversation with me yesterday said he thinks it is "extremely appropriate" that he is in this insurance fight because "what happened to my constituents my neighbors and my friends also happened to me " meanwhile attorney general hood has deftly used messrs lotts and taylors washington moves as a prod for his own agenda in a public statement in january he noted that if insurers didnt settle with him and continued "with their robber baron mentality i think that congressman taylor and congressman bennie thompson and senator lott will see to it that we have national insurance reform " hows that for a threat within a few weeks state farm had agreed to settle with the attorney general hood and to review claims as well as agreed to pay off all those in the scruggs lawsuit including messrs lott and taylor any bets on just how big a slice of his contingency fees mr scruggs will now donate to the democratic national committee for next years elections lost among all the politicians war whooping over the state farm capitulation is the effect this extortion has had on the private insurance industry in recent weeks companies from state farm to allstate have stopped writing policies in parts of mississippi which will result in consumers having fewer insurance choices if they can find insurance at all ah but never fear washington has a solution for that too in the face of insurers exiting his state in no small part because of the actions of politicians mr taylor earlier this month introduced yet another piece of insurance legislation this one would expand the national flood insurance program to cover other hurricane related damage in other words the mississippian wants to create a new federal disaster insurance program that will put taxpayers rather than private insurers on the hook next time a storm hits revenge is a scary thing write to kim wsj com
