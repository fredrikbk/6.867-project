politics &amp economics statehouse yields clues to obama sharp elbows of illinois politics taught lessons in art of compromise springfield ill as an illinois state senator barack obama was a leader in helping to tighten state ethics laws up to a point when a package seemed doomed in the senates final hours with his democratic leader among the foes he left the chamber to tell advocates there was nothing more he could do "he wasnt going to stand on the desk and pound his shoe " recalls cynthia canary director of the nonpartisan illinois campaign for political reform and an admirer "barack is a political realist you may know that in his heart he feels strongly but hell only go so far " yet a compromise was salvaged she adds and mr obama helped to toughen it in subsequent legislative sessions the accomplishment was emblematic of the picture that emerges of the eight years mr obama spent here of a lawmaker of lofty liberal rhetoric who nonetheless pragmatically accepted bipartisan compromises that won over foes and sometimes left supporters dissatisfied now that he is running as a presidential candidate after just two years in the u s senate most clues about what style of politics he would bring to the white house are here in illinoiss statehouse mr obama wrote in his recent best selling memoir that it was in springfield that he learned "how the game had come to be played" between democrats and republicans "i understood politics as a full contact sport and minded neither the sharp elbows nor the occasional blindside hit " the obama campaigns tangle this week with that of democratic rival hillary clinton shows a willingness to engage in intraparty spats as well yet he also wrote that through his state senate years he "clung to the notion that politics could be different " less combative more bipartisan he has put that notion at the heart of his presidential bid illinois republicans recall mr obama as a committed liberal of no singular achievements yet one they could work with to pass ethics welfare and death penalty revisions "hes unique in his ability to deal with extremely complex issues to reach across the aisle and to deal with diverse people " says republican state sen kirk dillard "if he surrounds himself with good people i wouldnt lose any sleep with him as my president " as for sharp elbows the scraps for which mr obama is remembered including near fisticuffs once on the senate floor were with fellow black democrats some of whom were resentful of his ambitions and his successes in mr obamas first term in he joined with mr dillard to pass illinoiss first ethics package in a quarter century and with republican state sen dave syverson then chairman of a health and human services committee to overhaul the states welfare law those earlier ethics overhauls grew out of a proposal from the late u s sen paul simon an illinois democrat for a four member task force one representative of each party in the illinois house and senate to forge a compromise mr dillard represented senate republicans senate democratic leader emil jones like mr obama an african american from chicago picked the young freshman on the advice of former federal judge abner mikva who had known mr obama as a constitutional law teacher at the university of chicago the panels recommendations didnt go so far as ethics revamp advocates wanted to ease passage for example its ban on lawmakers personal use of campaign funds exempted existing accounts still mr obama had a hard sell in senate democrats caucuses "he was getting so beat up by the members sometimes i felt sorry for him " recalls mr jones who became his mentor "he would just listen to them and then explain the reason why this particular issue was before us " when the legislature revisited the ethics issue in mr jones was among those who resisted changes mr obama promoted "he wouldnt buck emil jones " ms canary said the senate and house agreed to a weaker bill likewise mr syverson says the welfare overhaul compromise he cosponsored with mr obama riled both parties "he took heat from some liberal groups" for welfare limits mr syverson says "but i took heat from conservative groups " for the child care and health care aid to those who moved from welfare to work when democrats won a majority in for mr obamas final two years he succeeded mr syverson as the health panels chairman yet on his most ambitious initiative for universal health care coverage the best he could do was pass a measure providing for a study on the judiciary committee mr obama wanted to co sponsor democratic chairman john cullertons top initiative a highway safety measure allowing police to stop vehicles in which occupants werent wearing seat belts at the time nonuse couldnt be the primary reason for stopping drivers but mr jones objected the senate leader said a tougher seat belt law would give police another ruse for racial profiling the practice of stopping and searching minority drivers for little reason "barack said then lets do a racial profiling law " mr cullerton recalls mr obama and other democrats had previously proposed antiprofiling bills which would require police to keep data on the race of those they stopped police groups always were opposed but they wanted a seat belt law senators say mr obama negotiated changes to the racial profiling measure that allowed the police to remain neutral both bills were passed meanwhile the legislature in was revamping death penalty laws after evidence of numerous wrongful convictions mr obama wanted to mandate videotaping of interrogations of murder suspects to guard against coerced confessions prosecutors and many republicans were opposed particularly to the prospect that unrecorded confessions would be inadmissible in court they recall mr obamas spending hours in negotiations on compromises such as allowing for equipment failure and providing for judges discretion "some people say the exemptions are too broad " mr cullerton says "but thats what you have to do to pass laws " the credit that went to mr obama for the racial profiling and videotaping measures stoked tensions among black colleagues who had sponsored similar proposals only to see mr jones promote his proteges efforts one was state sen rickey "hollywood" hendon an outspoken democrat who once had to be separated from mr obama in the senate after confronting him for reasons that witnesses dont recall and mr hendon wont discuss mr hendon complained that he felt like the football player who had run yards only to see the halfback plunge the final yard for the touchdown and the credit earlier this month he was outside the old state capitol in the cold lending support as mr obama announced his presidential candidacy crossing the aisle for six of barack obamas eight years as an illinois state senator democrats were the minority while loyal to party leader sen emil jones obama worked with republicans such as sen kirk dillard and gets credit for helping to pass several major laws creating the states earned income tax credit for working poor expanding early childhood education programs mandating that police videotape interrogations of murder suspects requiring police to record the race of those in vehicles they stopped to stem suspected "racial profiling" ending the states welfare entitlement and providing childcare and health coverage to help those taking low wage jobs imposing ethics restrictions on the legislative and executive branches
