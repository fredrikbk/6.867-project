iran misses another deadline conspiracy theorists may soon have to add another name to dick cheneys secret cabal planning war with iran mohamed elbaradei at least thats what a wag might say after the director general of the international atomic energy agency iaea speculated this week in an interview with the financial times that iran might be as close as six months from developing an industrial scale uranium enrichment facility of centrifuges that kind of capability would put iran on track to produce sufficient fissile uranium for a nuclear bomb by the fall of mr elbaradei also noted that "even if the iranian nuclear program is for peaceful purposes there is no question that at the back of their minds this is a deterrent " lets underscore the words "even if " the director general has until now been remarkably cautious in his pronouncements on irans intentions but his comments this week are a remarkable if implicit admission that iran might have other uses for enriched uranium than turning on lights these comments also coincide with irans decision to flout yet another u n deadline to suspend enrichment according to the iaea report on iran released yesterday not only have the iranians continued to enrich they have also failed to offer further information on some of the outstanding questions in their nuclear file one such question concerns the source of some highly enriched read bomb grade uranium particles found in iran by iaea inspectors so what does the international community now intend to do belying his own forecasts as a u n technocrat mr elbaradei ventured a political opinion that any military strikes against iran would be "catastrophic counterproductive " so much for him being a neocon shill secretary of state condoleezza rice after meeting with her russian german and eu counterparts in berlin could only say that she "confirmed that we will use our available channels and the security council to try and achieve that goal " ms rice shouldnt hold her breath the security council could barely agree in december to sanction a handful of companies and individuals directly implicated in irans nuclear and ballistic missile programs and as these columns reported tuesday the level of european commercial investment in iran has grown briskly since its secret nuclear programs were exposed in with an estimated jobs in germany alone dependent on exports to iran moral courage on that front may be expecting too much ultimately whatever hope there might be of resolving the iranian issue through diplomacy is going to require compromises by the iranians themselves heres what iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had to say about that "if we shut down other activities for years and the country only focuses on nuclear energy it will be worth it because if we obtain this energy our people will advance as much as years " maybe its time the rest of us start taking mr ahmadinejad at his word and tailoring our expectations accordingly
