weekend journal review film the astronaut farmer is quite a spacey oddity jim carrey + zero amazing grace brings an abolitionist to life giggling and grimacing my way through "the astronaut farmer " i wondered how i would ever be able to convey the special idiocy that fuels this saga of a rancher named farmer go figure who fulfills his dream of orbiting the earth by building his own rocket then i remembered an old bob and ray radio skit in which the roving reporter wally ballou interviews a man who plans to build his own tunnel beneath the hudson river the man explains that he is doing this because hes tired of paying tolls to go in and out of manhattan but isnt building a tunnel like that hard wally asks "not really " his subject replies "what you do is get a shovel dig down for a while and then dig straight out " the movies hero played by billy bob thornton is the space cadet soul mate of that amateur sandhog the difference between the movie and the radio skit is that the movie takes its subject seriously really seriously and ever so earnestly its all about uplift charles farmer isnt supposed to be a space cadet in the hoary tradition of frank capra never has a capra knockoff mustered more cliches farmer is supposed to be a little guy with a big dream and a bigger heart a guy who puts himself and his loving family through some difficult times but still a fearless guy with a can do spirit who becomes a national hero because he wont let anyone stand in the way of his dream not even if it means taking on those heartless bigwigs in washington its clear from the very first shot an astronaut on horseback beneath a vast western sky that the movie will be for better or worse something special maybe the rider is crazy a cowboy with a buzz lightyear fixation who goes around half suffocating himself in a space suit and helmet but a shiny silver rocket stands on its tailfins in his barn then maybe hes a crackpot tinkerer who actually believes that his home made spaceship can break the surly bonds of earth or maybe its a parody of the cockeyed optimism dispensed by the rocket boy drama "october sky " or of the hapless wernher von braun biopic "i aim at the stars" for which mort sahl suggested the alternate title "i aim at the stars but often hit london" but no this is billy bob thornton a specialist at playing no nonsense guys who are eccentric but perfectly sane and the filmmakers the director michael polish and his writing partner and twin brother mark polish want us to understand that charles farmer has the right stuff an aerospace engineer and former air force pilot farmer was on his way to becoming an astronaut until tragedy struck in the sort of overworked back story thats supposed to confer plausibility whats more one of farmers astronaut buddies played by an uncredited bruce willis comes to check out the project takes one look at the rocket and says evidently on the strength of its sheen "you built this thing that is some serious engineering " this movie is some muddled imagineering its a glib fantasy that soars beyond the misinformation belt into the vacuous realm of misinspiration no one asks pointed questions about anything but money of which farmer seems to have woefully little his clueless wife audie played by virginia madsen and his bright faced kids have bought so fully into his insanity which is meant to be seen as wisdom that his year old son takes on the job of flight controller when things go wrong before they go inspirationally right audie starts to lose faith but she finally sees the light and declares in one of the dumbhead classic lines of all time "without the rocket were just a dysfunctional family " and with the rocket they are what just props for a preposterous premise useful props an appealing intimacy suffuses several scenes with the family at the kitchen table the oddest thing about this very odd movie is that it doesnt seem to know what to make of itself here it is positing faith perseverance and family values as the basic ingredients of farmers climactic blast off yet bogus uplift gives way to genuine downdraft in a coda that finds the hero chatting casually with jay leno suddenly the astronaut farmer is just sly old billy bob doing yet another guest shot on yet another broadcast of the tonight show thats a new definition of weightlessness amazing grace "amazing grace" is a case of good works done well this admirable historical drama directed by michael apted from a script by steven knight tells the personal and also rousingly political story of how the pioneering abolitionist william wilberforce struggled to end the slave trade in the british commonwealth in the late th and early th centuries the slaves provided cheap labor for jamaicas sugar plantations wilberforce as played by the excellent welsh actor ioan gruffudd has his own struggle he is torn between his passion for politics and his love of god to resolve the conflict he does gods work in a house of commons that views the enslavement of black africans as an economic necessity and that resists his best efforts for decades the film takes its title from the hymn that was written by wilberforces friend and mentor john newton a slave trader turned monk to atone for his sins newton is played by albert finney who is far from the only formidable actor in a cast that includes michael gambon ciaran hinds rufus sewell benedict cumberbatch toby jones bill paterson and romola garai the senegalese singer youssou ndour makes his acting debut as oloudaqh equiano an african slave who bought his freedom settled in london and wrote a best seller about his life the number in "the number " jim carrey plays a dog catcher walter sparrow whos beset by obsessive thinking everything in his addled brain adds up to virginia madsen is once again the heros clueless wife the movie adds up to nothing at all despite joel schumachers efforts as director matthew libatiques stylish cinematography and layer upon layer of droning complexity mesmerized by a mysterious novel with the same title as the film walter finds frightening parallels between his life and that of the books murderous detective fingerling a role that mr carrey also plays theres little in this first script by fernley phillips but bloodless notions nothing that might qualify by the light of day as entertainment yet the film has its own grim fascination as an example of another kind of obsessive thinking the process through which a studio apparatus is brought to bear on developing an idea that defies development starter for ten if james mcavoys dynamic performance as the young doctor in "the last king of scotland" was overshadowed by forest whitakers portrait of idi amin as how could it not have been mr mcavoy gets his chance to shine as the star of "starter for ten " a surprisingly agile and delightfully warm romantic comedy set in the s with a not so hot for export title its a catch phrase from a real life british quiz show called "university challenge " hes brian jackson an earnest working class nerd whose desire "to know everything" stands him in good stead as a member of bristol universitys academic team on tv as bright as he is though he cant figure out how to choose between alice eves drop dead gorgeous and very funny alice whose flashdance sweater hangs so low off one shoulder that it threatens to capsize her and rebecca halls funny and utterly enchanting rebecca a campus activist with a gift for self irony rest assured that brian finally gets it right and that "starter for ten" gets things right too tom vaughan directed in an auspicious feature debut from david nichollss smart lively script dvd tip "rory oshea was here" a flawed but enjoyable comic drama
