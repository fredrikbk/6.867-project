double agenda time waster annoying web games help coder hone his craft at players expense online edition theres nothing particularly new about irritating games children of the s had the electronic memory game "simon" children of the s had those wooden cups with balls attached by strings both games can leave players muttering over why they cant succeed and why they keep trying the internet has allowed annoying games to multiply and live just a click away the online game "double jeu" french for "double game" is an example from the "frustrating yet addictive" genre in the flash based "double game " players are tasked with keeping two balls aloft for as long as possible by using two paddles one that floats horizontally across the middle of the screen and one that acts as a see saw at the bottom players control the paddles by moving their mouse side to side if either ball falls off the screen the contest is over the catch the mouse operates both paddles operate simultaneously a typical first effort has players lasting less than seconds the payoff for taking on "double game" is dubious failing to keep the balls in the air results in a string of demeaning insults which skirt american stereotypes about the rude french "congratulations " mocks an english language translation of the game "you are almost as smart as poodle " keeping the balls aloft for seconds more difficult than it seems earns nothing but disjointed sarcasm "its exactly the same time as paris hilton bravo " the abuse is the punch line for game creator kevin nave a year old parisian who sets up players by framing "double game" as an intelligence test surviving beyond seconds is an accomplishment mr nave in an email interview admitted that hes never lasted longer than seconds in comments posted on gaming blogs which helped make "double game" a viral hit last fall some players claim to have lasted more than a minute mr nave has crafted about two dozen similarly and purposefully bothersome games and parked them at "irritating games how to waste a lot of time at work " the web site available in english as a subpage off his mostly french personal web site the antique resource web site victoriana com claims that the wooden cup and ball game originated in france where it was known as bilbocquet making mr nave in some sense a successor of that toys unknown maker but unlike that early french time waster and so many games that just happen to be frustrating "double game" was deliberately designed to irritate players "all of these games were made for me to practice programming " he explained each game was an avenue to learn some bit of code he had never worked with before mr nave says before finishing each programming exercise mr nave asks himself "what can i do now to make this an irritating game " later the underlying skills he teaches himself can be used in his commercial work as a free lance game developer and web site designer but for the purposes of his annoying collection he says "i just want to torture the player " "double game" helped him learn to program the more realistic and sophisticated physics of the bottom ball which rolls around the see saw paddle "but it wasnt efficient for making a game " he says "so i just added a second paddle at the top" to make the game more difficult his most recent irritating creation "double pong " is inspired by the classic atari era tennis game to make it frustrating mr nave gives the player control of two "pong" games simultaneously while all of mr naves creations are annoying few capture the addictive upside of "double game " in "blur maze " players grow progressively myopic while navigating a labyrinth drawn in a soft focus style the games entire purpose is seemingly to make the player squint and it works "puking snake" modifies an old school game eating coins to lengthen a snake to induce nausea mr nave decided to try his hand at making a clone of the game after playing a straightforward version of it on his cellphone "i found that making this game rotate would be fun " he says several of his games undermine a players basic instincts in using a mouse mr naves first game in the series "catch the butterfly " published in reverses the direction of the mouse controls "follow the square" tests a players mouse control concentration the most interesting in this line of fool your mouse games "invisible mouse " is a reminder of our total dependence on visual cues in order to navigate our pcs mr nave doesnt question the popularity of "double game " which for no clear reason became a viral hit last october at first as droves of bloggers linked to his game he saw traffic on his personal web site explode on his best days more than visitors played the game he claims "i dont know why it was so popular " he admits "i received emails from russia japan u s a and brazil " he created the game using adobe flash mr naves specialty he published a french language book about flash last year cribbing the source code from flash programs isnt difficult however and mr nave says soon found replica "double game" games posted on other web sites "but if they steal my game it means they like it thats what i say to myself " he explains write to aaron rutkoff at aaron rutkoff wsj com
