weekend journal travel cracking down on chair hogs hotels monitor guests to foil pool no shows siberia at the breakers vacation no walking the dog emptying the dishwasher or scrambling to get to a meeting on time and now at many resorts this year no reason to wake up at a m to grab a good chair by the pool with the spring break crush coming hotels in resort areas are arming themselves with new policies to combat "chair hogs " the scourge of vacationers who stake claim to prime spots early in the morning and then dont show up again until after noon reversing longstanding procedures to leave guests belongings untouched many hotels now enforce time limits on unoccupied chairs by removing and storing personal items as of last christmas guests at parrot cay in the turks and caicos islands who leave their tiki huts for more than an hour during holidays will lose them sanctuary in paradise valley ariz began a waiting list system last month if you disappear for more than an hour the chair is given to someone else and you go to the back of the queue and a new sign at the peninsula in bangkok instructs guests that items will be removed if left unattended for minutes as occupancy rates at luxury hotels have grown over the last five years prices have risen by according to smith travel research that comes despite an increase in the number of rooms over the same period higher prices can make for higher expectations "people think because they have the money they should get whatever they want " says sharon zambrelli a new york beauty industry consultant who had a run in with another guest at the breakers in palm beach fla last month when he refused to get off chairs her husband had saved minutes earlier when the other guest wouldnt discuss it she got a pool attendant she knew who helped her get the chairs back cracking down on guests goes against just about everything the &# billion a year u s hotel industry stands for that the customer is always right and that hotels should cater to guest whims however ridiculous in fact much of the &# billion spent last year on capital expenditures went toward guest pampering amenities such as better spas and more elaborate pools but the battle over chairs mostly at the pool sometimes at the beach has become so extreme that hotels say they have no other choice the westin maui has started sending attendants to tag chairs left unoccupied once tagged the attendant waits half an hour and if the guests have not returned the belongings are bagged and kept at the towel desk for pickup the hotel says it asks a second attendant to serve as a witness in case the guest says something is missing until last april the royal hawaiian in waikiki allowed people to sign up for a chair at p m at the pool desk for the next morning typically a line of people would start as early as p m disturbing the other guests at the pool now guests claim seats the same day if a chair is left vacant for minutes its given away "we have pool chairs at the hotel but everyone wants the same " says matthew hart general manager of the grand wailea resort in maui "it got to be refereeing adults " the hotel put in a policy last year that chairs left unattended for over an hour could be reclaimed by the hotel it also started selling cabanas for &# to &# a day up to a year ahead of time mr hart estimates are now presold for holidays sarah smith an advertising executive from san francisco has noticed the difference at shutters on the beach in santa monica calif shes stayed there for years but for the first time last summer she was greeted by a pool attendant who told her that if she left for more than two hours her chair would be given away ms smith appreciates the rule "youre not worried that you have to get out early to save a spot " she says the room shutters only has space for chairs on the pool deck the policy was added after people complained there was nowhere to sit says laura mciver the resident manager because food and drinks are served at the pool unattended seats also meant a missed revenue opportunity since the policy went into effect there have been fewer arguments she says michael fishbin national director of ernst &amp youngs hospitality group says the hotels are partly responsible in a push to attract the growing family travel market over the past decade hotels have added childrens clubs and aggressively marketed their pools increasing poolside expectations at the same time hotels have spent millions on enormous spas that draw in day guests who often expect pool access along with their &# massages some resorts act like country clubs allowing locals to use the facilities for an annual fee now web sites like tripadvisor com have become flooded with chair complaints "as for the pools they were very nice but we never managed to get chairs at any of them so spent all our mornings at the beach people must get up in the middle of the night to put their towels on chairs to reserve " says one review for a hotel in cancun even when rules exist they can be violated at the four seasons maui when cabanas are vacant for more than minutes excluding lunch hours the staff may reassign them but meredith kaplan a recent guest and stay at home mom from los angeles noticed that people who return year after year make friends with other repeat guests and look out for each others chairs "they stake their claims " she says at the same hotel this past christmas lydia dunnaville wanted to move to a sunny cabana so she asked an attendant to take away towels from chairs that had been unoccupied for hours the attendant refused saying the minute policy wasnt always enforced ms dunnaville called over the pool manager who gave her the chairs and a complimentary lunch the next morning the stay at home mom from portland ore who doesnt like to leave her room before a m got down to the pool at a m and saw guests giving attendants large tips which she assumed were to reserve spots tipping heartily works for great neck n y dentist david schwartz he estimates he spent &# taking care of the attendants at el conquistador resort in puerto rico last christmas and every day when he and his family came down late in the morning they had a group of chairs reserved for them with ice water fruit and newspaper faxes the chairs were theirs all day "we treat them well and they take care of us " he says adding that when youre paying more than &# for a week giving the attendants a little extra is worth it el conquistador pool manager manny melendez says the resort doesnt promote tipping and has a policy of removing items after half an hour if another guest wants the chair and thomas steinhauer general manager of the four seasons maui says a pool attendant can accept tips for setting up chairs but not for reserving them the resort occasionally brings in "spotters" to make sure staff members are following the rules and is breaking ground in september on an adults only pool in hopes of creating more desirable areas last year breakers created new pool and beach areas and added chairs to reduce density but guests still quibble and last december one came down early in the morning in his boxers to claim his spot apparently he didnt want to waste any time changing says nick velardo director of the hotels ocean club operations longtime breakers guest jerry della femina explains why "the new areas are like siberia " says the new york advertising mogul adding that pool attendants have a lot of power during holidays "it doesnt matter if youre a hedge fund manager you have to get up early and be nice to get a good seat " beaches arent immune either the discovery point club on grand cayman in the cayman islands has plenty of chairs but guests get up at dawn to vie for one of the eight shaded beach huts and umbrellas five of those umbrellas were added last week and the resort which has two bedroom units says two more are on the way two months ago the pink shell beach resort and spa in fort myers beach fla started a new "rule of thumb" that items left for more than two hours will be removed if it is clear the guests arent coming back soon and the la jolla beach and tennis club in la jolla calif will redistribute vacant chairs after an hour still most resorts say space is not as big an issue on the beach since you can sit on the sand hotel management textbooks recommend chairs per guest room based on anticipated occupancy rates over holidays occupancy rates per room tend to be higher because more families travel "you cant build a church for easter sunday " says robert mandelbaum an industry adviser with pkf hospitality research hotels say they often dont want to add chairs because it would spoil the aesthetics the seats most in demand are in the front row closest to the pool have a cabana when others dont or have a good view of the ocean at halekulani hotel there are chairs for rooms but only half the chairs have long seats and those are the ones people want the encounters over chairs can be traumatic last january jackie bzostek the director of education and training for planned parenthood in fort worth texas found a cabana by the pool just before noon at the paradisus punta cana in the dominican republic just after she and her two adult daughters settled in an irate woman accused ms bzostek of stealing her space her husband had placed some towels on the chairs before a m she screamed ms bzostek said there had been no towels when she sat down the other woman accused her of lying and of denying her children a place to sit "i think about it every time i see a cabana now " says ms bzostek who stayed put but left soon afterwards the trick may be bringing someone who doesnt mind getting up early and spending the day on the chairs after a bad experience in cabo san lucas mexico a woman who was saving chairs threw a fit when he tried to take one for his pregnant wife brandon fuller decided to use his "secret weapon" his father herb every morning at the velas vallarta in puerto vallarta mexico herb fuller would get down to the pool by a m and be there with six chairs when the rest of the family arrived two hours later "i told him it was for the grandkids " says the software engineer from longmont colo another option is to spring for the pricey rooms at halekulani hotel on the waikiki beachfront in honolulu guests staying in suites that go for &# to almost &# a night have chairs placed and spaces created for them the minute they arrive at the pool with extra chairs kept in the back executive manager gerald glennon says that doesnt mean they are more important than other guests but he says "you cant keep everyone happy " some travelers just choose carefully "i dont want to stay anywhere there arent rules anymore " says kathy eurich an executive assistant from milwaukee whose family of four ended up with only one chair every afternoon at disneys animal kingdom lodge in orlando fla last spring "its just
