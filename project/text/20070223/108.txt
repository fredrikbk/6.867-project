than wall street professionals who took home at least &# million in cash from their bonuses respondents are spending of their payouts on average on watches and jewelry for even the lowest paid bankers in the survey thats a bling budget of more than &# while the poll by wealth research firm prince &amp associates of redding conn is only a sampling of the street it adds to growing signs of an entirely new level of consumption there last year wall street bonuses jumped an average of to meaning that the senior bankers with the title of managing director received average pay of between &# million to &# million according to the options group a new york consulting firm overall according to an estimate released by new york state wall street will pay a record &# billion this year in bonuses bankers spending what they call their "burn rate" is growing as fast as their bonuses while the national real estate market is suffering multimillion dollar homes continue to trade briskly in

drunk with delight as financial types fork over &# for a case of mouton rothschild for the survey which will be released today prince &amp associates worked through six large investment banks to set up interviews with top earners about of the respondents were women participants reported how much they had spent and how much theyd budgeted for purchases the researchers added unearmarked funds to the savings and investing category the street crowd is spending the biggest share of its bonuses on homes especially second or third ones some of last years bonuses went toward purchasing residences with another going toward home improvements respondents say theyre spending about of their money on fine art and collectibles while went toward "other" a category that includes hobbies such as horses and flying lessons as well as "mistresses and other lovers " the average amount diverted to savings and investments meanwhile is "what surprised me is the low savings and investing rates for people who are making millions of dollars a year " says russ alan prince president of prince &amp associates "this says to me that wall street expects the good times to continue " nearly three quarters of the wall streeters surveyed said they expect business in to be "excellent " most expect bigger bonuses for this year since so many of todays top deal makers and proprietary traders are in their s or early s they figure they have plenty of time to save and invest and so they say theyd much rather spend in interviews with several bankers all of whom refused to comment on the record about their bonus allocation most said the survey findings are broadly in line with their own spending "i work hour days six days a week im sitting on planes for hours straight and im dealing with high pressure decisions " said a top banker from morgan stanley "i deserve rewards " on the record these bankers say they lead relatively modest lives and give generously to charity jonathan knee a top deal maker at evercore partners inc a new york investment advisory firm believes the wall streeters he knows arent buying watches and art to the extent that the survey suggests "many bankers cringe when they see their brethren engaging in stereotypical conspicuous consumption " says mr knee author of "the accidental investment banker " "and i honestly believe this kind of spending is the exception rather than the rule " others caution that todays free spending wall streeters could be headed for a fall "some of this generation of bankers are in la la land " says peter solomon chairman of investment banking firm peter j solomon co of new york "this is a cyclical business were in a period of easy credit and people throwing money around and no one in investment banking should assume that next year will be better than last year " the bankers spent an average of of their bonuses on personal services such as nannies maids tutors cosmetic surgery and spas according to the prince survey despite media reports of bankers rushing to ferrari dealerships the survey showed they spent a relatively small of their bonuses on luxury cars thats still &# each based on the average payout wall streeters spent less than of their bonuses on personal or family travel some bankers say they simply dont have time to take long vacations others say that when they have time off theyd prefer to spend it at their second homes instead of getting on another plane the richest bankers are the most lavish spenders deploying a larger proportion of their take toward homes cars and luxury goods roughly half of the surveys respondents took home bonuses of more than &# million last year this group spent on watches and jewelry and socked away about by comparison the other half of respondents those who received &# million to &# million spent only about on baubles and put into savings and despite the notion that the really rich give more to charity the rule didnt seem to apply to the bankers in this survey respondents gave about to charity those receiving bonuses of &# million or more gave the same proportion as their poorer peers says mr prince "this is not an especially generous group "
