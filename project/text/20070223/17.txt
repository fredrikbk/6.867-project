drop in securities class actions doesnt mean fraudsters have retreated in response to the feb editorial page commentary "the class action market" by stanford law school prof joseph grundfest todays short term drop in securities class action filings does not support a crystal ball forecast that companies will be less likely to commit fraud that the sec will be more vigorous about its duties or that there will be no need for future private securities class action lawsuits prof grundfests forecast is based on a few faulty premises first it is not easy for new firms to break into plaintiffs securities litigation many times they must first get on the short list of a state pension fund for possible litigation they may not have time to wait or resources to provide portfolio monitoring services as offered by large firms such as bernstein litowitz the private securities litigation reform act favors firms that have established contacts with large pension funds firms such as milberg weiss and lerach coughlin those two firms are crippled by federal criminal investigations and that is the obvious reason why filings have dropped nearly half of milbergs lawyers have already fled the firm second it is easy to say that corruption has declined when one compares today with the recent past of enron worldcom and other debacles taking a long term view there is no reason to believe fraud will decline the bankruptcy of a large accounting firm arthur andersen and the temporary uptick in sec enforcement may have had a short term effect but we cannot expect long term sec criminal enforcement against individual officers and directors and why should taxpayers bear the expense of fighting securities fraud when plaintiff lawyers do it for free rob gaudet seattle prof grundfest offers a compelling argument why the private bar is no match for government enforcement of securities laws in addition to the fact that the government doesnt reduce recoveries by a one third contingent fee there is also no need to conduct expensive and lengthy investigations and those who actually caused the fraud arent allowed to escape blame by having the corporation pay damages i am often surprised that more scholars dont see the parallels between these policy arguments against securities class actions and false claims act complaints the favorable results achieved in securities class action litigation could also be expected to occur with government enforcement of fca litigation currently private attorneys are permitted to pursue fraud claims against government contractors even when the government declines to intervene these so called qui tam complaints simply do not require the use of private counsel based on the exact same policy arguments just as prof grundfest says about securities litigation as long as the pertinent government agency takes vigorous enforcement action against alleged false claims which still could and should be reported by whistleblowers allowing plaintiffs lawyers to conduct the litigation rather than the department of justice makes the process an "expensive wasteful and unnecessary sideshow that generates little deterrence and offers questionable levels of compensation " thus where the government declines to intervene in fca complaints the question there should also be whether they should exist at all william y culbertson associate professor northern kentucky university highland heights ky
