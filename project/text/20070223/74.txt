fashion shows the new italian design team added a much needed shot of pizazz this year the brands first official runway presentation tuesday evening was the most eagerly awaited show of milans fashion week the front row seats in an old convent hall with peeling frescoes were packed with international press and buyers including those from big american department stores neiman marcus and bloomingdales the show of fitted coats corset dresses and fur skirts enchanted the audience stephanie solomon womens fashion director at bloomingdales decided to place her first order "they have the uniqueness workmanship and authenticity theyre not just imitating " said ms solomon admiring a hand stitched gabardine double breasted suit later in the brands showroom "you can see they have real soul " "theyre one of the strongest new talents in italy " agreed neiman marcus fashion director ken downing who praised the designers"outstanding" use of shearling retailers reporters and fashion enthusiasts have pinned much hope on the budding brand created by roberto rimondi and tommaso aquilano the label was the winner of the vogue italia sponsored "who is on next" emerging talent competition in but the impressive turnout for the show is also a comment on whats lacking in the italian fashion scene international retailers attending the milan shows are thirsting for new creative blood because milan one of the most important fashion cities in the world has gradually been losing its power to set the trends its been a decade since milans heyday in the s gianni versace sent daringly cut dresses down the runway giorgio armani dazzled with sophisticated tailoring and dolce &amp gabbana emerged to seduce buyers with sultry sicilian style more recently guccis designer tom ford who left in captured attention with his porno chic looks of eight newcomers on the official milan fashion week calendar this year only has attracted international interest the buyers and press continue flocking to established labels mostly the same names from the s meanwhile a new generation of designers has emerged in paris in recent years nicolas ghesquiere at balenciaga and alber elbaz

strongly freshness and innovation at fashion shows are crucial for creating buzz even if the bulk of buyers budgets are already spent on a pre collection long before the catwalk shows kick off what makes them and the fashion press interested in a label in the first place is the creativity at a show in an industry that feeds on constant innovation setting the trends is key to justifying high prices especially when fast fashion brands such as zara and h&amp m can replicate trends so easily in the competition among the top brands getting the advantage in setting the tone can put a brand on the fashion map and if the allure of milan suffers luxury brands here could have a harder time defending their status and prices not everyone sees a problem "theres a big difference between france and italy in their philosophy of clothing " says mario boselli the head of italys camera nazionale della moda italiana the trade federation that organizes milan fashion week "france is more about luxury while italy is more linked to its manufacturing sector paris fashion week presents things that are very stimulating but the italian look is more wearable " but some in the italian fashion industry are

crucial backer franca sozzani the editor of vogue italia who began to spread the word about them to buyers and press around the world last february messrs rimondi and aquilano decided to mount their first fashion show but off the official calendar so they could do things their way they thought strategically pradas show usually held on tuesday evening at prada group spas headquarters during milan
