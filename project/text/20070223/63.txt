politics &amp economics italys leaders launch talks new government seen resembling old one elections are unlikely rome the new government italy is trying to form after the sudden resignation of prime minister romano prodi is expected to look much like the last one and it may have even less maneuvering room to push forward on crucial economic and social policies the countrys president giorgio napolitano began two days of high level talks with party leaders yesterday the most likely scenario is that the same wobbly nine party coalition that disintegrated wednesday will try to pull together a new administration according to a person familiar with the talks with the last elections held less than a year ago it appeared unlikely that mr napolitano would heed a call for snap elections from center right opposition leader silvio berlusconi who was narrowly voted out of office last year mr prodi tendered his resignation to italys president after his government failed to garner enough votes to approve a foreign policy motion in the upper house of parliament mr prodis coalition held a single vote majority in the senate a new center left government could be headed again by mr prodi or by another politician from his coalition "prodi is willing to stay if and only if he gets guarantees of full support from all coalition parties " the premiers spokesman silvio sircana said either way an administration based on the same coalition would still command just a razor thin majority in parliament and therefore be exposed to the same differing views on economic and foreign policy as the government that fell it remains unclear for example how mr prodi would overcome the objections of two communist parties in his coalition to italys continued military presence in afghanistan brian coulton a sovereign ratings analyst for fitch ratings in london said it will also be difficult for any government to restart mr prodis economic agenda "the structural reform agenda is going to grind to a halt " he said "that will be the most important casualty " italy does have a second more unlikely option that some economists would likely welcome mr napolitano the president could appoint a caretaker prime minister to form what in italian political parlance is referred to as a "technical government " a technical government which would likely have ministers from both the right and left sides of the political spectrum would have the support of a broader coalition it would officially be charged with tackling only the most urgent issues such as drafting an electoral law so that new elections could take place historically technical governments which usually last a year or so have been among the most successful at passing thorny economic restructuring measures those governments havent been chosen by voters and are therefore less accountable to an electorate that might oppose moves such as cutting pension benefits or raising the retirement age they are also bipartisan and therefore less prone to parliamentary boycotts "the situation is still so hazy right now " said silvia pepino giuliani a senior european economist with j p morgan in london if a technical government is formed she added "youd have to see who was heading it and what mandate they were given " in lamberto dini was tapped to head a technical government when a center right coalition headed by mr berlusconi collapsed after seven months in office mr dinis government pushed forward with a pension overhaul that is credited with helping rein in public spending ahead of italys entry into the euro zone giuliano amato currently interior minister headed a technical government in that passed a brutal tax measure that rescued the country from the risk of defaulting on its bonds if both political options currently on the table fail mr napolitano would have to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections until those options are tried however elections are unlikely a survey by ipr marketing for left leaning rome daily la repubblica found that just of italians would like new elections bumpy road the next italian government must tackle some difficult issues including passing an electoral law to foster greater political stability renegotiating several union contracts including those for italys vast public sector work force overhauling the state pension system which consumes more than of annual gross domestic product highest in the euro zone reducing italys public debt currently at of gdp compared with a euro zone average of
