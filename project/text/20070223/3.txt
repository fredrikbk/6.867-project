an upside down world london the other day ken livingstone the mayor of my hometown of london organized a conference on islam and the west it was a carefully rigged affair in which handpicked speaker after handpicked speaker stood up and announced that the democracies were to blame for the tidal wave of murder sweeping the world to provide a spurious air of balance the organizers invited a few people who dissented from the line of the muslim brotherhood and its british allies agnes poirier a french feminist was one of them but she pulled out because although there were no special facilities for christians hindus and jews mr livingstone had provided separate prayer rooms for muslim men and muslim women she wanted to know does ken livingstones idea of multiculturalism acknowledge and condone segregation it clearly does but what made this vignette of ethnic politics in a european city worth noting is that commentators for the bbc and nearly every newspaper here describe mr livingstone as one of the most left wing politicians in british public life hardly any of them notices the weirdness of an apparent socialist pandering to a reactionary strain of islam pushing its arguments and accepting its dictates mr livingstones not alone after suicide bombers massacred londoners on july leftish rather than conservative papers held british foreign policy responsible for the slaughters on the transport network "blairs bombs " ran the headline in my own leftish new statesman in any university you are more likely to hear campaigns for the rights of muslim women derided by postmodernists than by crusty conservative dons our stop the war coalition is an alliance of the white far left and the islamist far right and george galloway its leader and the first allegedly "far left" mp to be elected to the british parliament in years is an admirer of saddam hussein and hezbollah i could go on with specific examples but the crucial point is the pervasive european attitude to the iraq catastrophe as al qaeda the baathists and shiite islamists slaughter thousands there is virtually no sense that their successes are our defeats iraqi socialists and trade unionists i know are close to despair they turn for support to europe the home of liberalism feminism and socialism and find that rich democrats liberals and feminists wont help them or even acknowledge their existence there were plenty of leftish people in the th century who excused communism but they could at least say that communism was a left wing idea now overwhelmingly and everywhere you find people who scream their heads off about the smallest sexist or racist remark yet refuse to confront ultra reactionary movements that explicitly reject every principle they profess to hold why is the world upside down in part it is a measure of president bushs failure that anti americanism has swept out of the intelligentsia and become mainstream in britain a country that was once the most pro american in western europe now derides tony blair for sticking with the atlantic alliance but if iraq has pummeled mr blairs reputation it has also shone a very harsh light on the british and european left no one noticed it when the berlin wall came down but the death of socialism gave people who called themselves "left wing" a paradoxical advantage they no longer had a practical program they needed to defend and could go along with ultra right movements that would once have been taboo in moments of crisis otherwise sane liberals will turn to these movements and be reassured by the professed leftism of the protest organizers that they are not making a nonsense of their beliefs if that is they have strong beliefs to abandon in europe and north america extreme versions of multiculturalism and identity politics have left a poisonous legacy far too many liberal minded people think that is somehow culturally imperialist to criticize reactionary movements and ideas as long as they arent european or american reactionary movements this delusion is everywhere until very recently our labour government was allowing its dealings with britains muslim minority to be controlled by an unelected group the muslim council of britain which stood for everything social democrats were against in their desperate attempts to ingratiate themselves ministers gave its leader a knighthood even though he had said that "death was too good" for salman rushdie who happens to be a british citizen as well as a great novelist beyond the contortions and betrayals of liberal and leftish thinking lies a simple emotion that i dont believe americans take account of an insidious fear that has produced the ideal conditions for appeasement radical islam does worry europeans but we are trying to prevent an explosion by going along with islamist victimhood we blame ourselves for the islamist rage in the hope that our admission of guilt will pacify our enemies we are scared but not scared enough to take a stand i hope conservative american readers come to britain but if you do expect to find an upside down world people who call themselves liberals or leftists will argue with you and when they have finished you may experience the strange realization that they have become far more reactionary than you have ever been mr cohen a columnist for the observer and the new statesman is the author of "whats left how liberals lost their way" fourth estate see related letter "letters to the editor our islamist friends champions of rights" wsj mar
