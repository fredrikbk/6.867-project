india didnt benefit from nehrus policies i respectfully differ with dr k paul pouloses "road to prosperity" letters to the editor feb india did not benefit from the policies of nehru as reflected in dr pouloses letter if anything the countrys economic boom was delayed by nehrus socialistic tilt regarding the indian judiciary it was not and is not independent today nehru controlled the judiciary by diminishing its power to interfere with his policies and today the indian judges can easily be influenced by political and financial pressures as for the largest democracy india really doesnt have a true democracy in a democratic form of government there are one set of laws for all of its citizens this is simply not the case india has different laws for minorities for example only muslims get subsidy for hajj pilgrimage every year in addition muslims can marry four wives the huge quota system applied to government jobs and even in education is a blatant example of reverse discrimination these are not the characteristics of a true democracy i would call indias democracy as incomplete or pretend to be what india needs is an american type of democracy having the same set of laws for its entire people with strict and uniform enforcement of all laws without any exception these kinds of changes will boost peoples morale and enhance the rate of economic well being vijay p khasat clinton ohio
