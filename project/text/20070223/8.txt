bill clintons amt bomb as tax season nears democrats in congress are discovering they have an urgent political bomb to defuse the alternative minimum tax the amt already hits four million americans and without new legislation this year it will explode in the pocketbooks of million taxpayers come april whats amazing is that many democrats and reporters are trying to blame this looming tax increase on the tax cuts see if you can follow their argument taxpayers are obliged to pay the higher of their tax bill under either the regular irs code or the amt and because the tax cuts reduced the regular income tax of the average family by &# a year more middle class families are being bounced to the amt system ergo its all president bushs fault this logic requires overlooking that a taxpayers bill under the amt is still lower than it would have been without the tax cuts but never mind the political game here is to use the amt as an excuse to justify repealing the bush tax cuts in reality the amt is one more liberal monster that was created in the name of soaking the rich but has now come back to swallow the middle class democrats created the amt in amid a political frenzy to capture a mere millionaires who had paid nothing and the politician most responsible for the amts relentless expansion in recent years is none other than william jefferson clinton remember the tax hike that was supposed to fall only on the rich in addition to raising gas taxes and medicare payroll taxes and income tax rates the democratic congress that year also raised the amt from a flat rate to a dual tax rate of on amt income up to &# and on amt income above that amount its true that the bill slightly increased the amts family income exemption but democrats refused to index those exemptions for inflation so the combination of the higher rates and the failure to index for inflation has caught more and more middle class taxpayers in the amts maw from to this clinton stealth tax hike increased sixfold the number of filers paying the amt to nearly two million from a joint tax committee jtc analysis requested last year by senator charles grassley of iowa shows that about million more americans will have to pay the amt next year thanks to the higher post amt rates the house ways and means committee calculates that if you live in a high tax state such as california or new york and have two or more kids youre very likely to be hit with the amt this year even if your income is as low as &# all of which means that if democrats really want to spare joe lunchbucket from the amt the cleanest solution is to repeal the clinton amt rate hikes the nearby chart prepared by the american shareholders association based on joint tax data compares the number of filers who will be hit by the amt under current law and what would happen if the amt rate was moved back to the pre clinton and the exemption was indexed for inflation at the level of &# &# for a joint return going back to the pre clinton rates would leave only about million tax filers subject to an amt penalty next year instead of million under current law the estimated "cost" of this fix to the treasury over years would be some &# billion which is money democrats in congress would prefer to spend but as senator grassley notes "this tax was never meant to tax the middle class so why should we count it as a revenue loss when we make sure they dont have to pay it " theres a larger policy lesson to keep in mind as the debate unfolds over both the amt and the looming expiration of the bush tax cuts in beware politicians who say they only want to tax the rich sooner or later their tax schemes will soak the middle class because thats where the real money is regarding the amt democrats are now saying theyll be glad to provide amt relief for the middle class but theyll have to raise taxes on ceos and other high income americans to do it where have we heard that one before
