deal breaker a landmark vote in japan shareholders just say no steel company merger rejected in proxy fight an americans triumph tokyo when u s companies announce plans for a merger shareholders occasionally derail the deal over price or other issues in japan people couldnt remember that ever happening until yesterday an investment fund led by an american scott callon rallied shareholder support and won a vote to block a small tokyo steel company from being taken over mr callon bested two of japan inc s biggest guns the nations top steelmaker nippon steel corp which owns a majority of the would be acquirer and trading giant mitsui &amp co which backed the deal as the small companys biggest shareholder "there has historically been a view among the business elite in japan that they know how to run their company and other voices dont have to be heard " says mr callon a year old former morgan stanley managing director yesterdays shareholder vote he says means that "truly the individual shareholders stood up " long silent shareholders are gaining power in japan shaking up managers and raising hopes that the nations economic recovery could pick up vigor instead of being owned mostly by banks and other friendly business partners as in the past japanese companies increasingly must answer to individual shareholders and independent investment funds just of japans &# trillion in personal assets are in stocks and similar investments compared with of &# trillion in the u s much of the japanese money sits in banks which traditionally played a big role in financing big companies recently though individuals have been edging into the market the number of japanese individual shareholders rose to million in from million in according to official data and they now make up of the market spurred by their buying the market is booming the benchmark nikkei stock average ended the day yesterday at its highest close in nearly seven years growing shareholder activism could shake up japanese companies by forcing them to use their resources more efficiently the tokyo stock exchange is full of companies that trade for less than the value of their assets such as cash and real estate and could be revived by industry consolidation "there remains enough inefficiency in the japanese economy that cleaning up just some of it will provide a boost to growth for many years " says marc goldstein director of japan research at institutional shareholder services a big proxy adviser in the past few months some aggressive investors have made companies bow to their demands last october a u s fund called steel partners japan strategic fund bought of the shares of a small instant noodle maker myojo food then made a tender offer for the whole company myojo managers wanted to remain independent but they eventually agreed to sell out to nissin food products co a much larger noodle maker that allowed steel partners to sell its stake at a profit its now applying a similar strategy with sapporo holdings a beer maker the trend of shareholder activism has also affected south korea steel partners and u s investor carl icahn bought about of a south korean tobacco company and got a director on the board through a proxy battle last year mr callon says the small steel company called tokyo kohtetsu co is a classic case of executives not heeding shareholder interests management of the company which collects scrap steel and processes it for use in construction wanted to sell out to a larger rival in osaka for only a premium mr callon says a much larger premium was in order given the potential cost savings from the deal tokyo kohtetsu executives disagree they say their company could be overwhelmed soon by imports from china and has little leverage to strike a better bargain although mr callon doesnt think chinese technology is strong enough to pose an immediate challenge "we are too small " said yoshiyuki niino the companys finance chief sitting in a head office that has desks for just six people the company has a single foundry miles away "we cant make the necessary investment in equipment to keep us competitive " mr niino said mr callon the son of an international business machines corp employee spent three years as a toddler in japan and later mastered the language he received a doctorate in japanese politics at stanford university and wrote a book concluding that the traditional japanese system of cross shareholding and government big business ties was "coming apart " he joined morgan stanleys tokyo office in after a stint at another bank he returned to morgan stanley in as a managing director in charge of equities in tokyo there mr callon who is tall thin and talks in rapid high energy bursts spent a week meeting all of the nearly people under him a half hour at a time in mr callons grandmother went into a coma while the rest of the family gathered in san jose he stayed in tokyo to work on business projects that would determine his teams bonuses during that period his grandmother died "i wasnt making the right choices as a human being " mr callon says he told his bosses he quit and last year started an investment fund with sanae shimizu a former colleague the fund is called ichigo part of a japanese saying that means "once in a lifetime chance " it has just &# million in assets under management a tiny amount by the standards of the fund world most of it from family friends and former clients as early as april of last year mr callon and ms shimizu identified tokyo kohtetsu as a potential investment the companys shares were valued at under six times its annual net profit though it trades on an exchange for smaller companies thats less than half the average price to earnings ratio for steel companies on the tokyo stock exchange one reason was that heirs of the companys founder and the ministry of finance which had received shares as payment for taxes were steadily reducing their stakes that created an overload of selling in the market but didnt affect tokyo kohtetsus core business it was making money had no debt and plenty of cash with a market capitalization of under &# million it was off the radar screens of many institutional investors before mr callons fund could officially open up shop and snap up a stake tokyo kohtetsu made a move it had been talking to osaka steel co a much bigger maker of similar products miles away in western japan the two companies which had customers nationwide realized they could save money by delivering products from the plant closest to each client last october the two announced they would combine the deal gave tokyo kohtetsu shareholders shares of osaka steel for each of their tokyo kohtetsu shares that translated to a premium at the time and valued tokyo kohtetsu at around &# million later that value went up because osaka steel shares rose as did tokyo kohtetsus the companies said the price was fair citing opinions obtained from major japanese securities houses mr callon didnt think so even in japan an acquiring company usually has to pay a to premium for its prey in the u s a premium is typical mr callon thought the premium should be higher than usual because of tokyo kohtetsus low valuation and the clear cost savings besides the reduction in delivery costs the combined company would have more clout in the market for scrap steel from cars or demolished buildings and could squeeze lower prices from suppliers challenging the deal would be tough mr goldstein of institutional shareholder services and goldman sachs strategist kathy matsui say they dont know of any cases in japanese corporate history where shareholders blocked a merger agreed on by the companies with the two parties to the deal declining to discuss how they arrived at the price mr callon thought he saw the hand of japan inc tokyo kohtetsus biggest shareholder with a stake is mitsui the big trading company tokyo kohtetsus president previously worked at mitsui for more than years meanwhile giant nippon steel owns of osaka steel mitsui and nippon steel are longtime business partners and in financial terms that relationship is far more significant to mitsui than its holding in little tokyo kohtetsu in the year ended march of nippon steels total sales of &# billion went to mitsui or a joint venture between nippon steel and mitsui "its safe to say tokyo kohtetsu and osaka steel werent acting independently " says mr goldstein who like other observers believes the big backers on each side influenced the deal mr niino of tokyo kohtetsu said "the merger and the merger ratio have nothing to do with the relationship between mitsui and nippon steel " a mitsui spokesman minoru kasahara declined to discuss why mitsui was willing to accept the small premium for its shares a nippon steel spokesman masato suzuki said his company received periodic reports on the takeover talks but the buyer and seller were the "main players " many of tokyo kohtetsus smaller shareholders thought they were getting too little some protested the deal on yahoo japan corp s bulletin boards "the exchange ratio is atrocious " griped one who called himself nigenoken as soon as keniti nagano heard the merger news the year old trade association employee became so angry that he asked his boss for a day off to attend the tokyo kohtetsu shareholders meeting where the deal would be voted on "i wanted to ask the president to explain this deal to me " said mr nagano who owns shares or about of the company mr callon printed out or so postings from the internet bulletin board and took them with him to a business trip in singapore on the plane already exhausted from long work hours he started reading the postings and was overcome with emotion "it was a toxic combination of being so tired and so frustrated and so angry that i started crying " he says he got up and went to the bathroom for a while until he had composed himself "i realized we had to fight " mr callon decided ichigo should buy shares in tokyo kohtetsu and try to alter the deal if he gathered a significant block of shareholders against the merger terms he figured management would agree to bargain for a better deal "the strategy was to get them to talk " he says "i wanted it to be like this is a difference among friends " ichigo amassed an stake in tokyo kohtetsu in two months but in mid january meetings with tokyo kohtetsu and osaka steel executives mr callon got nowhere he says they cited the fairness opinions and called the price nonnegotiable a week later ms shimizu ichigos lawyer and three assistants went to tokyo kohtetsus headquarters to ask for the shareholder registry tokyo kohtetsu wouldnt give them a copy but did allow them to use a conference room for two hours to copy it a senior tokyo kohtetsu executive watched over them as they scanned the documents with a portable optical character reader and wrote down some entries by hand on friday feb ichigo announced the proxy contest saying it would seek votes to reject the deal at the shareholder meeting it mailed proxy ballots to tokyo kohtetsus shareholders of whom are individual investors the following monday he found proxies filling his mailbox soon proxies were arriving each day tokyo kohtetsu first commented on the deal after ichigos announcement shunsuke hirashima the companys president argued that the company was at risk "in the near future domestic makers of general steel are going to see imports from abroad particularly china " wrote mr hirashima on the company web site by that point izumi takaishi had already decided to vote with mr callon the year old president of a real estate company had built up a stock portfolio worth some &# over years including shares in tokyo kohtetsu worth about &# when tokyo kohtetsu announced the merger terms mr takaishi was surprised by the low merger ratio never having been involved in a protest against management he thought there was nothing he could do about it "i thought it would be very difficult to change something that the company had decided " says mr takaishi then the ichigo proxy arrived and two days later a form from tokyo kohtetsu that he says "didnt explain the merger enough " he returned the ichigo proxy last friday ichigo made a final appeal to the managements of tokyo kohtetsu and osaka steel sending the presidents of both companies letters asking for meetings mr hirashima called mr callon to say he appreciated the overture but wasnt going to change the terms of the deal says mr callon yesterday of tokyo kohtetsu shareholders agreed with mr callon blocking the deal after the three week campaign some tokyo kohtetsu shareholders who had pledged their shares to mr callons proxy solicitation traveled to the meeting to show support mr nagano the trade association employee sat next to mr callon throughout the proceedings mr callon said in a statement posted on its web site yesterday tokyo kohtetsu called the vote "truly regrettable" and added "we believe a precious opportunity has been lost " the company said at this point it is not planning to renegotiate a deal with osaka steel at a better price
