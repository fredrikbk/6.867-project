weekend journal sports by the numbers the nhls young guns this season one of the national hockey leagues big attractions is a pair of young stars who are already showing signs of belonging next to wayne gretzky and mario lemieux in the hockey pantheon pittsburgh penguins center sidney crosby and washington capitals left wing alexander ovechkin are arguably the games most marketable young superstars since messrs gretzky and lemieux at years old mr crosby leads the league with assists as well as in overall points the total of goals and assists and with goals year old mr ovechkin is near the top of the goal scoring list for a second straight year having finished third with goals last season all stats are as of wednesdays games while theyre providing plenty of excitement their stats arent nearly as gaudy as those of the earlier greats mr crosby is on a pace to score overall points this season a far cry from mr gretzkys single season record of set in and mr ovechkins goal pace would leave him well behind mr lemieuxs career best goals set in the season but before you get too nostalgic for hockeys past look at the numbers messrs gretzky and lemieux had scoring titles in years between them and were certainly among the greatest players ever but they also played in an era in which scoring was more prevalent than it is today in mr gretzkys rookie season of goals were scored in the average nhl game by mr lemieuxs second year the total was but in the s the trapping style of defense played by teams such as the new jersey devils curtailed scoring this years average of goals per game is down from to adjust for the difference we came up with adjusted scoring average or asa we took the scoring stats for mr gretzky and mr lemieux for their first two seasons and multiplied them by the ratio of the leaguewide scoring average then and now asa says the performances of the younger stars are on par with those of the two hall of famers with points per game so far in his pro career mr crosby tops the asa of mr lemieuxs first two seasons and if his scoring pace keeps on increasing until the end of the season hell be within striking distance of the mark mr gretzky set in his first two seasons mr ovechkin also stacks up well against mr lemieux with points per game compared to super marios asa to put it another way if messrs crosby and ovechkin were playing in the nhl of their projected point totals would look a lot more impressive goals and assists totaling points for mr ovechkin and goals and assists for mr crosby for a gretzkyesque points will messrs crosby and ovechkin have a realistic chance to break any of the single season or career records held by messrs gretzky and lemieux itll take more changes in the way the game is played last year the nhl instituted a variety of rule changes when play resumed after the work stoppage designed to give playmakers such as mr crosby and mr ovechkin room to maneuver and ultimately increase scoring its worked to a point from to last year scoring went from goals per game to but this year as goalies and defenses have adjusted to the rule changes scoring dropped to so dont be surprised if the nhl continues to tweak the rules to benefit its sharpshooters and as you watch hockeys two young superstars at work remember that today each goal is worth a little more than years ago but that may not be the case for long as good as the greats one reason why such young nhl stars as sidney crosby and alexander ovechkin havent matched the numbers of wayne gretzky and mario lemieux is that todays game is lower scoring translating messrs gretzky and lemieuxs rookie and sophomore season stats into todays lower scoring game shows that messrs crosby and ovechkin hold a narrow statistical edge over mr lemieux and are surprisingly close to mr gretzky adj adj adj player seasons goals assists scoring wayne gretzky sidney crosby alexander ovechkin mario lemieux  game projection for based on pace set through games of feb
