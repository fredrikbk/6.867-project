weekend journal review books the meaning of life etc the latest answers to the oldest questions by nicholas fearn grove press pages &# plato believed that truth emerges only through dialogue and socrates said that philosophy should always take the form of conversation these days not many students have the luxury of being taught in the old socratic way that nurtured generations of pupils at oxford and cambridge there is not enough time and there are too many students apart from platos own written dialogues moreover few first rate texts of philosophy are in the form of a reported conversation in fact there are just two in english david humes "dialogues concerning natural religion" and bishop berkeleys "three dialogues between hylas and philonous " in the past four decades though popularizers of the subject have rediscovered the art of conversation conducting interviews with professional philosophers turns out to be just about the best way of communicating their ideas to beginners "the latest answers to the oldest questions " by nicholas fearn a british journalist is a useful and up to date contribution to the genre such dispatches from the battlefield of ideas tend to take one of two forms some are bare transcripts of chat like three books based on interviews with philosophers on bbc radio and tv in the s and s by bryan magee a british writer and a former member of parliament a different approach was pioneered by ved mehta an indian writer in a series of profiles for the new yorker in and later collected as a book mr mehtas "fly and the fly bottle" the title alludes to wittgensteins dictum that the job of philosophy is to show the former how to escape from the latter was a mix of transcript biographical sketch and exposition in mr mehtas own words mr fearn takes the same tack quoting from published work and from his interviews with some philosophers from around the english speaking world he is himself trained as a philosopher and is the author of a lively primer in the subject "zeno and the tortoise how to think like a philosopher" refreshingly he is not shy about taking sides and expressing his own opinions which makes "the latest answers to the oldest questions" a more engaging read than it might otherwise have been in one chapter for example mr fearn reports on current thinking about the freedom of the will and ends up endorsing "compatibilism " this is the view that human freedom is perfectly consistent with the idea that all our actions are the ineluctable effects of prior causes compatibilists typically argue that it is constraint and not causation that is the enemy of freedom mr fearn suggests that this is one philosophical problem that has been resolved once and for all he notes that most philosophers accept compatibilism and that it is only the small number of thinkers who specialize in this area who keep worrying about it mr fearn also endorses materialism the thesis that mind is matter and more controversially noam chomskys idea that linguistic ability proves the existence of a form of innate knowledge other chapters focus on the nature of meaning the problem of personal identity the notion of moral luck animal rights "minds and machines" and even the meaning of life and death in a chapter on the definition of knowledge mr fearn explains a striking novelty in epistemology the family of "externalist" theories of knowing since plato most philosophers have regarded knowledge as justified true belief if you believe in a proposition that is true and if you can provide a justification or rationale for such a belief then it counts as knowledge externalist theories by contrast say that what turns a mere belief into knowledge is partly something outside ones own mind like the circumstances that caused you to acquire the belief in the first place for example you may have used a method that has generally proved to be reliable in the past externalist theories began to be developed in the late s and continue to be a growth industry as mr fearn notes philosophy has become a highly professionalized discipline with some paid practitioners around the world he writes that the subject has entered "a post heroic age " in which philosophers seek modest incremental advances in our understanding rather than the revolutionary leaps that most of the great names of the past hoped for todays philosophers are also considerably more down to earth than their forebears and generally constrained by common sense for an oldfashioned metaphysical romp through unverifiable thickets of fantasy todays readers would be better advised to turn to the musings of theoretical physicists so it is a pleasure to meet in these pages nick bostrum a young swedish philosopher at oxford who thinks it highly probable that all of us are mere computer simulations in other words he thinks that the science fiction film "the matrix" may well be fact and not fiction mr fearn informs us that mr bostrum used to work for the cia one of the most compelling topics discussed here arises out of the work of colin mcginn a british philosopher now teaching in america mr mcginn believes that the reason why many traditional problems of philosophy remain unanswered despite centuries of effort is that our brains are constitutionally incapable of dealing with them just as the brain of a goldfish is incapable of calculus noam chomsky also endorses this idea one problem with it as patricia churchland of the university of california at san diego notes to mr fearn is that one can never know to which puzzles it applies how could we be sure of the future limits of our own understanding a conundrum may seem intractable one day but a breakthrough could be just around the corner so we should never give up looking for answers mr mcginn says that he takes a wry pleasure in the thought that his pessimistic theory "will probably be the orthodox opinion in the dying stages of the suns heat " perhaps watch this space mr gottlieb is the author of "the dream of reason a history of philosophy from the greeks to the renaissance " he is working on a book about nothingness
