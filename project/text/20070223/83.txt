the philadelphia story judging by test score results philadelphia schools have been enjoying a renaissance over the past four years thirty two percent of philadelphias fifth graders achieved proficiency on the pennsylvania reading test in as compared to just in math proficiency rose to from at the eighth grade level there were percentage point uptics in both reading and math nevertheless the respected rand corporation in a study expected to influence the report of the accountability review council for the philadelphia schools that will be released later today claims these positive results which came after a series of reforms including the engagement of private firms in the management of schools are in fact deceptive and misleading in a press release early this month announcing results from its latest study rand claims to have shown that "the four year gains were generally on a par with gains from similar low achieving schools in the rest of the state " according to jolley christman one of the reports authors philadelphias "investment in private management of schools has not paid the expected dividends " needless to say the study attracted wide attention it also thrilled school choice critics including henry levin of columbia teachers college who said of the experiment in private management "its a romance that just hasnt worked they dont seem to be doing better and they cost more " these strong conclusions are not well supported by the rand study however the widely quoted press release overstates what is actually in the report the comparisons within the study itself are inexact and vital information on school spending and other school characteristics is missing from the report first a few words about the larger context in fighting off fierce opposition pennsylvania placed philadelphias schools in the hands of a school reform commission which then hired as superintendent the same paul vallas who had helped lift student achievement in chicago among other innovations mr vallas audaciously turned of the lowest performing schools over to private providers but reform did not come without a prolonged political struggle numerous compromises were struck including concessions to unions that allowed many of the old regulations to remain in effect meanwhile the unions kept a low public profile while apparently doing their best to undermine the reforms especially by encouraging experienced teachers to leave the schools assigned to private providers in the first year teacher transfer rates more than doubled at many of these schools despite this test scores rose in most of the privately managed schools now rand says philadelphia could have done equally well by doing nothing to prove that claim one might expect rand to have identified other big cities with extremely low performing schools making equally striking gains but without launching reforms such as those undertaken in philadelphia instead rand compared philadelphia to other schools in pennsylvania despite rands own admission buried deep in its report that "philadelphia is unique among pennsylvania school districts other schools in the state are only imperfectly comparable to philadelphia schools " in any event rand says that gains in philadelphia "were generally on a par" with gains in "similar" schools elsewhere but the report never identifies those "similar" schools not their names not the characteristics of the students attending them not their test performance back in before reforms began rand only tells us that the comparison schools were in the bottom of all the states schools a very large category that contains a wide range of schools still philadelphia schools do not look all that bad while not making much progress the first year they are estimated to have outperformed the comparison schools in the second and third years for example philadelphia eighth graders in year three are estimated to have gained eight to points more than those in the comparison schools in year four philadelphias edge slips that could be a temporary blip rand instead concludes that philadelphias gains remained only at "par " ordinarily researchers make use of all available estimates not just the most recent one to draw their conclusions in its second analysis of schools within philadelphia rand finds privately operated schools to have done no better but also no worse than would be expected from that same school given citywide trends in the words of the reports italicized conclusion "we find little evidence in terms of academic outcomes that would support the additional resources for the private managers " given the restrictions placed on the private providers such a finding would not necessarily be surprising but rands way of reaching its conclusion is flawed the research looked only at those students in certain grades who were tested on multiple occasions a small non random percentage of all students no information is provided on their representativeness more puzzling still is rands decision to expect these schools to exceed the overall citywide gains in test score performance in so doing rand seemingly ignored the fact that the schools assigned to the private managers were among the citys most challenging scoring in one to two years below the citywide average a more suitable analysis would have expected them to gain more than students at comparably low performing schools finally rand questions the additional cost of private management and says that the privately managed schools gained additional resources that the average school did not but nowhere does rand provide evidence on overall per pupil spending at any philadelphia school making it impossible to tell whether the privately managed schools actually received more additional resources than other city schools it is more likely that per pupil expenditure at the privately managed schools dropped when experienced highly paid teachers left the schools at a much higher rate than before rand needs to show that that did not happen or was offset by large increments in other kinds of expenditures if it is to draw the conclusion that the privately managed schools had "additional resources " just how sensitive results are to rands specific methodology is unknown but if education policy research is going to make a solid contribution to school reform it needs to be both objective and keep pace with rising standards in educational research in rands case a forward step would be to make its philadelphia data available to other qualified researchers something it has so far been unwilling to do mr peterson is director of the program on education policy and governance at harvard university and a senior fellow at stanfords hoover
