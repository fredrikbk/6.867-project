the evening wrap tall cup of reality online edition starbucks has achieved the sort of omnipresence once reserved for things like say oxygen or gravity but now its restless leader is wondering if somewhere along the path to ubiquity the coffee company may have lost its soul surely it will strike some as a little silly that the head of a large publicly traded company that sells billions of dollars worth of beverages would agonize over the frenzied pace of the companys growth starbucks which seems so inescapable gives off the outward appearance of health and a vast number of other corporate leaders might be content to just tally their profits and head to the golf course but in a memo to senior executives that surfaced on the web chairman howard schultz wrote that "in order to achieve the growth development and scale" necessary to achieve such stunning expansion "we have had to make a series of decisions that in retrospect have led to the watering down of the starbucks experience and what some might call the commoditization of our brand " of course turning into a commodity business that is one that competes mostly on the basis of price is a fate that keeps many captains of industry up at night starbucks has expanded at a breakneck pace for years now and its whirlwind growth forced the company to seek efficiencies without trampling the unique experience that brought consumers through its doors in the first place thats a challenge that arises again and again for growing businesses but for as much as its innovations may have facilitated its growth mr schultz wonders whether they also came at some cost to the starbucks brand once starbucks baristas whipped up espressos by hand no more the company has adopted automatic espresso makers that have greatly improved speed and efficiency anyone who has waited in a long line for a cup of coffee can see the value in that but to mr schultzs thinking in removing the hand readied espressos "we overlooked the fact that we would remove much of the romance and theatre " whats more the new machines "blocked the visual sight line the customer previously had to watch the drink being made and for the intimate experience with the barista " in some of mr schultzs other concerns he sounded not unlike those who grind their teeth and grumble to themselves about cultural homogeneity and corporate blandness when they spot another starbucks opening down the street he wrote that some of its new stores lack "the soul of the past some people even call our stores sterile cookie cutter " cranking out look alike shops starbucks has opened the door to competition from chains like dunkin donuts which is now snapping at starbucks fashionable heels mr schultz observed that "small and large coffee companies fast food operators and mom and pops" have been set up "in a way that creates awareness trial and loyalty of people who previously have been starbucks customers this must be eradicated " but some bystanders werent left all that inspired one commenter on the web site where the memo was posted wondered "does the right hand know what the left hand is doing " surging oil soaks stocks with
