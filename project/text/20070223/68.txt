regulators hedge fund approach hands off washington after months of reflection the overseers of the u s financial system have concluded that current regulations are sufficient to prevent hedge funds private equity firms and other "private pools of capital" from threatening the financial systems stability the report by the heads of the treasury federal reserve securities and exchange commission and commodity futures trading commission is their first comprehensive statement on hedge fund risks since a study that followed the near collapse in of giant hedge fund long term capital management while hedge funds "present challenges for market participants and policy makers " the risks can be maintained through a combination of "market discipline" and limiting access to the private pools of capital to wealthy investors the presidents working group on financial markets said in the report it urged policy makers to scrutinize banks mutual funds and other counterparties that do business with hedge funds and to rely on investors and their financial advisers to mitigate risks the report comes amid growing concern globally about the size and oversight of the hedge fund industry which has grown to about &# trillion in assets from about &# billion in the industry has largely escaped regulation and oversight officials in some european nations have recently begun calling for more scrutiny of hedge funds the sec federal reserve bank of new york and britains financial services authority also are assessing the ability of large financial institutions to handle market stresses "there was general agreement that the big emphasis needed to be on the relationship between the regulated entities the creditors the counterparties that are dealing with these private pools and an emphasis on best practices and risk management " treasury secretary henry paulson said in an interview he added that the group would continue to monitor the markets including the particular challenges posed "by the growth in over the counter derivatives" private investment contracts that arent traded on regulated exchanges the group decided against calling for more hedge fund disclosure that is a shift from when the group then under the clinton administration said that "more frequent and meaningful information on hedge funds should be made public " a treasury official said the group took all of the reports recommendations into account and incorporated some of its suggestions but it ultimately concluded that more disclosure wasnt necessary because market discipline has improved greatly over the intervening years now "its an entirely different situation " mr paulson said "what weve emphasized is market discipline " the group is relying on counterparties creditors and investors to demand the sort of information that will help prevent a financial meltdown among the recommendations is that investors in private pools of capital "should obtain accurate and timely historical and ongoing material information necessary to perform due diligence" on the hedge funds strategies and risk management but it leaves it to the firms that do business with hedge funds to determine how best to get this information it also calls on those who lend money or do business with private pools of capital to implement "risk management practices " including reviews of the "ability to measure and manage its exposures to market credit liquidity and operational risks " the working group also expressed support for sec efforts to raise the monetary threshold needed to invest in hedge funds in december the agency proposed requiring that hedge fund investors in addition to having a net worth of &# million or an annual income of &# for the previous two years have an additional &# million in assets excluding primary residences sec chairman christopher cox said that while the presidents working group doesnt issue regulations the sec has oversight of brokerage houses a suggestion that the sec could step up oversight of hedge funds by tweaking rules or through examinations of the brokerage industry since the sec has extended its supervision of five big brokerage firms beyond routine examinations the agencys staff meets with the firms risk management divisions to discuss big picture issues and inspects their internal controls the agency has questioned things including how much collateral prime brokers require of hedge funds and how firms manage risk on energy trades the presidents groups recommendations were blasted as weak by some advocates including attorney general richard blumenthal of connecticut where many hedge funds are based mr blumenthal recently created a unit to investigate industry fraud "these vague recommendations lack substance and specifics making them unenforceable " he said in a statement "federal action would be preferable but federal inaction and inertia will invite indeed fuel state initiatives " congress is also expected to weigh in massachusetts democratic rep barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee said his panel will hold hearings on hedge funds this spring the report is "a first step in addressing questions presented by the significant growth of hedge funds " he said but "further study and monitoring" of systemic risk and investor protection are needed kara scannell and greg ip contributed to
