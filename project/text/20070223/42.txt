lawfare david b rivkin jr and lee a casey the term "lawfare" describes the growing use of international law claims usually factually or legally meritless as a tool of war the goal is to gain a moral advantage over your enemy in the court of world opinion and potentially a legal advantage in national and international tribunals al qaeda of course is an experienced lawfare practitioner its training manual seized by british authorities in manchester england openly instructs detained al qaeda fighters to claim torture and other types of abuse as a means of obtaining a moral advantage over their captors that advice has been routinely followed by detainees at guantanamo bay who have succeeded in generating incessant demands from european officials among others for the bases closure and their own liberation these efforts however pale to insignificance when compared to the blizzard of litigation initiated in the u s federal courts on behalf of al qaeda and taliban detainees the suits range from habeas corpus petitions to free captured enemy combatants cases that were dismissed by the u s court of appeals in washington d c on tuesday to tort suits seeking monies from u s government officials to challenges regarding the detainees conditions of confinement there was a quixotic attempt to save saddam husseins life by asking a federal court in washington d c to "stay" his execution by the baghdad government several suits seek to hold the u s liable for the alleged misconduct of other governments of these the lawsuit by canadian maher arar ostensibly tortured after being "rendered" to syria is the best known the most significant common thread among all these actions is the clear desire to portray u s government actions as illegal and unprecedented in fact it is the claims for extensive due process rights for captured enemy combatants that are unprecedented combatants whether the regular soldiers of sovereign states irregular guerillas or terrorists have never enjoyed the right to contest the legality of their detention in the civilian courts or to a criminal trial the supreme court reaffirmed these traditional rules in hamdi v rumsfeld where a clear majority held that captured al qaeda operatives could constitutionally be held as enemy combatants for the duration of hostilities without the due process required for individuals accused of criminal violations the only process the court considered necessary was an opportunity to contest before military authorities the factual basis of their classification as enemy combatants with a limited opportunity for judicial review nevertheless lawyers for the detainees continue to demand a full fledged criminal process in the civilian courts for their clients former clinton attorney general janet reno has argued in a friend of the court brief that one detainee ali saleh kahlah al marri should be entirely removed from the military justice system even though he already has received far more extensive judicial process than that required by the hamdi decision similarly in a grim echo of domestic prisoners rights cases lawyers for another detainee saifullah paracha have demanded that he be transferred from guantanamo bay to a civilian u s hospital for a common medical procedure a cardiac catheterization perhaps the most pernicious ongoing lawfare example is the effort to hold u s officials financially liable for their wartime conduct based on the theories developed in bivens v six unknown named agents in that case the supreme court permitted a civil damage suit against individual federal drug enforcement agents for allegedly violating the plaintiffs constitutional rights in particular the fourth amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures several bivens actions have been filed on behalf of foreign combatants captured detained and later released by u s forces none have been particularly successful so far but the determined effort to use legal principles developed in the context of civilian law enforcement operations on u s soil against officials directing an ongoing armed conflict overseas reveals an unsettling policy agenda these efforts are of a piece with a similar "progressive" movement ongoing at least since the end of world war ii to remake the traditional laws of war attempting to import into the area of armed conflict concepts and norms from the world of domestic law enforcement thus leftist ngos routinely demand that irregular enemy combatants like al qaeda and the taliban be treated as pows or criminal defendants claim that military force can be applied only to the minimum amounts necessary to neutralize a particular opponent rather than with a view to achieving ultimate victory and have sought to ban an increasing number of weapons and weapons systems as being "inherently indiscriminate " the effect of this lawfare effort were it successful would be to make it exceptionally difficult if not impossible for a law abiding state to wage war in anything like the traditional manner bringing the full weight of the national armed forces to bear against an enemy without prompting charges of war crimes and efforts to intimidate individual officials with prosecutions on ersatz "war crimes" theories in fact the criminalization of traditional warfare seems to be the goal unfortunately the progressive humanitarians as they would certainly describe themselves have embarked on this campaign to criminalize warfare a kind of judicially enforced kellog briand pact without giving much thought to alternatives for ensuring the welfare and security of the civilian populations that the armed forces of states and of the u s in particular are raised and maintained to protect to the extent that terrorist combatants are given the rights of criminal defendants their ability to sustain long term hostilities and to reach their civilian targets is increased lawfare designed to delegitimize the use of american military force and the american way of war certainly has the potential to undermine public support for the war effort both at home and abroad recognizing the stakes involved the u s should be as committed to winning the lawfare battle as the ground combat in afghanistan and iraq merely defending itself in court is not enough the u s must go on both the legal and public diplomacy offensive utilizing such aggressive litigation tactics as seeking sanctions against lawyers who make frivolous arguments or violate security regulations most important the administration should strive to explain tirelessly and at the highest levels that its policies are both legal and legitimate and that it is the lawfares practitioners who are the true radicals messrs rivkin &amp casey who served in the department of
