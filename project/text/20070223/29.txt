for a college " says leon harris the academic director and english teacher at crested butte administrators at the half dozen or so snowboarding and skiing high schools claim that although some students become mountain town ski lift operators others do go to good colleges the crested butte routine is rigorous students living on campus rise at dawn for either indoor or outdoor workouts and head to the mountain for a few hours to take turns making runs doing jumps spins and board grabs as they ride down a massive half pipe ramp on another part of the slope jumps launch them feet in the
