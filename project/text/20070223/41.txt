journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources social science population explosion is no cause for panic scholar says in reply to gloomy predictions despite many doom and gloom predictions explosive growth in the worlds population isnt something to panic about says nicholas eberstadt a scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute fears that the worlds resources wouldnt be able to support the growing number of humans first emerged in the late th century in the work of thomas malthus his ideas were famously updated more than two centuries later by paul ehrlich in his book "the population bomb " mr eberstadt says the strains that malthus and others predicted from a surge in population havent materialized instead as population has increased so has most peoples standard of living the worlds population quadrupled to more than six billion during the th century a time when per capita gross domestic product almost quintupled similarly while a shortage of resources would be expected to drive up commodity prices costs actually fell in the th century how to explain the apparent paradox in mr eberstadts view enormous strides in health care and industrial production have made it possible for far greater numbers of people to thrive "healthier people are able to learn better work harder engage in gainful employment longer and contribute more to economic activity " he doesnt specifically address whether these efficiencies also would protect the environment even predictions of further rapid population growth are dubious mr eberstadt says behind the mathematical sophistication of those forecasts is a lot of guesswork about how many children people will want to have in the future in developed and less developed regions people already aim to have fewer children even in regions such as east asia and south america once beset with rapid population increases some nations birthrates are falling behind the level needed to replace existing populations the population explosion marking the th century is coming to an end in all likelihood population bomb panic soon will give way to worry about graying populations and absent immigration population decline the wilson quarterly winter management easy success can derail high achievers at work as executives approach peaks in their careers a sense of listlessness and crisis can overwhelm a certain kind of overachiever management consultant george d parsons and richard t pascale an associate fellow at oxford university call this "summit syndrome " saying it is powerful enough to derail promising careers but hard to spot in its early stages they distinguish this affliction from the more familiar ones that can occur during a fast climb up the corporate ladder such as collapses under intolerable work loads summit syndrome can happen many times in a career and it tends to afflict the most aggressive strivers people who flock to investment banks and start ups and who thrive on new challenges when those challenges are overcome "they cant or find it extremely difficult to motor along flat terrain " restlessness sets in sudoku becomes a part of office routine headhunters calls are taken taking time off to row across the atlantic ocean seems like a good idea from a companys perspective it leads to sudden unexplained departures health problems or declining performances of talented executives companies can avoid this the authors suggest by watching for those early signs through online self evaluations outside assessments or by flagging the risk of summit syndrome at leadership seminars corporations should encourage those at risk to focus on what has been the secret of their success so far and to apply those skills to the fresh challenges that come with peak performance many executives might not appreciate how much they still have to achieve such as learning to make conflict with others a manageable positive experience mentoring and coaching others and learning to shape a longer term vision for their career and lives than their rapid rise to the top has so far allowed harvard business review march health indian woman learns to see shedding light on blindness an indian woman who learned to see at the age of has upended neuroscientists beliefs about blindness and added hope to the battle against one of the developing worlds worst
