weekend journal women acting badly an adulteress an evil boss an emotional predator merissa marr on why mature flawed and powerful women are at the center of this years oscar race and next years movies judi dench has played some dark characters in her time but few have been as toxic as barbara covett in "notes on a scandal " a dour schoolteacher with a bad haircut and thick ankles ms covett describes herself as "chronically untouched" as she prowls after a younger female colleague she refers to a portly colleague as a "pig in knickers " and confides in a voiceover "lasagna tends to disagree with my bowels " ms denchs diabolical character is in good company she is one of five academy award contenders for best actress in a field dominated by women behaving badly from the bitchy fashion editor depicted by meryl streep in "the devil wears prada" to kate winslets adulterous wife in "little children " this years nominees depict women who are flawed sharp edged and often morally unattractive perhaps most uncharacteristic for hollywood three of the best actress nominees are in the aarp demographic ms streep is years old helen mirren is and ms dench is the years field is a sea change for an industry that has been criticized for relegating women to roles that are secondary docile and often younger than the academy award for best actress is nearly always reserved for something more traditional in the past years the winners have included lightweight romantics gwyneth paltrow in "shakespeare in love" heroines julia roberts in "erin brockovich" and sympathetic crusaders susan sarandon in "dead man walking" this years ladies are in a beastly league of their own starring as the powerful centerpiece of women driven movies the best actress rivals also include penelope cruz in "volver " a portrayal of a working class mother who covers up the murder of her husband by dumping him in a freezer the favorite is ms mirren who plays elizabeth ii in "the queen" she depicts a stern monarch who is determined to maintain a stiff upper lip after princess dianas death despite criticism from the british public that she was cold and unfeeling the parts reflect audiences desire for a greater sense of reality and complexity in movie roles as hollywood has struggled in recent years to draw crowds for its high budget and often formulaic "popcorn" movies audiences have shown theyre more receptive to edgier stories and unflattering characters filmmakers say they also say viewers want to see women playing roles long reserved for men that has filmmakers courting a pool of talented leading actresses many of whom came to fame in the s and s and are eager to take on more challenging characters writers are creating roles specifically for them "the queen" was developed after one of the producers noticed how much ms mirren looked like queen elizabeth ii "filmmakers are writing roles for women that dont fit into the standard boxes of romantic comedy or sidekick to the male lead " says amy israel head of production and acquisitions at paramount pictures specialty arm paramount vantage who has a number of movies starring strong aggressive females rolling out this year there have been such roles before of course in bette davis rocked hollywood with her gritty performance as an aging actress in "all about eve " ms davis was in her s and had long complained about being considered a hollywood has been the same year gloria swanson made a splash with her role as a washed up movie star in "sunset boulevard " at the ceremony kathy batess obsessive wacko in "misery" trumped ms robertss hooker with a heart of gold in "pretty woman " more recently charlize theron received a nod for her fierce prostitute turned serial killer in "monster " but rarely has there been such a concentrated group as this years oscar bunch audiences can expect to see more of the same nicole kidman and jennifer jason leigh act out a thorny relationship between sisters in "margot at the wedding " in "the other boleyn girl " natalie portman plays the ruthless and scheming anne boleyn who steals king henry viii from her pregnant sister mary viewers will also see another familiar name julie christie in "away from her " she plays a woman with alzheimers who torments her husband by falling for a wheelchair bound mute its a shift from the conventional wisdom of even a few years ago that oscar hungry actresses should play victims or heroines with unassailable morals ms winslet herself spoofed the stereotype in a guest turn in on hbos "extras " a comedy about actors behind the scenes life ms winslet figures shes a shoo in for a statue for playing a pious nun in a world war ii film "if youre doing a film about the holocaust youre guaranteed an oscar " she says later in the satire she sees a girl with cerebral palsy and advises another actor to take note "that is another way you win " the character says "daniel day lewis in my left foot oscar dustin hoffman rain man oscar " patrick marber who adapted "notes on a scandal" for the big screen says audiences are bored with the artificial perfection that hollywood has historically portrayed "audiences dont want the defanged version " he says when it came to the role of ms covett mr marber didnt hold back instead he ramped up the character from the zoe heller bestseller "shes white hot vicious " says the writer who is nominated for his screenplay ms dench didnt hold back on the physical transformation either in one scene shes shown slumped in a bath her flabby liver spotted arms rolling over the top of the tub as she draws on a cigarette ms mirren meanwhile layered on the wrinkles padding and dowdy outfits the most striking scene in "the devil wears prada" shows ms streeps character the haughty controlling and immaculately turned out editor of a fashion magazine looking haggard and devoid of makeup after learning that her latest husband wants out of the marriage ms cruz filled out her behind with padding and takes on an "ugly beautiful" appearance even ms winslets afternoon lover in "little children" describes her as having eyebrows that are too thick and a far from perfect body "babel" scribe guillermo arriaga says moviegoers are drawn to complex too human characters as their real lives become more sanitized meeting people online instead of in person for example and becoming detached from how their food is raised "people are hungry for real human experience " says the mexican born writer who is nominated for his screenplay he believes viewers still want to feel a sense of hope but theyre willing to go to "dark places" to get there other factors may have prepared viewers for imperfection the boom in reality tv shows such as "beauty and the geek " in which socially challenged men humiliate themselves in learning how to win over women has shown that unflattering characters sell the rise of dvds especially through netflix has boosted audience sophistication by making more movies available to more people and studios have perfected their indie movie marketing chops becoming adept at selling tougher material the fact that many recent women driven movies dont follow the so called feminist narrative seen in s movies such as "alice doesnt live here anymore " which portrayed strong women improving their lot in life also suggests an evolution in the female role in cinema says linda williams a professor of film studies at university of california at berkeley in "little children " for instance ms winslets character doesnt break free of her unhappy life instead she returns to it similarly ms denchs role as a scheming repressed lesbian would have been deemed politically incorrect years ago now it is simply "complex " still theres a hillary clinton aspect to these roles a more empowered female audience wants to watch empowered women interestingly men do too "these are strong powerful edgy opinionated women " says producer beau flynn "guys find that sexy " adds mr marber "men enjoy watching the active protagonist women more than the passive weepers " this years field also is a shift for female actresses who have long complained they couldnt find decent roles once they hit "the baby boom is hitting " says robert sklar professor of cinema studies at new york university "its partly demographic but this is a group that is also particularly self aware narcissistic some would say and theyre interested at looking at themselves in movies as older people " laura carstensen professor of psychology and director of the stanford center on longevity notes that an aging population is naturally more female skewed older people also look for something different in their entertainment "peoples motivation changes as they age " she says "they look for more meaning " the academy is aging as well which could work in older actresses favor still ms dench may not relish her chances against ms mirren who has walked away with the usually predictive screen actors guild award ms dench is having an operation on her knee and wont be attending the awards ceremony this weekend
