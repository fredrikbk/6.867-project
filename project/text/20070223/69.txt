report raises questions about high school courses american educators have complained about grade inflation for years but new findings suggest that u s high schools may also suffer from another type of inflation in the labeling of courses under pressure to produce graduates better prepared for college and the workplace dozens of states have stiffened high school graduation requirements in recent years pushing a broader array of students to take more years of core subjects and eliminating less rigorous lower tier courses altogether reflecting these efforts a review of high school transcripts by the staff of the national assessment of educational progress shows that high school students are taking and receiving higher grades in more college prep courses than ever yet just released test results for th graders on the naep a widely respected barometer of educational achievement known as the "nations report card " indicated that students are graduating with mediocre math skills and reading abilities that have tumbled to their lowest level since the early s the th grade tests are designed to measure the sorts of high level thinking demanded in college work the findings raise questions about whether college prep courses are as tough as their titles indicate and if so whether high schools and their instructors are adequately prepared to teach such courses to a rapidly changing mix of students u s education secretary margaret spellings expressed disappointment with the findings saying "if in fact our high school students are taking more challenging courses and earning higher grades we should be seeing greater gains in test scores " other observers said the results suggest that some school districts are teaching watered down versions of everything from history to trigonometry "a course title alone does not make rigor " said david conley a university of oregon professor who studies high school course content the naep results are likely to fuel calls for reform measures as the federal no child left behind act approaches a reauthorization debate the bush administration has proposed requiring states to conduct additional reading and math achievement tests at the high school level in december the commission on the skills of the american workforce a private group that includes former governors and cabinet secretaries from both political parties called for such radical measures as ending high school after th grade for some students and denying entry to public colleges and universities to any who cant pass so called board exams in core subjects the naep review of high school transcripts released yesterday found that of the graduating class of completed at least a midlevel college prep curriculum that included four years of english three years of math including geometry and algebra and three years of science including at least two of biology chemistry and physics in only about of seniors completed a similar curriculum the naep review also found that the class of received about more hours of instruction in high school than their counterparts and earned higher grades on a zero to four point scale the seniors had a cumulative grade point average of points or about a b up from points in but the benefits of such changes werent evident in the results of naep reading and math achievement tests for the class of on a zero to point scale their average reading score was points that was down a point from the last time the test was given and was the lowest average score since when the average was points about of the test takers scored at or above the proficient range down from in on the math side the average score was on a zero to point scale and only of the seniors were scored at or above the proficient range naep officials said results of the math test arent comparable with those from previous years because of recent changes in the exams structure and content reflecting demographic changes in society the sorts of students taking the naep test have changed significantly in recent years hispanics accounted for of all th graders in up from in the scoring gap between them and white students has changed little since since when naep began allowing accommodations such as longer testing times more english language learners are also taking the naep in they accounted for about of all seniors taking the naep reading test and posted an average score of the effect was to lower the overall average score by two points to which naep officials said was statistically significant the decline in reading abilities was not a complete surprise a recent study by act inc the nonprofit testing concern based in iowa city iowa found that only about of high school graduates who took the act test in were prepared to tackle college level reading down from in act also found a decline in reading skills through the high school years with more eighth and th graders on track for college reading than seniors "reading just drops off the radar in high school " said jon erickson acts vice president for educational services and the naep results arent the only signs that college prep courses may not be delivering all that they promise the college board the new york nonprofit that gives the sat admissions test is in the midst of a nationwide audit of its high school advanced placement program courses amid concerns that some districts arent offering college level content meanwhile a recent study by the state of maryland found that of its high school graduates who completed a college prep curriculum needed remedial math in college up from for the class of states may require students to take more upper level courses but content is still largely left up to local school boards and varies widely and few states have instituted mandatory end of course tests to measure what is actually being taught in high school classrooms or taken concrete action to ensure that high school graduation standards are aligned with what colleges and universities expect incoming freshmen to know hodan janay of boston says she earned bs during four years of high school english took a college prep literature course her senior year and passed the state english exams required to graduate "but i wasnt as ready as i thought " says the year old who is now enrolled in a remedial english course at bostons bunker hill
