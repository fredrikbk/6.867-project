uploading speeds slowly catch up uploading is getting an upgrade after years of cranking up the speed of downloading material from the internet which made it faster to surf the web and play music and videos internet service providers are finally starting to boost the speed of files moving onto the web from your personal computer the acceleration is being spurred by the rise of social networking sites like facebook and video sharing sites like youtube as a growing number of people are posting their own music and video clips online upload speeds have long been a fraction of the speed of downloads forcing most users to wait several minutes to upload a photo for example that they could download in seconds but in recent months companies have been ratcheting up their upload speeds for consumers willing to pay a bit more verizon communications inc announced recently that it would start offering upload speeds of megabits per second roughly times as fast as what its most popular dsl service offers in some markets for customers of its new fiber based network called fios verizons rivals have also been increasing their upload speeds offering special features that allow for quicker capabilities comcast corp this year began offering subscribers a temporary "turbocharge " or boost in speed which kicks in when it detects very large uploads when the powerboost feature is activated comcast subscribers can receive upload speeds of up to two megabits per second last year cablevision systems corp doubled the upload speed of its most popular high speed internet service to two megabits per second and added a premium tier of service that offered five megabit a second uploads verizons new offering costs &# a month compared with the &# a month that verizon charges fios customers in some markets for slower five megabit per second uploads but verizons service is less expensive and slower than another offering from cablevision which charges &# a month for upload speeds of megabits per second that service is intended mainly for businesses and homes that use the internet extensively at the new speeds verizons fios is offering consumers could upload photos in about seconds the same upload would take minutes over verizons most popular dsl service which offers uploads at kilobits a second verizon says a three gigabyte file such as a one hour family video shot with a high definition video camera could be uploaded in around minutes compared with more than nine hours at the slower speed the fios service offers megabits a second for downloads as well verizons announcement could prompt other phone and cable operators to more aggressively boost upload speeds until now most cable and phone companies have only incrementally raised uploads even as theyve lifted download speeds comcasts fastest upload speed for instance is available only to customers who take its more expensive high speed offerings with downloads of up to megabits a second comcast charges &# a month for that broadband service when customers subscribe to other services subscribers to comcasts lower price offerings get much slower upload speeds of either or kilobits a second though they also can get a boost up to two megabits per second at&amp t inc likewise offers an upload speed of only kilobits a second on its fastest dsl service paired with a downloading speed of six megabits a second at&amp t offers a faster upload of one megabit a second to customers in the limited areas where it sells its "u verse" tv service fast uploads appeal to a niche of web users but cable and phone companies want to accommodate them because such users are willing to pay more for the service says bruce leichtman president and principal analyst of leichtman research group in durham n h among the consumers demanding faster speeds are people working at home who want to share large files with co workers in the office telecommuters also want faster uploads because the higher speed makes videoconferencing much easier faster upload speeds will also please users of peer to peer networks which allow users to share music videos software and photos some peer to peer networks are used for sharing pirated movies verizon for one acknowledges this but says it is working with hollywood studios to look for ways to block pirating on its network high speed networks arent always as fast as promised heavy network traffic and other issues can sometimes cause delays but any speed boost at all is welcome to some customers among verizons new customers is scott shapiro a music composer for tv shows films and games who is based in westchester county n y he uses his internet connection to deliver video and large audio files to his customers he had been subscribing to cablevisions service with five megabit uploads as well as the companys cable tv service now he says he pays less than &# for verizons new service which includes tv and phone service and is slightly less than what he paid cablevision prices for both companies vary depending on the services ordered and promotions "the internet and files are only getting larger " he says "the faster the better "
