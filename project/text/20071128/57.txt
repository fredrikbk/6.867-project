ethanol craze cools as doubts multiply claims for environment energy use draw fire fighting on the farm little over a year ago ethanol was winning the hearts and wallets of both main street and wall street with promises of greater u s energy independence fewer greenhouse gases and help for the farm economy today the corn based biofuel is under siege in the span of one growing season ethanol has gone from panacea to pariah in the eyes of some the critics which include industries hurt when the price of corn rises blame ethanol for pushing up food prices question its environmental bona fides and dispute how much it really helps reduce the need for oil a recent study by the organization for economic cooperation and development concluded that biofuels "offer a cure for oil dependence that is worse than the disease " a national academy of sciences study said corn based ethanol could strain water supplies the american lung association expressed concern about a form of air pollution from burning ethanol in gasoline political cartoonists have taken to skewering the fuel for raising the price of food to the worlds poor last month an outside expert advising the united nations on the "right to food" labeled the use of food crops to make biofuels "a crime against humanity " although the u n food and agriculture organization later disowned the remark as "regrettable " the fortunes of many u s farmers farm towns and ethanol companies are tied to corn based ethanol of which america is the largest producer ethanol is also a cornerstone of president bushs push to reduce dependence on foreign oil but the once booming business has gone in the dumps with profits squeezed plans for new plants shelved in certain cases and stock prices hovering near week lows now the fuels lobby is pleading with congress to drastically boost the amount of ethanol that oil refiners must blend into gasoline but formidable opponents such as the livestock packaged food and oil industries also have lawmakers ears what once looked like a slam dunk could now languish in pending energy legislation that might not pass for weeks if ever ethanols problems have much to do with its past success as profits and production soared in and so did the price of corn gradually angering livestock farmers who need it for feed they allied with food companies also stung by higher grain prices and with oil companies that have long loathed subsidies for ethanol production the u s gives oil refiners an excise tax credit of cents for every gallon of ethanol they blend into gasoline and even though its the oil industry that gets this subsidy the industry dislikes being forced to use a nonpetroleum product the u s ethanol industry is further protected by a cent tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol ethanol prices peaked at about &# a gallon in some markets in june according to oil price information service the price soon began to slide as the limited market for gasoline containing ethanol grew saturated new plants kept coming online increasing supply and dropping prices further today the oil refiners that purchase ethanol to blend in need pay only about &# a gallon for it the low ethanol prices help some oil refiners "id pay a hell of a lot more for ethanol than i am right now im getting a windfall because its priced so much less than its value to me " lynn westfall chief economist for refiner tesoro corp told investors recently the ethanol tax credit will bring refiners an estimated &# billion this year some oil companies use ethanol to stretch gasoline supplies or meet state requirements to make gasoline burn more cleanly ethanol thats voluntarily blended into gasoline reached a high this month according to the energy information administration the low prices reflect soaring output global ethanol production has grown to a projected billion gallons this year from billion gallons in according to the international energy agency the u s production is more than half of that total or about seven billion gallons this year up in two years it equals less than of u s gasoline consumption analysts expect u s production capacity to keep growing encouraged both by high oil prices and by the hope that congress will stiffen the mandate for refiners to use ethanol some observers regard the profit squeeze as part of an ordinary industry shakeout that will ultimately leave the best producers in a position to thrive as ethanol prices were pushed lower and corn prices stayed high ethanol profit margins dropped from &# per gallon last year to less than cents a gallon this year even as the production glut was driving down ethanols price critics and opposing lobbyists were turning up the heat environmentalists complained about increased use of water and fertilizer to grow corn for ethanol and said even ethanol from other plants such as switchgrass could be problematic because it could mean turning protected land to crop use suddenly environmentalists energy experts economists and foreign countries were challenging the warm and fuzzy selling points on which ethanol rose to prominence "our love affair with ethanol has finally ended because weve taken off the makeup and realized that lo and behold its actually a fuel " with environmental and various other drawbacks says kevin book an analyst at friedman billings ramsey group inc against all the criticism and lobbying "were david in this fight " says bob dinneen the ethanol industrys top lobbyist mr dinneen says the industry has been made a scapegoat for food price increases that are due to many factors including higher oil prices and growing overseas demand for grain he also faults the lack of a mature u s distribution network that would make it easier for consumers to get ethanol his group called the renewable fuels association and the national corn growers association have formed a coalition to "unify the voices" in the ethanol community he says back in early president bush gave ethanol a boost in his state of the union speech by calling for "strong funding" of renewable energy energy legislation that summer required oil companies to blend a total of billion gallons of "renewable" fuels into the nations fuel supply by the legislation also effectively extinguished ethanols chief competitor as a clean burning additive methyl tertiary butyl ether which had groundwater pollution issues the bill anointed ethanol as the default additive and instantly created demand nearly double what was produced that year "that was when the floodgates started coming open " says attorney dan rogers of the atlanta law firm king &amp spalding llp which arranges financing for ethanol plants hedge funds private equity investors and east coast bankers started pouring money into ethanol producers such as verasun energy corp and pacific ethanol inc went public mr dinneen the lobbyist hopscotched the country attending ribbon cuttings at new plants that popped up in corn growing states local farmers whod invested soon were cashing handsome dividend checks even as new demand pushed up the price of corn after languishing roughly in the &# a bushel range for three decades corn jumped to above &# early in so far this year its averaging &# in the past livestock farmers supported ethanol because it was good for the overall farm economy but now they began to complain that the higher corn price cut sharply into their profits a meat producer trade group called the american meat institute took a stand against federal support for biofuels last december joined soon after by the national turkey federation and the national cattlemens beef association the farm fissure widened when livestock meat and poultry groups started coordinating their lobbying with the oil industry in discussions helped along by former texas congressman charles stenholm who now lobbies for both industries packaged food companies too began pushing back as one after another blamed biofuels effect on grain costs for hurting earnings in june dean foods co h j heinz co kellogg co nestle usa pepsico inc and coca cola co sent a letter to senators saying that requiring greater use of ethanol would affect their "ability to produce competitively available affordable food " ethanols opponents also began to highlight reasons why ethanol might not be such a boon to the environment citing some recent research studies one by the national research council said additional ethanol production could strain water supplies and impair water quality a spring report by the environmental protection agency said that "ozone levels generally increase with increased ethanol use " a study coauthored by nobel prize winning chemist paul crutzen said corn ethanol might exacerbate climate change as the added fertilizer used to grow corn raised emissions of a very potent greenhouse gas called nitrous oxide the ethanol industry replies to that one with an energy department study concluding that use of ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by to on a per gallon basis provided that coal isnt used to run ethanol plants opponents of ethanol also have hammered on an agriculture department projection that by less than of the u s gasoline supply will come from corn based ethanol and of the corn crop will be used to make it that suggests to some that the tradeoff between food and fuel is unbalanced at the same time some foreign countries have been increasingly questioning ethanol mexico blamed it in part for contributing to rising prices of corn based tortillas china barred new biofuel plants from using corn and malaysia trimmed its biofuels production mandates cuban president fidel castro has called using food crops for fuel a "sinister idea " president hugo chavez of venezuela ordered troops to secure his oil producing nations grain supplies saying corn was to be used for food not fuel the government of quebec which has offered loan guarantees for corn ethanol plants recently decided not to initiate any new ones instead it will turn its attention to so called cellulosic ethanol which would be made from switchgrass wood chips or other plant matter it concluded that "the environmental costs of corn ethanol are higher than expected " says a spokesman for the provinces minister of natural resources in recent months u s lawmakers appear to have become more receptive to the anti ethanol arguments "people never thought they would have to make a trade between energy security and food security " says jesse sevcik a lobbyist for the ethanol opposing american meat institute the ethanol industry accustomed to getting its way in washington hadnt faced such opposition before it may not have helped that mr dinneen in a close echo of former vice president spiro agnews famous line for months brushed off his foes as "nattering nabobs of negativity " mr dinneen says arguments about ethanol driving up food costs are overblown in part because corn farmers will produce so much grain that corn prices will ease but even though u s farmers this year planted their biggest crop since world war ii prices have stayed well above &# a bushel thanks to rising demand in developing countries and poor weather in some grain growing nations the price is expected to stay well above &# next year as farmers shift some land from corn to two other crops whose prices have risen sharply wheat and soybeans new and bigger ethanol plants spurred by money from investors far from the corn belt have contributed to production capacity thats expected to approach billion gallons next year but annual u s demand stands at just under billion gallons so its easy to see why the industry supports the senate version of pending energy legislation which includes a requirement that gasoline blenders use billion gallons of renewable fuels by up to billion gallons of this would come from corn based ethanol the rest would come from cellulosic ethanol an industry that now barely exists or other fuels a similar bill passed in the house has no such provision mr dinneen who has been lobbying on ethanol so long hes known as the "reverend of renewable fuels " says hes "reasonably confident" congress will raise the ethanol mandate he says hes talking with the military labor groups southern black churches and others about how ethanol can help them "weve got to build the biggest baddest coalition we can "
