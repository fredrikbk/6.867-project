business dividend cut shouldnt be death sentence like human heartbeats corporate dividends are meant to indicate steady health so when payouts look precarious investors tend to tremble a case in point freddie mac which last week posted a &# billion third quarter loss and said it was preparing to halve its dividend its stock skidded that day anne mulcahy chief executive of xerox corp offers a veterans perspective on financial crises and the way out her color printer company reinstated its quarterly dividend last week after a six year stoppage that started in the year she took office for xerox reviving the dividend is the equivalent of climbing out of a hospice bed and resuming normal life ms mulcahy didnt set out to be a turnaround specialist she built her career in xeroxs sales department during the companys boom days but as the boss of an ailing business she learned a lot fast her perspective shared in an interview this week may be relevant to ceos in industries like banking and home building which face financial binds today among her key points heed outsiders early warnings of a looming cash squeeze prioritize spending needs and accept that dividends mightnt top the list get ready for a new set of shareholders once the payout goes and dont rush to reinstate the dividend until your recovery is rock solid trouble can start with a management fixation on growth and earnings ms mulcahy warns especially if its paired with a belief that cash will always be ample "that was common thinking in the late s " she says when conditions sour gung ho spending plans can become lethal matters get worse if companies assume that early signs of trouble such as ratings downgrades or clampdowns by lenders reflect outsiders wrong headed pessimism maybe the skeptics are right besides even if prospects arent clear outsiders doubts can rapidly become self fulfilling as ms mulcahy puts it "things that look like they arent problems suddenly become problems you hit debt performance triggers that require you to think differently everything is about tightening up and before long you start looking for sources of cash to avoid bankruptcy " at such junctures some executives get paralyzed or they slash essential costs and sell units cheaply rather than accept the humiliation of jettisoning the dividend even ms mulcahy tried trimming xeroxs dividend for a few quarters before omitting the payout entirely a halfway approach that didnt work "i wish i could say that the partial cut was someone elses idea " she says "but it wasnt as xeroxs financial plight worsened ms mulcahy decided to protect only two areas no matter what one was research and development in hopes of improving xeroxs product mix the other involved direct contact with customers everything else was fair game in that climate it didnt take long to scrap the dividend when dividends vanish so do many longtime shareholders they may feel betrayed they may just want to salvage a few dollars from an investment that they fear could head to zero but new breeds of investors take their place these are bargain hunters who believe a turnaround is possible no matter how ugly the business looks these holders may embrace managements plans or they may agitate for a different agenda they arent the easiest holders to work with but if management can spell out a recovery plan and make it happen such holders can help a stock rally to respectability xeroxs comeback strategy involved major layoffs and refocusing the business on color printing rather than the traditional highly competitive copier business by and signs of a partial recovery were clear ms mulcahy thought about reviving the dividend but decided to wait "it was important to get the companys credit rating back to investment grade " she recalls "we also wanted to build enough cash that we could consider acquisitions again " she didnt want hasty dividend action that might dissipate xeroxs gains also she says "we didnt ever want to go through a dividend cut again " xeroxs new quarterly dividend cents a share is less than the cents it paid in its heyday the stock at around &# a share remains far below its high of &# though it is up fourfold from its lows the company has also whittled back some of its old ambitions still employees and customers see the revived payout as a sign it is back on its feet in the next month or two directors at many beleaguered financial companies will take a hard look at dividends thanks to battered stock prices washington mutual is yielding a level so high that wall street analysts have been predicting a dividend cut wamu says only that directors routinely review dividend policy todays financial heavyweights might pull through with dividends intact but basic finance and legal covenants require that when times get tough senior creditors get paid first ms mulcahy learned that in when she renegotiated xeroxs &# billion line of credit with banks winning badly needed financial breathing room "it helped that we were focused on cash and restructuring the business aggressively " she recalls "the dividend action gave us extra credibility it would have been unacceptable to still be paying a dividend "
