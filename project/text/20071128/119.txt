samsungs image may face new bruise south korea to begin bribery probe adding to conglomerates woes seoul south korea until recently investors in samsung electronics co have been most concerned about the sharp downturn in the companys core chip business likely to hit earnings for much of next year now there is another looming concern a potential bribery and accounting scandal involving the entire samsung group the largest conglomerate in south korea yesterday shares of of the listed samsung companies including flagship samsung electronics plunged the reason south korean president roh moo hyun signed legislation triggering a government investigation of the conglomerate that could take months analysts expect the investigation along with a separate investigation started earlier this month by the nations top prosecutors to distract samsung and perhaps damage the image of its various companies and products the news and the related drop in samsungs share value yesterday came just as big investors and market analysts were arriving here for an annual conference with executives where investors immediately asked questions about the downturn in the memory chip business which is the steepest since chu woosik the companys investor relations chief said samsung wouldnt increase capital spending on memory chips next year though he said a final spending level hasnt been set "will it be lower or flattish is still to be decided " mr chu said at the conference "we have no intention of flooding the market with capacity " memory chip prices have fallen at a faster than usual rate this year because manufacturers added so much new capacity samsung just last month increased its spending for the remainder of this year on chip factories and capacity startling some investors mr chu said the company expects that with capital spending slowing down across the memory industry demand will catch up to supply next year and ease the pressure on prices for memory chips meanwhile the unfolding bribery drama shows how samsung electronics known around the world mainly as a maker of chips television sets and cellphones and its corporate cousins have a second role in south korean society the samsung companies are the countrys biggest corporate citizens objects of pride and envy subjected to intense scrutiny that few other companies face "people want to know the truth of the allegations implicating the nations largest conglomerate " mr roh said at a news conference it is too early to tell whether investigators will uncover serious wrongdoing the chief accuser a former samsung group attorney has revealed little evidence to back up the allegations of wrongdoing that he laid out over several news conferences earlier this month the former attorney says samsung paid bribes via special accounts set up in the names of certain executives transferred money from various business units into the accounts and covered up the practice with help from outside attorneys and accountants samsung group representatives have issued detailed rebuttals and said its various companies and executives will cooperate with investigators in an interview yesterday mr chu said he doesnt expect the investigations to have an immediate effect particularly on planning and executive transitions that typically occur at the end of the year at the electronics company but he said he does worry about the potential fallout on samsungs image at the investor conference he said "let me assure you theres nothing to worry about we will do whatever is needed to raise the competitiveness of the company " much of south koreas wealth is concentrated in just a few dozen large conglomerates known as chaebol such as the samsung group watchdog groups and reform minded politicians occasionally put pressure on the groups leading to investigations and prosecutions but major changes to the system have been difficult to implement in part because other parts of south korean society rely heavily on their largesse the vast majority of which is spread legitimately samsung group which includes publicly traded companies and an additional smaller affiliates is led by lee kun hee son of its founder and now south koreas wealthiest man for several years public scrutiny focused on lee kun hees efforts to transfer control of the group to his son because the family owns only a small stake directly the fall in the memory chip business the companys largest by revenue and usually its biggest profit contributor has led to a drop in samsung electronics shares since the beginning of the year the benchmark korea composite stock price index or kospi meanwhile is up almost for the year the split is unusual because investors have long considered samsung a proxy for the country
