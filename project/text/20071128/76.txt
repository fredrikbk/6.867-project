israelis palestinians agree to talks olmert abbas set launch of peace sessions dec with all issues on table annapolis md israeli and palestinian leaders agreed to begin formal peace talks for the first time in seven years as president bush put his credibility behind efforts aimed at ending the enduring conflict the two sides remain far from an accord at a much anticipated conference hosted by the white house at the u s naval academy here they failed to agree on a joint statement outlining their disputes still israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas declared they would "make every effort" to reach a final peace agreement by the end of beginning with the launching of formal talks slated for dec mr bush flanked by the two leaders read a limited declaration in which messrs olmert and abbas also promised that "vigorous ongoing and continuous negotiations" wouldnt shy from addressing "all outstanding issues including all core issues" to their conflict there would be no exceptions the declaration said when he finished reading the statement mr bush symbolically bridged a handshake between the two leaders before simultaneously clasping each mans hand they were images reminiscent of efforts by previous u s presidents to forge middle east peace and marked a departure for a president who had previously been reluctant to gamble his influence or credibility on middle east peace standing before delegates gathered from about nations and international organizations mr bush pledged to israelis and palestinians "to devote my effort during my time as president to do all i can to help you achieve this ambitious goal " he also said "i give you my personal commitment to support your work with the resources and resolve of the american government " yet beyond relaunching peace talks mr bush offered little new and the depth of american involvement remains unclear the formal talks will include only israelis and palestinians without the participation of any third party at least thus far diplomats said mr bush made no specific promise to help them bridge their historic differences "america will do everything in our power to support their quest for peace " he said "but we cannot achieve it for them " some arab leaders in attendance expressed cautious optimism but made it clear they expected more "it is absolutely necessary to establish an international follow up mechanism that monitors progress in the negotiations among the parties as well as the implementation of commitments made " said saud al faisal the saudi arabian foreign minister for israelis the thorniest issue is dividing jerusalem which both sides consider to be their capital and control over its holy sites palestinians are most focused on the status of refugees in from what is now israel and their descendants whose "right of return" to israel has been a staple of palestinian nationalist rhetoric for six decades when mr olmert and mr abbas spoke their rhetoric was little changed from previous positions staked on those and other thorny issues yet both men sounded chords of hope mr olmert said that while the process will be "extremely difficult " it also carries the inevitability of history mr abbas called for an end to the cycle of violence and israeli occupation of the west bank adding that it was time "for us to look at the future together with confidence and hope " mr bush also made clear that he views the effort as a way to turn back what his administration sees as a rising tide of extremism across the middle east much of it allegedly backed by iran that was another departure from his administrations previous stance "were here because we understand that the success of these efforts to achieve peace between israelis and palestinians will have an impact far beyond the holy land " mr bush said to that end the fact that the syrian government long a pariah to the bush administration was in attendance yesterday was seen as crucial but the syrians kept a decidedly low profile they are hoping to simultaneously launch formal peace talks on the return of the golan heights land first conquered by israel in a syrian diplomat said inclusion of the issue on the agenda of the conferences closed sessions could "be a stepping stone " but the official also said his government wasnt expecting any dramatic breakthroughs this week messrs olmert and abbas will meet today with mr bush at the white house jay solomon contributed to this article
