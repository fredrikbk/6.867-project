mr trump strongly defends his good name a recent article written about me "stalled condo projects tarnish trumps name " marketplace nov was one of the most ridiculous i have read in many years few have done better than donald trump at building and selling apartments in recent times and inarguably the trump brand generates a substantial price per square foot premium on saleable real estate relative to market i have had tremendous successes with massive projects and yet you focused your story on two small jobs both of which are licensing deals the unit ft lauderdale las olas project which we decided not to go forward with because the market isnt strong and the tampa building which sold out once and partially sold out a second time because the developers for whatever reason have been unable to build trump international hotel &amp tower ft lauderdale which isnt mentioned is much more substantial and construction is topped out with sales going very well you chose not to focus on other much larger buildings and developments for example the trump international hotel &amp tower las vegas the tallest building in that city owned and developed largely by me this building is one of the most successful condominiums in the u s with sales well over &# billion and costs of &# million it is completely sold out with closings to begin in february nor did you focus on my project in cap cana in the dominican republic where &# million in sales have been achieved with of the estate lots being sold out in less than one day my tower in waikiki was sold out with &# million in sales in less than five hours a record this building is largely owned by me and being developed by me at trump world tower the tallest residential building in the world which faces the united nations and which is developed by me a &# million apartment was sold just last week and total sales close to &# million were completed trump park avenue at th street and park avenue also owned by me has had sales of over &# million and has been a resounding success on all levels as my chicago building will be which with two years to go until completion is already sold these are enviable figures that go along with enviable locations instead you mention a tiny job in ft lauderdale thats being held off until the market improves and another relatively small job in tampa thats been sold twice both of which are licensing deals and for which i am not responsible for development in spite of the many daily trade publications including yours that are constantly referring to this as one of the worst credit crunches in years and in an environment when no developers are getting financing for their jobs we have successfully secured financing within the last three months for our trump international hotel &amp tower in toronto trump soho and trump international hotel &amp tower in panama those facts are a testament to the strength of the trump name and brand within the financial community donald j trump new york
