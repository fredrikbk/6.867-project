ask personal journal q shortly after my son was born a friend bought a savings bond for him in his name because he didnt know my sons social security number he had his own social security number put on the bond do i need to get this corrected now or do i deal with this when it matures bill behr fort worth texas a you probably wont need to do anything since the treasury wont update the bond if the only change is to fix the social security number when it comes time to redeem the bond the financial institution will use the social security number of whoever is redeeming it for tax purposes in order to redeem the bond you have to be named as an owner or co owner under most circumstances but since the social security number and the bond serial number can be used to track it consider making photocopies of the bond to have the numbers handy in case you lose the bond says tom adams author of "savings bond advisor " we answer readers questions on personal finance send them to personaljournal wsj com
