financial firms capital depleted hunt for cash citigroup board spurns overture about merger gets abu dhabi money as citigroup inc was dealing with billions of dollars in mortgage related losses and the departure of chief executive charles prince it got an unexpected call from a prominent investment banker suggesting a merger with bank of america corp citigroups board dismissed the informal approach "totally out of hand " and no discussions have taken place says a person familiar with the matter "when youre looking for a ceo thats no time for a transaction " this person says bank of america says it never authorized a formal overture to citigroup citigroups board meanwhile gave a green light to a smaller transaction a &# billion capital infusion from an investment arm of the abu dhabi government in exchange the abu dhabi investment authority will receive a stake in the form of convertible stock more broadly the abu dhabi deal shows that after years of doling out money to corporate clients and consumers financial companies now need some fresh cash of their own faced with massive losses linked to the subprime mortgage crisis and accompanying credit crunch several of the nations financial institutions from wall street investment firms to bond insurers are assessing their need for new sources of capital and they are likely to intensify their fledgling efforts in coming months amid signs that they could face billions of dollars in additional losses as the mortgage market fallout persists "its a bitter pill to swallow to admit that the problems in the market have reached the point that companies that traditionally could fund themselves now need external sources of capital " says david honold who invests in financial stocks at turner investment partners in berwyn pa of course one way to tap external capital is to merge operations the merger boom that fizzled out this summer was driven by cheap and plentiful financing in the debt markets and a booming stock market with credit increasingly tight and the stock market looking shakier wall street may now see a round of opportunistic deal making bank of america based in charlotte n c has long been one of the most opportunistic acquirers in the banking industry in the past couple of years it has scooped up retail bank fleetboston financial corp credit card issuer mbna corp wealth management firm u s trust co and most recently lasalle bank this wasnt the first time citigroup received an overture involving bank of america it got a feeler from the bank several months ago according to a person familiar with the matter the latest one though was quickly disavowed "bank of america did not authorize any investment banker to approach any company over the last six weeks " a bank of america spokesman said citigroup declined to comment a deal with citigroup would have marked the culmination of bank of america chairman and ceo kenneth d lewiss quest to make his company the undisputed titan in american banking the year old mr lewis who has spent his career at bank of america has long complained that the company doesnt get the respect it deserves from wall street and new york banks bank of america recently surpassed new york based citigroup to become the biggest u s bank by market value a longtime goal for mr lewis to be sure investment bankers and other representatives for companies often approach potential merger partners and it is hard to ascertain how serious mr lewis and his management would be about such a deal all the major banks would be particularly sensitive to these sorts of overtures following the ouster of merrill lynch &amp co ceo stan oneal earlier this month mr oneal was forced out of merrill in the wake of disastrous quarterly results unexpected write downs and an unauthorized approach to wachovia corp about a potential merger a combined citigroup and bank of america would have had to shed most of citigroups u s branches and its &# billion in consumer deposits to stay under a regulatory cap that bars any u s bank from an acquisition that would give it more than of the nations total bank deposits together citigroup and bank of america with its &# billion in deposits as of june would have had nearly of the u s total bank of america alone holds one incentive for citigroup to do a deal with bank of america would be to fill its leadership void now that mr prince has stepped down the banks board is searching for a new ceo but there is a paucity of senior bank executives with the experience to deal with the current credit crisis mr lewis is well regarded in the industry despite bank of americas recent stumbles in its effort to build an investment bank citigroups board is continuing to review outside candidates for the banks top job the leading internal candidate is vikram pandit a former morgan stanley executive who joined citigroup earlier this year mr pandit who was recently named to oversee citigroups investment banking and alternative investments operations has a strong ally in robert rubin the longtime adviser who became chairman of the board when mr prince stepped down earlier this month however a person familiar with the matter says the citigroup board would be unlikely to view a merger with bank of america favorably thats because the events of the past few months have shown that citigroup is already unwieldy and difficult to manage and combining it with another giant would make it even more so citigroup in its pursuit of fresh capital has opted to look overseas where government investment arms known as sovereign wealth funds are bulging with cash the transaction with the abu dhabi government was aimed at shoring up investor confidence and the massive banks capital levels which had fallen below its targeted rate in the third quarter for the first time in years in exchange for the capital infusion citigroup will pay a pricey in interest annually to the abu dhabi investment authority the deal may have modestly assuaged citigroup investors who have seen the banks shares slump for months yesterday the stock rose cents or to &# an influx of fresh capital can often be bad news for existing stockholders because such deals typically dilute earnings still for citigroup investors are "most concerned about getting stability and allowing the company to run their business and hopefully get beyond this mess " says david easthope senior analyst at celent a boston financial research and consulting firm the move by citigroup came weeks after mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac announced plans to issue preferred shares to shore up their capital as a wave of mortgage defaults spread from subprime loans to the traditional loans that the two companies guarantee between them fannie and freddie own or guarantee a combined &# trillion of u s home mortgages or nearly half the total outstanding earlier this month fannie mae priced a &# million preferred stock issue which followed another preferred stock issue several weeks earlier freddie mac which said yesterday it was selling preferred stock to raise up to &# billion said the sale will consist of "a larger offering of nonconvertible noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a substantially smaller offering of convertible noncumulative perpetual preferred stock " freddie mac said it expects to price both offerings soon three months ago countrywide financial corp facing a funding crisis of its own turned to bank of america for help the bank pumped &# billion into the nations no mortgage lender in exchange for convertible preferred stock yielding annually "what companies are doing is trying to find ways to get some money to harbor this short term liquidity freeze " says eric fitzwater senior analyst at snl financial a charlottesville va research firm that focuses on the financial services industry bond insurers whose businesses reputations and share prices have been hit hard in recent weeks by rising defaults on u s subprime mortgages and a flood of downgrades of collateralized debt obligations securities backed by pools of mortgages or other assets are also trying to raise fresh cash the companies which guarantee payment of interest and principal in the event of default by a bond issuer are considering everything from debt offerings to issuing hybrid securities to buying reinsurance that could reduce risk and relieve the stress on their balance sheets two of them ambac financial group and mbia inc have lost more than half of their market value in recent months over concerns that potential losses in their portfolios of risky mortgage related cdos would erode their capital bases so much that they would lose their coveted triple a credit ratings last week cifg holding inc a private bond insurer that rating agencies had recently named as the most imperiled of the triple a rated guarantors announced it was getting a &# billion capital injection from the controlling shareholders of its french parent in the form of a convertible bond reinsurance and long term debt the new funding which doubled cifgs capital increased the pressure on its peers to shore up their own finances financial guaranty insurance co has been talking with its investors including private equity firms blackstone group inc and cypress group about how much capital it could tap to support its triple a rating while mbia has been fielding offers of capital from existing investors and hedge funds according to people familiar with the matter valerie bauerlein contributed to this
