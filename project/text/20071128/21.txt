business bookshelf will work for fodder punching in by alex frankel collins pages &# the summer before alex frankel started college he met a kayak instructor who regaled him with tales of battling the elements and testing his limits adventures that the kayaker experienced not while careening through white water rapids but while delivering packages for united parcel service the stories stuck with mr frankel now as did the mans account of how time motion researchers from ups spent days measuring and recording his every action on the job long after graduating from brown the university mr frankel decided on a whim to take a temp job at brown as ups sometimes calls itself or rather not on a whim at school mr frankel studied "modern culture and media " among other things and went on to become a "writer and brand observer " according to his web site he has written for wired and fast company published "wordcraft" about the coining of brand names and started a consulting company so when he took a job helping ups drivers deliver packages during the christmas rush a few years ago he wasnt just another free lance writer hoping to make a little extra cash mr frankels rationale was a bit grander than that he needed to satisfy "a deep seated curiosity an urge to understand the commercial world that surrounds us by interacting with it in an all encompassing way to experience firsthand what it felt like to be part of an interconnected global workforce by becoming a piece of it " at least thats the explanation he gives in "punching in " mr frankels account of his brief stint at ups and one all encompassing firsthand experience of the interconnected global work force leading to another and possibly to a book contract at an enterprise rent a car office a gap clothing store a starbucks coffee shop and an apple computer store there is something faintly comical about seeing an "undercover reporter" venture into the unfamiliar land of the hourly wage adopting the local dress e g the green starbucks apron and recording the exotic folkways he finds at the apple store you sell by not appearing to sell when mr frankel tells us in the opening chapter of "punching in " that the first ups driver he works with is "of samoan descent " one suspects that a devilish margaret mead parody is afoot but he is very much in earnest certainly more in earnest than he was when dissembling to potential employers about why he wanted a job and why did he want these jobs aside from a chance to interact with the commercial world in an all encompassing way etc mr frankel hoped to find out how companies with distinctive brands and strong corporate cultures mold their "front line" employees on this score he claims to have gleaned important insights ups with its uniforms "on the job lingo" a barcode scanner is a "delivery information acquisition device " or diad and gung ho approach to delivering packages inspires an almost military style loyalty in its employees who march into the world as eager ambassadors of the ups brand mr frankel felt "a whiff of the spirit of adventure" at ups unlike his experience in "the more constrained environments" of starbucks enterprise and gap at starbucks the company urges its coffee making baristas to make customers feel welcome an enforced coziness decried by mr frankel because it puts "a human face on what might otherwise be viewed as a bland monopolistic globalizing corporation " he complains that enterprises indoctrination of new employees is "cultlike " drumming into them the false promise of promotion to the executive ranks while blurring the fact that they are "chiefly insurance salespeople" whose primary duty is to "bully" customers into signing up for the maximum collision damage coverage and gaps tepid sales in recent years had a deleterious effect on workers mr frankel says "if the product a company sold was neither interesting nor compelling to consumers " he writes "then the company could do little to halt boredom dejection and lack of enthusiasm from swelling into the employee ranks " after those disappointments mr frankel seems grateful to land a job in an apple store just as the companys exquisite designs make customers sigh apple practices a cool approach to retail work that made the author swoon "you got to hang out share your knowledge learn and stay current with cutting edge technology i was precariously close to being myself and customers were sure to pick up on that and respond accordingly " however high flown his mission and immediate his experience mr frankels observations are of course essentially meaningless a few days or weeks spent in a low level job might result in lots of impressions but such forays simply cannot produce much informed analysis no prizes for guessing how peeved a book publishing company would be if an undercover reporter took a job there as a receptionist collected a couple of paychecks and then emerged with a critique of its business practices and mr frankels criticisms dont exactly draw blood a child could have told him that thousands of enterprise employees couldnt all become vice presidents and maybe the dejection of gap workers has less to do with company revenue than the tedium of endlessly folding clothes that have been manhandled by customers mr frankel certainly hated doing it luckily though workplaces are inherently interesting and pulling back the curtain even a little as mr frankel does reveals plenty of engaging material he is an able reporter though hardly flawless "some one million people hear muzak music each day " he tells us missing the mark by million anyone who has ever marveled at starbucks baristas ability to keep complicated drink orders straight will be grateful to learn that mr frankel during his training period was "sent home with a set of dice stamped with different drinks and modifiers one throw might yield tall mocha add syrup caf " even when he fails to land a job mr frankel has something worthwhile to relate as when he describes applying to work at a container store prospective employees about a dozen at a time are called in for a group interview which includes an exercise that involves selecting a few items in the store and talking about them with the rest of the group a process clearly designed to identify the few applicants who are passionate about neatness and organizing a certain winnowing process can also be usefully applied to "punching in " by all means savor the reporting on offer but dont put too much stock in the big picture conclusions in other words take the sort of approach thats recommended for reading "coming of age in samoa " mr lasswell is the journals deputy books editor
