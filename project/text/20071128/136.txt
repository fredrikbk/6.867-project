verizons opening move and you verizon wirelesss decision to open up its network will likely mean more choices for gadget shoppers in many parts of the world buying a cellphone involves a trip to an electronics store where consumers can pick whatever phone they want then they figure out which cellphone service provider theyd like to use not so in the u s where cellphone companies long have exercised an iron grip on what phones were offered in the marketplace consumers first have to pick their cellphone carrier and then buy the phone at heavily subsidized prices from the carrier that has limited both the array of phones available in the u s and the features on the phones in recent months a growing chorus of players consumers regulators and big companies striving to break into mobile communications have sought to break down the existing system google inc has led the way unveiling an alliance of cellphone companies tech companies and handset makers this month to make new software available free of charge to power mobile phones google also pressured regulators to join the crusade not all the details are yet clear but verizon wirelesss move will likely mark a turning point in the long push to open the u s wireless industry what does verizons announcement mean for cellphone users consumers will be able to buy cellphones and other mobile devices sold by companies other than verizon and use them on verizons network it also means consumers will be able to get special features and applications on their phones not offered by verizon when will this go into effect it should go into effect in mid how much is it likely to cost to buy a phone from an electronics store rather than a carrier verizon isnt offering any estimates but because verizon now subsidizes the cost of the phones it sells consumers buying elsewhere may pay a lot more the cost may range dramatically from inexpensive phones for less than &# to top of the line multimedia phones for &# will i be able to use an old cellphone from another carrier like at&amp t on verizons network not necessarily u s cellphone carriers each operate on one of two different technical standards verizon and sprint use cdma technology while at&amp t uses gsm the standard used in most of the world phones built to run on cdma cant operate on gsm so an old at&amp t phone for instance couldnt be used on verizons network but it is possible an old sprint phone could work on verizons network will i be able to buy the iphone and use it on verizons network not in its current form the iphone runs on a gsm network verizon uses cdma technology unless apple inc comes up with a new cdma phone iphone users will be out of luck will the new plan mean that i can use my verizon phone in more places overseas not unless more manufacturers introduce handsets with chips that run on gsm technology which is used in many nations outside the u s as well as cdma technology which verizon uses some handset makers are starting to make these dual mode phones but they are still fairly rare will verizons cellphone plans cost as much if im using a phone i bought elsewhere verizon is staying mum on pricing but some analysts expect the company to charge more verizons announcement talks about allowing outside "applications" on phones using the verizon network what does that mean currently verizon decides which software applications like gaming and music services it will allow on phones using its network that has meant some applications designed by independent software developers havent been available on a verizon cellphone verizons announcement changes that now any application that meets a new set of technical standards will be allowed on cellphones using verizons network opening the gates to more services what sort of applications could become available as a result of that change depending on how much leeway verizon decides to give developers in drafting its standards consumers could use verizons network to access a greater number of mobile video and music services electronic books payment and banking services and location based services that give the user information specific to where they are developers could charge for their services or offer them free with advertising verizon mentioned home appliances in its announcement what are they talking about verizon says its new policy will allow for unlimited innovation in linking devices and software to its network they cite examples such as a digital camera being linked to a wireless network so that images could be uploaded to a web page immediately do other u s carriers have the same approach no other large cellphone operators in the u s like at&amp t inc sell select devices with approved features through their own retail outlets and occasionally through a few partners are there any drawbacks to using the outside devices or hardware verizons customer service wont support the new features that means consumers will be left to troubleshoot with the makers of individual devices or software verizon talks about devices that meet "minimum technical standards " how stringent are those standards likely to be and will most current devices likely make the grade verizon insists its standards arent overly strict and says its goal is simply to be sure that no new applications or hardware will introduce bugs that could affect other customers does verizon intend to go the other way too and unlock phones that you buy from them to make them available to work on other networks customers can already take phones they buy at verizon and activate them on sprint which uses the same cdma technology though certain features may not be supported by sprint jessica e vascellaro and sara silver contributed to this article
