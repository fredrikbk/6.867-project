nexcen scouts for beaten brands plenty of retailers restaurants and consumer brands have headed down the wrong track thats where bob dloren founder and chief executive of nexcen brands inc sees potential new york based nexcen over the past year has scooped up fast food and retail franchises and consumer products brands where it sees turnaround potential at a bargain price already its collection includes athletes foot sneaker shops maggiemoos ice cream parlors bill blass fashions and waverly home goods among others nexcen acquires the intellectual property of its brands leaving the capital risks to franchisees and licensees who provide a stream of guaranteed fees that grows as nexcen adds new acquisitions wall street is a bit skeptical of the companys business model and its ability to secure financing but the year old mr dloren who created nexcen in by merging his investment bank ucc capital corp with a defunct wireless provider to reap a tax benefit said "i believe this model is going to become more familiar as all kinds of businesses seek to minimize and transfer risk " mr dloren sees opportunities everywhere for example he points out that an ice cream parlors business cools when the summer ends yet it pays rent all year thus he plans to offer warmer snacks for colder weather anybody familiar with the athletic sneaker industry knows mall based chains do a poor job of catering to local tastes and staying on top of trends he says and dont get him started about apparel manufacturers which have long accepted the risk that their fashions will be marked down by department stores or even returned unsold "thats a difficult way to operate a business " mr dloren says yet being state of the art can have its downside mr dloren insists the financing for his companys smallish acquisitions less than &# million each is immune to the credit markets because it is backed by nexcens fixed and predictable inflow of fees but skittish investors still fled nexcen shares during this falls credit crunch and while mr dloren says nexcens brand collecting strategy is "actually very simple " analysts say its moving parts are increasingly daunting to explain to investors who dont know how to pigeonhole the company "its a fascinating business model with a lot of potential " says scott krasik an analyst at c l king &amp associates "but it was much easier to get people interested in it when we had a bull market " after hitting a week high of &# on june nexcen shares began to tumble as the credit markets started unraveling on nov they plunged in a single day hitting a week low of &# after the companys profit outlook sorely missed wall streets consensus the guidance didnt include the benefit of three to five major acquisitions nexcen expects to announce next year and some analysts said nexcen needs to fine tune its communication skills nexcen shares have since regained some ground and were at &# yesterday in p m composite trading on the nasdaq stock market thats a bargain says todd slater an analyst at lazard capital markets llc he has an &# price target on the shares based on rising cash flows he anticipates from a steady series of acquisitions through the next several years nexcens closest peer in the intellectual property business mr slater says is iconix brand group inc which bought apparel brands such as ocean pacific and joe boxer but no retail franchises athletes foot which franchises more than stores that are expected to generate &# million in sales this year is dwarfed by rivals foot locker inc and finish line inc but dloren says athletes foot has an advantage because of its u s stores are located off the mall most often in sneaker obsessed urban neighborhoods the chain is targeting for its future growth many athletes foot stores have exploited the flexibility of the franchise matching their shoes to local tastes in a way that big mall based chains typically dont but some stores in the year old chain are more successful than others and domestic stores are still posting drops in comparable sales to fix that the company has set up purchasing committees for franchisees as well as nexcen university an atlanta training center to help franchisees pick from four newly developed store formats that focus respectively on high tech "performance" sneakers classic designs surf and skate and urban styles "its all about the way the stores look the way they sound the way they smell " mr dloren says he aims to precisely calibrate layouts fixtures and lighting the same way top notch chains like abercrombie &amp fitch co do meanwhile athletes foot stores overseas which face less competition and enjoy more consumer demand are generating comparable sales gains of and account for nearly two thirds of the franchise nexcen aims to increasingly exploit its international network particularly in asian markets such as korea japan and china as well as the middle east for instance nexcen bought two premium ice cream franchise brands maggiemoos and marble slab creamery as well as two pretzel franchises pretzel time and pretzelmaker a key strategy at home and abroad will be to sell both ice cream and pretzels at a single shop when summer gives way to fall snackers can opt for a warm pretzel instead of ice cream with further acquisitions nexcen expects to add still more snacks and treats to the mix still some critics worry that a clutter of snack offerings inside a single store will muddy the brands as for trusting a franchisee with multiple concepts "with an athletes foot and an ice cream parlor i think it could be a stretch " says marko grunhagen a marketing professor at eastern illinois university mr dloren says hell only make that stretch abroad where its a familiar practice nexcens third business consumer brands has acquired the bill blass clothing line and the waverly home decor brand dozens of licensees not nexcen will be taking on liability for seasonal markdowns on apparel yet that could be a worry the recent trend among successful apparel houses like polo ralph lauren corp is to buy their licenses back notes richard e wilson a marketing professor at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management but nexcen hired some top level talent to manage bill blass including big name designers peter som and michael bastian says allan ellinger senior managing partner at mmg a new york investment bank that advised bill blass in its sale to nexcen that should aid nexcen as it looks to reintroduce bill blass to shoppers at stores including saks inc where the brand now has a small presence and macys inc "bob dloren is not afraid to invest money and thats the key " mr ellinger says "he loves the brands he buys and hes taking care of them "
