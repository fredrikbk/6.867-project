cable dodges tighter fcc control chairman martins defeat signals tough sledding for his other proposals federal communications commission chairman kevin martin suffered a rare defeat yesterday when fellow commissioners refused to support his proposal to tighten regulation of the cable industry the result is a victory for cable companies which had vociferously objected to mr martins plans it means consumers probably wont soon be able to buy cable channels individually mr martin conceded defeat around noon noting he didnt have enough votes to support his plan he said a report the fcc was scheduled to vote on which found that the cable industry had grown large enough to warrant more regulation would be rewritten to remove that suggestion during a turbulent day the meeting of the five member commission was delayed several times and items dropped off the agenda including a proposal to make it easier for minorities and women to own media properties commissioners complained that mr martin put too many contentious issues on the agenda and didnt allow enough time to study them all four of mr martins colleagues asked him last week to remove the minority media ownership issue from the agenda one senior fcc official said but mr martin refused to do so the defeat signals rough times ahead for the republican chairman who is trying to push through a plan to ease media ownership limits by the end of the year mr martins proposal which would allow media companies to own a broadcast station and newspaper in the top markets drew objections from both sides consumer groups have vowed to stop mr martins efforts to push the proposal through the fcc in mid december and lawmakers have scheduled two hearings next month to grill the fcc commissioners about the deal the controversy could continue to hold up fcc approval of sam zells buyout of tribune co the approval has been tied to a resolution of the media ownership issue in an interview mr martin said he intends to move forward with the media ownership vote in december mr martin likely has the support of his two republican colleagues to adopt the change but their resistance to his cable plan and the uproar about it among congressional republicans and conservative free market groups suggest that his political support is softening at issue yesterday was an annual report the fcc produces on the state of video competition over the past two years the fcc has used internal and external data to estimate that about of households subscribe to cable this year mr martins staff relied on a single external data source that said the subscription rate had increased to a rate that high would trigger a rule passed years ago by congress that was designed to rein in the cable industry if it got too large the rule states that if at least of households can get cable and at least subscribe the fcc receives new authority to regulate the cable industry cable companies argued that they are losing market share to satellite and phone companies not gaining it by yesterday evening the commission hadnt voted on several cable related items that remained on the agenda a proposal that would set up an fcc governed arbitration process for programmers seeking to be carried on cable systems was pulled off the agenda several programmers notably the nfl network have asked the fcc to get more involved in such disputes another proposal involved slashing the price that cable operators charge independent programmers for leased access on their systems that proposal was expected to gain approval consumer groups have pushed for the change which they say would provide for more diversity on cable systems
