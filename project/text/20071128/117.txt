pursuit of happiness indias surging economy lifts hopes and ambitions socialism and castes begin to give way lessons of dumbo since it gained independence india has been defined by socialism poverty and a hindu caste system that determined a persons place in society from birth now amid an explosion of economic growth millions of indians are embracing long unthinkable ambitions to lead a better life than their parents and create a better life for their children "my son would have followed in my footsteps years ago " says sanjaya sharma years old he works as his father did at a crematorium on the banks of the yamuna river in new delhi where open funeral pyres sit on about concrete slabs mr sharmas job is to ensure bodies are fully cremated and if the children of the deceased arent available to pierce skulls with a stick in a sacred hindu rite working one of indian societys humblest jobs earns mr sharma rupees or about &# a day now the father of five says "i dont want my children to do what i am doing i want them to go into business get educated get a respected profession learn computers and earn for themselves " mr sharma and his wife push their eldest a year old girl named khushboo to get good grades khushboo says she wants to get a "good private sector job in bombay or in america " using the old name for mumbai the new sense of possibility felt by indians many of them from the lower classes is one of the most profound social consequences of the great economic reawakening of this nation of billion economic growth has averaged about a year for the past four years a rate that if sustained would double average incomes in a decade indian companies are snapping up western rivals droves of indian professionals meanwhile are returning home from abroad seeing a greater chance here of entrepreneurial success poorer indians are flocking from villages to the cities in search of new jobs and a better lot in life "there has been a psychological breakthrough " says andre beteille chairman of the indian council of social science research the year old has studied indian society since shortly after india won independence from britain in "substantial sections of the indian population believe that they are as good as anybody " theres demographic evidence to suggest that indias economic boom will continue about one third of indias population is under the age of over the next five years india will be responsible for nearly of the increase in the worlds working age population according to an october world bank report chinas population in contrast is rapidly aging its working age population is expected to fall to of the total in from in according to a separate world bank report issued in september the organization for economic cooperation and development recently claimed india in became the worlds third largest economy after the u s and china based on purchasing power parity which adjusts exchange rates to equalize the cost of goods in different countries indias newfound ebullience contrasts sharply with the tragic aspects of this ancient land many of its rural residents representing roughly of indias population still live in brutal poverty malnutrition infant mortality and other childhood diseases are commonplace especially in the countryside because successive indian governments have underinvested in health care and many public and aid agency funds destined for the poor are siphoned off by corruption and it isnt the first time india has felt this kind of optimism when it won independence indias leaders believed the nation could secure a new and unique perch as a tolerant secular democracy especially if the steady hand of the state was on the economic tiller since then indias stability has stood out against the turmoil that frequently roils neighboring pakistan which won independence the same year but indias economic performance in the few decades after independence was so poor that it came to be referred to derisively as the "hindu rate of growth " india also has seen short spurts of rapid economic growth before it experienced three such years in the mid s but the boom fell apart with the advent of the asian financial crisis still there is little to compare with what is happening in large parts of the country today changes that are altering how people live and what they aspire to domestic tourism companies are booking record numbers of sightseers an advertisement for ifb industries ltd a maker of washing machines dryers and microwave ovens features a smiling young woman looking at a spreadsheet on her laptop "housework on your mind " it asks "set yourself free with ifb " the opportunities open to young indians are now vast compared with just a few years ago and they go well beyond information technology and call centers whole new industries free from the shackles of state ownership offer a new generation a far wider range of choices "in my community you should do only engineering or medicine " says year old sunil ji bhat referring to the two traditionally respectable professions for the upper classes under the ancient but still influential caste system brahmins like mr bhat are at the top "now new things are coming up insurance journalism hotel management and youth are very much attracted to these new fields " a kashmiri pandit from predominantly muslim kashmir mr bhats family was part of a mass exodus from kashmir in amid widespread violence much of it aimed at hindus they settled in a refugee camp in jammu the southern part of the state of jammu and kashmir his family once well to do has lived there since much of the time all in one tent since he was years old mr bhat wanted to be a news anchor at the time the family could see only one state run television channel "my parents were very apprehensive " he says "they thought the man reading the news must have got his job through contacts " mr bhat is enrolled in a masters degree program at the indian institute of mass communication in new delhi and his parents have gradually accepted that he may have a future in television today there are more than television channels in india and more than still waiting for government permission mr bhat frequently reminds his parents that one anchor on a popular cable news channel is a kashmiri pandit too the changes can be even more dramatic at the bottom of the caste hierarchy v p gomathi grew up in a small village in the southern state of tamil nadu in a family of dalits dalits the former "untouchables " are at the bottom of the hindu caste ladder so low as to be outside of the system altogether ms gomathis father was an alcoholic her mother married at and was never educated but her mother realized the importance of schooling so she and the rest of the family sacrificed to get ms gomathi a good education "she thought my daughter should not have to face all this " says ms gomathi who went to a private missionary high school and then to college now she is working towards a masters degree in social services at the tata institute of social sciences in mumbai ms gomathi says she faces criticism at home for her success with villagers saying "if she goes for a higher education we cannot find a groom for her " but her achievements have encouraged others in her village to take education more seriously as ms gomathis exodus from her village demonstrates much of the newfound advancement is happening in indias cities in contrast much of rural india is in danger not just of being bypassed by economic growth but of going into reverse with the ranks of the worst off swelling in of rural indian wage earners aged were in the lowest earning section of society making less than rupees a year roughly &# according to a new study by iims dataworks a new delhi based market research firm by mid that number had increased to the survey found in contrast the ranks of the lowest paid workers in indias urban areas fell to of the working population from three years earlier agricultural reform has been so lethargic that indias farming economy has grown at a much slower rate than the overall economy in recent years the last government led by the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party lost in in part because its campaign slogan "india shining" rang hollow with many indians especially in rural india the current congress party led government of prime minister manmohan singh reliant on a fragile coalition of political parties has been hobbled in its ability to deliver reforms that might spread the benefits of economic growth more widely one of the most critical reforms needed to ensure indias continued economic growth is fixing a public education system riddled with problems many teachers regularly fail to show up to class because it is difficult to fire them and they can earn more in private tutoring only of indians in their mid s and older have a secondary education according to the world bank education reform is crucial if the government wants to gain the benefit from its youthful population and not simply end up with more uneducated workers to find jobs for reform also is needed to meet the rising demands and aspirations of indias own citizens even the poorest of whom now view education as the ticket out of the slums or impoverished hamlets the indian government economists and business leaders all have identified the need for better education especially at the elementary and high school levels but many are disillusioned with government efforts that has prompted calls for the private sector to take a more active role in promoting private schools even in remote and poor parts of the nation the federal government meanwhile is planning to greatly expand the number of higher educational establishments including those that are part of the elite indian institutes of technology and indian institutes of management networks the countrys equivalent of the ivy league indias ability to give more of its citizens the prospect of material and social advancement will largely determine whether todays progress is viewed by history as a transformative period akin to the mass migration of u s blue collar workers in the s and s into the middle class it also will help narrow the many fault lines that crisscross this fractious and fragmented nation divisions between religions between caste layers between north and south between urban and rural between development and subsistence living some say the stability and cohesion this transformation can bring may help a newly powerful india set an example on the world stage by marrying democracy with prosperity in a volatile region short on both "our perception is the world is a much safer place if a nation of billion people is prosperous and doing well " says montek singh ahluwalia deputy chairman of the planning commission a government agency that plays a big role in setting indias economic course "i dont think democracy has much of a future if it doesnt work in india " the pursuit of a life changing personal dream is sufficiently new in india that it can be a difficult concept to grasp even for people
