just how much do we want to share on social networks heres what i know about facebook ceo mark zuckerberg from his personal page on the social networking web site he started he grew up in dobbs ferry n y considers himself an atheist has visited at least countries outside the u s and by facilitating the flow of information like this is "trying to make the world a more open place " i also know thanks to a new facebook service that follows its members around the internet and reports back to their friends that on thanksgiving at p m mr zuckerberg bought a ticket to see "american gangster" using the movie ticket web site fandango the new service called beacon works like this say youre a facebook user and you buy a sweater from an online retail site that has signed up for beacon with your permission facebook sends a note to your facebook profile it also shows up in some cases in an area of your friends facebook accounts called "news feed " which gives them updates on friends activities sometimes an ad for the purchase site accompanies the note fandango overstock com and blockbuster are among a few dozen sites on board you get no financial benefit from the transaction except the satisfaction of having yet another way to broadcast your every move to friends this idea hasnt been universally celebrated last week i ran a highly unscientific poll using a facebook service that lets you pay to ask questions of facebook users i asked if facebook could tell your friends what you do on other sites buying movie tickets clothes etc when would you want to share that information by friday morning the results were in of the respondents chose always chose often sometimes or rarely and chose never the poll had been prompted by an email id received last week from the privacy watchdog group moveon org civic action which was petitioning against beacon the email quoted a blogger who put forth scenarios like "a college student buying a ticket to brokeback mountain and his homophobic football teammates finding out on facebook " matthew helfgott a year old college student told me he signed the petition after facebook ruined his hanukkah surprise by telling him about the gloves his girlfriend had bought him "thats really personal stuff " he said later i was able to put his comment in perspective i received a "friend request" from mr helfgott a message from facebook telling me that mr helfgott wanted us to publicly list each other as "friends " accepting the request gave me along with other people access to his personal facebook page where he listed his home address cellphone number political views birth date and plans for new years eve among other details mr helfgott in becoming one of my so called friends could see similar private details about me i decided to try beacon myself i bought a ticket at fandango for "no country for old men " a box appeared on the corner of my browser window telling me "fandango is sending this to your facebook profile vauhini bought no country for old men on fandango " thirty seconds later the box disappeared when i went to facebook there was a similar notice at the top of the page to stop facebook from sharing my purchase with my friends would have taken four clicks instead i clicked "ok " beacon critics complain that it should be easier to opt out then in the clothing section of overstock com i found my next purchase meant to catch my friends attention a creepy three piece bunny costume top bottom ears i agreed to send that to facebook too later that evening i saw my friend steve at another friends house sitting with some people i hadnt met "i saw you bought a bunny costume " he said "yeah " i said "i bought it for work " "i use that excuse all the time " he joked when i described beacon to the group they were initially indignant then that was it the conversation wandered elsewhere and when i tried to resuscitate discussion of facebook and privacy we ended up talking instead about other vital technology issues like the effect of relative social status on blackberry etiquette i shouldnt have been surprised that my costume purchase was so quickly dismissed for some time my friends have had access to facebook information far more personal than my buying habits such as my photo album yet that initial reaction to beacon was negative why the discrepancy facebook users share for a reason we want others to know what were up to we trade privacy for increased connectedness but we want to do it on our own terms this isnt about the information beacon collects but how it collects it peeking in on us then asking to report to our friends what it saw beacon asks facebook users to make ever more invasive trades for the sake of an ever more superficial sense of closeness it may or may not be worth it but keep in mind one definition for "beacon" is warning signal email me at vauhini vara wsj com lee gomes is on vacation
