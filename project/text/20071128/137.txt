the new deal diplomacy sovereign wealth funds buy small stakes and keep quiet winning over some skeptics most people use cash to gain influence for the state run investment funds of the middle east and asia the trick has been to spend money without gaining too much no place is that strategy clearer than among investment officers in the united arab emirates a loose federation of semi autonomous emirates that includes oil rich abu dhabi and its neighbor dubai after abu dhabis investment arm bought a stake in citigroup inc for &# billion abu dhabi officials went out of their way to stress how uninvolved they would be in citis affairs they would get no board seat or have any ongoing say in the banks operations the sensitivity of the citi deal underscores the fraught dynamic now in play between the estimated &# trillion of state owned investment pools their often high profile western targets and the governments that regulate the investments as they wade deeper into western economies these funds are showing some hard won political savvy first came u s congressional uproar over a chinese state controlled play for unocal corp in last year political opposition held up a bid by dubai controlled dp world to buy into u s shipping ports in reaction the funds have taken on a more subtle approach after years of missteps it finally appears to be working in an attempt to make its latest deal go smoothly citigroup briefed sen charles schumer the new york democrat who was among the most outspoken critics of the dubai ports deal mr schumer said citigroup alerted him about the investment ahead of time mr schumer said he viewed the deal as good for citigroup and the financial markets in general and didnt think the investment would trigger a national security review in washington "my general inclination is that foreign investment here is good we need to be careful when national security is at stake as in a ports deal " he said adding that he didnt see any problems with the investment as long as "it stays a purely economic deal without politics interfering " u s canadian and european officials are still fearful that state run investment pools can be used for political rather than business purposes particularly where sensitive national assets are in play in a congressional hearing on sovereign funds earlier this month sen evan bayh an indiana democrat raised questions about the influence of saudi prince alwaleed bin talal one of citigroups largest individual shareholders on decisions at the bank including the recent ouster of the banks chief executive "does he have a controlling interest in the company most people would ordinarily say at no " sen bayh said "but its hard to say he didnt exert some significant influence " influence or rather minimizing it has been at the heart of a series of other deals in recent weeks dubai international capital a private equity outfit owned by dubais ruler agreed on monday to a big investment in sony corp which has struggled recently with a long turnaround abu dhabis mubadala development co said last week that it would pay &# million for a roughly stake in advanced micro devices inc which had trouble digesting a big acquisition all three investors kept their deals under thresholds that could trigger increased regulatory scrutiny and they each signaled they wouldnt be taking on active roles the approach grew out of the dp world debacle which blind sided u a e officials after the setback they hired washington lobbyists and sent government officials on a charm offensive to the u s the countrys western educated economy minister sheikha lubna al qasimi dropped by the offices of dozens of lawmakers and administration officials to burnish the uaes image "if you have a question call us " she said she told them chinese entities led by its sovereign wealth fund and state owned banks are also wading into big deals but are likely be more cautious in the u s after getting burned on its biggest deal to date china investment corp the countrys sovereign wealth fund agreed in may to pay &# billion for a of blackstone group lp as part of the new york based private equity firms initial public offering that deal surprised many and sparked criticism at home among chinese officials after blackstones share price fell following the ipo since debuting in june blackstone has lost of its value from the ipo price of &# a share criticism in china was especially sharp because chinese officials are used to seeing huge gains in the early months of a newly listed company thats because chinese regulators encourage domestic underwriters to underprice ipos since the drop in blackstones share the countrys other big pool of sovereign wealth the national social security fund has shied from striking a similar deal despite entreaties from u s private equity firms according to people familiar with the matter the funds chairman xiang huaicheng said last week that the fund is "always studying" alternative investments but still faces regulatory limits on its investment scope chinese officials wary of their agencies being seen as "dumb money" are unlikely to lift such limits unless blackstones share price rebounds in fact even china investment corp has shifted tack looking much closer to home for deals it recently subscribed for about &# million of shares in state owned construction company china railway group ltd s hong kong ipo chinese entities continue to have huge piles of funds some &# billion in china investment corp alone analysts and bankers say they may
