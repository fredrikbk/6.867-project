flat tax fred fred thompsons presidential campaign has been struggling in part because of a sense that he lacks passion and an agenda but late last week he unveiled a tax reform that is more ambitious than anything weve seen so far from the rest of the gop field mr thompson wants to abolish the death tax and the alternative minimum tax and cut the corporate income tax rate to from but his really big idea is a voluntary flat tax that would give every american the option of ditching the current code in favor of filing a simple tax return with two tax rates of and mr thompson is getting aboard what has become a global bandwagon with more than nations having adopted some form of flat tax most especially in eastern europe have seen their economies grow and revenues increase as theyve adopted low tax rates of between and with few exemptions the main political obstacle to such a reform in the u s has come from liberals who favor punitive taxes for "class" reasons and k street corporate lobbyists who want to retain their tax loophole empires the housing and insurance industries states and localities charities bond traders and tax preparers are all foes of low tax rates thats why the idea of a voluntary flat tax introduced on these pages a dozen years ago makes political sense the thompson plan would allow taxpayers to keep their mortgage and charitable deductions if they prefer by adhering to the current tax code and rates but it would also allow the option to abandon those credits and deductions except for a single allowance based on family size &# for a family of four most taxpayers would pay a rate on income above that allowance with a rate kicking in at &# for a couple there would only be five lines on the tax form and most taxpayers could fill it out in minutes liberals are already objecting that the plan is not "paid for " by which they mean it doesnt raise taxes the way they hope the next president will but mr thompson is right in refusing to play by the "static revenue" scoring game that demands that one dollar in estimated tax cuts be offset by one dollar in estimated tax increases somewhere else "the experts always overrate the revenue losses from tax cuts " mr thompson says and history supports him going back to the mellon reductions of the s the kennedy tax cuts of the s the gippers in the s and this decades success with president bushs reductions mr thompsons plan is based on one introduced by gop representatives paul ryan and jeb hensarling that is in any case not designed to lose revenue it is intended to allow federal receipts to grow at the rate of the economy which would leave them at some or of gdp roughly their average of recent decades when critics object to revenue losses they are really saying that the tax share of gdp should be allowed to rise to and higher which is where we are headed if the bush tax rates expire wed prefer a flat tax with one rate instead of mr thompsons two once the concession is made that richer people should pay a higher tax rate the political temptation is always to raise the rate on the wealthy the virtue of the single rate flat tax isnt merely its efficiency but also its moral component it treats all taxpayers equally if a person makes five times more money than his neighbor he should pay five times more taxes not or times more however whats refreshing about the thompson plan is that it goes well beyond the current republican mantra to make "the bush tax cuts permanent " that is certainly needed but the gop also needs a more ambitious agenda especially with economic growth slowing the flat tax has the added political benefit of assaulting the special interests who populate the gucci gulch outside congresss tax writing committee rooms lower rates and simplify the tax code and you instantly reduce the opportunities for beltway corruption it is both a tax policy and political reform the two apparent republican front runners rudy giuliani and mitt romney should be paying attention both have called for tax cuts in general but have dodged any endorsement of the flat tax presumably because they think it is too politically risky the politically calculating mr romney has questioned whether the flat tax is "fair " mr giuliani is more open to the idea saying the flat tax "would be a lot easier it would probably bring in a lot more revenue and it would not have some of the burdens on the economy that the massive tax code has " thats right so why not go all the way mr thompsons voluntary proposal is one way to deflect some of the inevitable political opposition anyone who prefers the current tax code can stick with it the rest of us can have a better choice
