common sense retail stocks look cheap but theyre no bargains smartmoney the holiday shopping season has kicked in with what seems a strong start black friday sales up foot traffic up and online sales up according to various sources my weekend drive through upstate new york past several malls revealed jammed parking lots and police handling crowd control if things are really that merry at the malls you wouldnt know it from mondays plunge in stocks including many battered retail stocks so what is wrong with this picture plenty according to my niece laura holden an elementary school teacher in columbus ohio laura as well as her two sisters contributed to the traffic by spending friday at a mall but they spent practically nothing instead picking out favorite items and offering hints to their mother laura reports that high gas and food prices have crimped her personal spending items she might have bought for herself a year ago are now on her christmas wish list dont count on more affluent shoppers to come to the rescue true shares of nordstrom which sets the standard for upscale department stores rose last week after reporting much better than expected earnings for the quarter ended nov but that was when the dow jones industrial average was just off its all time high the "wealth effect " already battered by slumping home prices is taking a further hit from falling stocks investors seemed to ignore that nordstrom also lowered sales estimates for the next quarter as well as its full year earnings forecast shares of tiffany and sothebys establishments that cater to the hedge fund crowd have been battered sothebys shares trade for significantly below their week high and have never recovered from the failure of this falls big impressionist sale even though modern and contemporary works fared better tiffanys sales have been buoyed by dollar rich foreigners but shares are nearly off the high hit in mid october on wall street where tiffany opened a new store layoffs are mounting and expectations for bonuses seem to be shrinking it is tempting to view some of these retail share prices as bargains especially since the major averages have all dropped or more from their peaks the u s consumer has been down for the count so many times in recent years yet we have always bounced back finding a way to buy those flat screen television sets and new cars especially when deep discounts were offered why does this time feel different the triple threat of higher fuel prices falling real estate values and steeper food prices has got to take a toll on discretionary spending readily available credit is no longer the option it once was the home equity spigot has all but been turned off not to be an alarmist but credit card debt could easily go the way of subprime mortgages credit card defaults are on the rise one reason american express is trading at a week low at some point retail stocks will be attractive the time to buy is when everyone has thrown in the towel not when they still rally when results barely beat low expectations the plight of the consumer like that of the homeowner is going to take some time to play out my hunch is that it will be the after christmas sales that really offer some bargains james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com commonsense
