fiscally fit when a high paying job keeps you low a bigger salarys not worth more misery but figure out the right exit strategy online edition my sister melissa made a decision a few months ago that she knew would wreak havoc on her familys finances she quit her job melissa and her supervisor didnt get along to the point that shed been diagnosed with a condition her doctor said was stress induced after a particularly unhappy exchange with her boss over a minor problem melissa snapped and resigned on the spot it was a dicey decision melissa had been looking for a new job for almost a year but hadnt been able to find a position that offered the same level of salary and benefits indeed the pay at the job she left was much better than what shed had before and the increased income made it possible for melissa and her husband joe to buy their first home but that increased income was now gone out of work for weeks and worried about spending down their savings my sister ended up taking a job for less pay fifteen years ago i was in a similar spot i took a job as a copy editor for a legal publishing firm right after i graduated college it paid relatively well but the job was deadly dull i dreaded facing work each day but was reluctant to leave because of my messed up finances at the time i had about &# in credit card and student loan debt the economy was bad and i searched in vain for a job that paid as well or better but i kept at it and finally found a position with a small business magazine that sounded ideal the job would allow me to do some reporting as well as editing the office was closer to my home and during the interview i really clicked with the managing editor granted the benefits werent as good and the pay was &# less after taxes than id been making but i figured saving gas and reducing wear and tear on my car would make up for some of that the new job just felt right and id had it with my old job so i went for it as id feared the transition period was rough for the first six months i struggled to adjust to a smaller paycheck a &# drop in pay doesnt sound huge now but i was just out of school and were talking entry level journalism here my salary was around &# a year lots of people stay in jobs they hate solely because it pays the bills ask any newly minted lawyer slogging away at a corporate job to service &# in student loan debt my sister and i werent that deep in the hole but we still felt trapped by debt with the benefit of hindsight there are a number of things we could have done to ease the financial stress of switching to a lower paying job what we both needed was a better plan for finding a new job and for managing cash flow to ease the financial shock we should have focused on reducing debt wed both known for some time that we wanted out of our jobs as soon as we starting searching for a new position we should have started devoting as much of our disposable income as possible to paying down debt to free up cash that would have made the decision to move to a lesser paying job less frightening and living with less disposable income would also have made the transition less stressful debt was an issue for my sister and me if thats not a problem for you its still a good idea to shore up your finances before moving to a lower paying job build up your savings now in case you encounter a shock to the wallet an unexpected car repair or health care emergency after you move on if saving outside a retirement account doesnt come naturally learn how to trick yourself into becoming a better saver here while getting our finances in order melissa and i also should have been trying to address why we were unhappy most people stuck in miserable jobs dont give enough thought to what they could do to improve the situation other than leaving the company cant stand your boss try searching for a position elsewhere in the company work and home life clashing ask for a more flexible work schedule job boring you to tears think about how you could do your work more productively and urge your employer to make changes that may give you greater job satisfaction by finding a way to stay with your current employer you avoid giving up seniority by starting as a new hire somewhere else and in times of layoffs seniority often counts as an added bonus if you wind up improving your current work situation you will have paid down debt or put some money away melissa and i also should have spent time investigating the state of the job market before sending out our resumes to determine your employability its necessary to understand job market conditions not just in the larger economy but within your field says bob basile founder of career coaching inc for example he says look at wall street "if youre a trader earning big bonuses in this environment there could be tremendous opportunities for you on the other hand if you work in the mortgage end of the business you could be facing a job risk " to get a feel for market conditions mr basile suggests talking to other people in your industry including former employers personal contacts or even your alumni association networking is the best way for people in high paying fields to find jobs in alternative careers speaking of resumes consider ways to set yourself apart from other job candidates before you start applying when my husband gerry was unexpectedly laid off in he spent some time reviewing job postings in his field to find skills that employers were looking for and he took technology courses to learn skills that werent required at his previous employer improving his computer skills helped gerry land a job that pays more but isnt as physically demanding as typical jobs in his field slinging a keyboard is a lot easier than slinging a wrench if personal and networking contacts havent yielded promising positions online networking services can help web sites such as execunet com linkedin com and netshare com cater specifically to business professionals but today you can find networking and career oriented job search sites for most fields to find search sites for your industry check out job list web site such as quintcareers com and topjobsites com my sister still feels anxious about her finances but she loves her new job and feels confident she made the right choice and that small business magazine i left my first job for it went under a victim of recession but i had no regrets the work was challenging and fun and i made lasting friendships a year and a half later my former boss was one of my bridesmaids and the career contacts i made working for the magazine were essential in helping me quickly land a new job one with a much better salary and benefits so when a job makes you miserable dont let your finances stop you from jumping ship just look before you leap are you stuck in a job you hate because it pays the bills are you so miserable youre considering changing careers what are you doing to
