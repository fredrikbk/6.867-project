is condenets web approach paying off deal to distribute videos via youtube is latest partnership condenet today plans to announce it has struck a deal to distribute videos from its various web sites which cover topics such as food and travel via youtube it is the latest in a string of partnerships for the digital division of conde nast publications including deals with msnbc and yahoo magazine publishers were slow to embrace the web and until recently many magazine web sites were bare bones operations with limited audiences more magazines are giving away their online content putting pressure on them to figure out how to make money from their web products the bulk of magazine publishers believe the answer is to build separate web sites for each of their print titles sarah chubb president of condenet since has taken a different approach condenet has built web sites based on topics such as fashion and travel ms chubb believes this is the best way to expand the audience and the ad revenues condenet whose parent company is a unit of advance publications now includes eight different sites such as the food site epicurious com the fashion site style com and reddit com a social news aggregation web site by some measures condenets partnerships appear to be paying off traffic to its web sites increased in october to million unique u s visitors from the same period last year according to comscore media metrix year to date revenue at condenet is up versus the same period last year that number includes revenue from wired com and flip com neither of which figured in last years figures stripping out those two sites condenet revenue is up about year to date versus the same period last year that comes amid a strong year for web advertising in general online ad revenues for the first nine months of were up about to &# billion according to the interactive advertising bureau and pricewaterhousecoopers with revenue and circulations steadily dropping on the print side of magazine businesses digital publishers such as condenet have their work cut out for them web revenue for magazine companies is about of their total revenue says martin walker chairman of walker communications a magazine consulting company "while online ad revenue is growing quickly it is not replacing lost print revenue " he says "none of them can compete on the web in terms of traffic " ms chubb has worked in new and traditional media for more than years starting as an account executive at elle magazine in below are excerpts from an interview where she talks about the companys latest partnerships and its strategy moving ahead wall street journal how are your content deals structured sarah chubb we do not pay to distribute our content it is generally a no cash exchange the trade off is that we get distribution wsj how does the youtube deal work in terms of the advertising piece ms chubb we have the right to sell the advertising there is a revenue split as there always is with google if we are not able to sell the full inventory it goes into the google system wsj are you finding that the advertisers that traditionally advertise in conde nast print magazines are the same brands that are advertising with you online ms chubb our list of top advertisers matches up pretty closely with the conde nast advertising list of advertisers wsj how have you managed to grow your revenue for the year by with new advertisers more spending by existing advertisers ms chubb a little of everything growth from existing advertisers and a lot of new business wsj conde nast still of course operates web versions of its print titles how do those fit into the big picture for you ms chubb their main purpose is a consumer marketing purpose a connection for the consumer to the brand the reason for those sites first and foremost is renewing and selling subscriptions wsj is the ad network strategy one you plan to pursue ms chubb we actually were one of the first companies of our type to get into an advertising relationship with a blogger the sartorialist on style and mens style right now the idea of a vertical advertising network is very interesting to us we actually have some activity going on in that area but it is also the trend du jour so you are probably going to see a lot of announcements about things like that not all of them are going to succeed wsj is the market for sites based on specific topics such ad food fashion and travel saturated now ms chubb i dont think that the market is saturated at all we are looking at lots of different categories all the time we are also investors as well as acquirers of other businesses i am looking for growth if there is a category we can get into by starting something new like we did with teen site flip then we will if there is a category we can get into by buying or investing in something that is adjacent to a category we are in today we will consider that seriously also
