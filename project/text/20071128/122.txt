tallichet obit appreciated many thanks for your thoughtful kind spirited retrospective of david tallichets passing "pioneer of theme restaurants pulled his ideas out of the sky " remembrances nov he was likely the last of his happy and peculiar breed a "warbird" collector who had actually flown such extraordinary machines in the dangerous skies of world war ii during my years of affiliation with a flying museum our air boss met several times with mr tallichet who was considering giving us the last flying b marauder however those restaurant troubles mentioned in your article precluded this remarkable gift and he sold that unique airplane for a substantial sum i had a bit of personal interest in the matter as my father flew the marauder in combat over europe it now resides at kermit weeks fantasy of flight in polk city fla while mr weeks is of course a good bit younger than was mr tallichet he is surely the same in kindred one who "gets" the joyous mysterious and essentially unexplainable spirit of flying and who devotes his resources to preserving those irreplaceable artifacts of past glory and sacrifice one hopes that the airworthy remnants of mr tallichets legacy will all end up safeguarded by similarly minded good stewards farewell sir your "going west" diminishes the airmans world and we shall miss you howard deever omaha
