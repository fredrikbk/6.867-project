maybe the globe isnt immune to slowing u s doubts spread on view that europe and asia will pick up the slack with worries over the fallout from the housing and credit markets deepening the once widespread view that europe and asia would pick up the slack and shield the global economy from the effects of a u s downturn is being put to the test investors embraced the idea shuttling money abroad and buying shares of companies with big overseas operations like wm wrigley jr co and m co until disappointing results from both sent their shares down technology companies which as a group have the largest overseas sales exposure were another popular destination after weathering the initial stages of the stock market selloff in october they have fallen sharply this month less than two months ago the international monetary fund offered a remarkably upbeat view that global economic growth would slow down just a smidge to next year from an estimated this year but that no longer seems certain "its quite clear that the downside risks to world growth have increased since we met about a month ago at the imf " the governor of the canadian central bank david dodge said recently house prices have continued to fall in the u s and elsewhere banks in the u s and europe have announced billions of dollars in mortgage related losses stocks around the world have fallen sharply and an unrelenting reluctance by banks to lend even to one another has prompted the federal reserve and european central bank to act the notion that the rest of the world has "decoupled" from the u s came into vogue earlier this year as overseas economies particularly emerging markets continued to post robust growth and europe and japan appeared to be enjoying a long delayed upturn policy makers joined the decoupling parade in the spring the imf included a chapter in its april world economic outlook called "decoupling the train " the gist the current weakness of the u s economy stems largely from housing woes and housing is less global than say computers and other parts of the u s economy that is good news for the rest of the world but the u s is now flirting with something more severe than a mere slowdown that along with rising oil prices and the specter of a global credit crunch is changing the picture europe is showing signs of faltering while japan may be at risk of sliding back into recession while developing economies like china are still on a steady boil recent drops in their stock markets suggest investors are beginning to doubt their immunity to a u s led slowdown "were seeing a bond market in the u s which is pricing in a very high chance of a recession and yet is refusing to price in any significant chance of monetary easing in the euro area " says jacques cailloux chief euro area economist with royal bank of scotland "so i do think the market is betting to some extent on the decoupling " he says "but i think its the wrong bet " recent data show the euro zone economy has been resilient so far with gross domestic product rising in the third quarter compared with last year german and french business confidence staged surprising rebounds this month according to data released yesterday with german exporters notably optimistic despite the euros flirtation with &# the combination of a u s slowdown the stronger euro and continuing credit market turmoil is likely to damp growth in the fourth quarter and through next year once hot housing markets in spain and ireland are slowing last week the british bankers association said united kingdom mortgage approvals fell sharply in october canadian door maker masonite international corp saw demand in the u k and france soften in the third quarter "although we do not expect a major downturn in europe like we are experiencing in north america these markets could be materially less robust in the last quarter of and into " chief executive officer fred lynch said earlier this month weinig group a german machine tool maker typical of midsize export oriented companies says new orders from china have begun to slow sharply "many of our chinese customers sell their products in north america and they are growing more slowly or not at all that hurts their appetite for investment " says rainer hundsdoerfer weinigs ceo other chinese customers which make fittings for the domestic market are still buying machines he says weinigs orders from latin america have also begun to slow for the same reason many manufacturers there rely on exports of finished goods to the u s demand from europe especially eastern europe is helping to compensate demand in oil producing countries also remains strong "if the u s economy went into recession asia would be most affected but the rest of the world could largely carry on " mr hundsdoerfer predicts "europe is in more serious danger of a slowdown than many people think " says simon johnson chief imf economist "if the u s slows down and europe slows down that affects trade and there are no amount of reserves an emerging market can have that protects against markets drying up " the global economy he says now faces the potential for a late th century style spike in oil prices a st century global financial shock and an old fashioned th century style slowdown in global trade that could put japan in particular at risk despite an expansion that has lasted nearly six years and despite policy makers efforts to boost domestic demand the country remains overly dependent on exports says lehman brothers global economist paul sheard while the risks to other asian economies dont seem as stark as in japan investors have been selling shares the decline in the seoul stock market which has fallen this month is especially notable because south korean companies are export oriented and carry heavy debt loads they are seen as particularly sensitive to changes in global growth and the global availability of credit another sign that global growth may be slipping according to christopher wood a hong kong based analyst for clsa group is a drop in global shipping rates after more than doubling earlier this year the baltic exchange dry index which reflects rates to transport bulk commodities such as coal iron ore and grains has fallen by over the past two weeks joellen perry in frankfurt and marcus walker in berlin contributed to
