iraqi tv then and now friends dr phil and satellite dishes take place of action flicks and saddam online edition i asked some iraqi friends about their favorite tv shows and their answers surprised me "friends oprah seinfeld " was one reply "my mother says i am american because i just watch american shows when i am not watching television my wife and mother change it to iraqi programs " oprah was available on iraqi tv before the war but most of the other american shows that have since become popular werent "lost" and "dr phil" were the favorites mentioned by another iraqi he said he liked learning about couples relationship problems from dr phil i explained to him that the couples featured on "dr phil" were not representative of all relationships in america other iraqis said they also love american cartoons but as sarmad explains below thats nothing new he and his friends grew up watching american cartoon classics another big change in television since the war is the availability of satellite tv before the war it was banned today it is everywhere and its the way iraqis have access to such a broad array of american programming as well as shows from europe the middle east and elsewhere syrian soap operas and egyptian movies are also popular it was interesting to hear iraqis views of america based on what they see on television and what they hear about american pop culture they watch "desperate housewives" and reality shows like "so you think you can dance " they also see the news about britney spears and lindsay lohan and some say they are worried about the way young girls grow up in america "do you think its a good place for daughters " one iraqi friend asked rhetorically "if i go to america i will leave my wife and daughter here " replied another gina chon iraqi tv under saddam one summer evening prior to the u s invasion of iraq i was sitting on a plastic mat in my living room watching the p m daily news on one of baghdads two tv channels the main news item showed saddam hussein hosting as he used to do from time to time and quite frequently did in the last years in his tenure a group of guests for conversation in one of his palaces this time it was more than a dozen outstanding female architects talking about architecture and design although he had no formal education in architecture the former president started giving design and architecture tips he moved on to evoke images from islamic designs and to laud arabs achievements in construction going back to the times of the prophet mohammed at the end of the segment mr hussein encircled by a captivated audience his personal secretary and one or two of his bodyguards gave the architects time to ask questions one dared to digress from the main topic to broach an issue that millions of iraqis wondered about but never were able to approach why dont we have satellite channels just like the rest of the world the female architect asked will iraq mr president ever have satellite dishes grinning mr hussein pointed out that iraqis had two fine state run television channels that broadcast a variety of programs and shows besides he added scathingly iraqis are "too busy" to have time to watch satellite channels iraqs two tv channels aired assorted daytime hours and signed off sometime just after midnight until the u s invasion in satellite televisions werent allowed so most iraqis had no access to outside programming it is widely believed that top iraqi officials had access to satellites and channels from all over the world one iraqi engineer who worked for the now dismantled iraqi information and culture ministry under mr hussein once told me that one night a top official in that ministry sent for him to fix his satellite dish which was not receiving a signal some iraqis would secretly buy illegal satellite tv equipment that was smuggled into the capital and other provinces from kurdistan where satellite dishes could be purchased easily however the dishes were pricey and only affluent people were able to afford to buy them people who bought satellites tried to hide the fact that they possessed the illegal equipment from neighbors and relatives who they feared would report them to local baath party officials people reported each other more out of jealousy than anything else to conceal them sometimes the rooftop satellite dishes were covered with pieces of cloth or cooking pots or placed in wooden bird cages those found to own or have owned a satellite dish met with some severe punishments they usually had their equipment confiscated by the government and were fined around my neighborhood there were stories of people thrown in jail though i never saw that firsthand i still grew up watching tom and jerry or as we called it in iraq "the cat and the mouse" when i was a child japanese sci fi cartoons and american cartoons also including popeye and casper the friendly ghost were on the state run channels all time i watched almost as many american movies subtitled in arabic on tv as arabic ones every night both iraqi state owned channels the general channel and the newer al shebab channel which was started and run by uday hussein saddams eldest son showed american movies mostly action and drama i watched "the professional " "basic instinct" and "titanic " i was scared of chucky theatres in baghdad that showed movies like "the terminator " "universal soldier the return " "mission impossible " "the specialist" and the rocky firms were always full perhaps because we grew up during wartime my friends and i have a penchant for big time western action and war movies if you asked young iraqis now to name their favorite actors names such as sylvester stallone arnold schwarzenegger jean claude van damme tom cruise jackie chan and robert de niro would be the first answers actors such as woody allen tom hanks and billy crystal are hardly known even as mr hussein started his religious campaign in the early s some movie theaters began specializing in mainstream american and european movies that had nudity these movies were a big hit though only men tended to frequent these theaters i remember watching a movie called "save me" that was so popular that many people in the audience sat on the floor the iraqi state television also used to sporadically show oprah and the british comic character ali g many people were fond of these although we didnt understand many of the references and couldnt always understand the dialect im still a big ali g fan except now i get more of his jokes sarmad ali write to gina chon or sarmad ali
