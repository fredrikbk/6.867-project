blame the bank boards the ax has been falling on the ceos of banks ubs westlb bear merrill citi northern rock i think the ax should be aimed up one level at the boards of these institutions whose directors have failed miserably amnesia about past credit mistakes is common in the banking business as banks compete for every deal that any other bank is willing to do this amnesia is taking its usual blame for the current slowdown but this time is very different the handwriting has been on the wall for some time and bank boards have made little effort to read it most bank boards consist principally of leading clients ex politicos and community leaders notably absent among them is any sophisticated understanding of banking and risk let alone stuff like derivatives but the contemporary banking business is about risk management risk trading and systems integration and has been for years german banks speculate in the u s mortgage market a regional british savings and loan northern rock becomes the ninth largest bank in u k buying mortgages from brokers and selling interests in them to u s investors the largest bank in the u s with assets in countries citi finds itself with &# billion in securities that it cant value and we havent even talked about what could happen with all the private equity positions these guys own as far as boards are concerned in other words were not just talking about sophisticated risk management were talking about basic oversight the late abn amro of the netherlands bought last month by three large break up candidate banks in europe underperformed for years with a presence in over countries its last management team was entirely dutch and none had ever worked for another bank its ceo lasted over seven sad years abns last outside directors served on an average of almost four other corporate boards and four noncorporate boards each perhaps they were distracted it appeared that three of these directors actually had some bank experience though the last annual report noted they owned no shares in fact seven of directors didnt it is hard to imagine they were pursuing management about best practices royal bank of scotland one of the abn purchasers paid a whopping premium mostly in cash in the middle of a banking crisis it has a board with a few outside directors that have banking experience though it is not clear if this experience was in the risk taking activities that go on today however rbss member board has six management directors five of whom report to the sixth thus it would take nine of the outsiders to overrule the management team that seems pretty unlikely to me northern rock britains current national disgrace had its key board members paraded before parliament their understanding of northern rocks risk exposure was frightening their last chairman was a science journalist and the current chairman is a chemist though hes had time on another banks board many german bank boards are dominated by state governments then theres ubs of switzerland of its strong board three have bank experience all with ubs two seem to have been involved in swiss banking and wealth management and only the well respected chairman has trading and international risk experience though a bit dated while i dont doubt the integrity of any board it is hard to imagine how any outside directors without any banking experience could have even thought of asking what "super senior cdos" were and how many have we got citigroups board reportedly fought for two years to get sandy weill to name a successor but looking at citis business structure its clear they didnt have much overall success overseeing the companys banking integration efforts let alone risk management and they still havent figured out succession planning the average tenure of the citi board member is over years much has been made of the fact that many of citis outside directors were not associated with stellar business performances elsewhere but with the scale of citis bad positions investors must be wondering if not succession planning or business oversight or risk oversight what were they doing for the last decade at citi one common denominator with many of the bank boards ive looked at is that very few bank directors actually have full time jobs to be blunt many of the biggest bank boards resemble retirement clubs without current corporate banking or risk expertise its hard to see what these directors are adding save a few more deal contacts more ugliness in bankdom is on its way and the time to upgrade bank boards to understand banks risks is now we need to improve the structure the incentives and the people i dont want to see regulators choosing bank boards but they cant do much worse than what weve got mr hahn is a fellow at the sir john cass business school in london and was citigroups senior corporate finance officer for the u k see related letter "letters to the editor what were the bank boards thinking " wsj december
