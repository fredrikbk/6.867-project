euro snow boost swiss resorts zurich an abundant early snowfall has set the stage for a record winter for swiss tourism with the francs weakness against the euro set to drive hotel bookings up further still swiss ski resorts rejoiced when a thick layer of snow covered much of the alps in early november allowing for an early start to winter in many places visions of a white and lucrative christmas for the countrys tourism industry received another boost by the weakness of the swiss franc against the euro making holidays in the alpine country less expensive for visitors from the euro zone u s citizens however may think twice about swiss holidays given the recent slump in the dollar "bookings are at absolute record levels and its getting tough finding rooms for the peak days in some three star or four star hotels " swiss tourism spokeswoman edith zweifel said adding "we know the low swiss franc and the high euro has a very positive effect " davos which opened the slopes recently faced an unexpected onslaught of skiers and snowboarders who ended up waiting for their tickets "buses from germany were brimming with tourists in the summer and thats no doubt due to the currency situation " said christoph schefer a tourism official at davos mr schefer hopes the alpine center known for the yearly world economic forum will register another double digit percentage point increase in german visitors this winter less prominent resorts at lower altitudes are also thriving lenzerheide in southeastern switzerland which had to lay off staff last year is currently rehiring workers at a considerable cost swiss tourism said switzerland offers better value than france in the upcoming season according to germanys private banking association bankenverband each euro a german tourist spends is worth about european cents in switzerland compared with about cents in france the association said while the euro swiss franc rate is attractive to visitors from europe the decline of the dollar has reduced the purchasing power of u s visitors however well to do u s travelers typically dont bother with exchange rates so switzerland may still be on their radar screens according to swiss tourisms ms zweifel bookings for business travelers in switzerland are particularly robust hotels in cities such as zurich basel and geneva currently have above average occupancy rates of credit suisse tourism expert frederic junod said the city of zurich expects million overnight stays through the end of this year up from last year the turmoil in financial markets so far hasnt had a noticeable negative impact on the influx of visitors "of course there may be a decline of business travel going forward should financial markets continue to slide but we dont see any of that right now " said ms zweifel swiss hotel stays are expected to rise this year above a long term average growth rate of according to a survey by think tank bak basel economics in the short term prospects for switzerlands tourism industry remain favorable next summer it joins austria in hosting the european soccer championship an event likely to spark demand for additional overnight stays in switzerland bak said further ahead however the outlook is mixed snow is generally getting scarcer a fact alpine countries became painfully aware of last season with expected to see a decline in tourism after the windfall from the soccer championship long term prospects are at best sketchy three years from now growth rates in overnight stays are projected to come down to a modest bak estimates foreign exchange relations will continue to play a dominant role switzerlands tourism industry could cope with a moderate appreciation of the swiss currency according to credit suisse "i dont think there would be a dramatic drop on demand were the euro to trade at a level of say swiss francs " said mr junod many economists expect the swiss currency to remain weak against the european currency at around francs in the next few quarters others argue the franc is undervalued pegging the "correct" level at around francs but in order for the franc to move markedly higher swiss interest rates would have to rise clearly relative to the euro zone a scenario considered unlikely by many economists tourism is switzerlands third biggest exporting sector after the machinery and the pharmaceutical industries accounting for around of the countrys gross domestic product and employing people despite many top quality hotels the sector as a whole is relatively weak and profit margins are very low experts say "the problem is that nearly every swiss village has its own hotel or restaurant often family run which lacks the money to invest but which somehow manages to survive " says credit suisse economist mr junod therefore the average yearly occupancy rate barely rises above which is low by international standards this year that rate is estimated at compared with in thanks to the soccer championship next year it will likely climb above in but will come down again in he said german tourists are the largest visitors group in switzerland by far last winter season they accounted for almost of the million overnight stays by foreign visitors more than double the share of tourist from the second ranked u k u s tourists accounted for of the foreign total domestic tourists notched million overnight stays
