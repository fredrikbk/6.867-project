verizon to open cell network to others phones facing growing pressure from regulators consumers and potential rivals verizon wireless will soon allow wireless customers on its network to use a wide array of phones and mobile devices bought elsewhere the change which will take effect by the middle of next year is a big shift for verizon the nations no carrier by subscribers and it moves the u s wireless industry a step closer to the model in much of the rest of the world where consumers can generally purchase devices independent of carriers and then plug them into their operator of choice under verizons new policy consumers will be able to go to virtually any electronics store and buy cellphones and other mobile devices for use on verizons network as long as the devices meet the carriers minimum standards right now verizon wireless customers have to go to verizons retail stores or those of its partners and choose from whatever phones are offered by the carrier consumers switching from one cellphone service to another usually have to give up their old phone and get a new one in the short term the impact of the shift may be limited verizon a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc will continue to sell phones at its outlets as it does now and because the carrier like other cellphone companies subsidizes the cost of phones sold in its retail network few consumers may want to pay the higher prices to buy a phone from an unaffiliated outlet it isnt clear whether verizon will charge consumers using phones bought elsewhere the same price for its cellphone plans verizon declined to discuss pricing plans yesterday except to say that data charges will be based on usage it also said it couldnt guarantee the same level of support for devices it doesnt sell whats more because verizon uses a different technical standard from most of its rivals a phone used on at&amp t inc s network wouldnt work on verizons still verizons change of heart is the latest sign of how regulatory legal and market pressures are forcing u s wireless carriers to rethink their traditional models and give consumers more freedom to pick their network providers devices and mobile applications in recent months at&amp t sprint nextel corp and t mobile usa all responded to the threat of government regulation by announcing they would follow verizons move last year to prorate fees for contract termination rather than forcing all customers to pay exit fees that run as high as &# in october sprint nextel agreed as part of a class action settlement to provide departing sprint customers with the code to "unlock" their phones software so the phones can be used on other providers networks though a california judge has yet to approve the settlement there is activity overseas too court action in germany just last week forced deutsche telekom ags t mobile to back off an agreement with apple inc to be the exclusive provider of the iphone in germany now t mobile will have to allow the device on the networks of competitors the company said it would sell the "unlocked" iphone for &# meanwhile technology companies like google inc ebay inc s skype and a host of mobile start ups have been pushing operators to make it easier to get their devices and applications in front of consumers carriers often block disable or play down features they dont want consumers to use over the summer google successfully persuaded the federal communications commission to set aside a portion of the spectrum it is auctioning early next year for a new open network and it teamed up with handset makers and others in the tech industry to launch a new mobile operating system android to power mobile phones and allow a greater range of applications and services those efforts have paid dividends two u s carriers t mobile usa and sprint have signed on to the android initiative so far verizon hasnt yet signed on to android and faced off against google over the fcc rules strenuously opposing what it saw as unfair government meddling in the marketplace but over time the carrier softened its position saying this summer it would agree to some of the open access rules the fcc was proposing with its latest initiative verizon can open its network on its own terms carving out its current retail business from the changes fcc chairman kevin martin said in a statement that he is pleased by verizons decision and believes that "wireless customers should be able to use the wireless device of their choice and download whatever software they want onto it " verizons move was called "a great step forward" by google chief executive eric schmidt "as the internet has demonstrated open models create better services for consumers and stronger businesses for providers " mr schmidt said in a statement "we are excited to work with verizon and other industry leaders to achieve this vision " verizon said that early next year it will publish technical standards for the development community so that software applications and devices can run on its network the company said it will also make sure the new devices and features have no bugs that could affect other verizon customers it has put &# million into its labs to support the new program the carriers standards for devices on its open network wont be "nearly as extensive" as those for the devices it certifies for its own retail stores chief marketing officer john stratton added there was little sign verizons rivals were planning to follow suit verizons biggest competitor at&amp t said it wasnt contemplating a similar move ralph de la vega chief executive of at&amp ts wireless unit says he doesnt see a need for the carrier to follow in verizons footsteps "if there is an application or service people want we make it available " he said pointing to the companys variety of music offerings from yahoo napster and emusic as one example "we are probably more open than people give us credit for " mr de la vega said a key concern for at&amp t is testing devices rigorously to make sure they are compatible with the carriers network something he wouldnt want to compromise on "otherwise people will turn on a device and their voice mail or some other feature wont work " he said in statements the other two major wireless carriers sprint and t mobile touted their openness to new features and phones but stopped short of saying they would duplicate verizons move still if verizons position becomes the standard for all u s carriers that could send ripples through the equipment industry handset makers like nokia corp motorola inc and lg electronics inc would be able to market directly to u s consumers rather than having to sell mainly to carriers also manufacturers would be able to distribute phones to customers on multiple networks today u s operators generally strike "exclusive" handset deals with manufacturers so they can use their phone models to lure customers for instance verizon wireless is the exclusive carrier partner in the u s for lgs chocolate music phone if at&amp t or sprint customers want the phone they have to sign up for a new service plan with verizon these arrangements have limited the presence of some companies in the u s nokia the worlds largest cellphone maker has close to a share of the global market but less than of the north american market partly because it is more reluctant to customize its products for carriers than its peers industry analysts and executives say a nokia spokesman said it was too early to tell how the move would affect the companys strategy in the u s the ramifications go beyond cellphones verizon hopes that electronics manufacturers will create a variety of devices for its open network such as notebook computers with wireless broadband personal music devices digital cameras electronic book readers and portable gaming systems mr stratton said he envisions even kitchen appliances being linked to the companys network one day "its subject to imagination " he told reporters in a conference call on monday "it encourages anyone who wants to get in the game to get in the game " jessica e
