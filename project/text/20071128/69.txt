how to ensure relatives dont rip you off case of astors son highlights risks of powers of attorney requiring regular accounts sadly brooke astor is making headlines again but there may be a lesson in the indictment of the late philanthropists son and a lawyer close to the familys affairs it can be risky to hand off financial responsibilities even to someone you think you can trust estate lawyers say older people are often making use of a tool known as a durable financial power of attorney this legal document authorizes an agent usually a spouse another family member or a trusted adviser to make financial decisions if you become unable to make them yourself but naming someone to take control over your money has the potential for serious abuse and lawyers are increasingly devising strategies to help safeguard their clients among the tactics lawyers are including provisions requiring regular accounting statements from agents they also are naming co agents who can serve as checks on each other or naming a supervisor who has the power to fire an agent "people want to make sure when they sign the document that they do what they can to protect themselves " says bernard a krooks a lawyer with littman krooks in new york who specializes in elder law "when the power of attorney takes over youre usually no longer in a position to supervise it " according to the indictment in the astor case made public yesterday in manhattan ms astors son anthony marshall abused his power of attorney in order to "unjustly enrich" himself and others the indictment alleges that while his mother had diminished mental capacity mr marshall took works of art from her home and used her funds in a variety of ways among them to increase his salary pay expenses related to a maine property that ms astor no longer used and pay the expenses of a yacht captain "tony marshall faithfully and effectively managed his mothers affairs for more than years " responded mr marshalls lawyer kenneth warner in a statement whatever "he received was in accordance with her wishes were confident that once all the facts are known mr marshall will be exonerated " when setting up a power of attorney you want to name an agent while youre still in good health and can make clear decisions typically such documents are included as part of a standard estate planning package which also includes a will and health care proxy giving an agent the power to make health decisions when you cant the cost can range from a few hundred to thousands of dollars depending on what sort of extra provisions and safeguards you include its important to designate someone trustworthy since the agent has wide latitude over your finances because a power of attorney arrangement is a private agreement between you and your agent there is no court supervision "what i tell people is that if you dont trust someone one thousand percent dont grant them power of attorney " says ronald fatoullah an elder law specialist in great neck n y lawyers say that powers of attorney are often a tough balancing act you want them to be simple for trusted family members or friends to implement without too many hoops each time a transaction is made but you also want to avoid giving agents a license to steal "were certainly seeing a trend in people asking about how their assets can be protected and seeing people ask more questions " says mr krooks the new york lawyer a couple of years ago by contrast "people said i want to make sure that my kids have the easiest time possible in managing my affairs " to further protect yourself you can require that your agent provide family members or a third party such as a lawyer or accountant with regular accounting statements another strategy is to name co agents while that can be a burden many transactions for instance would need two signatures it can also create a system of checks and balances in some cases lawyers appoint an additional safeguard a "protector " who has the power to replace the agent if there is wrongdoing another key point make sure to carefully lay out exactly what powers you want your agent to have for instance you can limit the agents power to make gifts of your property so they cant just give money to themselves spell out under what conditions gifts can be made how much and to whom frank johns an elder law specialist at booth harrington &amp johns of nc pllc in charlotte and greensboro n c often asks his clients and their agents to sign "interpersonal agreements " documents that have no legal meaning but which might lay out in simple terms the importance of whats expected "signing that document can be a very powerful event " mr johns says "usually i know right away that the agent is going to live by the agreement " power of attorney laws differ from state to state so make sure your lawyer is familiar with what your state allows rules also can vary by financial institution lawyers say banks are increasingly scrutinizing power of attorney documents or are reluctant to honor them because they fear being subject to suits alleging they unwittingly helped an account be drained by an improper agent there are two main kinds of power of attorney documents if youre using a "springing" power of attorney document which goes into effect only when you are declared incapacitated make sure to carefully specify how you are to be deemed incapacitated you can ask for instance that your agent get a second opinion to make sure you really are unable to handle your own affairs a non springing power of attorney document meanwhile goes into effect immediately upon signing that can be useful in a case where an agent wants to immediately take control to stop say abuse by a neighbor or caregiver without waiting for a doctors declaration of incapacity "you can go in and start safeguarding the assets right away " says john pankauski a west palm beach fla lawyer who specializes in lawsuits involving power of attorney abuses he adds that you really need to trust your agent to do a non springing power of attorney mr krooks suggests using a non springing document but not handing it over to your kids "tell them where it is " he says and once you lose your capacity they can use it another option is to use a so called revocable living trust these trusts go into effect while youre still alive and you can name another person as trustee to manage property in the trust once you become incapacitated many people name institutions such as banks or trust companies as trustees if theyre worried a family member might loot their money however you should still name an agent as power of attorney to handle assets not in the trust there is some recourse if your agent is accused of financial impropriety another loved one can petition a court to name a protective guardian or conservator typically court appointed guardians can be another family member or a third party such as a lawyer a bank a social worker or a specially trained professional guardian in the astor case mr marshalls son asked a court in july to remove his father from mrs astors affairs alleging that his father was neglecting mrs astor and enriching himself at her expense a judge appointed a longtime friend to oversee mrs astor and j p morgan chase &amp co to serve as the guardian of her estate once a guardian is appointed he or she then has legal standing to sue the agent to try to recover funds jeffrey skatoff a probate and estate planning lawyer in palm beach gardens fla says his firm recently handled a case in which a grandchild with power of attorney had "looted" an account "we got a guardian appointed filed a lawsuit for conversion and were able to set things right " in florida he adds treble damages often attach to lawsuits alleging elder abuse "so a civil lawsuit can be a powerful tool " also if you sense wrongdoing contact your local district attorneys office many of which have elder abuse units and let them investigate "unfortunately when people have authority over money sometimes very bad things happen " says mr pankauski the florida lawyer protecting your estate even trusted agents can abuse the power of attorney here are ways to prevent that set up checks and balances by naming multiple agents limit an agents power to make gifts of your property consider a living trust for your assets see related letter
