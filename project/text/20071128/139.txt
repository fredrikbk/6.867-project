western grocer modernizes passage to indias markets to open stores in india german retailer metro ag first had to teach farmers like n madhu to stop piling vegetables on the ground after picking them the bacteria from the dirt can slash the shelf life today mr madhus gourds go directly from the vine to the plastic crates metro gave him "they taught me if i stop using sacks and give them uniform sizes they will pay me the best price " said mr madhu one recent morning as he unloaded crates of green foot long gourds from his small family farm at the metro distribution center in hyderabad farmers like mr madhu are a critical part of operating in india for metro the worlds fourth largest food retailer measured in sales metro is the first western retailer to tackle a fundamental problem facing wal mart stores inc and other retailers trying to enter india today how to stock their huge supercenter stores with produce that must travel indias rough roads in outdated trucks and that come from farmers shepherds and fishermen who use techniques from a century ago for all the promise that indias retail industry holds it is estimated today at &# billion and growing it requires focusing as much on managing its supply chain as it does on attracting shoppers metros advantage over the others may appear slight since entering india in it has opened just three wholesale markets its customers are small retailers restaurants and hotels with another two scheduled to open next year but it has a huge advantage in infrastructure it has set up one of the first supply chains transporting refrigerated goods across india "stores are just the tip of the iceberg of the work is under water " says thomas hubner chief executive officer of metro cash &amp carry international the division that runs the companys india operations "people must be aware that setting up a business in india can take to years " wal mart which used its supply chain expertise as a critical weapon against rivals when expanding in the u s is teaming up with an indian partner bharti enterprises ltd "our wholesale cash and carry venture will invest in setting up an efficient supply chain that will link farmers and small manufacturers directly to retailers thereby maximizing value for farmers and manufacturers on the one end and retailers on the other " said a wal mart spokesman indias reliance industries ltd plans to open thousands of stores nationwide over the next five years and is also building a vast network of suppliers foreign retailers arent yet allowed to own stores in india they have to come in through franchise agreements with indian companies or as wholesalers they can also own logistics companies to supply to indian retailers "you have to start from scratch " says ira kalish director of consumer business for deloitte research lp in los angeles who has studied the indian consumer market "you start with an inefficient supply chain and gradually invest in improvements " indias traditional way of transporting vegetables can be seen in the southern city of hyderabad while the city is nicknamed cyberabad for its high tech companies its wholesale vegetable market is decidedly low tech large open trucks piled high with loose onions and carrots and sacks of green chilies sit roasting in the midday sun as they are unloaded onto the backs of long lines of wiry men the produce is weighed and then piled high in unrefrigerated warehouses vegetable traders use bags of squash as chairs and beds the produce is only about halfway on its journey to the consumer and it is already looking sad large distributors buy from the market and sell to midsize retailers who then sell to the mom and pop shops and cart pushers that make up the bulk of the indian grocery trade the chain can involve up to seven intermediaries economists estimate that up to of produce in india is ruined or lost metro is working to get that figure to at most metro says its supply chain for fruit and vegetables is too new to reliably say how much progress the company has made in fighting waste metro based in dusseldorf has experience building supply chains to stock its retail and wholesale stores in countries wal mart by comparison operates in half as many markets metro which posted &# billion in sales last year is under pressure to succeed in india because like wal mart it increasingly relies on international operations for growth "its a way of securing our future " says metros mr hubner "at some point our business in india and china will be bigger than that in europe my successor or that persons successor might be indian or chinese " when metro first opened a shop in bangalore four years ago locals didnt eat much fish because seafood didnt make it inland fresh enough to be edible so metro taught fishing crews how to cool fish by immediately gutting and stuffing them with shaved ice before few fishermen had ice and most used and reused chunks of ice that damaged the fish the company now sells up to five tons of seafood between and types of fish in the bangalore region every day metro managers visited shepherds to show them how to vaccinate their herds and treat the animals for sicknesses like bluetongue and foot and mouth disease metro imported british sheep to breed with their indian counterparts which tend to be too skinny for metros meat rack metro also had straightforward lessons for vegetable farmers dont water spinach the night before it is picked dont place cucumbers on the ground after you pick them pack fruit and vegetables in crates instead of burlap bags and dont store onions in warm warehouses or they will sprout and spoil metro cut out middlemen by sending its own truck drivers to collect directly from some farmers in trucks refrigerated to between and degrees it had to make sure its suppliers didnt turn off the refrigeration in their trucks to save gasoline a common practice among indian drivers to check metro started measuring ice cream from the center of the package to make sure there had been no melting along the way "in a place without any cooling systems at all a truck cooled to exactly degrees looks like a thing from the moon " says mr hubner such efforts to build a modern supply chain have met some resistance from middlemen who are used to transporting produce and now seeing their jobs eliminated under metros plan to protect the middlemen and local small retailers some indian states have banned foreign companies from selling agricultural products mr hubner says he expects this ban to be lifted soon because the company has gone through lengthy administrative steps with local authorities metros efforts have attracted restaurant owners who say they shop there because it has everything in one place and is rarely out of stock they used to buy vegetables rice meat and drinks from many small suppliers that often run out amit vohra a chef for the itc kakatiya hotel in hyderabad has been able to put seafood until recently a rarity in this landlocked city on his menu because he knows metro will consistently bring in fresh pomfret shrimp and lobster from the coast "now we have been able to have a week of seafood specials " he said as he looked behind the gills of a fish packed in shaved ice at metros hyderabad center "the big lobster was the star "
