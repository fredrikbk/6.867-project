hollywood bombs what if they held a war movie and no one came thats the tale of woe at this years fall box office where tinseltowns bleak vision of iraq has many movie goers taking a pass films from brian de palmas low budget screed "redacted" to robert redfords star studded "lions for lambs" are playing to empty seats small wonder as hollywood sees it the fictionalized stories worth telling about iraq and the war on terror involve the rape and murder of an iraqi girl by american soldiers "redacted" the kidnap and torture of an innocent egyptian "rendition" the duplicity of the army surrounding a soldiers death "in the valley of elah" and other american perfidy "lions for lambs" has performed so poorly that it may not make back its &# million investment this hasnt been a good year at the box office anyway but that only goes halfway to explaining the numbers both "rendition" and "in the valley of elah" have taken in less than &# million despite headliners like reese witherspoon and tommy lee jones attendance at mr redfords film dropped by after the first weekend as word got out of the movies antiwar speech making one online site filmcritic com described "lions for lambs" as an "op ed masquerading as a motion picture " entertainment weekly remarked of "redacted" that "war is hell and so is this movie " it is not impossible to make a successful antiwar film as the "deer hunter" and "platoon" proved regarding vietnam but they also came several years after that war ended when our soldiers still werent fighting and the public was in the mood for perspective thats a different audience than the one now in theaters which is less than thrilled at the opportunity to spend bucks to watch american soldiers depicted as rapists and murderers while our own real life troops are being killed by roadside bombs its always a difficult venture to turn tragedy into entertainment but war movies succeed when they capture the complex reality of the battlefield as well as the sacrifice and heroism that emerge from it americans dont seem amused to see their countrymen or country portrayed as immoral imperialists and they prefer to win the wars they start bring back john wayne or at least clint eastwood
