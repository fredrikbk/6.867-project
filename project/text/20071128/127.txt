the morning brief a parsing of annapolis and what comes next online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the good news is that the three main players at the peace conference in annapolis entered the process with weak positions that fuel what seem to be genuine desires for the bold deal they hope to reach next year the bad news is they enter the resulting negotiations with weak positions that only increase the odds against success the annapolis conference produced a "joint understanding" read aloud by president bush but shorn of details or even mention of any of the issues that fettered previous peacemaking in it mr bush israeli prime minster ehud olmert and mahmoud abbas president of the palestinian authority and plo chairman expressed a determination to end decades of bloodshed and suffering by immediately launching "good faith bilateral negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues including all core issues without exception as specified in previous agreements " they want to do so by the end of and plan to set up a steering committee that will meet "continuously" to make it happen the one allusion to more concrete steps is a commitment to follow through on obligations made under the "performance based road map" announced on april and that itself may trouble critics who find the middle east terrain so drastically altered since the map was drawn the road map outlined "clear phases timelines target dates and benchmarks" aimed at producing a "final and comprehensive settlement of the israel palestinian conflict by " and even putting outdated timelines aside it offers a thorny path for example at the outset of phase i the palestinian leadership was supposed to issue "unequivocal" recognition of israels right to exist but should that leadership now be mr abbas or the isolated and defunct but nevertheless elected hamas led government now mostly confined to gaza israel was charged in this phase with ending all incitement against palestinians but many palestinians view israels de facto blockade of gaza and its west bank security wall as just such incitement hamas yesterday rallied its supporters in gaza against the conference and promised more violence a day after thousands of israelis marched to protest the talks in annapolis as the washington post reports through the many bids for mideast peacemaking extremists have been able to use violence as a veto and the annapolis statement does offer one solid benchmark that might be used to judge whether they can continue to do so messrs abbas and olmert pledged to meet on a biweekly basis to follow up on negotiations and it could be an encouraging sign if the two men stick to those meetings rather than skip one in protest of the almost inevitable incidents that would inflame opposition to a deal in the israeli or palestinian camps israeli and palestinian sources tell haaretz that the statement was completed less than half an hour before it was announced and that it was only after u s secretary of state condoleezza rice took mr abbas out of a meeting with messrs bush and olmert and applied more pressure that he approved the draft document an analysis of the statement by al jazeera suggests why mr abbas was reluctant and the skepticism it faces back at home "if the run up to the meeting is any guide the morning after annapolis promises more of the same israeli rejection of deadlines frameworks or principles for the negotiations that we have witnessed so far " al jazeera says and if some readers are skeptical of al jazeeras coverage its argument illustrates how the more concrete compromises will have to come from israel israel wants security a domain mr abbas may have little power to control since the bigger threats now come from groups he himself now opposes the palestinians want land and specifically the homes that families left behind in israel proper and this "right of return " along with jerusalem remains the toughest points of contention any tough concessions will have to be made and defended by mr abbas and mr olmert whose authority at home is still damaged by the war in lebanon and never equaled that of his predecessor ariel sharon and any encouragement for a breakthrough would have to come from the monitor and judge of negotiations as envisaged by the statement the u s but this would be over an election year an echo of president clintons efforts of in which the white house may find it hard to press its israeli ally the white house said mr bush would serve as mediator while leaving workaday details to ms rice the new york times notes said white house spokeswoman dana perino "what the president told the leaders today is that hes only a phone call away " cables win is fcc chief martins loss the federal communications commission dropped what once seemed an ambitious plan to tighten regulation of the cable television industry in the face of what the new york times describes as a "lobbying blitzkrieg" by the cable companies and in what the wall street journal notes was a rare defeat for fcc chairman kevin martin the resulting compromise was "a significant though not total victory for the cable industry " since the commission agreed to postpone rather than reject outright a decision "over whether the cable television industry had grown so dominant that the agencys regulatory authority over it should be expanded " the times notes but the decision means "consumers probably wont soon be able to buy cable channels individually " the journal says adding that other items dropped from the agenda tuesday included a proposal to help increase minority and female ownership of media properties "commissioners complained that mr martin put too many contentious issues on the agenda and didnt allow enough time to study them " the journal reports his defeat yesterday signals a tougher road ahead for mr martins proposal to ease media ownership rules and allow companies to own both a broadcast station and newspaper in the top u s markets verizons bid to let freedom ring up sales one giant step for verizon wireless one gigantic step for the u s cellphone industry verizon the no american wireless carrier in terms of subscribers

industry a step closer to the model in much of the rest of the world where consumers can generally purchase devices independent of carriers and then plug them into their operator of choice " the wall street journal notes and it means consumers can now envisage the prospect of not having to buy a new phone when they switch services as the los angeles times points out verizon is calling the move a "transformation point in the year history of mass market wireless devices " and whether or not the decision lives up to that billing marketers and media companies expect it to be a boost for "those

of ad buys on verizon and tony nethercutt of admob says an open mobile ecosystem will make it "easier for mobile content and applications folks and easier for advertisers to participate " subpoenas suggest further mortgage uncertainty the federal trustee for bankruptcy courts subpoenaed mortgage giant countrywide financial "to determine whether the companys conduct in two foreclosures in southern florida represented abuses of the bankruptcy system " the new york times reports the late october subpoenas from the u s trustee a division of the justice department came as the agency said it was cracking down on the mortgage servicing firms that file false claims in foreclosure cases and as foreclosures around the u s are on the rise the times notes "the ways that lenders and loan servicers deal with troubled borrowers are also coming under increased scrutiny by judges " the paper says adding that three federal judges in ohio recently dismissed foreclosure cases brought by mortgage lenders and loan servicing companies against borrowers "because the companies failed to show proof that they owned the notes underlying the properties they were trying to seize " italy moves
