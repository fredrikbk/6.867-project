why lbo bust may be a sign of trouble ahead new york the last time the leveraged buyout machine looked this bad leg warmers were in style and the u s was led by a president named george bush apparently it is all over again turmoil in the credit markets and economic uncertainty have led buyers to return newly bought companies to the public market in recent months proving there simply isnt enough credit to go around this breakdown of the lbo machine has ramifications for the equities market not only are some valuations buoyed by premiums once offered by private equity buyers the flight of this "smart money" suggests more doldrums ahead so far most of the dashed deals have ties to housing finance or the consumer since august leveraged buyouts of car radio maker harman international industries inc lender sallie mae inc music shop guitar center inc and building equipment leaser united rentals inc are among those that have dissolved or run into trouble because of failed debt offerings it is as though private equity firms were shopping with maxed out credit cards and now have to make decisions accordingly this gradual disintegration of the leveraged buyout market has actually been a positive for the debt markets which were weighed down by an unprecedented backlog of supply a few months back but it isnt all good news the last buyout bust of this scale in began with the dissolution of a few deals and ended with the subsequent collapse of a financial institution and a stock market "crashette " "this feels a lot like and the blow up of the ual buyout which was followed by three or four years of anemic economic performance taking a tremendous toll on both equity and bond markets " said anders maxwell managing director at peter j solomon co who was a junk bond salesman and trader during the late s correction "this is in many respects potentially more problematic given the very real problems in corporate as well as consumer credit " the unraveling this time around similarly began with the collapse of a few deals there is again speculation that a major bank may have to merge as a result of recent losses and the stock markets already showing signs of weakening all harbingers of another recession risk aversion has kept a contingent of junk bond and leveraged loan buyers sidelined since early this summer enough time that deals have fallen into jeopardy "we seem to have a minitrend here and i think it will continue because the marginal buyers of a lot of these kind of deals these highly levered lbo deals have basically pulled back substantially " said margie patel portfolio manager at evergreen investments "in all these deals demand that looked likely in the spring early summer has just evaporated " one of the major buyers of debt like leveraged loans and junk bonds which are used to fund these buyouts are structured products in the form of collateralized loan and collateralized debt obligations the creation of these vehicles has slowed dramatically if not come to a complete standstill amid turmoil in the credit markets and a broader based risk aversion that has spread from the subprime mortgage market to the rest of the capital markets market participants breathed a sigh of relief when banks managed to sell financing for kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co s roughly &# billion buyout of first data corp in late september yet the loans came at deep discounts to entice buyers and bankers were able to sell only a portion of the companys total debt package "pre first data everyone thought everything was going to fall apart post first data everyone thought nothing was going to fall apart " a risk arbitrager at a major investment bank said "now its what it should be there are standards and everything has a price " investors are being choosier now about what lbo bonds and loans they buy because there are risks in the economy that didnt exist when the deals were negotiated before the fallout of the subprime mortgage market "were not so far down the slope where everything systematically is going to fall apart " the risk arbitrager said "were certainly at a point where debt investors are choosing where they believe risk is appropriately priced " yet the formerly courted companies may not see it that way when kohlberg kravis roberts and goldman sachs group inc sought to dissolve the harman buyout citing a "material adverse change " company officials insisted that their business remained on an even keel despite a cut to fiscal first quarter profit projections that was mostly because of increased research and development costs primarily at its car radio business which the company said wasnt a surprise eventually goldman and kkr agreed to invest &# million in harmans debt securities possibly to avoid a protracted fight "the deals that are most in jeopardy are the ones that were most reliant on exceptionally attractive financing " said paul scanlon managing director at putnam investments "if that financing is no longer available it clearly has some potential for those deals to unravel " when bond offerings to third parties fail in the financing markets as guitar centers did recently banks normally have to carry "bridge loans" on their own books thats extra risk exposure particularly given mounting troubles in the financial sector and current fears about a consumer spending slowdown it is made worse by the fact that the junk bond and leveraged loan markets are actually in as bad a shape as they were in at the height of the credit crisis this summer bankers were unable to sell the hundreds of billions of lbo debt they had on their books after the markets seized up in the end of july as a result of subprime contagion and the massive supply backlog a supply window opened up in october and issuers took advantage of it yet were left with as bad a market as they faced in the worst of times "they prefer to sell debt in these little cycles these binge cycles where the market gets hungry and they stuff it and the market backs off and they wait to do deals again " said justin monteith market analyst at kdp investment advisors "it would be easier on everybodys nerves if it was done in a more organized fashion " even if it were peter j solomons mr maxwell said there are enough troubling indicators in the market from fears about a slowdown in consumer spending to defaults in the mortgage market to woes in the corporate sector that the collapse of several lbos signals a turning point in the economy at large "these large visible and highly leveraged transactions reflect the froth in the market " he said "the collapse of several of these deals is analogous to prior cycles when record breaking and highly geared buyouts marked the top its downhill from there "
