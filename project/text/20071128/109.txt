interview officials at more than agencies and is examining white house emails and documents in one email sent by the u s drug control office and disclosed this summer an official quotes mr rove as being pleased that officials at the commerce transportation and agriculture departments went "above and beyond" the call of duty in arranging appearances by cabinet members at republican campaign

already found one alleged violation at the general services administration where rove deputies gave a presentation on jan at the end of the presentation according to a report by mr blochs office on

bush mr bloch urged that ms doan "be disciplined to the fullest extent for her serious violation of the hatch act" and for failing to cooperate "fully and honestly" with the probe the white house hasnt acted on mr blochs request in a response ms doan said the investigation was "far off the mark " her lawyer urged the white house to ignore mr blochs findings citing a "clear lack of objectivity and impartiality " now mr bloch is facing claims that he too isnt cooperating with investigators agents working for the inspector general of the office of personnel management are seeking his emails
