not for the faint of heart value focused mutual funds name a big company stock you didnt want to own this year and theres a good chance its in the portfolio of your large cap value fund for the managers of "value" mutual funds whose strategy is to seek out beaten down stocks financial stocks are often a major holding upward of one third of many funds holdings this year has been no exception unfortunately financial companies banks and investment houses are among the companies most heavily bloodied by the collapse of the residential real estate market the average large cap value fund is down so far this year according to morningstar inc but that average disguises double digit losses at a number of well regarded value funds among them touchstone large cap value fund is down and the hotchkis &amp wiley core value fund has lost investors in weitz value run by veteran value manager wally weitz are down that contrasts with a increase in the standard &amp poors stock index including dividends and an gain in the average large cap growth fund the portfolios of these battered value funds amount to a whos who of stocks that have lost or more in citigroup inc freddie mac home depot inc countrywide financial corp and american international group inc to name a few fund managers missed the extent to which many of these companies such as citigroup were exposed to low quality mortgages that are vulnerable to financing problems in the case of countrywide with companies like home depot they underestimated the degree to which consumers would rein in their spending in some cases these value managers are throwing in the towel on some names while standing firm on others touchstones manager john schneider for example has dumped countrywide but has been holding on to fannie mae and freddie mac "being a value manager is not for the faint of heart " said mr schneider who has been in the money management business for years "you have to wade in when everybody else is fearful " others share that sentiment the managers of the &# billion dodge &amp cox stock fund recently used the battering of financial stocks as a chance to build a new position in aig shares after many years for investors in these funds its much the same idea over the long run value investing is a proven strategy the basic idea is that a stock bought at less than the true value of a company is more likely to go up and also has less room to fall if the thesis doesnt hold up however one warning for fund shareholders some funds are selling out of stocks either because of strategy changes or to meet investor withdrawals and shareholders could be stuck with capital gains tax bills as a result but while being a contrarian is often at the heart of value investing the losses posted by these value managers could be seen as their turn at the same whipping post that left managers of "growth" stock funds those looking for fast growing companies scarred at the end of the tech stock bull market several years ago the problem back then growth fund managers didnt appreciate the extent and speed to which the decline would spread once the bubble popped in a recent conference call with investors mr weitz said his firm missed the extent to which negative sentiment would overwhelm their investment philosophy in the short term "we really did expect trouble in the mortgage world but i think we were way complacent about how the reaction of others would affect our own stocks " said mr weitz who founded his money management firm years ago in fact early this year mr weitz devoted several pages of a shareholder newsletter to the then brewing subprime mortgage problem his approach was in part to look for companies that he felt could take advantage of the growing crisis he believed one such company was redwood trust a real estate investment trust that provides financing to the residential mortgage market mr weitz was impressed that the firms management had been warning of an impending real estate market collapse and building a cash stockpile no matter redwood is down this year in an interview mr weitz said he still believes redwood is poised to come out of its troubles in strong shape "but all people hear right now is that theyre taking on credit risk " he said george davis chief executive officer at hotchkis &amp wiley capital management argues that the declines in financial stocks are overdone when it comes to banks the market is underestimating the resiliency of income they generate from lending asset management and other fee generating businesses he said "theyre only looking at the punitive markdowns in the problem areas " the decline in the oakmark select fund is causing manager william nygren to feel the heat from some shareholders who want the fund to scale back its roughly stake in financial stocks and invest elsewhere such as energy mr nygren is sticking to his guns trying to "reverse those positions right now" is "all backwards looking " he said its a different story at the muhlenkamp fund which is down this year fund manager ronald muhlenkamp has trimmed his stake in home builder stocks to less than from in june sold half of the funds countrywide position and cut its citigroup holding to about from nearly "i ran out of guts so we sold some of this down " mr muhlenkamp said on a mid october conference call with financial advisers mr muhlenkamp has been adding to stocks like boeing co corning inc terex corp and cisco systems inc the thinking such companies produce goods for foreign consumers and benefit from the weakness in the u s dollar those stocks also are sporting higher valuations than beaten down countrywide and citigroup mr davis of hotchkis &amp wiley sees a different outcome than the aftermath of the tech stock bubble where some firms had business models that turned out to be unviable "these are companies that have tangible value " he said "with the home builders sure home prices can decline and land prices can decline but they are worth something "
