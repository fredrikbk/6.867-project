polish finance chiefs tall order warsaw jacek rostowski a united kingdom born economics professor with a courtly manner who rather improbably finds himself finance minister of poland just wants people to calm down "to paraphrase bank of england governor mervyn king my ambition would be to make economic policy boring " he said in a recent interview that could be one of the more difficult tasks facing mr rostowski his new boss prime minister donald tusk is riding a wave of exuberant hopes after his pro business civic platform party won a come from behind victory over jaroslaw kaczynskis ruling conservatives oct in a snap general election it isnt in mr rostowskis nature to be boring the year old sometimes regales friends with tales of growing up in the governors mansion on the seychelles islands where his exiled polish father pursued a second career in britains colonial service and he became something of an enfant terrible in european central bank circles in the late s when he and colleague andrzej bratkowski proposed that poland and other fast growing candidates for european union membership unilaterally adopt the euro now the graduate of the london school of economics and professor at central european university in budapest must make good on mr tusks pledge to deliver an "economic miracle" that will slow and eventually reverse a job seeking exodus of two million poles to western europe the recipe would be a mixture of public spending curbs tax cuts and a downsized and deregulated public sector "i like the idea that we picked an economist of the british school " said civic platforms hanna gronkiewicz waltz who ran polands central bank for most of the s and is now mayor of warsaw "hell reduce the fiscal deficit like gordon brown did as chancellor of the exchequer but not in a way that will hurt economic growth " however this program must be squared with mr tusks campaign promises to lift wages for underpaid teachers and doctors while replacing a crumbling road system with a thousand miles of gleaming motorway as part of vast infrastructure investments co financed with the european union "whoever says you can cut taxes raise wages and reduce the fiscal deficit definitely believes in miracles i have my doubts " said jerzy hausner an economist and former deputy prime minister and economy minister whose plan to rationalize bloated social spending in the early s was blunted by opposition within his own social democrats then rolled back by mr kaczynskis conservatives in based on that experience mr hausner said mr rostowskis main goal should be to aim for a budget surplus by only that can help buffer polands economy from an inevitable cyclical downturn he says "what we learned in is that the instant the economy slows we have a crisis in public finances " mr hausner said polands debt hovers just below of gross domestic product a level mr rostowski said he would like to cut by four to seven percentage points "the purpose of prudent fiscal policy is to achieve a prudent debt to gdp ratio " he said "its a cushion for when the economy goes down " mr rostowski is guarded about how he plans to attack the fiscal deficit noting that he first needs to get an inside look at budget accounts looming is an estimated billion zloty &# billion loss in tax revenue next year "the bottom line is that we need to reduce public debt and tax rates while maintaining macroeconomic balance and allowing for prudent increases in public expenditure " mr rostowski said "but this needs to be in a medium term framework it doesnt all have to be done on day one " in this he appears well in tune with the new prime minister who has said his approach is "making a lot of small changes add up to one big one "
