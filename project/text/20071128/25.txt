cessnas new plane to be built in china lower costs may make flying more accessible as pilot ranks dwindle textron inc s cessna aircraft co will become the first u s manufacturer to turn over complete production of an airplane to a chinese partner a move intended to cut production costs and foster a nascent private aviation market in china cessna officials said chinas state owned shenyang aircraft corp will build the new cessna skycatcher at its factory in shenyang china the planned single engine two seat airplane will be the smallest in cessnas product line it is designed for training and what is known as the light sport market for recreational fliers cessna hopes manufacturing in china will help keep the price of the plane low enough to attract new pilots to counter the dwindling ranks of u s recreational fliers it also could lower the cost barrier for training new pilots amid surging demand for airline pilots world wide the deal is scheduled to be announced this morning in china at a news conference in beijing cessna which said this summer that it would build the plane estimates it will be available by late lewis campbell textrons chairman and chief executive said in an interview that lower manufacturing costs in china would allow cessna to sell the airplane for &# less than it would if it had built the plane at its factories in wichita kan the move also positions cessna to play a larger role in the developing private and corporate aviation market in china "this will give us a foothold into a market that will expand over the next to years " mr campbell said mr campbell is also a director of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal some training schools in china already have ordered the airplane cessna said boeing co and airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co have used chinese manufacturers for years to build parts for their planes neither of them has been willing to rely on outsiders to produce an entire product line as cessna plans cessna says it will design the airplane and build the first prototypes in the u s but all of the production airplanes will be fabricated in china items such as engines and electronics will be supplied by teledyne continental motors inc and garmin ltd in the u s and shipped to china for installation and test flights airplanes destined for delivery in the u s and elsewhere will be partially dismantled for shipping and reassembled at approved cessna locations the company said cessna will provide on site personnel to oversee manufacturing and quality assurance china has been home for component work for western aircraft but that involves less technical know how than building a plane from scratch in the s mcdonnell douglas corp attempted to build an assembly line in china for its single aisle md jetliner but the reception for the planes outside china was lukewarm and the venture was abandoned in after only a handful were assembled airbus is working with china to build a secondary assembly line for its a jet in tianjin but that factory will put together large assemblies from existing airbus plants in europe mr campbell said textron of providence r i chose to partner with shenyang because of the chinese manufacturers history of producing chinese military and civil airplanes as well as components for most of the worlds big names in aerospace shenyang aircraft corp is a unit of china aviation industry corp i commonly known as avic i luo yang chairman and president of shenyang aircraft wrote in a release that the company "sees cessna as a significant partner " lin zouming president of avic i said the government consortium "has placed strategic importance on general aviation development and will strongly support and promote the business " cessna said it will be able to deliver the first planes for sale at &# each with subsequent planes costing &# each by comparison the four seat cessna cessnas next cheapest model carries a base price of almost &# the company said customers have preordered almost skycatchers cessna president jack pelton said that without chinas participation cessna probably wouldnt have started the skycatcher program "if you are going to field a low end product this is about the only way you can do it " mr pelton said he said the move wont result in a loss of jobs at cessnas main plants adding that cessna has unfilled orders valued at &# billion with plans to expand its profitable business jet line manufacturers of small propeller driven airplanes have faced increasing pressure in recent years to make their products more affordable the equation has become especially complicated during the past couple of years as oil prices have driven the price of aviation gasoline above &# a gallon in many metropolitan areas government officials and pilot groups say the rising cost of airplane ownership has contributed to an almost drop in the number of licensed pilots in the u s since to about despite the drop the light sport niche has attracted new manufacturers and models in recent years as remaining pilots upgrade to advanced planes growing demand for air travel also has led to a tight market for pilots world wide which threatens to stifle the industrys growth the problem is particularly acute in china and india both of which have ordered hundreds of new jetliners to meet an explosion in demand for domestic and international air travel in recent years the chinese government has loosened some of the many restrictions on private aviation and encouraged the development of an indigenous flight training industry yet according to industry groups there are about business jets in all of china although that number is growing "it took us years to put the first jets into china then last year alone we delivered " said roger whyte cessnas senior vice president for sales and marketing according to the civil aviation administration of china the country had nonmilitary pilots in january the last date for which figures were available about students were enrolled among five civilian flight schools two scientific research centers and scientific research bases one of the most prominent the civil aviation flight university of china has tripled its yearly capacity to students and now operates one of the largest fleets of training planes in the world by the end of the year the university will have cessna s and six cessna cj jets in its fleet of airplanes yang zhou contributed to this article
