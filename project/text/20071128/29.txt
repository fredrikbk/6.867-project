business world i spy few movies have been as lucky as "the china syndrome " released less than two weeks before the three mile island nuclear accident "look " a new film doesnt have jane fonda and michael douglas and isnt the product of a major studio but it does have a theme that the right headline could turn into a national preoccupation that theme is surveillance no jack lemmon gets up to speechify about the dangers of runaway technology the movie is about as far from a political manifesto as a film can get then again "china syndrome" didnt have much sex while "look" has lots of sex in public places barry schuler its co producer says he began thinking about the subject surveillance not sex in a previous job as chief executive of aol when subpoenas began arriving for access to member emails adam rifkin the films director and screenwriter previous projects include "mousehunt" and "small soldiers" had a similar epiphany he was nailed by a traffic camera for running a red light they were frankly lucky to get an r rating for their film a loose hanging collection of intersecting plotlines portrayed by an ensemble of little known but interesting actors whose stories are seen entirely from the perspective of surveillance cameras in atm machines high school parking lots a department store stockroom etc the characters are mostly unaware their behavior and misbehavior is being recorded the audience isnt hence the films ingenious charm in his own research mr schuler says he found that most of the nations million closed circuit surveillance tvs arent monitored by security pros theyre watched by teenagers not all of whom are above making highlight reels and posting them on youtube says mr schuler "we want people to start thinking is this ok " hes no hair on fire alarmist he likes the fact that surveillance helps "catch the bad guys " but the nature of the beast is also changing surveillance cameras in the future will be networked linked to each other and to computers capable of face recognition and other kinds of pattern recognition and thus able to extract information about who and what the camera is seeing mr schuler says jokingly he covers his face now when he visits an atm in the future thats just the behavior that may cause the system to pay him more notice whats he got to be bashful about wheres his car been what web sites has he visited the computers will want to know the subject matter of "look" already is of urgent interest to technologists and civil liberties enthusiasts if not yet the average moviegoer in a much noted october speech donald kerr who serves as no overseeing the nations intelligence agencies laid out a hard truth "in our interconnected and wireless world " he said "anonymity or the appearance of anonymity is quickly becoming a thing of the past " and our only hope for "privacy" meaning some degree of control over who has access to our private information he argued is by trusting government dr kerrs speech was not well received by privacy activists and the civil liberties community it might help to ask what exactly we are afraid of or should be afraid of that our embarrassing emails and web habits will be shared with spouses and employers not unlikely in our lawsuit culture that surveillance will be used to punish dissent in russia almost guaranteed a gradual shift in the balance of power between citizen and state that would make freedom increasingly an empty concept mr schulers movie doesnt offer answers the cameras for the most part are just there ignored by the characters as they engage in various kinds of illicit childish and occasionally admirable behavior it just so happens though that a large scale experiment in the "surveillance society" is already underway in britain reputedly the most monitored society in the free world thanks to thousands of networked police cameras to enforce traffic laws and congestion tolls and to deter crime over time the prevailing motive that has emerged is neither orwellian nor especially sinister but merely mercenary surveillance is used chiefly to extract money from the public for the agencies and jurisdictions that operate the cameras happily the experiment also shows that normal democratic pushback is helping to curb excesses by questioning the competence and motives of government after steadily increasing for years the latest data for show the number of drivers ticketed by speed cameras actually fell slightly thanks to public blowback against what the royal automobile club calls "overzealous" enforcement designed to "maximize the number of tickets rather than reduce the number of accidents " one result now a government plan for a national biometric id is hanging by a thread after revelations last week that two discs with personal and banking details of seven million families were lost in the mail by a government tax agency all this suggests the best hope for taming the new technology is simply voters learning curve "look " which opens in los angeles and new york in mid december and hopes to ride a wave of public interest to national distribution not only is a disturbingly inventive piece of entertainment from a certain perspective its also a kind of public service announcement though wed still recommend leaving the kids at home if only to spare them embarrassment at your embarrassment
