job prospects pain from free trade spurs second thoughts mr blinders shift spotlights warnings of deeper downside for decades alan s blinder princeton university economist former federal reserve board vice chairman and perennial adviser to democratic presidential candidates argued along with most economists that free trade enriches the u s and its trading partners despite the harm it does to some workers "like of economists since the days of adam smith i am a free trader down to my toes " he wrote back in politicians heeded this advice and with occasional dissents steadily dismantled barriers to trade yet today mr blinder has changed his message helping lead a growing band of economists and policy makers who say the downsides of trade in todays economy are deeper than they once realized mr blinder whose trenchant writing style and phrase making add to his influence remains an implacable opponent of tariffs and trade barriers but now he is saying loudly that a new industrial revolution communication technology that allows services to be delivered electronically from afar will put as many as million american jobs at risk of being shipped out of the country in the next decade or two thats more than double the total of workers employed in manufacturing today the job insecurity those workers face today is "only the tip of a very big iceberg " mr blinder says the critique comes as public skepticism about allowing an unfettered flow of goods services people and money across borders is intensifying including some republicans as well as many democrats see related article on page a the rethinking is helping free trade foes underscoring the urgency of helping those battered by globalization and clouding the outcome of a hot debate should government encourage forces of globalization or try to restrain them some trade critics are bothered by the disappointing performance of latin america since it slashed tariffs in the s and s while more protectionist china and southeast asia sped ahead others are struck by the widening gap between economic winners and losers around the globe the rethinking on trade issues is the most significant since the early s when many in the u s worried that japan would overtake the u s a fear that has since abated some critics are going public with reservations theyve long harbored quietly nobel laureate paul samuelson whose textbook taught generations damns "economists over simple complacencies about globalization" and says rich country workers arent always winners from trade he made that point in a essay that stunned colleagues lawrence summers a cheerleader for trade expansion as clinton treasury secretary says people who argue globalization is inevitable and retraining is enough to help displaced workers offer "pretty thin gruel" to the anxious global middle class others are finding the debate moving closer to positions theyve had for years ralph gomory international business machines corp s former chief scientist who now heads the alfred p sloan foundation says that changing technology and the rise of china and india could make the u s an also ran if it loses many of its important industries harvard economist dani rodrik says global trade negotiations should focus on erecting new barriers against globalization not lowering them to help poor nations build domestic industries and give rich nations more time to retrain workers mr blinders job loss estimates in particular are electrifying democratic candidates searching for ways to address angst about trade "alan because of his stature provided a degree of legitimacy to what many of us had come to feel anecdotally that the anxiety over outsourcing and offshoring was a far larger phenomenon than traditional economic analysis was showing " says gene sperling an adviser to president clinton and now to hillary clinton her rival barack obama spent an hour with mr blinder earlier in this year mr blinders answer is not protectionism a word he utters with the contempt that cold warriors reserved for communism rather mr blinder still believes the principle british economist david ricardo introduced years ago nations prosper by focusing on things they do best their "comparative advantage" and trading with other nations with different strengths he accepts the economic logic that u s trade with large low wage countries like india and china will make all of them richer eventually he acknowledges that trade can create jobs in the u s and bolster productivity growth but he says the harm done when some lose jobs and others get them will be far more painful and disruptive than trade advocates acknowledge he wants government to do far more for displaced workers than the few months of retraining it offers today he thinks the u s education system must be revamped so it prepares workers for jobs that cant easily go overseas and is contemplating changes to the tax code that would reward companies that produce jobs that stay in the u s his critique puts mr blinder in a minority among economists most of whom emphasize the enormous gains from trade "hes dead wrong " says columbia university economist jagdish bhagwati who will debate mr blinder at harvard in may over his assertions about the magnitude of job losses from trade mr bhagwati says that in highly skilled fields such as medicine law and accounting "if we do a real balance sheet i have no doubt were creating far more jobs than were losing " mr blinder says that misses his point the original industrial revolution the move from farm to factory unquestionably boosted living standards but triggered an enormous change in "how and where people lived how they educated their children the organization of businesses the form and practices of governments " he says todays trickle of jobs overseas where they are tethered to the u s by fiber optic cables is the beginning of a change of similar dimensions and american society needs similarly far reaching changes to cope "im trying to convince a bunch of economists who are deeply skeptical and hard to convince " he says mr blinder years old a princeton college graduate with a ph d from massachusetts institute of technology has been on the princeton faculty since he is known for his work on macroeconomics and a liberal bent captured by the title of a book "hard heads soft hearts tough minded economics for a just society " when he talked about trade in the past mr blinder emphasized its great benefits his undergraduate economics textbook first published in says "the facts are not consistent" with the popular notion that "cheap foreign labor steals jobs from americans and puts pressure on u s businesses to lower wages " when mr blinder went to washington in to join president clintons council of economic advisers he became even more convinced of the benefits of free trade he saw steel aluminum and farming lobbyists fight for export subsidies or protection from imports and then passing the costs to consumers "i came out a much more radical free trader than i went in " he says as a clinton aide he helped sell the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada although he says he disagreed with the administration pitch that it would create jobs in u s economic theory teaches that trade changes the types of jobs in an economy not the overall number but he bowed to mr clintons political savvy "if he had left the salesmanship to me nafta would have failed " he says mr blinder left the white house after months for the fed in and immediately was mentioned as a possible successor to alan greenspan he left in and returned to princeton where he still teaches introductory economics six years ago he cashed in on his prominence by joining former clinton banking regulator eugene ludwig in a firm that advises troubled banks and another that deciphers the fed and other central bankers for a hefty price at princeton he began to reassess some of his views on trade visiting the yearly business gabfest in davos switzerland in january he heard executives talk excitedly about moving jobs overseas that not long ago seemed anchored in the u s he was silent when his former princeton student n gregory mankiw then chairman of president bushs council of economic advisers unleashed a political firestorm by reciting standard theory but appearing indifferent to pain caused to those whose jobs go overseas "does it matter from an economic standpoint whether items produced abroad come on planes and ships or over fiber optic cables " mr mankiw said at a february briefing "well no the economics is basically the same more things are tradable than in the past and thats a good thing " mr blinder says he agreed with mr mankiws point that the economics of trade are the same however imports are delivered but hed begun to wonder if the technology that allowed english speaking workers in india to do the jobs of american workers at lower wages was "a good thing" for many americans at a princeton dinner a wall street executive told mr blinder how pleased her company was with the securities analysts it had hired in india from new york times columnist thomas friedmans book "the world is flat " he found anecdotes about competition to u s workers "in walks of life i didnt know about " mr blinder began to muse about this in public at a council on foreign relations forum in january he called "offshoring " or the exporting of u s jobs "the big issue for the next generation of americans " eight months later on capitol hill he warned that "tens of millions of additional american workers will start to experience an element of job insecurity that has heretofore been reserved for manufacturing workers " at the urging of former clinton treasury secretary robert rubin mr blinder wrote an essay "offshoring the next industrial revolution " published last year in foreign policy "the old assumption that if you cannot put it in a box you cannot trade it is hopelessly obsolete " he wrote "the cheap and easy flow of information around the globe will require vast and unsettling adjustments in the way americans and residents of other developed countries work live and educate their children " in that paper he made a "guesstimate" that between million and million jobs were "potentially offshorable " since then he has been refining those estimates by painstakingly ranking occupations as described by the bureau of labor statistics to identify how likely each is to go overseas from that he derives his latest estimate that between million and million jobs are vulnerable he says the most important divide is not as commonly argued between jobs that require a lot of education and those that dont its not simply that skilled jobs stay in the us and lesser skilled jobs go to india or china the important distinction is between services that must be done in the u s and those that can or will someday be delivered electronically with little degradation in quality the more personal work of divorce lawyers isnt likely to go overseas for instance while some of the work of tax lawyers could be civil engineers who have to be on site could be in great demand in the u s computer engineers might not be mr blinders warnings and his numbers are now firmly planted in the political debate over trade and sometimes invoked by those whose views are distinctly more protectionist than mr blinder richard trumka for instance secretary treasurer of the afl cio cited them in an indictment of "free market fundamentalism" and a call for "more balanced trade policies that protect the rights of workers " diana farrell head of the mckinsey global institute a pro globalization think tank arm of the consulting firm that has done its own analysis of vulnerable jobs calls mr blinder "an alarmist" and frets about the impact he is having on politicians particularly the democrats who see resistance to free trade as a political winner she insists many jobs that could go overseas wont actually go ms farrell says mr blinders work doesnt take into account the realities of business which make exporting of some jobs impractical or which create offsetting gains elsewhere in the u s economy he counters he is looking further into the future than mckinsey or years instead of five and expects more technological change than the consultants do "even without the buck rogers stuff " mr blinder says theres an urgent need to retool americas education system so it trains young people for jobs likely to remain in the u s just telling them to go to college to compete in the global economy is insufficient a college diploma he warns "may lose its exalted silver bullet status " it isnt how many years one spends in school that will matter he says its choosing to learn the skills for jobs that cannot easily be delivered electronically from afar similarly he says any changes to the tax code should encourage employers to create jobs that are harder to perform overseas while mr gomory the former ibm chief scientist suggests tax breaks for companies that create "high value added jobs " mr blinder says the focus should be on jobs with person to person contact regardless of pay and skill levels from child day care providers to physicians mostly he wants to shock politicians policy makers and other economists into realizing how big a change is coming and what new sectors it will reach "this is something factory workers have understood for a generation " he says "its now coming down on the heads of highly educated politically vocal people and theyre not going to take it "
