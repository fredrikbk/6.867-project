in the fray small departure large problem the only surprise in mondays news that smithsonian institution secretary lawrence m small had resigned is that it hadnt happened sooner the reason for mr smalls departure was the fallout on capitol hill from an inspector generals report that showed him billing the smithsonian for such lavish expenses as first class air travel and home maintenance costs albeit with the approval of the board of regents the smithsonians governing body mr small might have weathered this storm as he had others during his seven year tenure were it not for threats by sen charles grassley r iowa and others on the hill to freeze a &# million increase in the smithsonians budget unless mr smalls office changed its ways mr small who came to the smithsonian from fannie mae after many years at citibank has opened two new museums renovated two others and raised about &# billion yet for much of his tenure it seemed he could not get out of bed without igniting some controversy early on he caused an uproar by promising big donors control over the way their monetary gifts were used thus blurring the traditional church state boundary between fund raising and programming he allowed general motors and other corporations to muddy the distinction between sponsorship and commercial advertising he installed as head of the renovated national portrait gallery not an art historian but cultural historian marc pachter who blithely admitted to lee rosenbaum for an article on this page that "i personally dont do brushstrokes " things werent much better outside the smithsonian where mr smalls personal life repeatedly cast a pall over the institution in he was convicted of buying art containing feathers from birds on the endangered species list and then got into a tussle with the judge on what form his community service sentence should take last year a government report implicated him in the fannie mae scandal so now the smithsonian must search for a replacement early reports that sheila p burke a former political operative she was once sen robert doles chief of staff and currently the smithsonians chief operating officer is a serious contender for the post are not reassuring the smithsonian doesnt need another leader from outside the world of the arts and sciences and unfamiliar with the unique culture of the nonprofit world whats called for now is a figure in the mold of the carnegie endowments vartan gregorian who in stints running brown university and most famously the new york public library showed that it is possible to raise money and maintain an institution while keeping faith with the values it embodies but overdue as it was mr smalls departure will amount to very little unless it becomes an occasion to address some longstanding problems the first is the smithsonians governance as the preceding resume shows the board of regents should have picked up on plenty of warning signs that mr small was more of a liability than an asset or was he whatever his failings as an administrator he certainly knew how to raise money and its hard to escape the conclusion that as long as mr small kept the checks coming in the regents were only too willing to look the other way at least until his actions threatened the support of the smithsonians primary source of funding capitol hill more fundamentally there is the smithsonians governing structure itself the board of regents is headed by the chief justice and includes the vice president and assorted members of congress along with a number of private citizens whatever luster these public officials add to the smithsonians letterhead its unrealistic to expect them to exercise meaningful oversight given their other responsibilities oh to have seen chief justice robertss expression when he learned that besides running an entire branch of government he was responsible for museums and research facilities plus a zoo beyond governance the smithsonians entire basis of operations needs review at the moment congress provides some of its roughly &# billion annual budget with the institution itself responsible for the rest that may be an enviable figure to some public largess to most cultural institutions amounts to far less but it so limits the smithsonians other revenue raising options that its like wearing golden handcuffs close the gap by charging admission like other museums out of the question says congress visitors have already paid admission with their taxes one previous secretary who floated that idea was warned that for every penny the institution took in at the gate congress would dock its appropriation accordingly this is the financial environment mr small was forced to operate in you can criticize his fund raising methods his often skewed sense of priorities and his insensitivity to the intellectual culture of the smithsonian but under the circumstances what choice did he have other than to aggressively cultivate private and corporate donors the smithsonian doesnt just need a new secretary it needs an entirely new modus operandi mr gibson is the journals leisure &amp arts features editor
