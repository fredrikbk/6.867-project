lawmakers join hunt to bag big donors early presidential herd spurs rush for limited funds i get a lot of invites the unusually early and intense fund raising push in the presidential campaign is spurring congressional candidates into a hasty money chase as well just two months after the current class of lawmakers was sworn in the sheer number of campaigns hunting for seed money has intensified the competition to tap big donors before they bump up against either legal or self imposed caps on what they can give during the current election cycle fund raisers say the rematch between democrats and republicans for control of the house and senate is also ratcheting up what has become a perpetual campaign finance cycle wealthy donors have always tended to give early in campaign cycles as favors to friends and business associates or because they are acquainted with candidates "more fund raising is going on by members of congress because theyre competing with so many presidential candidates " says jan baran a washington campaign finance lawyer individual campaign contributions are limited to &# per candidate per election and &# for all candidates donors also can contribute an additional &# to political action committees and parties "its a small group of people but of them are in new york washington palm beach and hollywood " says david hansen who managed the re election campaign of veteran utah republican sen orrin hatch this quarter is "light years more active" than previous election cycles says mr hansen even though he isnt up again until mr hatch attended a fund raiser in his behalf this month in palm beach fla wealthy donors say they also met this month with sen arlen specter r pa whose term is up in at donald trumps acre mar a lago golf resort for a fund raiser organized by longtime republican consultant roger stone "theres guys running for president on the republican side and senators are competing with them for everyones money " mr stone says sen mel martinez r fla also up for re election in has begun an early round of fund raising too this month he attended a fund raiser at the home of a fort lauderdale attorney much of the action has taken place in private homes and hotels in big money hot spots sen jay rockefeller d w va sen mary landrieu d la sen carl levin d mich sen tom harkin d iowa and sen richard durbin d ill all have had events in new york sponsored on their behalf in recent weeks all are up for re election next year mr durbin has attended about more fund raisers for his campaign this quarter than in the same period in the election cycle says his illinois chief of staff michael daly who has run the illinois democrats campaigns since seasoned politicos for their part have also noticed the difference "i get a lot of invites many more than in the past " says gifford miller a former new york city council speaker concrete data on fund raising to date in wont be available until mid april when candidates are required to file their first quarter reports with the federal election commission but campaign staffers say that beyond pressures caused by the early presidential jockeying what could be a record setting quarter for money gathering is driven by the ever steeper cost of elections and there is always a bit of a frenzied push early in campaigns to establish momentum at this stage then candidates tend to focus on corralling big ticket contributors who can give campaigns an air of viability as well as cash before embarking on the more exhaustive hunt for small donors other factors are also accelerating congressional fund raising activity the stakes in senate races are particularly high for one thing democrats captured control in with the narrowest of margins making it extremely difficult to push legislation through the chamber and the party is eager to increase its majority republicans meanwhile hope they can regain control the democratic senatorial campaign committee yesterday emailed out a fund raising pitch with the subject line "nightmare scenario" that opens "one seat thats all it would take to flip senate control in " the pitch sets a goal of raising &# by march democrats see an opportunity to expand their majority next year since seats currently held by republicans will be up for grabs compared with just democrats seats just as democrats wiped out moderate republicans in liberal leaning northeastern districts in the house in they are now strategizing to upend moderate republicans representing democratic leaning states in the senate in the next election one is maine republican sen susan collins victor kovner a new york lawyer and his wife sarah a former official in the clinton administration hosted a fund raiser in their home this month for rep tom allen d maine an incumbent considering a challenge to ms collins for her part ms collins earlier this month attended an event sponsored for her by republican kathryn patterson kempner ms collinss chief of staff steven abbott says the lawmaker isnt racing for dollars faster than previous cycles but he says "the parties are feeling a lot of pressure because the presidential campaigns pose direct competition for individual donors money " the house too is shaping up early as an expensive battleground republicans are already plotting to retake the house targeting in particular the large number of freshmen democrats who are seen as the least entrenched and thus the most vulnerable earlier this month the kovners also hosted a fund raiser for freshman democratic rep john hall of new york ms kovner a longtime political activist says the early congressional fund raisers are largely geared toward ensuring that newly elected candidates have large campaign war chests to discourage challengers she adds that because of the presidential campaign "there is a fear that donors to individual campaigns will reach their maximum spending limits sooner " indeed in addition to their two recent congressional events the kovners were among the hosts of an event on march at a midtown hotel for new york sen hillary rodham clintons presidential campaign house and senate control can also drive the policy debate on key issues donors care about from iraq and immigration to health care and taxes because both the presidency and congress are up for grabs at the same time the power of a new president to implement his or her agenda could hinge largely on which party prevails on capitol hill overall there are relatively few donors who come anywhere close to approaching the federal limits for total giving in just donors gave &# or more according to the center for responsive politics a nonprofit research group but that number is expected to rise this year partly due to the increasing political involvement of hedge fund and wall street executives many big donors are juggling both presidential and congressional candidates eric mindich a former goldman sachs group executive and now chief executive of new york hedge fund eton park co hosted an event last month for sen landrieu at the home of laurence belfer a private investor mr mindich is also raising money for illinois democratic sen barack obama mark gorenberg a san francisco venture capitalist spent the first quarter of this year raising money for mr obamas presidential campaign but mr gorenberg says he plans to spend much of his time the rest of this year raising money for democratic senate candidates "most people are unaware of spending limits and feel they can write many presidential checks " leaving less for congressional candidates he says thomas quinn a lawyer and registered lobbyist at venable llc in washington says he has already contributed to the primary races of sens clinton christopher dodd of connecticut and joseph biden of delaware as well as to new mexico gov bill richardson all democratic presidential candidates mr quinn also says he would have given to the presidential campaigns of mr obama and former north carolina sen john edwards but says they have refused contributions from registered lobbyists meanwhile several new york bankers and lawyers privately say that they too are spreading largess among multiple presidential candidates some say they are doing so to promote debate giving multiple candidates an opportunity to state their views "the contribution limits are so low and youre dealing with people who can easily write a check for &# " says kent cooper of politicalmoneyline a washington based research group people are also giving to multiple candidates as favors to friends and business associates and to hedge their bets to make sure they have done something for whoever becomes the general campaigns candidate "ill be maxed out earlier than usual this cycle " mr quinn says "everyone is in play "
