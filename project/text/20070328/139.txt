tax report irs is getting less charitable new regulations raise the bar on gift reporting dont lose your shirt when you give it away many people who have donated used clothing books furniture and other household items to charity each year failed to get proper documentation for their gifts and thus could lose all or part of their deduction if challenged by the internal revenue service according

administration a u s treasury department unit at the same time the report urges the irs to do a better job of enforcement one problem many donors face is understanding the property donation rules
