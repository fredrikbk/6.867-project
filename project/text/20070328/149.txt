of the canal grande and the canale della giudecca on it is a square yard th century abandoned warehouse that once stored salt its semi arched windows look over the water to two of venices most beautiful buildings the th century doges palace to the north and the church of san giorgio maggiore to the south today the warehouse is the center of a messy battle between two big forces in the art world who both want to turn it into a museum in one corner is francois pinault the french mogul whose fashion and retail conglomerate includes gucci and yves saint laurent in another is the solomon r guggenheim foundation which operates museums in venice new york and bilbao spain the rivals are jockeying for position in the city of titian amid a soaring global market for contemporary art each side claims a different mayor of venice encouraged it to pursue the warehouse now the two have erupted into open warfare alberto rigotti an italian investor who is putting up of the proceeds for the guggenheim bid recently likened the year old mr pinault to a door to door salesman "mr pinault reminds me of an artist or a wandering shopkeeper who cant find the space to show his goods " mr rigotti told french newspaper le monde last month in an interview jean jacques aillagon a pinault associate called mr rigotti a second rate banker who "doesnt know what hes talking about " mr pinault declined to be interviewed or respond to emailed questions mr pinault a self made entrepreneur known for his business smarts and quick temper turned a lumber mill into a roughly &# billion fortune over the past years he also owns christies the international auction house and a private collection of post s artworks including pieces by jeff koons andreas gursky and takashi murakami he is one of several luxury goods tycoons making splashy moves in modern art prada designer miuccia prada and her husband company ceo patrizio bertelli set up the prada foundation in milan in to display to the public contemporary works last fall lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton chairman bernard arnault asked frank gehry the architect of the guggenheim museum in bilbao to design a new home for his own contemporary art collection in paris in mr pinault planned to build a contemporary art foundation in the outskirts of paris but he dropped that project abruptly because of bureaucratic hurdles soon after mr pinault bought palazzo grassi an elegant th century building on venices canal grande and turned it into a museum to house some of his works he knew that the palazzo wasnt spacious enough to permanently house some of his bigger installations such as a piece by damien hirst that consists of a chopped up cow preserved in vats of formaldehyde in may venice mayor massimo cacciari offered to take mr pinault on a tour of another building punta della dogana that could be used as an exhibition space during the tour mr cacciari asked mr pinault whether hed be interested in "anchoring your collection permanently in punta della dogana " according to mr aillagon who was also present "why not " answered mr pinault mr cacciari declined requests to be interviewed what the pinault camp didnt know is that the guggenheim foundation had already set its sights on punta della dogana years earlier when a previous venice mayor had piqued its interest in it the guggenheim has played an important artistic role in venice for nearly years its peggy guggenheim collection an assortment of european and american art of the first half of the th century was the passion of the american heiress a niece of solomon guggenheim the museum is currently housed in peggys former mansion and consists mainly of artworks she gathered over her lifetime by the peggy guggenheim museum was also facing space problems so when in the summer of last year the city of venice finally announced an official auction for a concession to run punta della dogana for years both mr pinault and the guggenheim rushed in the pinault bid pledged to hire japanese architect tadao ando to renovate punta della dogana and to house a significant part of mr pinaults private collection permanently in the building according to mr aillagon in its first offer the guggenheim committed to hiring iraqi born british architect zaha hadid and spending some &# million to &# million a year to operate the museum according to philip rylands director of venices peggy guggenheim museum after the first round of bids resulted in a stalemate a special commission of city officials now has in hand a fresh round of offers the citys mayor is expected to render a final decision by easter though the initial bids were roughly equivalent at an estimated &# million just for building restoration costs neither mr pinault nor guggenheim satisfied the committee "both competitors said they could do extraordinary things for venice but the interesting aspect to us was can you invent something new " says architect carlo magnani a member of the first bidding committee "are they bidding for more storage place or for a great new idea capable of drawing the attention of both the public and young artists " asks art critic achille bonito oliva who chaired the first committee the city of venice asked that the second submissions provide more details about the long term financial commitments of both bidders it also wanted more information about the specific works that the two bidders would display permanently at the museum an indication that it doesnt merely want rotating exhibitions "we are convinced that our project is the best one and the one that responds the most adequately to the citys expectations " says mr aillagon "mr pinault has the capacity to intervene in a more massive and systematic way on the art market to improve his collections " guggenheim disagrees "the development of an audience for contemporary art is a challenge but were a huge organization " says mr rylands "our rival is a remarkable collector but he is only one collector " the two sides rejected a proposal to join forces and operate the new museum together "we actually offered to talk to pinaults camp but it never happened " says mr rylands "if the guggenheim had told us about their desire to be candidate we could have done something together " retorts mr aillagon "but they havent had a word for us "
