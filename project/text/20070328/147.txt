the race to get tv shows overseas u s studios hope to beat pirated episodes on the web now london gets lost fast london for decades europeans had to wait months if not years to find out what happened on top u s shows like "dallas " "m a s h" and "friends " but with viewers now sharing plot summaries and even episodes online british sky broadcasting group plc and u s studios are trying to pull off the fastest trans atlantic tv flight yet in january they began showing the abc hit "lost" in britain four days after it aired in the u s while not as good as a simulcast its a big improvement over the typical three to six month delay before u s shows appear on british screens its also an important effort u s networks are under pressure to make more money on their shows and increase their share of the &# billion overseas television market meanwhile about of u k tv airtime is american programming and network executives including bskyb worry that they will lose viewers to pirated episodes online "who wants to wait six months to see season three of lost when you can download it " asks tom toumazis the managing director for europe middle east and africa at buena vista international television the sales arm for walt disney co s abc transporting shows overseas quickly is part of disneys five year plan to boost its operations globally he says at the moment only english language tv networks are involved because its almost impossible to get dubbed shows on the air in less than three months the logistics are trickier than they appear because shows are often completed at the last minute and studios are concerned about plot details leaking studios rarely let episodes leave the country before they have aired in the u s studios used to send tapes of entire series overseas in one batch at the end of the season foreign networks didnt mind because they wanted to show the series uninterrupted without breaks for the world series thanksgiving and other events that dont happen overseas abc first considered sending taped copies of each "lost" episode to london with a courier but executives worried that flights could be delayed by bad weather or an airline strike and the idea felt more like a stop gap measure than a long term business plan like all major studios disney can transmit live feeds by satellite but that option was rejected because its particularly expensive for a show filmed in high definition like "lost " so disney approached technicolor a film production unit of paris based thomson sa to send the episodes over its undersea fiber optic line technicolor has a global network to send video digitally designed for movies tv shows and ads it was used to send daily takes from "oceans " back to los angeles so that executives could follow the movies progress the service costs about &# more an episode than using a courier of course tv networks simulcast live events around the world such as the academy awards and the super bowl even though they play at odd hours overseas but simultaneous or near simultaneous broadcasts are technically complex and expensive making them impractical week in and week out for a tv series "lost" airs wednesday night on abc since the start of this year each thursday morning technicolor technicians in glendale calif have converted a tape of "lost" into a digital file that night they transmit the file through a data line across the u s and under the atlantic it arrives at technicolors london office two hours later or early friday morning u k time then technicians convert the file into the european tv format and record it onto videotape for viewing a bskyb employee who lives nearby picks up the tape on his way to work at the broadcasters headquarters in west london friday morning during the day bskyb staff members record an audio description of the show for blind people as required by u k tv standards bskyb then broadcasts "lost" sunday evening its first slot with big audiences the speed creates some problems bskyb doesnt have time to send preview tapes to british tv reviewers so they cant write reviews ahead of time that means bskyb loses an important way of building buzz for the show and because foreign audiences arent used to breaks in the middle of series like the week "lost" hiatus in the winter british networks are trying the quick turnarounds only near the end of a u s tv season when theyre sure there wont be disruptions still its an important move for bskyb the pay tv service that is owned by news corp "lost" is the most popular show on the services main satellite channel another u s hit " " is regularly among the top five both figure prominently in bskybs marketing plan to drive subscriptions by cutting the delay between show times the service hopes to keep fans who are tempted to watch pirated versions on the web in the case of " " the intricate storylines often appear on fan sites within hours of an episodes u s premiere since bskyb bought the spy thriller three years ago the

"the television gossip world is global these days " says a ten spokeswoman mr toumazis of disneys tv sales arm says the quick transmission of "lost" in the u k is an experiment disney wants to repeat in other countries but that wont be easy he says the main problem transferring what are essentially huge computer files quickly and securely once that can be solved it will just be a question of whether overseas networks believe its worth the cost "if you can conquer the technological challenge then its just about economics " he says geoffrey a fowler in hong kong contributed to this article
