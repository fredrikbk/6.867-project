" the journal adds a stark choice for bush on iraq bills president bush has repeatedly criticized timelines for a u s withdrawal from iraq now embedded in bills passed by the house and senate as an unacceptable tying of commanders hands in iraq proponents of the timelines including some republicans who voted for those bills argue that the presidents strategy for the war hasnt brought it to a close and will just keep american soldiers stuck in iraq indefinitely with all the geopolitical consequences that implies whichever the outlook yesterdays passage of the senate bill sets up a
