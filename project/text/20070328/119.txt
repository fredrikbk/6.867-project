politics &amp economics veto showdown looms over iraq funding bill senate by endorses goal of withdrawal hagel casts decisive vote washington congress and the white house edged closer to a veto fight over iraq war funding after the senate endorsed democratic provisions setting a goal to withdraw most american forces next year sen chuck hagel r neb crossed party lines to cast the decisive vote on the roll call which followed last weeks house action approving even tougher language calling for withdrawal by september the senate hopes to complete passage of the &# billion measure tomorrow after which house and senate leaders must negotiate a final package to go to mr bush next month it is almost certain now that withdrawal language will be included yet congress and mr bush must reconcile their differences before mid may when the military will face major financial problems without an infusion of money senate armed services committee chairman carl levin d mich said the veto fight by itself is crucial if congress is to pressure the iraqi government to show more progress on military and political benchmarks demanded in the bills the confrontation will show the iraqis that "there is a determined element of the government pressing the president and also that it has momentum " he said but mr bush has scarcely welcomed congresss demands for an increased role in shaping u s policy in iraq and mindful of the stakes senior democrats are softening their rhetoric in anticipation of white house arguments that a veto standoff could disrupt funding for troops in the field "i think wed like to reach out to the president " said house majority leader steny hoyer d md before the bill is sent to mr bush "what are the areas of compromise we all want to fund the troops no one wants to micromanage the war we dont believe that setting deadlines particularly deadlines as far away as aug of is micromanaging " senate majority leader harry reid predicted there would be no backing down from "what we feel is important in iraq " but the nevada democrat added "its not all or nothing well work on language on all these issues and try to meet him president bush part way but not all the way " while iraq policy will be the dominant issue in house senate talks mr bush has also threatened a veto because of the added domestic spending including farm disaster aid in the bill here some of his strongest supporters disagree sen kit bond r mo whose son is serving with the marines in iraq said the farm assistance is a "legitimate" addition to the bill "this is something that has been ignored for three years and people are in tough shape " he said added to the mix last night was legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to &# an hour over the next two years a &# increase that would be achieved in three cent increments progress toward a final agreement has stalled because of differences over the level of tax breaks to be offered small businesses democrats are hoping tax writers can use the house senate talks on the spending bill as a forum to settle their differences senate republicans agreed but only after exacting a price about &# billion more in year tax breaks chiefly by extending preferential depreciation rules for an additional nine months the resulting minimum wage package has grown so complicated that it almost rivals in total pages the iraq bill itself democrats know that they dont command the two thirds majorities to override mr bush but by brandishing the veto pen so far in advance the white house may have hurt itself "we tried a monarchy once " mr hagel said "its not suited to america "
