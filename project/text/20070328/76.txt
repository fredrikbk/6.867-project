by some of chicagos most impoverished housing projects the development to be called metropolis will be built in two phases and will cost about &# million a lot of money for a neighborhood thats been down on its luck for years but where most developers might see high crime and dilapidated surroundings mr primo a newcomer to commercial real estate development sees opportunity "the argument is unassailable that there is significant buying power concentrated in these minority communities that remains untapped " says mr primo chief executive of capri capital partners llc a real estate investment firm that manages about &# billion in assets mr primos passion notwithstanding some wonder whether the project can succeed "you really have to reassure the retailers that the market will be there " says rachel weber an urban planning professor at the university of illinois chicago the projects backers hope to do just that metropolis was designed by blue chip architecture firm skidmore owings &amp merrill llp known for working on the buildings that dominate chicagos skyline the sears tower and the john hancock center the first phase will feature square feet of retail space and condominiums a planned second phase would add a hotel and high rise condos the architects renderings show a glassy modern look a departure from the low scale stucco found in most contemporary shopping centers the six story building has a sprawling rectangular base topped in the middle with tiered curved floors decorated with windows of multicolored glass the design and scope of the development which will have a grocery store drug store restaurants and other shops says a lot about how some developers envision the future of americas inner cities in many such neighborhoods it can be hard to find essentials like groceries and prescription drugs and residents have to trek elsewhere to make purchases but thats changing in part due to developers such as mr primo capri capitals co founder and one of the few african american executives in commercial real estate hes building metropolis with partner judson investment co llc to fill a vacuum in the community but also to prove that its possible to make money in poor neighborhoods while stimulating economic activity there according to michael e porter head of the initiative for a competitive inner city which studies urban economies average incomes in inner city communities rose after adjusting for inflation from to icic defines inner city areas as those zip codes where poverty is higher unemployment is higher and median income is lower than the average for the metropolitan area at the same time a boom in residential construction is luring black middle class families with higher incomes yet the number of stores in inner city communities has shrunk an icic study published in september found that the gap between shopping demand and supply in inner city neighborhoods in the top u s cities is about or &# billion that means that consumers who live in inner cities satisfy of their shopping needs outside of their communities in the bronzeville neighborhood where metropolis will be built the gap is wider consumer demand is &# million a year within a mile radius but of residents spending is outside the area some &# million a year according to claritas inc a san diego marketing information company it wasnt always so in bronzeville a historic african american neighborhood created by the great migration of blacks from the south in the early s and once known as the "black metropolis " it was once a vibrant area with shops and music clubs that was also home to jazz pioneer louis armstrong bluesman muddy waters and trailblazing journalist and suffragist ida b wells among many others but the neighborhood went downhill after world war ii and by the s was racked with poverty exacerbated by the citys decision to concentrate poor blacks in high rise housing projects in the neighborhood more recently the area is making something of a comeback all but a couple of housing projects have been torn down and mixed income housing is rising as part of a chicago plan to fix its abysmal public housing raised in the suburbs as the son of a schoolteacher and the first black episcopal bishop in chicago mr primo a friend and early supporter of democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama speaks of "elevating the disenfranchised " but insists his project is not philanthropy "it makes great economic sense for hard nosed cold hearted socially disinterested business organizations to pursue this market " he says mr primo years old is one of a small number of african americans who have broken into big time commercial real estate development in part by focusing on communities that long have been off developers radar former basketball legend earvin "magic" johnson owns beverly hills calif based johnson development corp and began putting up movie theaters and restaurants in inner cities in san francisco based macfarlane partners a real estate investment firm with &# billion in assets and headed by victor macfarlane has many investments in lower income minority areas as does urban america run by richmond s mccoy which recently closed its second urban fund to buy about &# billion in real estate over the next two years to increase the odds that metropolis will draw from outside the neighborhood mr primo hired skidmore and charged the firm with the mission of designing something impressive architecturally "how many developers in the inner city hire som to design their projects " mr primo says "zero " "we believed that if designed properly and built properly we would create a project that would be welcomed by the community and would translate into high dollar per square foot rents for us and high sales for the retailers " says mr primo who is also a pianist and composed and performed a jazzy piece for a video presentation of the project even though city politicians are encouraging the new development navigating chicagos political minefields hasnt been easy to win the crucial support of alderman dorothy tillman mr primo included a fountain in the design at her request and also will put in a technology center giving area residents free access to computers and the internet gloria dickson who works at an animal shelter lives across the street from the site and says she looks forward to having a new grocery store since it currently takes her about minutes to walk to the nearest one but she worries the changes might bring gentrification "i just hope that doesnt happen so that rents dont rise so high " she says "i dont want to get pushed out of this area " while capri capital and judson investment control part of the site they still need approval from the chicago housing authority to purchase the rest metropolis also has no anchor tenant yet usually a requirement for retail developers to start a project "were prepared to start without an anchor " says mr primo "the proof is in the pudding " mr primo says "well see how it all tastes after were done " alex frangos contributed to this article
