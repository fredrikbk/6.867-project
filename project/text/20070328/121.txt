at goldman sachs asset management many had thought a pullback was overdue before feb when subprime mortgage market woes in the u s and a sharp fall in the shanghai stock market combined to rattle

for bigger market players to find opportunities in the markets "we are active managers and we pray for volatility like farmers pray for rain " says goldmans mr sullivan "we had been defensively
