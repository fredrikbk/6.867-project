including dupont co nestle sa pepsico inc and suzuki motor corp with operations in china that it says have been cited by the government for violating environmental laws the government has no formal ties to the group as part of the effort dubbed green choice ipe has compiled thousands of government environmental records into a publicly accessible online database among other things green choice which is backed by about chinese environmental groups will encourage consumers around the world to consider boycotting companies with poor environmental records in china the report a more comprehensive version of a list first issued in october also cites nearly chinese companies the multinationals cited are broken out separately ma jun ipes director said he isnt singling out multinationals but argued that they should obey minimum environmental requirements "some international companies make open commitments to corporate citizenship " he said "but in the meantime they are failing basic standards " rampant industrial pollution in china is blamed for widespread respiratory problems and drinking water shortages costing the government upward of &# billion a year the concerns have brought greater heat on multinational companies last year in an interview with state media pan yue director of the state environmental protection administration accused developed nations of shifting their dirtiest industries to the east in the form of "environmental colonialism " where the "rich consume and the poor suffer the pollution " ipes data were compiled from a variety of sources including government news releases and local environmental bureaus most of the companies on the list were cited for releasing polluted wastewater though some were cited for failing to file environmental impact statements or other procedural issues the violations date as far back as some companies on the list acknowledged problems suzuki said government inspectors visited its jinan city plant in july and found the level of chemical pollutants in its wastewater exceeded the law the company said it has addressed the problem and has since met inspections "its true that we dumped the wastewater " said suzuki spokesman yoichi kojima "however we took quick action " pepsico which was cited for problems at two facilities said it has carried out a "facility upgrade" at a nanjing plant that was cited for pollution issues in and is now in full compliance the company said it isnt aware of any environmental problems at a pepsi facility in the city of changchun that appears on the groups list many said the list reflects one time violations that have since been addressed "it was just a single wastewater discharge incident " said dupont spokesperson olivia chan of her companys inclusion on the list "since then weve reviewed our wastewater discharge procedures " others challenged their inclusion "we shouldnt be on that list and nobody took the trouble to speak to us " said beate bieniek a spokeswoman for american standard cos a new jersey company that makes bathroom and kitchen fixtures she said a factory in shanghai was cited after a pipe broke because of cold weather ms bieniek said the discharge didnt contain toxic materials and "was immediately fixed " some companies said they were cited for administrative reasons a nestle bottled water plant in shanghai was cited in for starting operations before its wastewater treatment facilities had passed an environmental impact assessment the company said the paperwork had gone missing in a routine administrative error the company promptly corrected the situation and paid a fine ipe said it tried to give companies early warning that they might appear on the list by notifying relevant officials in beijing mr ma said the japanese embassy also got involved and contacted all of the roughly japanese companies with factories on the list ipe said it intends to give companies in the database the opportunity to address problems companies will be allowed to post responses on the site detailing how they have addressed a problem ipe said it will consider environmental problems resolved if the companies agree to hire third party auditors to monitor environmental compliance at their factories some companies have cleared their names a division of japans matsushita electric industrial co dispatched six staff members to ipes offices this month and gave a powerpoint presentation to show that they had addressed an issue with wastewater disposal at a panasonic battery plant according to the company and ipe the company also signed a commitment to begin using independent monitors to police environmental compliance at its factories mr ma said he hopes companies will use the green choice database to check the environmental records of their suppliers in china german pharmaceutical and chemical company bayer ag which has nine production facilities in china hosted a pre launch dinner for the campaign monday "companies should be getting to this issue before the activists do " said bill valentino who heads up corporate social responsibility for bayers greater china operations juying qin and miho
