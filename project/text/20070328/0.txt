a growing sector for advice about six years ago shirley wise made one of the most astute decisions of her life she became her own boss a desire to become financially independent after a divorce and a feeling that she wasnt living up to her full potential provided her with the impetus she needed to strike out on her own "ive always wanted to have my own business " says ms wise whose conference planning firm is based in tallahassee fla ms wise is one of millions of american women who have taken the plunge by setting up her own business it is a trend that is creating a potentially vast market for financial advisory firms equipped to tap it businesses that are majority owned by women are growing at two times the rate of all firms nearly million firms in the u s are or more owned by women employing more than million people and generating &# trillion in sales according to the center for womens business research sharon g hadary director of the center for womens business research says the majority of businesswomen are between and years old but it is a demographic that is shifting life changing events such as divorce death of a spouse or retirement are propelling fit active and often cash rich boomer women to become later life entrepreneurs in addition younger women are leaving corporate america in droves to set up their own companies as they seek greater flexibility to raise families frustration with bumping their heads against the glass ceiling is another motivation "we are seeing huge influxes of women at both ends of the age spectrum " says ms hadary financial service companies began targeting the businesswomens market just over a decade ago wells fargo &amp co was at the vanguard of the push since the san francisco company has lent more than &# billion to women owned businesses far surpassing an early target of &# billion over a decade other major firms such as merrill lynch &amp co and citigroup inc have launched initiatives aimed at attracting businesswomen and some independent financial advisers have also made inroads into the market by consciously targeting these clients but sheer growth in the number of businesswomen and the need for more firms to adopt service approaches that appeal to women means that much of the market is still up for grabs experts say "its a gold mine thats just waiting to be tapped " says delia passi the author of "winning the toughest customer the essential guide to selling to women " who as chief executive of medelia communications provides training to advisers in how to market to women ms passi says demand for her training program has tripled over the past three years as firms recognize the huge potential this market offers based on medelias research and polls of advisers who participate in its training sessions most of whom are brokers with large wall street brokerages ms passi estimates that fewer than one out of advisers have more than of their book of business dedicated to women business owners this is jaw dropping given that four out of business owners in america are now women and that businesswomen have the same financial planning needs as businessmen she says one reason for the disparity is that women tend to turn to the banks where they do their day to day cash management to run their investment portfolios its because banks are a familiar environment where women already have personal connections with staff according to ms passi another factor she says is that many women are put off when shopping for an adviser because they feel they dont get the time and attention they deserve at the heart of the matter are gender differences in communication styles says ms passi adding that around of advisers are men according to a recent study by the center for womens business research businesswomen are as likely as their male counterparts to say they know enough about investments to make financial decisions debunking the myth that women often lack the confidence to take control of their finances however the study found big differences between the sexes in their communication styles women generally place more emphasis on building trusting relationships gathering facts and consulting with experts before making financial decisions according to the study for example some of women polled said they choose financial products and services based on their relationship and experience with a lender in addition and this is an important consideration for financial service companies as the debate over how they charge for their services rages on businesswomen much more so than businessmen want to know how their financial adviser is compensated building up trust was the major factor for ms wise the tallahassee entrepreneur after an expensive investment mistake based on brokers advice she managed her own portfolio for four years with td ameritrade holding corp about two years ago ms wise came across an offer in a magazine for a free one hour consultation with a financial adviser from the national association of personal financial planners through that ad ms wise made contact with carolyn mcclanahan an emergency room doctor turned independent financial planner ms wise and ms mcclanahan started chatting by phone about ms wises finances "the first thing she told me was that i was paying too much in taxes that really got my attention " says ms wise who has a background in accounting it took eight months several telephone conversations and face to face meetings where ms mcclanahan was vetted by ms wises cpa and lawyer before ms wise felt comfortable enough to engage ms mcclanahan as her financial adviser ms mcclanahan took the time to evaluate her entire financial situation and to protect her assets set up a trust and plugged holes in ms wises insurance coverage she also encouraged ms wise to strike a healthier work life balance by finding avenues to release stress get fit and pursue her passion for
