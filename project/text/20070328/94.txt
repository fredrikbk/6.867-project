moving magazines out of print world to strictly online questions for jack kliger company hachette filipacchi media u s title president and chief executive officer advertising trends are forcing some magazine companies to make radical changes to their mainstay publications in some cases there is no longer sufficient financial support for a print product but a web version can still draw a decent audience under jack kliger a magazine industry veteran hachette filipacchi media u s has turned two of its titles ellegirl and the u s print edition of premiere into internet only outlets their print editions shuttered both decisions reflected industry trends ad pages for premiere were down nearly in according to publishers information bureau while ellegirls ad performance was more robust hachette knew the long term future of the magazine was clouded by how teenage girls use media mr kliger says ellegirls teen audience gets more of its information from computers and cellphones than it does from traditional magazines what remains to be seen is if web versions of magazines carry the same heft and authority as their print counterparts mr kliger is looking to bolster the digital presence of hachettes other titles including such popular magazines as elle and womans day below he discusses the changes that must be made for web publication and pressures on the industry the wall street journal what factors have prompted hachette to end the print editions of these magazines mr kliger looking at the ellegirl and premiere categories the consumers in the teen market and the movie market want fast information we saw trend lines for both ellegirl com and premiere com moving in very positive healthy directions and we didnt necessarily feel that the print versions which were not trending in a reasonable timeline toward profitability enhanced what the digital versions were providing they did not have the same dynamics as some of our other brands like caranddriver com elle com and womansday com which complement and interact with their print versions so we think that there are places for print digital combinations but in the cases with ellegirl and premiere we think they are best served on digital media only with other extensions such as branded events and licensing wsj how has ellegirl been doing since you announced last april it would become digital only mr kliger ellegirl is doing very well the traffic and advertising revenues have both more than doubled since last year partnerships are important for this brand and we recently announced that ellegirl com will carry the tornante companys michael eisners investment firm "prom queen " a scripted serialized mystery told over episodes new advertisers include target which signed on to ellegirl for the relaunch and just renewed for spring and fall wsj tell us about the economics and behind the scenes efforts that go into shuttering a print publication and making it work on the web are the editorial staffs of ellegirl and premiere of a size similar to what the print editions had are readers getting the same quality and quantity of content mr kliger first of all the editorial staffs are not the same size much of the web content is produced through community vehicles like partnerships as well as forums and community conversations the point is that on the web i believe that its more of a conversation than a one way discussion we feed the daily appetite more frequently than the monthly appetite but we dont give as big a portion each time because its being consumed much more quickly and its not a feature length concept online editors are not necessarily assigning as many pieces as much as they are sifting through material and figuring out what works best on our destinations when premiere com was aligned alongside premiere the magazine the magazine had the majority of staff and there were a few people on premiere com with repurposed material and some original content when we closed the magazine version we went from i think two staffers on premiere com to five or six we have senior editor glenn kenny who has his own blog and does much of the movie reviews and we have seen a noticeable growth of traffic as we have freshened the concept of premiere com basically being a hub for movie related entertainment information wsj will the online version have the same personality and authority the magazine had for many years mr kliger in some ways it will because glenn kenny who is the most recognizable name in terms of movie coverage and reviews and who has been at the magazine for at least ten years he has moved over to the web site his byline is there he does his blog and his movie reviews are still the lead feature there that part of the personality stays i think the authoritative voice whats going on in movies is still there however we are not talking about a feature magazine the in depth analysis of whats going on behind the scenes in the movies that was a ten page story in premiere its not going to be replicated on the web nor should it be hachette says the site will continue to offer fresh coverage of hollywood news what it is is a compendium of movie information rather than an in depth product about the movies wsj in the u s hachettes main assets are elle the fashion magazine as well as enthusiast titles such as car and driver and womens service magazine womans day given your decision to close down more consumer oriented titles like the u s editions of premiere and ellegirl whats the future of the company mr kliger were not as narrowly defined as enthusiast the company is not for sale every operating unit we have is profitable we are actually in the market to buy i will tell you i know well make at least one purchase this year we are going to be looking for either print digital or digital only businesses and we are very focused on building out our brand wheels multiple media outlets for each magazine title and our brand strategy our digital operations have expanded substantially by the end of the year digital will represent between and of our revenues and in the next three to five years i would say that number will triple
