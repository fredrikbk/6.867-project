vollard the art dealer modern masters needed most cezanne to picasso art institute of chicago through may the show then travels to paris chicago theres a grand exhibition of modern masterpieces "cezanne to picasso ambroise vollard patron of the avant garde " at the art institute of chicago until may thereafter at the musee dorsay in paris and well discuss the art but have patience thats because for all of the great art here this show focuses on vollard the dealer from the remote french island of reunion east of madagascar who bucked and conquered the paris art establishment he not only commissioned exhibited collected and sold the great artists whose works are on display but befriended some of them antagonized others and encouraged many to push into new media over half a century from the early s to his death in vollard was largely responsible for catapulting cezanne into prominence and shaping the careers of gauguin bonnard redon picasso derain matisse renoir degas and rouault to name just some of those whose work he influenced as well as sold gertrude stein a client described him as "a huge dark man glooming this was vollard cheerful " his imposing physique was one reason so many artists painted him this exhibition includes vollard portraits no doubt he relished sitting for and possessing picassos cubist portrait renoirs version of the dealer as a toreador cezannes vision of him as an impenetrable intellectual and bonnards interpretation of him as the stolid dealer sitting among important canvases casually strewn about his gallery opinions about the man differed as widely as the styles in which he was painted cezanne revered him matisse equated his name with the french word voleur meaning thief renoir was a lifelong friend gauguin wrote that he was "a crocodile of the worst kind " picasso thought he cheated him by buying the contents of his studio for a pittance but vollards galleries and residences became vital marketplaces for artists and collectors not only to buy and trade art but also to savor "artistic life " as the photographer brassai put it for example matisse bought cezannes "three bathers" from vollard and later wrote "if cezanne is right i am right because i knew that cezanne had made no mistake " vollard hosted dinners in the cellar of his shabby and cluttered gallery where he mingled painters sculptors writers poets and collectors one such party was captured by bonnard in "dinner at vollards vollards cellar " which appears in the exhibition by vollard had become the wealthiest dealer in paris despite or maybe because of his notoriously eccentric sales techniques he often fell asleep while talking with customers when gertrude and leo stein asked to see cezanne landscapes she recalled that he disappeared behind a partition in the back of his gallery and returned with "a tiny picture of an apple " when they reminded him of what they were after he disappeared again and returned with "a painting of a back " he finally came out with a suitable cezanne which they purchased when the wife of h o havermeyer the american sugar king came to see vollards cezannes he ignored her and continued a conversation with an artist friend until she said her ship was about to sail vollard replied that there would always be another ship she stayed to buy the american impressionist mary cassatt said about vollard "he is a genius he could sell anything " but vollard was more than a dealer he provided monthly stipends to gauguin when he otherwise would have had no income though this generosity was insufficient to counter gauguins belief that vollard sold him cheap and kept too much for himself vollards home and gallery provided studio space to several artists he became an impassioned publisher of lithographs and limited edition books with original prints by his best artists whom he encouraged to try the new media he sold the works on paper at prices that ensured their affordability lively examples in the exhibition include a suite of color lithographs by bonnard "some aspects of paris life " and a bonnard poster advertising one of vollards first shows of published works nearby is a bonnard centerpiece in bronze his first sculpture vollard had seen bonnard modeling a small dog in bread dough and thereafter encouraged him to try sculpture the exhibition includes several van goghs from vollards exhibition of his work among them is a triptych showing various scenes on the river seine almost seurat like in technique while that show established vollard as a leading proponent of the avant garde it didnt sell many van goghs even the masterpiece "starry night over the rhone" failed to attract a buyer nevertheless were it not for vollard taking up a hundred of van goghs late works they would not have been seen at all in paris and perhaps forgotten these works are followed in the exhibition by cezannes featured in vollards retrospective of his work in including the lush "three bathers " which matisse purchased in six installments several rarely seen early cezannes are displayed including "the negro scipion " which hung at monets giverney for many years monet called the painting "a work of primary power " and cezanne "the greatest of us all " it hangs here alongside such sensual early cezannes as "the bathers " "the abduction" and "the feast the orgy " each showing color light and human figures very unlike cezannes later landscapes in all vollard sold cezannes some again and again at ever heftier prices vollard was almost single handedly responsible for the success in the s of the nabis group including odilon redon maurice denis bonnard and edouard vuillard they can be seen along with the dealer and his ubiquitous pussycat in deniss "homage to cezanne " showing them all gazing at a cezanne in vollards cramped gallery their work was characterized by expressiveness and decorative form and the exhibition includes many lively examples in surprising media such as deniss sprightly female nude on a tin glazed ceramic vase and derains large plate showing nude bathers gauguin wrote that vollard "never comes around except when there is already a buyer and commission doesnt satisfy him " yet gauguins monumental "where do we come from what are we where are we going " his "green christ " "the red cow " "breton women" and "manao tupapau " as well as several sculptures and ceramics all stunning examples of his tahitian and french work were sold by vollard and appear here despite his cubist portrait by picasso vollard didnt embrace cubism picasso thought vollard conniving and moved on to other dealers nevertheless vollard was instrumental in presenting the work of picassos blue and rose periods to the public and many of these works are on display including the arresting "the old guitarist " "nude with red stockings" and "crazy woman with cats " picasso was part of vollards publishing empire as well several charming and sexy etchings of animals and other creatures are on view for the rare chance to see an array of great modern art this show and its exceptional catalog shouldnt be missed but the team of curators from the musee dorsay the metropolitan museum of art and the art institute of chicago has also done a splendid job of unraveling the story of this important complex and contradictory entrepreneur which is as engaging as the art is captivating mr henning writes about arts and culture for the journal
