bad chemistry democrats in congress have packed &# billion of pork into the iraq war spending bill so why not lard on an all politics solution to securing the nations chemical facilities "toxic" chemicals as aficionados of endless political crusades know have been a target of the environmental left for decades after they saw an opportunity theyve argued that the path to chemical security lies in requiring the industry to use "inherently safer technologies " guess what "inherently safer" means banning some chemicals or requiring substitutes the substances greens consider most "unsafe" happen to be the ones theyve been trying to eliminate for years for reasons having nothing to do with terrorists inconveniently most of these chemicals such as chlorine serve vital public health purposes and have no substitutes opposed to this one size fits all mandate for an entire industry stands the department of homeland security late last year it issued broad draft regulations that laid out stringent standards for chemical plant security but gave companies flexibility to decide how to meet those standards this approach makes sense because what we call the "chemical industry" is like chemistry itself various and complex different companies specialize in different chemicals which have different security risks since the industry has spent more than &# billion on security measures rather than force each firm to start over with straight jacket procedures the administration would build on the industrys specialized knowledge giving it the freedom to develop innovative solutions up to now the green groups have had no success getting the government or previous republican congress to buy into banning chemicals to achieve "inherently safer" technologies so they turned to the states three new jersey new york and maryland have developed chemical security programs new jersey governor jon corzine who as a senator led an unsuccessful chemical ban charge is pushing to require facilities in his state to use "inherently safer" technologies the greens banning as security strategy in the states has hit a snag homeland securitys draft regulations reserve the right of the federal government to pre empt state laws in certain situations the argument for pre emption is national security as with port or airline security but after years of siccing the environmental protection agency on their targets the greens have turned to the new democratic majority to give them "federalism " and so a provision in last weeks house iraq war supplemental would block dhs from approving a chemical facility plan unless it "exceeds" state standards new jersey senator frank lautenberg has included a provision that gives states the right to go beyond the federal government lets hope senate republicans get these chemical provisions excised from the final war spending bill homeland security is within two weeks of issuing its final rules throwing a monkeywrench now will merely guarantee more years of wrangling over chemical security rules that should have been settled long ago if greens and democrats want to rid the world of chemicals for environmental reasons then engage in an open debate about the pros and cons rather than waving "terror" as a ruse see related letter "letters to the editor safer chemicals lessen threat of terrorist attack" wsj april see related letter "letters to the editor tough chemical standards are threatened by politics" wsj april
