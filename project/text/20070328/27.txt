business world waste case now it might be because he owned media properties and employed hundreds of journalists and threw extravagant parties to which he occasionally invited them for once a few voices have been raised in defense of the ceo in the dock conrad black aka lord black on trial in chicago for allegedly fleecing shareholders in his empire that once embraced hundreds of newspapers including londons daily telegraph and the jerusalem post his supporters mostly in the british and canadian press wonder whether hes being railroaded over so called "noncompete" payments he received personally from buyers of newspapers his company hollinger was selling did these payments lubricate the sale of the papers thus benefiting shareholders or were they kickbacks the government seems determined to argue that the money should have gone to hollinger as a matter of form regardless of its economic function well ask a different question regardless of any self dealing behavior on lord blacks part was criminal and civil litigation really the best way to settle whether he was properly looking after the interests of minority shareholders surveying the mess that hollinger has become the answer would have to be "no " his downfall began when a new york investment fund tweedy browne owner of million shares wrote to his board in late questioning "management fees" paid by the publicly traded hollinger to a private company ravelston which lord black owned and through which he controlled hollinger under pressure from tweedy and other activist fund managers the hollinger board eventually appointed a special investigating committee headed by former sec chief richard breeden then making a lucrative new career for himself as a tribune of corporate reform he issued an inflammatory report accusing lord black and lieutenants of running a "corporate kleptocracy " unquestionably this was one way of dealing with a high handed ceo but these words tossed out amid the press frenzy over enron were better calculated to stimulate media interest than facilitate a happy ending for shareholders as vanity fair aptly pointed out last month the consequence was that all involved became "mired in cannibalistic internecine lawsuits " the legal costs alone have come to dwarf even the &# million that lord black and his deputies are accused of paying themselves improperly meanwhile shareholders consider themselves no better served by his successors the new directors and executives hired to clean up the mess under mr breedens watchful eye as the new managers attended to legal and regulatory warfare hollinger was dismantled in desultory fashion leaving only a rump company controlling the chicago sun times and a few smaller papers the net gain to the funds that spent five years and millions of dollars battling the company was a big fat goose egg only mr breeden and the lawyers seem to have emerged from the episode with personal wealth enhanced whatever the crimes and misdemeanors of lord black it has not been an excellent adventure for tweedy browne and other shareholders they presumably saw value to be unlocked in hollinger thats why they invested in the first place though the greater part of their disappointment may stem from their own misjudgment about the future of the newspaper business for starters lord black was the majority shareholder and had assured himself of voting control by issuing two classes of stock tweedy and others knew this going in no that doesnt mean lord black is relieved of his duty to play fair with minority shareholders nor that minority shareholders dont have every right to use the available means to press for change those available means however once would not have begun and ended with lawsuits and stirring up the corporate governance furies had outsiders seen unrealized value in hollinger they might have weighed their odds and launched a hostile bid to buy the company out from under its proprietor any lawsuits and media campaigns would have been carefully metered to encourage lord black to sell but not to damage the company that approach worked well enough in the s yes this would have made it worth lord blacks while to get out of the way onlookers wonder why large sums change hands in the business world to get rid of used up ceos or reward controlling shareholders for giving up control answer to avoid destroying a business in order to save it alas corporate governance has become a new favorite cause of societys forces of self righteousness they flog the unanalytic ideal of "shareholder democracy " democracy is a four syllable word for "good" in these mouths but does it really apply in the case of companies whose shares trade on a stock exchange investors after all have thousands of companies to choose from with ease of entry and exit afforded through the stock market you can buy shares in a one share one vote company if thats your ideal and even companies that give shareholders a vote on managements pay you are equally free to buy shares in a company in which control remains with a dominant shareholder whose interests may not be synonymous with your own companies are free to be different including in the rights and protections they offer shareholders being different is how they compete for capital and markets are fully capable of setting share prices to reflect different approaches to vouchsafing the trustworthiness of management whats missing today is the universal solvent of a lively expectation that hostile takeovers can befall managements that hog too much value for themselves unfortunately legal and regulatory changes have made these all but impossible yet hostile takeovers were a far more productive way of closing the circle of accountability than the corporate governance wrecking ball aimed at hollinger has proved to be
