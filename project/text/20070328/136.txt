the evening wrap captives &amp crude online edition the uproar over irans snatching of british troops from the persian gulf shows no signs of being resolved quickly and that may mean fuel prices for consumers world wide are headed a whole lot higher energy traders have been busy studying maps of the straits of hormuz and trying to find iranian state television on their satellite dishes as crude oil futures leap in response to the crisis late yesterday crude futures briefly pushed above &# a barrel after rumors that iran had launched a missile at a u s ship in the persian gulf whipped around global trading floors those rumors turned out to be false but the fevered reaction they stirred indicated that geopolitical risk premiums had returned to crude prices in a big way the u n security council last weekend passed tougher sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment efforts and that also has increased concern that tehran might clamp the flow of oil through the persian gulf crude futures didnt keep their hold on the &# plateau for very long but just the same renewed market anxiety over a conflict that might crimp shipments out of iran kept prices strong all day and at the end of trade in new york crude settled at &# a barrel up &# that was the highest closing price for crude since september british prime minister tony blair made it clear that his patience with tehran is exhausted he told parliament that the time had come to "ratchet up the diplomatic and international pressure in order to make sure the iranian government understands its total isolation on this issue " britain then promptly severed all "bilateral business" with the islamic regime at first iran seemed to give somewhat when its foreign minister said from the sidelines of a conference in saudi arabia that the country would soon free a female sailor who had been taken but then iranian television ran a video showing some of the sailors eating and played a statement by the female sailor faye turney in which she said "obviously we trespassed into iranian waters " ms tucker was the only sailor to speak in the video and it wasnt clear where it had been shot "its completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on television " the british foreign office said before the airing britain said broadcasting images of the captives would violate the geneva conventions britain has maintained all along that its sailors were conducting a legal action in iraqi territory when they were seized by their iranian captors "there is no doubt our personnel were seized in iraqi territorial waters " the foreign office reiterated after the broadcast of the video the royal navy had earlier taken the unusual step of conducting a media briefing in which vice adm charles style said that iran has been changing its story on where exactly the sailors had been snared he said that on sunday tehran had described a location that was inside iraqi waters then on monday iran offered a new position that was two miles to the east and within iranian limits adm style said that the revised coordinates didnt square with the global positioning system coordinates of the vessel that the sailors had been searching which was nautical miles inside iraqi waters at the time "we unambiguously contest both the positions provided by the iranians " he said bernanke keys some familiar notes federal reserve chairman ben bernanke testifying on the outlook to the joint economic committee of congress said that despite risks that the economy may slow or that inflation might speed up the central bank currently has the correct stance on monetary policy "to date the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing of core inflation " he said to the panel suggesting that policy makers are disinclined to do any tinkering with interest rates in the near future the fed chairman also offered some dulcet tones on the subprime mortgage fiasco saying that he sees no signs that it is poised to spill over into the broader economy and cause more widespread discomfort as some investors and analysts have feared but if economists were mostly nodding their heads in agreement up to that point mr bernankes view that business spending while slowing should grow modestly in the future seemed to flummox some a couple hours before mr bernanke sat down with lawmakers the commerce department reported that durable goods demand jumped during february after a miserable reading a month earlier as commercial aircraft orders surged amid some brisk business at boeing things wont be slowing down at the company either after american airlines parent amr said it plans to speed up its orders for new jetliners but if boom times for the aerospace giant are set to one side orders excluding the transportation sector were negative also orders for nondefense capital goods less aircraft a closely watched barometer of business investment slipped by that led ian shepherdson chief u s economist at high frequency economics to conclude mr bernanke "appears to be in denial " he said a "moderate pace" of expansion in business spending is possible "but only if you define moderate as zero at best and more likely declining outright " comments oil shake markets mr bernankes testimony about the economy
