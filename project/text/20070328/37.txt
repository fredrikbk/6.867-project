canada may alter treaty on taxes to woo investors the canadian government is aiming to amend a longstanding tax treaty with the u s in an effort to boost anemic investments by venture capitalists but banking critics say the effort has fallen short of what is needed included in the conservative governments budget last week was an announcement that tax breaks will be extended to investments made in canada by u s limited liability companies which are often partners in u s private equity firms because llcs are excluded from a u s canada tax treaty the profits they generate are subject to taxation in both countries as a result the partners in llcs are generally unwilling to invest in canada canadian prime minister stephen harper is now seeking to amend the treaty to include llcs and grant them tax relief in canada canadian officials said they believe the amendment will broaden interest among u s investors the change must be ratified by the canadian parliament and the u s senate it is expected to be in place in but the budget doesnt address an even broader concern the amount of paperwork u s investors have to wade through when they seek to cash out of their investments by selling a stake in a private canadian company while the tax treaty provides an exemption for these investors from canadian taxes they must fill out what can amount to thousands of pages of paperwork to access the tax break canadas minister of finance james michael flaherty said last week further changes could be coming "it is two sides of the same coin " mr flaherty said "i expect that well do more in the future on that " processing the paperwork can takes months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees said stephen hurwitz of boston law firm choate hall &amp stewart llp who was part of a team that lobbied the canadian government for both sets of changes "the irony is that canada has stellar talent and technology but with this tax situation they are shooting themselves in the foot " mr hurwitz said large deals like investment in the oil sands in alberta involving hundreds of millions of dollars can bear that burden but investments of a few million dollars in technology start ups are frequently scuttled because of the paperwork mr hurwitz said "its an unbelievable nightmare to exit a canadian company " said doug redding chief operating officer of vimac ventures in boston which frequently invests in canadian companies "its just not sound economic thinking " canada is the third largest recipient of venture capital behind the u s and the united kingdom though it makes up about of the north american economy last year through september it received just of the venture capital funding according to thomson financial the effort to remove the barriers has been going on for about eight years and this is the first time it has gained traction said robin louis chairman of ventures west management inc of vancouver british columbia but mr louis expressed frustration that the paperwork issue hasnt been addressed "the vc industry is relatively small in canada in general and the current government in particular has very little understanding of the crucial role venture capital plays in building new businesses " mr louis said in emerging canadian venture funded companies raised an average of million canadian dollars us&# million their u s counterparts raised an average of c&# million according to thompson financial since these companies compete in the same north american market under funded canadian companies frequently fold or are bought by u s interests mr hurwitz said
