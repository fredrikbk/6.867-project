the debate continues on cancer treatment therapies and statistics in response to marc siegels march editorial page commentary "stupid cancer statistics" the current state of the art in medicine is "evidence based medicine " therapies that seem to be common sense often do not turn out to be helpful and are often harmful as well as expensive we know that having a high level of hdl cholesterol correlates with having fewer heart attacks and cardiac deaths so it is common sense that a medicine that raises hdl should cut down on these problems and yet a recent medicine that raises hdl was found in stage clinical trials to cause more deaths than in the placebo group this would never have been conclusively shown without randomized placebo controlled double blinded studies the gold standard for evidence based medicine self breast exams to detect early breast cancer should according to common sense help improve survival but a large well done study in china showed no benefit there was harm though in that many women who found lumps underwent surgery and needless anxiety for nothing multiple studies screening for lung cancer using chest x rays and sputum cytology have shown no mortality benefit even though lung cancers were found at earlier stages so i think it unlikely that finding lung cancers slightly earlier with ct scans will be found to be helpful some cancers such as colon and cervical clearly are more often cured if found early others such as ovarian lung and possibly prostate have not been shown to be helped by early detection given that previous studies on lung cancer screening have shown no benefit and the cost of screening all smokers would be very high and the added pain and expense and worry involved in surgery to evaluate lesions that turn out not to be cancer i think the onus is on proponents of ct scan screening to prove the benefits with randomized controlled trials before current recommendations against screening are changed robert almquist m d charlotte n c dr siegels commentary calls for increased use of specialized "spiral" ct scans to detect lung cancer early enough to intercept its deadly course however he is too quick to dismiss the crucially important ongoing scientific debate over whether such screening actually saves lives over the long term lung cancer is far and away the no cancer killer in the u s and all countries where cigarette smoking is common to detect cancers in a curable stage and help save americans from a cruel death each year would truly be miraculous but rigorous studies have shown that detecting tiny nodules even if cancerous may not actually reduce mortality cancer death dr siegel himself refers to the fact that merely demonstrating a longer survival time from diagnosis does not necessarily mean that lives will be saved five years hence rather it just extends the time measured between the earlier diagnosis and the same fatal outcome most importantly he also neglects to take the downside risks of screening into account false positives are indeed common and the diagnostic biopsies and needless major surgeries for benign or indolent nodules are not only costly but emotionally devastating and in about one in cases result in severe or even fatal complications merely asserting that "my patients want to know if they have cancer" is not a valid way to deal with this frustrating puzzle dr siegels use of one illustrative patient also flies in the face of evidence based medicine the plural of anecdote is not data large randomized controlled trials are under way and need to be completed before we adopt potentially dangerous and costly screening programs that may do more harm than good gilbert ross m d executive and medical director american council on science and health new york
