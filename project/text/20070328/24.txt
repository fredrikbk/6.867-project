borders slashes buyer rewards cuts discounts the nations second largest book retailer borders group inc has decided there can be too much of a good thing when it comes to its free membership rewards program less than a week after it reported disappointing fourth quarter and annual results borders said that it is phasing out its popular holiday savings rewards and personal shopping days benefits and replacing them with a simpler less generous promotion called borders bucks the move will dramatically alter a program that has been a tremendous hit with consumers since the launch of the borders rewards membership club in february nearly million people have signed up and borders continues to add an estimated new customers each week borders announcement comes at a time when many reward programs including those from credit card companies and airlines frequent flier plans are tightening eligibility rules or becoming stingier with benefits under the new borders plan each time customers reach &# in purchases at borders superstores or waldenbooks stores they will receive &# in borders bucks at the beginning of the following month they can then use that &# until the end of that month at which point the offer expires users will be contacted by email and urged to print out a &# coupon although those who forget will be able to use their &# credit by presenting their borders rewards card in stores customers will be able to earn borders bucks online after borders opens its own web site next year the company announced the new program to customers in a cheery email that lauded the plan as "now simpler than ever" and "a new program to celebrate " but under the old plan discounts could be much deeper members were given personal shopping days which enabled those who had spent &# in a month to apply a discount on all purchases made on a specific day in the following month gift cards were the exception customers also received a credit equal to of their store purchases made through nov in a special holiday savings account that credit could then be used on purchases made from nov through jan the only caveat was that customers had to have at least &# in their account which meant they had to have spent a minimum of &# to qualify a big downside for borders was that the company had to absorb all of the holiday savings account spending during its fourth quarter a period when shoppers would have been in the stores anyway buying gifts under the new program the impact on the company will be more regulated by enabling customers to claim their borders bucks year round george jones the retailers ceo foreshadowed the changes to the program in january when he told investors that he intended to "make modifications in the program going forward " earlier this month borders cited the "customer redemption of borders rewards benefits" as one of the reasons that gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased in the fourth quarter but some of borders biggest competitors are moving in the opposite direction adding perks to their membership programs in october in response to sharper pricing from a host of price minded rivals including discounters and warehouse clubs barnes &amp noble inc raised its discount for club members to on hardcover fiction and nonfiction best sellers and added a discount on all adult hardcover titles barnes &amp noble previously offered a discount on hardcover fiction and nonfiction best sellers members continue to receive a discount on most everything else sold in the store including coffee and paperbacks but

program " said michael tam chief marketing officer "they said since they are spending the money they wanted to enjoy the benefits right away instead of having to wait until mid november " in addition mr tam said that borders will now add special savings promotions to make up for the difference between the old and new programs although he declined to be specific he said the retailer will be launching what it calls bonus rewards events for all members this could include days when discounts can be applied to all purchases something previously available only to customers who had spent &# in the prior month borders will also continue to send out weekly coupons via its email newsletter some customers werent impressed "why bother " asked ron goodenow a market research consultant and writer in northborough mass "i find that on a lot of things that im interested in like music and dvds that their prices are higher than the competition " the five dollars he says wont mean anything to him "its gratuitous considering how much theyve hyped the program " a spokeswoman for borders said she believes that based on the retailers market research most customers will be happy with the changes
