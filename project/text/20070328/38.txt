common sense cvs caremark deal challenges merger playbook smartmoney for years the common sense mergers and acquisitions playbook has stood me in good stead but the caremark rx takeover saga which ended last week has me wondering whether i should throw it out and start all over again let me briefly recap the action in november cvs the big drugstore chain announced a friendly acquisition of caremark rx a big pharmacy benefits manager for &# billion then benefits manager express scripts jumped in with a much higher offer for caremark and a bidding war was under way cvs had to raise its offer twice to secure shareholder approval for the deal ultimately cvs paid &# billion and is buying back million of its shares where did the playbook go wrong playbook shares of acquiring companies drop on merger news those of the target rise reality cvs shares did plunge but since it never offered much of a premium caremark shares didnt rise since it was largely a stock deal caremark shares also fell express scripts shares which should have dropped soared on news of its bid playbook bidding wars are great for the target but terrible for the acquirers shares reality the same investors who hated the cvs caremark deal when it was first announced seemed to love it every time cvs offered to pay more cvs shares kept rising the more it increased its bid express scripts shares also rose when it raised its bid this was of more than academic interest to me since i owned caremark shares last fall i was disappointed cvs wasnt offering a bigger premium meanwhile when cvs shares got crushed i stepped in and bought cvs options both because i thought the deal made sense and because cvs was getting caremark at a bargain no one seemed to share this view cvs shares dropped to just over &# by the end of november in december express scripts lobbed in its &# billion offer a substantial premium to the cvs bid i was pleased as a caremark shareholder of course but dismayed for cvs the last thing i wanted as a potential cvs shareholder was for cvs to get in a bidding war i thought of unloading my cvs options then caremark shares predictably rallied but so did cvs maybe investors who never liked the deal thought cvs would get outbid cvs didnt raise its offer by the end of january cvs shares had climbed to more than &# nearly where they were before the deal but then cvs shares started dropping again hitting &# on march just after shareholders sued to block the deal days later express scripts boosted its offer and cvs finally followed suit boosting its cash dividend yet cvs shares continued to rally they rose after cvs raised its bid to &# billion the day the deal closed last week cvs shares traded above &# a level they hadnt seen since september and not that far from its week high of just under &# a deal cvs investors hated at &# billion they loved at &# billion from a financial perspective i cant complain whatever the underlying reasons i made money both on my caremark shares and the cvs options which expire in but this deal left me humbled yet again by a market that sometimes behaves the way you least expect james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
