sec is to get more sway over fasb boards foundation gives regulator input on appointments the foundation that oversees the financial accounting standards board has agreed to give the securities and exchange commission more say in the process governing appointments to the private body which sets accounting rules for thousands of public and private u s companies the move outlined in a recent letter to sec chairman christopher cox has sparked fears among some accounting observers and fasb members of increased political meddling in the way accounting standards are set a somewhat arcane yet often high stakes process others who say the fasb based in norwalk conn is to blame for overly complex accounting rules think the step while welcome doesnt go far enough and that the sec should directly appoint fasb members the foundation consults the sec on appointments to the fasb and its own board which is a mishmash of representatives of various industry groups but the commissions role isnt formally spelled out while the sec doesnt directly oversee the fasb that is the nonprofit foundations job the agency must sign off on accounting standards adopted by it before u s public companies must follow them as for the rule change the sec "ended up where we started " says mr cox the sarbanes oxley corporate governance rule gave the sec oversight of fasb and the sec outlined its role in a policy statement in that statement the sec said that given its oversight responsibilities the fasb should give the sec "timely notice of and discuss with the commission" its intention to appoint new members the agreement reached earlier this month defines "timely" as generally days but not less than days before the foundation nominates members to its board or fasb members members of the foundation however along with some fasb members saw the changes as far more significant than a mere clarification of policy representing a possible erosion of the rule making bodys independence debate over the shape of fasb comes as the complexity of accounting rules along with the increased regulatory burden facing companies has become a hot button topic the issue came to a head in mid december when the financial accounting foundation presented to the sec a list of its final appointments and reappointments to its own board and the fasb the sec determined this notification was inconsistent with the spirit of the policy statement according to commission officials in response the sec told the foundation that it wanted to formalize its role in the fasb appointments process a spokesman for the foundation said there was nothing incorrect about its notification and that the groups policies were in line with both the sarbanes oxley act and the sec policy statement of by february the commission had drafted a nine page memo outlining its proposed role in the appointments process according to people familiar with the matter but many of the foundations trustees balked saying the accord infringed on their and the fasbs independence after another month of talks the foundation compromised in a march meeting with mr cox and agreed to a slimmed down agreement these people said in a two page memo sent to mr cox the next day the foundation agreed to follow a specific timetable for notifying the commission of potential appointments and reappointments to the fasb and its own board give commissioners the opportunity to nominate their own candidates further notify the commission of finalists for any position and allow commissioners to interview those contenders according to a copy of the memo provided by the foundation the final decision regarding appointments and reappointments remains with the foundation according to the memo signed by robert e denham the foundations chairman and a leading securities lawyer with munger tolles &amp olson llp mr denham said he was comfortable with the final agreement and that he doesnt think it "fundamentally changes the ability of the standard setter to be independent " critics of the deal though say that even the slimmed down accord threatens the fasbs independence this "is a big step on a slippery slope toward the sec becoming the parent of the fasb " said edward trott a board member at the body who is set to retire later this spring he called the agreement "disturbing " adding that it could open another avenue for congress to bring its influence to bear on the rule making process "i think this is set up to influence the selection of politically expedient candidates" for fasbs board he added congress which approves the secs budget has often sought to interject itself into the process of drafting accounting rules in the mid s congress forced the fasb to back off from a rule requiring the expensing of stock options a retreat some observers believe laid the groundwork for the backdating scandal that has now ensnared more than companies arthur levitt a former sec chairman who recently called for "reconfiguring" fasb acknowledged the changed appointments process raised the risk of political interference but he said that worry is offset by the danger in the current system where special interests in the business and accounting communities exert undue influence over accounting standards "the new arrangement with the sec is in no ways perfect but at least you know where to point the finger " mr levitt said "having the sec a public body appointed by the president more involved is a desirable change " investor advocates took a wait and see approach "congress clearly can muscle the fasb its happened before on options most specifically " said damon silvers associate general counsel at the afl cio who sits on a fasb investor advisory group "im not sure whether investors ought to be screaming just yet about this "
