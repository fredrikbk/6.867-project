full treatment in kenya aids therapy includes fresh vegetables indianas dr mamlin prescribes food drugs patients learn to farm eldoret kenya just beyond the morgue of moi teaching and referral hospital dr joe mamlin a professor of medicine at indiana university questions his staff on their latest progress in the war on aids "how much food are we harvesting today " he asks "how many people are we feeding " stretching over two acres of the hospital grounds is a garden of carrots onions cabbage collard greens and fruit trees a stream meanders by providing water for drip irrigation this land and other farms around the city tilled by dr mamlins team yield four tons of vegetables and fruit each week year round every morning a truck delivers the freshly picked produce to clinics in western kenya when the doctors write out prescriptions for drugs for aids patients they also hand out a ration card for food to those who are malnourished "in the u s i can sit in my office and write a prescription but here amid hunger and such poverty i cant just write a scrip " says dr mamlin "there are no calories in the drugs " getting affordable drugs to africa has been the top priority in the fight against aids but the continent with the majority of the worlds aids cases also has the worlds highest rate of hunger as clinics proliferate and distribution of drugs widens health workers are finding that hunger and malnutrition sap the therapys effectiveness undercutting the multibillion dollar investments of private organizations and governments the standard advice that comes with medicine throughout the developed world "take with food" is just catching on in africa last year the united nations which estimates one sixth of the people on antiretroviral treatment also need nutritional support formally declared that access to food should be part of a comprehensive response to hiv aids in september the bill &amp melinda gates foundation which has been at the front of the philanthropic assault on aids opened a new funding thrust boosting agriculture production in africa in the highlands of kenya dr mamlin has been pioneering a merger of medicine and agriculture the rangy year old internist with a crown of white hair studies the life span of passion fruit vines he surveys the construction of a tomato greenhouse he worries about access to fertilizer and seeds of the chickens under his wing he says "any one that cant lay an egg becomes a contribution to our meat stock " dr mamlin leads a partnership between indiana university and kenyas moi university school of medicine it created the academic model for prevention and treatment of hiv aids or ampath one of the first aids programs to include a large scale farming component the program treats more than kenyans stricken with hiv the aids virus about half require antiretroviral drugs it also feeds more than people including patients and their families and ampath which has a staff of nearly most of them kenyans teaches modern farming techniques to thousands of recovering patients so they can grow their own food "instead of just focusing on one aspect of the epidemic ampath has developed a whole ecosystem of response " says warren buckingham kenya coordinator for president bushs international emergency plan for aids relief which provided about &# million to ampath last year in addition ampath received about &# million from private donors and grant funded research the u n s world food program also donates grains and cooking oil to supplement ampaths fresh vegetables fruit and eggs the world food program which has traditionally helped victims of drought and disaster is expanding its food distribution to needy people with hiv aids and their families in many places dr mamlins foray into farming began five years ago when salina rotich who had wasted away to little more than skin and bones was carried into his clinic in the rural village of mosoriot before then dr mamlin had an academic career and was chief of medicine at indianapoliss wishard memorial hospital where he created a neighborhood health care system for the poor in he and other doctors from indiana formed an exchange program with moi university in kenya in the early s he spent two years in kenya as a visiting professor in nearing retirement dr mamlin went back to kenya to head the university partnership immediately he noticed a drastic difference from his previous stint in kenya patients were dying at a much faster rate and at a much younger age "indiana university found itself in the middle of maybe historys worst pandemic " he says the aids explosion struck particularly close to home when dr mamlin making hospital rounds spied one of the fifth year medical students sitting on a bed feeding a patient with a spoon "what are you doing " he remembers asking "this is my classmate " the student replied the deathly ill patient was one of the kenyan medical students daniel ochieng he became the partnerships first patient to be treated with the antiretroviral drugs "it took six weeks but we saw lazarus come back from the dead " recalls dr mamlin "we thought if that can be done for daniel how many more can we save " to remain a purely academic program he says "would have been absurd " while the student exchange continued the partnership transformed into a practicing health care network introducing hiv aids treatment into government clinics in april ms rotich years old at the time appeared on dr mamlins doorstep she was suffering from pneumonia the oxygen level in her blood was minimal her weight had plummeted to pounds she was dying of complications of aids dr mamlin controlled her pneumonia and put her on antiretroviral treatment expecting improvement "we waited for something to happen and it didnt " he says "thats when i asked her about food what are you eating she said nothing " he reached into his pocket and pulled out some kenyan shillings to buy eggs milk and corn meal week after week the doctor gave her money for food and week by week she added strength after six months she had gained pounds "i didnt have any food at home and i wasnt able to work to buy the food because i was so sick " ms rotich says now "once i started eating i started to get better " again dr mamlin thought how many more can we save this time with food as well as the drugs "for of people on antiretrovirals here their health improves up within six to eight weeks " he says "but dont come up theyre the ones without enough food " the village high school donated a plot of land and ampath sowed its first seeds dr mamlin hired steve lewis who was nurturing community farms in kenya at a development organization for ampath mr lewis cultivates several farms providing vegetables fruit and eggs "the doctors need the farmers " mr lewis says "for the drugs to be as effective as possible they need what we grow " by the time christine kili came to the clinic in mosoriot in sick and malnourished the program was handing out prescriptions for aids drugs and food at the same time "if we were given only drugs without food we wouldnt have come this far " said ms kili pointing to herself and ms rotich the two had returned to the mosoriot clinic on a recent day for their monthly checkups and drug prescriptions "it is only because of drugs with food that we are sitting here " she is most grateful that her prescription for food included her two daughters as well also a result of the doctors orders "you cant say to your children no this is my food and im not sharing " she says "you cant eat an egg while your child has nothing " one year old woman who recently came into an ampath clinic to fill her first weekly food prescription for herself her husband and their five children said they hadnt had an egg in three weeks she told the nutritionist that she and her husband are too weak to work and can afford one meal a day usually only corn porridge they sold most of their corn crop from the previous harvest to care for their month old baby when he was sick with pneumonia her eyes widened as her bag was filled with milk eggs assorted greens and dried grains "this will really help " she said straining to lift the sack which weighed about pounds ampath distributes food to patients for six months while the medicine gets them back on their feet then they graduate to ampaths family preservation initiative where they learn skills that will help them grow their own food or get a job so they can buy food "when a patient first comes to me wasted and dying the eyes look up and ask for medicine " says dr mamlin "after two months when they are a little more powerful those eyes look up and say im hungry after six months those eyes look up and ask how do i get a secure life be independent " mr ochieng ampaths first patient now heads the programs outreach efforts checking to make sure patients take their medicine and eat enough "they will be getting medicine for the rest of their lives " he says "so they need to be able to provide their own food for the rest of their lives " that is ronald kegolis ambition when he first met dr mamlin he vigorously shook the doctors hand and said only "sept " "do i know you " dr mamlin asked "thats the day i got the courage to go to the clinic " replied mr kegoli reflecting a common fear of seeking treatment he became ill in after being diagnosed two years later he was put on the aids drugs with food he recovered and then enrolled in an ampath farming class one day last year the class visited a passion fruit farm and the owner explained how she makes about &# a week from the fruit an income that is steady throughout the year when he was growing corn before he fell ill mr kegoli would make about &# from the annual harvest he knew that wouldnt be enough to keep him well nourished throughout the year he jumped at the chance to be an ampath passion fruit farmer now he tends the vines of seedlings he has rigged up an irrigation system that pulls water from a well to bring up the water he walks on a stairmaster type pump for several hours a day "we call it the moneymaker " he says of the pump under blue skies and a hot sun mr kegoli surveyed his half acre field and smiled "with passion fruit every week i make money " he says "now i am at peace " the ampath farmers have banded together in a cooperative they named amkatwende which means "rise up we go " that is also salina rotichs motto back from the dead she has added passion fruit seedlings to her two acres of corn her five children who had gone to live with her parents when she was too weak to care for them are now back with her she is feeding them all "im working my farm im carrying the water myself " she says "were eating well "
