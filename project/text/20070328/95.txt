mris aid in spotting some breast cancer magnetic resonance imaging or mri can spot otherwise overlooked cancer in the second breast of women who have already been diagnosed with single breast cancer according to a new study the findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that mris can be a powerful tool for breast cancer screening and help patients get earlier and more precise treatments for all the sites where cancer might be located they also come as mris which can cost as much as &# or roughly times the amount of a typical mammogram have become one of the fastest growing costs in health care prompting insurers to reduce reimbursement for them and try to limit their use the study which appears in this weeks new england journal of medicine followed women receiving breast cancer treatment at different facilities around the country all had received a normal mammogram for their second breast before undergoing mris which detected cancer in the other breast of about of the participants "we are identifying cancers that would otherwise not be receiving any treatment " said constance lehman a professor of radiology at the university of washington and the studys lead author breast cancer strikes about women a year and kills about as much as of women who are diagnosed with cancer in one breast are expected to eventually develop it in the other over the next ten years with traditional mammography those additional breast cancers are detected slowly at a rate of about a year the detection rate found in the study indicates that broader use of mris "would mean earlier detection and that translates into much longer term survival " said phil evans director of the center for breast care at the university of texas southwestern medical center in dallas dr evans was not involved with the study its release coincides with the american cancer societys announcement of new mri screening recommendations for women at high risk for developing breast cancer the guidelines were outlined in an accompanying editorial in the new england journal citing recent research in the field they call for women to receive annual mris if they know they have certain related gene mutations or have a to higher lifetime risk of breast cancer because of factors such as a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer robert a smith the editorials author and the societys director of cancer screening estimated that as many as of all women over the age of would fall under the parameters of the new recommendations he and other researchers cautioned however that the quality of breast mris varies widely around the country in his editorial mr smith noted that many facilities that offer mris dont perform image guided biopsies a fact that results in some patients having to repeat the mri procedure
