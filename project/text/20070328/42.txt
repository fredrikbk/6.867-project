dont qualify for a roth ira try slipping in the back door its a tortuous journey with a happy ending yes you should make a contribution to an individual retirement account by the april tax filing deadline even if you dont qualify for the tax deduction but if your goal is to convert the account to a roth ira in when high income earners become eligible you could be in for a nasty surprise theres a little known problem with the strategy but also two little publicized solutions freedoms price funding a tax deductible ira will garner you an immediate tax break but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income a roth doesnt offer an initial tax deduction but withdrawals are tax free both accounts can be a great investment but unfortunately you wont qualify for either if youre covered by a retirement plan at work and your total income for the tax year is above &# if you are single or above &# if you are married filing jointly that still leaves the nondeductible ira which has emerged as an intriguing alternative before the may tax law you could convert a regular ira to a roth only if your total income was below &# but last years tax law removed that income criterion starting in and suddenly nondeductible iras became a hot ticket the strategy make nondeductible ira contributions which in and are capped at &# or if you are age or older at &# then in convert the whole account to a roth imagine that at that point the account was worth &# of which &# was nondeductible contributions when you convert you would owe income taxes on the accounts &# in investment gains in return for that modest tax hit your new roth ira would grow tax free thereafter pretty sweet it is provided you dont have other iras but suppose that as of you also have &# in a regular ira you couldnt convert just the &# nondeductible account says james lange author of "retire secure " rather you have to assume the &# conversion is coming pro rata from your &# total ira result you would owe taxes on &# because in this example the pro rata share of your nondeductible contributions would be just &# dodging trouble fortunately there are two solutions first if your current employer allows it you could roll much of your ira into your k that may leave you with just your nondeductible ira and no nasty tax bite in mr lange says second even if you have a large ira your spouse may not that means your spouse could fund a nondeductible ira between now and and then convert his or her account says cincinnati financial planner david foster what if neither solution is an option what if congress takes away the conversion opportunity making nondeductible contributions can still make sense "its a little bit of administrative work " mr lange concedes "other than that i dont see any downside " without the chance to convert in a nondeductible ira might seem unappealing because eventually your withdrawals would be taxed at federal income tax rates as high as by contrast if you invest in a taxable account you can take advantage of todays low tax rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends which currently tops out at but the ira is still a fine savings vehicle if you plan to buy bonds real estate investment trusts and actively managed stock funds after all part or all of your gain from these investments will be taxed as ordinary income anyway and the ira allows you to defer those taxes moreover if you cant convert in you may get an opportunity when you retire one tax smart strategy leave your k balance with your old employer for a few years and use that time to convert your ira including your nondeductible contributions to a roth because you no longer have a paycheck you should be in a low tax bracket and the cost of converting ought to be pretty modest taking shelter here are three pointers for funding a nondeductible ira make sure you file form with your federal tax return use the account to buy bonds reits and other tax inefficient investments aim to convert to a roth ira in or failing that when you retire
