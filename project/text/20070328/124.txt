steamy book gets buzz from the web viral video campaign gets audience quickly but views arent sales when harper perennial published chad kultgens debut novel "the average american male" this month it hoped to generate buzz cheaply with lots of stories in the press instead mr kultgens salacious tale of how men daydream about women turned out to be too steamy for most newspaper and magazine editors to touch they were nervous with reason that some readers would find the book juvenile sexist and offensive even penthouse which ran a brief excerpt called it "an appalling book we couldnt put down " so harper perennial a paperback imprint of news corp s harpercollins publishing unit spent &# to produce three risque videos promoting the book initially placed on youtube before spreading elsewhere on the internet including myspace the videos have become a web sensation with more than one million verified views in the past two weeks since its march publication date the book has gone back to press three times raising the total in print to from harper perennials experience is the latest example of how viral web video is remaking marketing giving companies with tiny ad budgets the ability to reach a big audience quickly and cheaply its particularly significant for book publishers which prefer to rely on word of mouth chatter to drive sales more than conventional advertising not every novel is suitable for youtube promotion but for titles like "the average american male " targeted at young men internet video can be a better marketing vehicle than traditional media outlets "we needed to go where the average american male readership would be online passing around funny quirky videos " says david roth ey editorial director of harper perennial adding that he is talking about men under the age of "if we were going to find them it wouldnt be by advertising in the new yorker " still the limits of the strategy are clear only a fraction of the million views has so far turned into sales likely because the people watching the videos arent frequent book buyers as mr kultgen says "now well see if the views translate into book sales " "the average american male" describes the fictional exploits of a narcissistic man obsessed with sex mr kultgen a year old los angeles screenwriter says the title was widely rejected by publishers who said they found the book hilarious but didnt think anyone would publish it because of its outre content even inside harper perennial some saw it as lad humor satire but others felt it was misogynistic after buying the manuscript harper perennial bet that a series of short videos that reflect the over the top protagonist of the novel would prove irresistible to web sites that in part cater to guys sitting in cubicles all day "the best way to reach our audience was to go directly to them " says mr kultgen the publisher hired new york director james monohan a friend of mr kultgen who created three videos from scripts that the two collaborated on "the goal was to entertain potential readers provide a brutally honest look at what guys think of women and drive people to the books web site " says mr monohan all three videos portray scenes between men and women with the action suddenly stopping to reveal the guys inner thoughts those arent exactly about cuddling or sharing feelings theyre gross out punch lines mr monohan says he worried that the publisher would censor the videos but in the end harper perennial decided that the videos were a true reflection of the books content and made only one cut bleeping an offensive slang word mr roth ey said that as soon as the first video was posted on youtube com it began getting hits then they began appearing on other web sites such as myspace fhm com heavy com and maxim com in most cases posted by members of the public "we didnt pay them and they didnt pay us " he says "if you post it on youtube com you are making it available " mr roth ey notes that the majority of comments from women who have viewed the videos on myspace com indicate that they find the videos funny based on that reaction harper perennial is looking for a woman to write a female counterpoint to "the average american male " the publisher will likely launch other viral video campaigns in the future mr roth ey says but it will pick the books carefully "its an audience issue " he says "if the audience isnt right it doesnt make sense to do video " there are so many videos being uploaded onto the web every day he adds that only the right video for the right book aimed at the right viewers will break through "even then you are competing with tens of thousands of other videos so there is an element of luck as well " he adds one irony harper perennial says it invested &# in web advertising intended to drive viewers to the books web site but mr roth ey estimates that only of those who have seen the videos came from links for which the publisher paid ad notes grubbs to
