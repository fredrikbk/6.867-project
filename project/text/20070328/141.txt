the mossberg solution preteen gadgets are more than toys low cost devices skimp on features adding cool factor its no secret that hip gadgets are the grown up versions of kids toys adults want the newest hottest device as soon as it comes out before the other grown ups on the block get it theyre experts at showing off new ipods and blackberrys but may need a refresher course in sharing and when a "toy" breaks pouting isnt unimaginable its no wonder kids are eager to drop their stuffed animals and reach for moms &# digital camera this week i tested three products from a company that sympathizes with the average kids grown up toy envy georgia based digital blue corp specializes in low end technology gadgets made just for "tweens" kids aged eight through in between childhood and teenage life i tried a kid friendly media player digital camera and digital photo album all of which perform many of the same basic functions as more sophisticated versions yet cost a fraction of the price and theyre enhanced with disney consumer products co characters themes and coloring to up the cool factor after using digital blues &# media player &# digital camera and &# digital photo album i concluded that the first two of these devices did indeed offer viable options for aspiring tech enthusiasts while maintaining enough entertaining characteristics to pass as toys the digital camera for example captured acceptable three megapixel images but also had a button that could superimpose disney icons into photos but some aspects of these products are glaringly lacking the digital photo albums screen had a downright terrible resolution of x making some images barely distinguishable and discouraging me from recommending it the media players buttons were finicky and its low price contrasts with its pricey content movies cost more than some dvds the digital camera was slow to capture and display photos digital blue isnt alone in making products for tweens that resemble the gadgets their parents carry various companies have introduced cellphones made specifically for kids with safety features like password protected phonebooks mattel inc s fisher price sells a kid tough digital camera for an even younger crowd ages three and up and toy company hasbro inc hopes kids will like its florescent colored portable video players with proprietary discs the most expensive of the digital blue gadgets i tried is the &# disney mix max personal media player it comes in seven designs and has buttons in the shape of mickey mouse ears the mix max measures about the size of a candy bar phone and has a " color display taking up most of one side shiny buttons for power hold and volume line the players top edge a slot on the side accepts securedigital cards which are loaded with music or videos and sold separately for a steep &# and &# each respectively especially considering the movies lack any dvd like special features i used the mix max to listen to various audio sd cards including music from the tv show "thats so raven " and watched the movie "high school musical" to test the players battery the audio sounded fine and the movie played without stuttering or stopping though the images were a bit grainy if you pause the movie and turn the player off and on it doesnt remember where you last ended after the device played videos for seven hours and minutes the battery finally gave out lasting nearly four times as longer as digital blue claims it also recharged in less than an hour but must use a computers usb port rather than an ac charger this undoubtedly keeps the mix max cost down but could be irksome over time music can be transferred from your computer onto the player and a mix it button on the device randomly generates a playlist of similar songs i loaded about of my own mps but the mix maxs megabytes of memory will hold up to about songs the &# disney pix max digital camera captures three megapixel images though lacks some basic functions that ive come to expect in even average digicams this camera offers only a x digital zoom rather than a true optical zoom it doesnt offer the ability to capture video footage nor does it have built in antishake functionality but it includes a good combination of physical traits its silvery buttons and a glossy black viewing screen make it look more grown up while disney themed front side decorations help distinguish it from comparatively dull high end digicams right now the pix max comes in two versions silver stars or "pirates of the caribbean iii" a princess themed camera is forthcoming i snapped images with and without the automatic flash pressing a button to review my shots on the " lcd viewing screen its megabytes of memory wont hold many photos but a memory card slot on the side adds capacity the camera took a whopping six seconds between when i pressed the shutter button and when i could take another photo for a kid with no camera experience this might not matter but for me it seemed like an eternity the most enjoyable feature of the pix max is its photo friends button which inserts one of disney related icons like winnie the pooh or a crown into your viewing screen before you take a photo the camera runs on two aa batteries a plus for kids who may not be responsible enough to remember to charge a battery the &# disney show pix digital photo album is the least expensive of the three gadgets that i tried and it shows the idea behind this gadget is a good one helping kids carry digital shots on the go but its screen resolution and size x on a " lcd make for an eye straining experience the lcd is built into a mickey mouse ears design the show pix holds up to photos and displays them when you press the power button by using slideshow or manual buttons it runs on one aaa battery and photos are loaded onto it from a computer via a usb cord the included software program was straightforward and simple to use clearly showing which photos were on the device and which resided on my computer but i had trouble identifying my photos after they were loaded onto the show pix and these were good quality five megapixel images if your child shows an interest in your grown up toys you might want to consider buying them some of their own gadgets and if they lose or break things like most children do these less expensive options from digital blue might be ideal guilt free solutions just dont expect too much and steer clear of the show pix edited by walter s mossberg mossbergsolution wsj com
