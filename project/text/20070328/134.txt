games to forget as soon as possible but bryants streak which included four straight games with or more points got columnists talking about wilt chamberlain who set the record with seven straight or more games as a philadelphia warrior in in the philadelphia inquirer rich hofmann writes that chamberlains streak was no big deal in fact at the time there were stories asking if his consistent excellence was boring and hurt attendance "ground beef was cents a pound at the a &amp p " mr hofmann writes "eagles tickets in the east stands at franklin field were raised from &# to &# the pope was john xxiii wilt scored yawn you look at the game stories many were from road games that were not staffed by the papers and they bore an odd similarity to each other it is as if they were going out of their way not to talk about chamberlain as if his routine dominance was such a given that anything and anybody else were needed to tell a compelling story it is more than years now and it is so hard to understand " nine eight seven come on youre driving everyone crazy run that thing find an open shot six five come on come on youre running out of time do something somebody anybody four three come

writes "too often it runs a play and gets nothing runs another same result four different times ucla had to shoot to beat the second shot clock against kansas and four times it resulted in a jayhawk back breaking pointer thats called being clutch but its not something you can rely on every game " the field for the womens final four is set joining lsu and rutgers for sunday night hostilities are tennessee and unc on espn com graham hays uses the fact that both tennessee and mississippis bands played parliaments "give up the funk" before tipoff as a neat opener for considering the lady vols and the evolution of womens hoops noting that the song "easily predated everyone with an instrument in dayton not to mention the starting lineups of both teams by nearly a decade but one year before the song began its evolution from cutting edge funk hit to pep band staple a year old pat summitt beat middle tennessee for her first win as head coach of the lady vols little did she imagine at that time a world where her foot all american would dribble through a full court press swat shots into the first row of the stands spin on a dime before soaring under the basket for a reverse layup and generally own the boards " that all american would be candace parker who dominated on both ends as the lady vols steamrolled the rebels by the rather ungodly score of meanwhile unc rode strong performances from ivory latta and erlana larkins to an win over purdue sticking with espn com mechelle voepel says the boilermakers couldnt have done more than they did citing a string of strong purdue performances good rebounding and turnovers forced "that all of that still wasnt enough is a testament to how good north carolina is " she writes "despite being overmatched inside purdue managed to make it a competitive game the only one among the four regional finals there are probably still some fans asleep in the arenas in greensboro dayton and fresno through which rutgers tennessee and lsu advanced " satellite tv has made its way onto planes all but eliminating the ritual of pilots offering the scores of big games taking place while birds are in the air in the new york times kate torgovnick ponders the creation of sports bars in the sky as fans watch a list sporting events on their setbacks "i can always tell when something exciting has happened good or bad " frontier airlines flight attendant natalie ordakowski tells ms torgovnick "everyone lets out a huge roar they throw their hands up in the air or tease one another we definitely sell a lot more liquor when games are on " one danger your flight may end with a couple of crucial minutes remaining making the slow procession out of the plane even more maddening if youre ever in this situation hope youre on frontier as this tidbit passed along by an airline spokesman indicates "the year before last jeff potter our c e o was on the plane the evening of the super bowl they pulled into the gate with three or four minutes left in the game no one wanted to get off the plane so jeff went up to the captain and said lets just sit until the games over " its a strange feeling when your team finally discards a headcase player whos driven you insane for years a bubbling brew of wild happiness lingering spite pre emptive schadenfreude directed at whatever poor franchise is headcases new employer and vague dread that the new team will make your team look bad by somehow fixing headcases gray matter all of that went through the fixs collective mind this morning reading this column by the san francisco chronicles ray ratto about armando benitez whose combination of million dollar arm and cent head tormented fans of the new york mets for years until he was finally shipped across town to the yankees in the summer of unhappily for mets fans the bronx bombers were smart enough to realize this particular package was ticking and toss it to the seattle mariners mr ratto opens with a slew of reasons from the warm hearted to the cold blooded why fans of the san francisco giants should not boo mr benitez when hes introduced on opening day mr benitez had a good spring has pitched much better than any other potential giants closer and makes himself more tradeable every time he looks good "but you cant help yourself " mr ratto writes "you will boo armando benitez on tuesday because you have been gearing up for it all winter you even have been teaching your kids to boo him as sort of a family that sneers together cheers together activity you have wanted your piece of him since the season ended and no amount of verbal and performance atonement will shake you from your core belief which is that he is the greg minton of the new millennium damn it and thats the story youre staying with " mr ratto then follows that up with the kind of historical perspective that will have readers spluttering on their coffee as old enmities are recalled "benitez is one of the few giants who has never not been booed in san francisco " he writes "all the other targets in club history had to work up to it johnnie lemaster was popular until he started kicking the ball around and thereby making his offensive shortcomings all the less tolerable minton was one of the most popular giants until he started blowing saves costco style in bulk atlee hammaker scott garrelts jack clark they all had honeymoons of one sort or other benitez is an epochal figure in giants history and letting up on him so easily undercuts what it means to be a fan " found a good column from the world of sports dont
