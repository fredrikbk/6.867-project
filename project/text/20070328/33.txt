corporate focus business how an open market might save the planet a tip for the big auto companies do what al gore does the chief executives of general motors ford and chrysler group have been dragged to washington twice in the past two weeks as politicians compete in a sudden stampede to stop the warming of the planet the chiefs were grilled about their plans to burn biofuels build hybrid cars and develop hydrogen cells there may be an easier way just ask the former vice president who once was a loner in the capitol but now has rock star status mr gore is a prodigious consumer of energy the associated press reported last month that his square foot nashville tenn home used kilowatt hours last year more than times the nashville average but he made up for that by buying carbon "offsets" credits sold by companies that plant trees invest in wind farms or take other action to counter carbon emissions as a result mr gore says he is "carbon neutral " why shouldnt the auto companies do the same at terrapass com one of the more popular offset web sites anyone can buy carbon credits to make up for the average annual use of a chrysler pt cruiser at a cost of less than &# thats a lot better than say some of the simplest hybrid cars which cost an extra &# to build and achieve only a to improvement in fuel efficiency buy every customer a terrapass and the big three could instantly be carbon neutral i recommend this of course with tongue in cheek terrapass and the other carbon offset markets in the u s are still works in progress and their limited demand depends largely on do gooders like mr gore or google billionaire sergey brin who travels the world in a boeing and buys offsets to counter its effects its unlikely the system could handle an order from gm for four million vehicles still these crude carbon marketplaces hold the secret ingredient that has led many big companies including the auto makers to come out favoring regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in recent months the auto makers hate the current u s regulatory regime corporate average fuel economy standards or cafe which singles them out for regulation and makes limited sense if oil companies flood the market with cheap fuel and consumers opt for ever bigger cars or trucks the best efforts to boost fuel efficiency will have little effect but a carbon cap the current rage in washington would cover other industries as well as autos and give companies flexibility to find the cheapest solutions to their emissions problems moreover if they cant find cheap solutions it lets them buy the right to continue polluting companies that exceed their caps could buy carbon credits in the marketplace while those that fall below their caps could sell emissions credits that gets to the really big battle that has washington lobbyists bank accounts swelling these days while corporate leaders are lining up behind a national carbon "cap and trade" law they are also preparing for one of the biggest intrabusiness knife fights since the telecom act of or the tax reform act of at issue how to set the carbon caps one approach would be to give every auto company or utility company a flat carbon quota per unit of output that would be great news for toyota and honda which already make fairly fuel efficient vehicles but bad news for gm and ford it would be good for utilities that rely heavily on clean hydropower but bad for those that rely on coal another approach would be to set caps based on some recent baseline years emissions that would turn the tables upside down it would be good news for companies that produce less fuel efficient cars or rely heavily on coal since they would get the larger quotas and find it easier to make cuts and it would be bad news for more fuel efficient producers and hydropowered utilities which would have less room to cut in between those two approaches there are a thousand variations with big money at stake in each the challenge for businesses in this game is to make sure someone at the negotiating table is tending their interests u s auto makers are putting their hopes in michigan rep john dingell the chairman of the important committee on energy and commerce and husband of longtime gm lobbyist debbie dingell and if you wonder why auto makers are suddenly eager for rapid legislative action you might consider the fact that mr dingell celebrated his th birthday last year so get ready for a real national carbon emissions trading system its coming and soon but before it does therell be some blood shed in washington corrections &amp amplifications debbie dingell the wife of michigan rep john dingell doesnt lobby congress the business column yesterday incorrectly referred to her as a longtime general motors lobbyist wsj march
