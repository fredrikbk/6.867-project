the attorneys showdown with subpoenas looming and justice department lawyer monica goodling taking the fifth before congress the controversy over the firing of u s attorneys grows closer to becoming not just a political fight but a court battle there seems little justification for a legal war however and the courts are not likely to enforce congressional subpoenas to presidential aides at bottom congress wants a public airing of private executive deliberations concerning the removal from office of several presidential appointees the president offered a private explanation congressional committees responded by authorizing the issuance of subpoenas to presidential aides a potential court battle between the congress and the president on this issue is a new iteration of an old battle between two branches of government if it ensues congress could lose as a matter of law and suffer politically as well congressional powers are only those "herein granted" expressly by article i the constitution which provides a long explicit list of its authorities in contrast article ii of the constitution provides that "the executive power" is vested in the president and while article ii contains enumerated powers of the president it does not limit that authority to those expressed expansive executive authority reflects alexander hamiltons recognition that "a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government " but as the staff of the executive branch has expanded along with that of the federal government generally congress has come to exercise more robust "oversight" of executive branch activity this meets a legitimate objective that of a check on the otherwise unbridled executive discretion in disbursing billions of taxpayer dollars but this is no basis for eroding the constitutional separation of powers between the branches of government as congress is trying to do in this case congress has the exclusive power to legislate but the power to execute the laws is entrusted to one person alone the president the ability to appoint retain or fire anybody to carry out these responsibilities is a core executive function properly left to his unfettered discretion this has been recognized by the supreme court as the court observed in a case growing out of the house un american activities committee investigations of the s "we have no doubt that there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure " since congress does need to legislate with knowledge of the historical impact and efficacy of its prior legislation courts have held that congress has the power and authority to make inquiries in connection with its legislative function but when it directs its inquiries to core functions of executive officials the executive has the right to resist thus the supreme court has recognized a so called "privilege" by which the executive branch can protect from inquiry conversations between and among the president and his aides the privacy of executive branch deliberations and presidential communications guarantees to the president unvarnished even unwelcome advice the privilege is not absolute and courts will strip away the protection when it is necessary to obtain evidence relevant to an investigation of criminality thats especially true when the suspected criminality involves the executive including the now sizable staff attached directly to the office of the president this was borne out during the watergate era when the supreme court in united states v nixon ordered the president to produce tapes of his conversations with aides for a grand jury in a related case senate select committee v nixon however the courts rebuffed a senate committee trying to obtain that same evidence explaining that the committee had simply not made a compelling case for its need for the material the two outcomes disclose a public interest distinction between generalized legislative inquiry and that of an authority conducting an investigation under a mandate of constitutional dimension thus whether a court will direct compliance with a subpoena for evidence of executive deliberations turns on how genuine and compelling the purported congressional interest may be the judiciary generally reluctant to entertain political questions involving the other branches will assess the particular question congress purports to be addressing in its inquiry the broad question currently being addressed is why the president fired some u s attorneys whom he had previously appointed congress seems poised to provoke a constitutional confrontation to get the answer congress should lose that battle because the answer as to these specific cases seems well outside the scope of anything congress could legislate under the constitution it is solely within the presidents prerogative to terminate the tenure of these officials his decision to do so is not subject to oversight by congress or review by the courts thus on balance there is no compelling need for congress to obtain information about his deliberations and judiciary recognizes a privilege of privacy attaching to those executive deliberations congress may ask the president why he fired these officials and its members may disagree or question the rationale for removal and do so in a very public way that is politics but it does not follow that the presidents aides can be forced to come to congress and give information under oath the check on a presidents corrupt or otherwise wrongful exercise of this plenary power to remove is not legal but political somewhere between providing no answer whatsoever and agreeing to an exacting examination of several thousand emails and taking testimony from presidential aides there lies a middle ground congress may legitimately inquire and the executive may equally legitimately parcel out such information as meets that need while preserving core executive prerogatives to deliberate in private the courts have evinced a strong preference for the other two branches to find this zone themselves and compromise that is what should happen here but if it does not precedent and common sense lead to the conclusion that congress will lose in court members of congress and well respected commentators outside of government including some of my former u s attorney colleagues suggest that congress needs to examine preservation of the "independence" of u s attorneys and their offices the courts are certain to ask independence from whom or what surely not from the president who appoints them and who has the authority and responsibility to supervise and direct these appointees and surely not from the attorney general charged by law with the responsibility to supervise their functions simply put the u s attorneys immediate boss is the attorney general and by statute the deputy attorney general who shares completely the attorney generals authority over u s attorneys should the attorney general with or without prompting from the president direct a u s attorney to prosecute or not to prosecute a particular case or to take care to do or refrain from doing something in the prosecution of the case he is doing no more or less than exercising his constitutional and statutory responsibilities to as the constitution requires "take care that the laws be faithfully executed " likewise the president presumably with his aides and the attorney general are charged with making judgments about whether a particular appointed official including a u s attorney is carrying out the policies and priorities of the president and his administration in a manner they find acceptable these are uniquely judgments to be made by and in the executive branch in the present controversy the administration has provided testimony and documents meant to reassure that cases being prosecuted by u s attorneys including public corruption matters are not being wrongfully influenced by partisan political considerations it is well that the administration should do so for the publics confidence in the administration of justice would be ill served by leaving a cloud of questions hanging over such matters at the same time it seems equally apparent that at least some in congress see a great political opportunity to put presidential aides in the congressional dock for the ostensible reason of fishing around for evidence that there was a corrupt motive behind these firings there is no such evidence yet if the courts were to step into a dispute arising in these circumstances it is more likely to be to protect executive prerogative rather than to abrogate it before joining battle on this issue the parties would serve the public interest well to withdraw and reconsider mr terwilliger a lawyer with
