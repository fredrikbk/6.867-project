u s to probe outsourcing after itt case federal law enforcement officials are expanding their scrutiny of outsourcing by defense contractors in the wake of a six year criminal probe of itt corp for sharing specifications for sophisticated military components with subcontractors overseas including one in china under a plea deal with the justice department to be filed today in u s district court in roanoke va itt is agreeing to pay &# million in penalties and admit guilt to two counts of violations of the arms export control act under the agreement half of the penalty imposed will go to funding new advanced equipment for the u s military federal investigators say the white plains n y company hoping to pare costs and increase profits outsourced production of components for advanced night vision equipment for the u s military itt shared technical drawings and specifications for the components with a singapore firm which in turn farmed out some of the work to companies in china and britain prosecutors said in documents to be filed in court they say some itt managers viewed internal compliance officials who warned them not to violate the federal export regulations "as obstacles to getting business done " using overseas suppliers to make components for sophisticated military equipment is a growing trend in the globalizing defense industry u s military contractors are joining with foreign counterparts to make equipment for use by militaries in the u s and its allies but the trend raises concerns that sophisticated military equipment could end up being used against american forces or in attacks on u s soil justice department officials say "my hope is that this case sends a clear signal to the rest of the industry that we will enforce these laws " john brownlee u s attorney in virginias western district said in an interview "when technology is illegally exported overseas that jeopardizes the tactical advantage and jeopardizes the safety of the fighting force " no individuals were named in the plea deal but a law enforcement official said the investigation continues into implicated company employees the u s military so highly prizes its night vision equipment that after handing over some of the gear to the pakistan military for use in monitoring that countrys afghanistan border a u s official was tasked with conducting quarterly counts to ensure none went missing the case is believed to be the first time a major defense contractor has admitted to criminal violations of the export control law previous investigations have ended with civil settlements the government could have sought to bar itt from doing business with the pentagon or exporting military equipment which probably would have been financially ruinous for the company defense electronics and services accounted for of itts &# billion in sales in and of operating profit in this case federal officials said they wanted to give the company an opportunity to come into compliance and make restitution itt discovered the violations as early as the mid s prosecutors said in itt disclosed some limited infractions but prosecutors say the company hid the extent of the problems and misled the government into believing it was fixing them itt officials tried to block the investigation after federal agents began their probe in in an attempt to "run out the clock" on the statute of limitations on some of the violations that changed after prosecutors informed the company in that they were prepared to indict the company agents from the federal bureau of investigation customs and other agencies are increasing their focus on crimes related to sensitive technology leaving the u s a justice department spokesman said the itt case is bound to send shivers through the u s defense industry which increasingly views international trade as vital for long term growth in addition to tarnishing contractors the case could lead to tougher regulations at a time when the industry has been pressing the government to streamline export controls so that u s defense and aerospace products can remain competitive defense industry executives contend that the list of components and technologies requiring export licenses contains hundreds of items some dating from the cold war which should be removed because they dont compromise national security the u s munitions list covers firearms to fighter jets but also includes parts found on commercial satellites and airliners "the pendulum has swung very far and the government has increasingly made the export rules more complicated " says jeffrey bialos a former pentagon official who now is a partner at sutherland asbill &amp brennan llp law firm in washington he says he cant comment on the underlying facts of the itt case but he wonders generally "are we creating a maze of rules thats hard for anyone to comply with " the state department said that in the fiscal year that ended sept it processed export authorization requests for items and services under arms controls an increase of about in the same year enforcement actions under the arms control laws led to arrests indictments and convictions mostly involving efforts to export defense items to china or iran which are proscribed locations the state department said the aerospace industries association the main trade group for defense firms has been pressing the government to speed up export licensing and make it more predictable to facilitate trade with u s allies
