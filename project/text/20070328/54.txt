ellingtons band is heavenly in these live s recordings i now have a sense of what heaven could be like for those of us for whom duke ellington is rejuvenatingly contemporary storyville the legendary danish label a cornucopia of ageless jazz has released "the duke box " available on amazon com and in record stores the s ellington orchestra his most exhilarating is heard entirely in "live" performances in dance halls where as duke told me the dancers became part of the music nightclubs concert halls and on radio remotes from around the country in the page booklet with photographs by herman leonard and william gottlieb masters of decisive jazz moments dan morgenstern notes that the sound of ellington "live" is more vividly realistic than "the dead non resonant studios of that time " those studio recordings also do remain essential because duke insisted on no more than two or three takes a song for maximum immediacy but as i can attest from having been at some of the dance halls and concerts ellington and his wondrously distinctive sidemen were most memorably heard in person the sound quality of "the duke box" is somewhat variable but all of it is more than acceptable and some of it glorious these eight hours of ellington on eight cds are in chronological order but i recommend you start with the s bands second cd the one i would want with me if i were stranded on the proverbial desert island as featured in that cd on nov the band after a typically grueling road trip arrived at the crystal ballroom in fargo n d fortunately on hand with recording equipment were two young ellington enthusiasts jack towers and dick burris mr towers later became an unexcelled sound restorer of time worn classic jazz recordings as some of the sidemen later recalled the band suddenly took fire that night here on fargo tracks from "mood indigo" to "harlem airshaft" and "the flaming sword " the heroes of my youth and beyond johnny hodges "tricky sam" nanton rex stewart ben webster ray nance who had just joined the troupe barney bigard and "the piano player in the band" as ellington described himself demonstrated why this of all dukes orchestras is the most revered but on every one of the eight cds the nonpareil ellington mosaic of moods colors incandescent ensembles "duke loves his brass " as one player told me and instantly identifiable soloists makes this a set i ought to include in my will a historic event from the hurricane in new york is the first performance in of "tonight i shall sleep " duke had recently composed the ballad he might have even written it on the road one night at the raymor ballroom in boston i heard an ellington piece new to me during a break i asked baritone saxophonist harry carney "what was that " "i dont know what its called " carney said "he just wrote it " off the stand duke was often writing or hearing in his head what hed later work out on the piano mr morgensterns comprehensive and deeply knowledgeable notes to "the duke box" end with ellingtons death at age on may of pneumonia and lung cancer in his hospital bed he was still composing and that spring he sent out christmas cards i was privileged to get one of them duke was always planning ahead as in his music which he wanted to be always in "a state of becoming " as former sideman clark terry told me "and thats why he never settled on a final ending for what he wrote " terry added the remarkable achievement of researching assembling and remastering the historic contents of "the duke box" is storyvilles contribution to ellingtons legacy the copenhagen company www storyvillerecords com is now owned by musical sales group headquartered in london and distributed in the u s by mri associated labels in new york looking through storyvilles extensive catalog i always find cds i must add to those i already have from two volumes of bing crosby with louis armstrong and jack teagarden "havin fun" and "havin more fun" to "george lewis and his new orleans stompers" and "thelonious monk in copenhagen " in the blues division there is the deeply flowing blues of pianist singer otis spann named for the red light district of new orleans where many later jazz legends performed the label was started in copenhagen in by year old karl emil knudsen who jubilantly identified himself as "doctor of jazz archaeology " along with arranging for the release of many out of print american classic jazz recordings he also produced sets by jazz masters visiting europe including some like the magisterial tenor saxophonist ben webster who took up residence in denmark after knudsens death in music sales group acquired storyville records wisely keeping on knudsens longtime copenhagen associates mona granger and andres stefanson who share the founders passionate conviction that the music in the storyville catalog will remain imperishable the catalog is available on the storyville web site in view of the diminishing interest by american record conglomerates in searching their archives for jazz reissues the lively persistence of storyville is particularly worth celebrating i spoke recently to the london based head of musical sales and storyville paul lower i found him widely versed in jazz history with the sense of mission of the labels founder among future releases he told me proudly is a ben webster boxed set and in the mail a couple of weeks ago i found a harvest of more storyville "masters of jazz" sets sidney bechet teddy wilson johnny griffin johnny hodges billie holliday and earl hines with four children and six grandchildren to remember in my will i may well include these cds in my bequests along with "the duke box " at a press conference in calcutta india duke ellington was asked "how have you managed to keep a big band so long when so many others have broken up " "its a matter " said duke "of whether you want to play music or make money i guess i like to keep a band so that i can write and hear the music the next day the only way to do that is to pay the band and keep it on tap fifty two weeks a year " asked whether the rise of rock n roll had taken away the jazz audience duke answered "theres still a dixieland audience a swing audience a bop audience all the audiences are still there " and for them so is still storyville records mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal
