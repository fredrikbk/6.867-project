the libby precedent if senate judiciary chairman patrick leahy wants to investigate the bush administrations dismissal of eight u s attorneys thats certainly his prerogative but he and other democrats determined to play up this faux scandal shouldnt be surprised if government officials decide theyd rather not step into this obvious perjury trap the judiciary committee is seeking testimony from among others monica goodling the justice departments liaison to the white house democrats want to quiz ms goodling on her communications with other justice officials such as deputy attorney general paul mcnulty who testified about the firings before the senate committee in february this week ms goodling indicated she will exercise her constitutional right to keep mum sad to say this is one more unfortunate result of the beltways modern habit of criminalizing political differences a la the scooter libby travesty congress has the right to conduct oversight of the executive and in a better world government officials would be willing to testify and give as good as they get thus would the public be educated about the facts and policy differences be aired but ms goodling has been around and she can see democrats dont really want to know the truth they want to shout "liar liar" and set the stage to accuse justice officials of criminal behavior in a statement to the committee explaining her decision ms goodling said "i have read public remarks by members of both the house and senate committees on the judiciary in which those members have drawn conclusions about the subject matter and the testimony now under investigation by the committee " weve read them too representative linda sanchez has already concluded that there have been "attempts to mislead the public on this issue " in a joint press conference senators charles schumer and dianne feinstein characterized justices testimony as "misleading statement after misleading statement deliberate misleading statements " mr schumer is also a lawyer and we reckon he deliberately chose that word "deliberate" as a prelude to charging criminal deception and keeping the issue alive long enough to help elect more senate democrats next year he runs the senate democratic campaign committee senator leahy himself issued a press release asserting that attorney general alberto gonzales and mr mcnulty "failed to tell congress the whole truth about this matter under oath " now that these democrats have reached a verdict they want to hold the trial if anyone had any doubt about this criminalization game it should have vanished late monday with senator leahys suggestion that ms goodlings decision not to testify implies that shes done something wrong "the american people are left to wonder what conduct is at the base of ms goodlings concern that she may incriminate herself in connection with criminal charges if she appears before the committee under oath " mr leahy said but the only thing the american people might wonder about is why the senator a lawyer who should know better has seen fit to bully an individual for doing nothing more than invoking her fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination mr leahys public smear prompted a rebuttal from ms goodlings lawyer john dowd who reminded the senator that "the fifth amendment protects innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances as much as it protects those who may have done something wrong " count ms goodlings silence as one more unintended consequence of the scooter libby case mr libby made the mistake of cooperating with the investigation into a leak he had nothing to do with and he later found himself charged with perjury based on little more than conflicting memories of who said what and when the prosecutor never even charged anyone for the leak that started it all theres no apparent underlying crime in this "scandal" either but well bet more than one democrat will soon be calling for a "special prosecutor" to investigate it nonetheless the new york times has already floated the idea as usual as mr dowd put it in his letter to mr leahy "the potential for legal jeopardy for ms goodling from even her most truthful and accurate testimony under these circumstances is very real one need look no further than the recent circumstances and proceedings involving lewis libby " if the probing senators want to know why lawyers cant in good conscience advise their honest clients in government to answer senate questions they should look first to the bitter climate their own habits have created
