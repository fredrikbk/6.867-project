a quick x ray could prevent surgical error doctors split over procedure to prevent common injury in gallbladder removal like thousands of other patients every year katherine adams learned that a commonly performed surgery to remove the gallbladder can carry serious risk the year old illinois womans bile duct was severed during the operation a mistake that experts say happens far too often and can lead to serious complications and death its also one of the biggest causes of surgical malpractice claims ms adams herself won a judgment of more than half a million dollars against her surgeon and the hospital now mounting evidence suggests the hazard could often be avoided if doctors performed a relatively simple x ray procedure to map out the ducts before surgery an estimated gallbladder operations are performed a year with as many as in patients suffering bile duct injuries some studies show that the pre surgery mapping could reduce the error rate by half a number of prominent surgeons and research including a review in the current journal of the american college of surgeons have called for broader use of the x ray procedure called an intraoperative cholangiogram the society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeons guidelines say such imaging "should be applied liberally" before surgery to help identify the anatomy still the procedure is encountering resistance from other surgeons who say its an unnecessary expense only one in five surgeons routinely performs a cholangiogram before gallbladder operations cholangiograms have a lot of potential but "they have not been adopted as a routine part of most surgeons practices " says lawrence way a surgeon at the university of california san francisco who is an expert in repairing bile duct injuries he says one reason for the lack of enthusiasm is that hundreds of cholangiograms would have to be performed to avoid one bile duct injury some studies have suggested the cost of routine cholangiograms about &# by one estimate doesnt justify the expected benefit the issue highlights a bigger debate in the medical community over the cost effectiveness of added safety measures even as doctors are pressured to reduce medical errors there is counter pressure to cut back on unnecessary procedures and justify each expense surgeons typically remove gallbladders if a patient has serious gallstone problems the modern day gallbladder operation performed by inserting high tech equipment and a camera into four small incisions in the abdomen has led to most patients leaving the hospital on the same day and returning to work soon thereafter the quick laparoscopic approach has become the standard replacing the operation performed years ago that required a lengthy incision and days of in hospital recuperation the less invasive operation however has resulted in more bile duct injuries considered by many to be the most severe risk associated with gallbladder surgery studies have found bile duct injuries occur anywhere from twice to times as often in laparoscopic surgery as in the older large incision surgery two recent surveys found that botched laparoscopic gallbladder operations are a leading cause of malpractice claims against general surgeons in addition according to the physician insurers association of america gallbladder malpractice claims are more likely to settle in favor of plaintiffs than other malpractice claims and for higher amounts with an average settlement in the range of a quarter of a million dollars in most cases surgeons cut the bile duct because they mistakenly believe it is the nearby cystic duct which must be severed to remove the gallbladder if the bile duct is cut bile can leak into the abdominal cavity causing serious and sometimes fatal infection at a minimum the sliced bile duct needs to be repaired a process that often involves major reconstructive surgery and a long hospital stay use of a cholangiogram to identify the ducts before surgery takes about minutes it involves the surgeon injecting a dye into the biliary system and taking an x ray of the area the resulting image creates a map of the duct system allowing surgeons to confirm they are cutting the right tube "there is a tremendous opportunity to save lives if we make some changes " says david r flum a surgeon at the university of washington medical center who has studied the issue "its the single best way to drop the risk of bile duct injury " a analysis by german researchers of more than gallbladder operations found that patients who underwent a cholangiogram suffered bile duct injuries at half the rate as patients who did not have the x ray in a subsequent study of million medicare patients who had a gallbladder operation dr flums group found the risk of injury increased by when a cholangiogram was not used eddie joe reddick the nashville tenn surgeon who pioneered laparoscopic gallbladder surgery in the u s during the late s says he made cholangiograms standard practice in his surgeries "the anatomy of this area is routinely kind of screwy " he says "it doesnt always look like it should shooting a cholangiogram lets you know where you are " dr reddick invented a special catheter used to inject dye into the cystic duct during a cholangiogram although he still promotes the sale of the catheter he no longer receives royalties surgeon resistanceas many as half of all gallbladder surgeons are expected to mistakenly cut a bile duct at least once during their career according to a survey of surgeons that figure also helps explain some of the resistance to routine cholangiograms since half of all surgeons will never experience a bile duct complication many of those physicians believe a prudent surgeon can avoid clipping the bile duct without the use of an x ray edward phillips the vice chairman of surgery at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles who reviewed the cholangiography issue for the nih says he performs the procedure every time he does a gallbladder operation but he notes that many surgeons dont get enough training in the technique to feel comfortable doing it and others simply find the cholangiogram unnecessary if they are confident they have identified the right ducts using other methods in research published in dr way at uc san francisco studied patients with bile duct injuries and determined that nearly every one was caused by a "visual perceptual illusion " in other words doctors were convinced they were cutting the right tube one reason the incidence of bile duct injuries may be higher with laparoscopic surgery is that the television monitor of the gallbladder area is two dimensional as opposed to the three dimensional view a surgeon has in the old open surgery some surgeons say the ability to touch the ducts with their fingers in the open procedure also helped them avoid mistakes ms adams believes a cholangiogram would have made a difference in the outcome of her operation "it would have been well worth it " she says the resulting medical bills from her bile duct injury totaled &# an expert hired by ms adams as part of a malpractice suit against her surgeon testified that a cholangiogram should have been performed the surgeon kellie jones monahan admitted she misidentified the bile duct and mistakenly cut it according to court records a jury awarded ms adams &# an attorney for dr jones monahan had no comment ms adams a mother of two in mattoon ill says she went in for the surgery on a friday with the expectation she would leave the hospital the same day and be back at her job at a local heating oil company the following monday instead ms adams says she awoke to the surgeon saying she "was sorry" and that "damage had been done " ms adams was rushed by ambulance to barnes jewish hospital in st louis where she spent several days being evaluated and having tubes placed in her abdomen to drain bile from the severed duct she returned to the st louis hospital twice more over the next three months the second time to have surgery to repair her biliary system that operation required a huge l shaped incision from just below her breast bone down to her bellybutton and across part of her abdomen "it ticks me off " ms adams says "the first thing i see every day when i get up to shower and look in the mirror is that scar "
