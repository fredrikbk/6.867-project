oil city of mosul has a population that is approximately shiite baghdad had long borne the brunt of the worst sectarian violence since the destruction of the al askari mosque in samarra last year but

since january meanwhile speaking after the senate narrowly voted to keep a timeline for the withdrawal of u s forces from iraq in a war spending bill yesterday president bush said that establishing a clear schedule for pulling out of iraq at lawmakers bidding would have disastrous repercussions "our enemies in iraq would simply have to mark their calendars theyd spend the months ahead plotting how to use their new safe haven once we were to leave " mr bush said in a speech to the national cattlemens beef association "it makes no sense for politicians in washington d c to be dictating arbitrary timelines for our military commanders in a war zone miles away " mr bush has promised to veto any measure that sets out a withdrawal timeline and he reiterated that position saying that he wouldnt negotiate with congress bernanke keys some familiar notes federal reserve chairman ben bernanke testifying on the outlook to the joint economic committee of congress said despite risks that the economy may slow or that inflation might speed up that the central bank currently has the correct stance toward monetary policy "to date the incoming data have supported the view that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable economic growth and a gradual ebbing of core inflation " he said to the panel suggesting that policy makers are disinclined to do any tinkering with interest rates in the near future the fed chairman also offered some dulcet tones on the subprime mortgage fiasco saying that he sees no signs that it is poised to spill over into the broader economy and cause greater discomfort he also said that business spending should grow modestly a position that puzzled some listeners who found little to support that in a new report on durable goods orders a

aircraft orders surged amid some brisk business at boeing but if boom times for the aerospace giant are set off to one side durables orders excluding the transportation sector were negative also orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched barometer of business investment slipped that led ian shepherdson chief u s economist at high frequency economics to conclude that mr bernanke "appears to be in denial " he said that a "moderate pace" of expansion in business spending is possible "but only if you define moderate as zero at best and more likely declining outright " comments shake markets mr bernankes testimony about the economy together with the weak durables data and a spurt in crude oil prices left stock traders in a jittery mood and the dow jones

now "we had hoped to see their immediate release " he said speaking of the sailors "this has not happened it is now time to ratchet up the diplomatic and international pressure in order to make sure the iranian government understands its total isolation on this issue " underlining that stance london said that it was freezing all bilateral dealings with iran iranian foreign minister manouchehr
