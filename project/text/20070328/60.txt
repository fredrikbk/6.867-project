floridas state insurer criticized if a megahurricane hits florida homeowners and businesses will be hit with huge tax increases to pay insurance claims says a report from a business association calling on the state run insurer of last resort to slow its growth the tax increases in the form of special assessments on most insurance premiums would be a result of the state legislatures move to cut insurance premiums now by shifting costs to after the event said a report issued last week by the associated industries of florida a lobbying group representing around businesses including insurance companies in the state "our state could be building a financial house of cards that could easily collapse " said barney bishop the groups president and chief executive "such a collapse would likely result in enormous state debt and further taxes on our insurance policies " since the record breaking and storm seasons florida and other gulf coast states have struggled as mainstream insurers have cut back coverage or pulled out of coastal areas entirely state farm insurance cos the largest private insurer in florida has strictly limited the amount of new business it writes there while the third largest allstate corp is in the process of transferring around policies to other insurers safeco corp and hartford financial services group inc have said they will no longer write new policies in the state mr bishop said the problem is less pronounced in commercial insurance the lobbying groups study prepared by tillinghast the research unit of towers perrin concludes that recent florida legislation aimed at cutting insurance premiums could drastically increase the amount of hurricane insurance payments that will be financed by bonds and premium assessments on homeowners and businesses because the insurer of last resort citizens property insurance corp lacks adequate reserves to pay claims in case of a catastrophe the group is calling for a slowdown in growth for citizens which has around one third of the homeowners insurance market and which plans to rapidly expand and begin offering some commercial policies as well according to citizens spokesman rocky scott the insurer has around &# billion in total exposure in the market and just under &# billion in cash on hand though it has an additional &# billion in bonding capacity and has made arrangements for a &# billion line of credit "there are obviously concerns about the ability to pay in the event of a major storm " said mr scott "but every company will face that concern" in the event of a big storm a number of forecasters including the respected colorado state university team of philip j klotzbach and william m gray have predicted an active hurricane season the season runs from june through november an estimate by risk modeler air worldwide corp places the potential insured cost of a category storm that hits the miami fort lauderdale area at &# billion but a series of smaller storms could also lead to assessments that exceed the savings created by the legislation the report said according to tillinghast per household special assessments could range from &# to as high as &# annually for years if a major hurricane hits in an interview mr bishop said his groups main concern was that the citizens has expanded quickly as it broadens beyond its original mission of insuring coastal homes "our concern is not that they are undercutting prices but that they are out to expand and dont have the dollars in the bank or actuarially sound rates to be able to pay the losses " mr bishop said "we are asking them to do due diligence " legislation this year that expanded special assessments on most business insurance policies to cover insurance payment shortfalls created the possibility that business owners will face new fees on their business policies as well as personal policies if florida has a major storm season mr bishop said many businesses are avoiding expanding in the state self insuring or going without insurance as are many homeowners to avoid skyrocketing premiums
