business bookshelf doing more of what youre good at doing go put your strengths to work by marcus buckingham free press pages &# the dustjacket of "go put your strengths to work" directs readers to the web site simplystrengths com to "learn how engaged your strengths are " i went as suggested and took the strengths engagement track test i scored a high on the test and was told "you are a very focused person " my bet is that marcus buckingham scores even higher he is preternaturally focused the strength of mr buckinghams book is its philosophical base in the late peter druckers classic admonition "the effective executive makes strength productive he knows that one cannot build on weakness " the author of several business books including "first break all the rules " mr buckingham is a drucker disciple but also a proselytizer for his own elaboration on the masters teachings what mr buckingham calls the "strengths movement " like a weight lifter in the gym mr buckingham builds his strengths movement through a lot of repetitions he makes his case and restates it in multiple ways and in multiple media beyond the web site there are videos self assessment tests and self improvement plans for every week every quarter every six months and every year and "rememo" tools in the back of the book these last are detachable green "i loved it" strength statement cards that begin "i loved it when " and red "i loathed it" weakness statement cards that begin "i felt weak drained bored when " to drill in the lessons mr buckingham offers plenty of acronyms the four signs of strength are designated perhaps inevitably sign s success i instinct g growth n needs the "distinct strategy for putting your strengths to work" he calls free f focus r release e educate e expand but enough about the accessories back to the book remember the book its message is mr buckinghams six step discipline meant to be followed over the course of six weeks the first step is to "bust the myth" that fixing ones weaknesses is the path to success he says that "repeated polls" indicate that of respondents agree or strongly agree with this misguided notion then label your strengths which he stresses does not refer to the sort of "patterns and predispositions" identified in personality tests often used in business but to realms of work where you show "consistent near perfect performance " then mr buckingham counsels how to flourish at work by "volunteering your strengths to the team" and how to navigate away from activities that weaken your performance and standing with colleagues it is also essential he says to "speak up" by having a "my strengths and weaknesses conversation" with teammates and with your manager the aim isnt to make them think that "youre some sensitive little flower who needs special treatment " mr buckingham says but to let them "know how to set you up so that you can make your greatest possible contribution " the last step he says is to "build strong habits" assisted of course by the exercises provided by "go put your strengths to work " will this regimen be effective given that it is rooted in the sound capitalize on your strengths thinking of peter drucker it might well be especially since mr buckingham uses all the forces of modern communication to reinforce his message for the motivated person who aspires to improve performance this clear and self contained program may help for others all the filling in of cards and setting of goals could be a substitute for actually doing anything as most executives could tell mr buckingham its the rare employee who can be persuaded to change his work habits even if the potential benefits are obvious that sort of change comes from within years ago many people wanted to sell mutual funds for bernie cornfeld a legendary investor because he made people rich so he devised a simple question to weed out the less promising candidates "do you sincerely want to be rich " he knew people dreamed about being wealthy but did they sincerely want it would they invest the serious time and effort to be successful if so he could make them rich if they just hoped to be rich but wavered at the thought of the work it involved he couldnt help them mr buckingham seems sincere in his desire to help people but this is less a book than a business his own strengths lie in the time honored methods of many successful self help entrepreneurs who turn their thinking into brands that encompass book publishing speaking engagements training and development programs and an online clearinghouse for the entire enterprise still its tempting to wish that peter drucker had a web site mr roman the former chairman and chief executive of ogilvy &amp mather worldwide and author of two business books is writing a biography of david ogilvy for palgrave macmillan
