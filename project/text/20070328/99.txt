medicaid proposal is bitter pill for pharmacies john mitchener owner of mitcheners pharmacy in edenton n c is worried a new medicaid reimbursement rule will force him to drop some of the customers who need him most a couple of truck drivers with diabetes several people who cant read and a woman who always comes in near closing to avoid crowds because her multiple sclerosis has made her unsteady on her feet "these are real live human beings " he says referring to the of his patients who get medicaid "i do not want to be put in the position where i have to say that i cannot fill your prescription anymore because the government pays so little " drugstores are fighting a proposal in the latest white house budget to slash reimbursements for generic drugs under the federal state health program for the poor and disabled which they say would affect their ability to go on filling those prescriptions and ultimately force many small pharmacies to close their doors hurting the neediest customers the governments proposal mandated by the deficit reduction act is aimed at saving the joint federal state medicaid program &# billion over five years the savings would come mainly through changing how the government calculates reimbursement to pharmacies including around small pharmacies with &# million or less in annual revenue the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services which administers medicaid and put forth the proposal in december is required by law to finalize the new rule on medicaid reimbursements by july the plan already has sparked a firestorm in washington the agency has received more than responses to the proposal many of them are objections from unusual allies pharmacies makers of generic drugs and pharmacy benefit managers whose interests often are at odds congress has jumped into the fray pharmacists question why theyre being asked to bear those cuts which make up more than of the proposed medicaid cuts over the five year period when pharmacy expenses are only of the total medicaid budget "this is probably the most crucial issue that this industry has ever faced " says bruce roberts chief executive of the national community pharmacists association the lobbying group that represents independent pharmacies the controversy over the new rule centers on the definition of an "average manufacturer price" used to calculate the reimbursements pharmacies receive for generic drugs under the new proposal for the first time the reimbursement formula would include an average manufacturer price that takes into account mail order prices and rebates to the big pharmacy benefit managers or pbms that administer drug benefits for large employers and health plans but retail and independent pharmacies where most medicaid beneficiaries buy their drugs dont get those rebates and discounts the government pays for medicaid prescriptions in two ways the federal government reimburses the pharmacy for the cost of the medication while the state pays the pharmacy a dispensing fee which is supposed to cover the portion of the pharmacists salary and store operations that are used to fill the prescription while some generic drugs do provide significant profits to pharmacies retail pharmacists dont always make money on them the independent pharmacists group offers an example from a pharmacy in alabama it pays &# to purchase tablets of the generic indomethacin a commonly prescribed anti inflammatory drug the federal government reimburses the pharmacy &# in alabama the state dispensing fee is &# per prescription but the average dispensing cost to the pharmacy is &# according to a study by the accounting firm grant thornton add it up and the pharmacy loses &# on filling the prescription the new medicaid rule is expected to make such gaps worse though the government has yet to release the reimbursement rates it will pay for specific drugs a report by the government accountability office aimed at determining the effect of the new rule found that reimbursements wouldnt even cover pharmacies costs of buying many drugs let alone the cost of dispensing them the report based on confidential pricing information that pharmacists arent allowed to review says reimbursements would be on average below the cost that a pharmacy pays a wholesaler for the drug meaning many pharmacists couldnt afford to fill such prescriptions for medicaid recipients leslie v norwalk acting administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services says the gao report is flawed because it didnt use a uniform definition of the average manufacturer price "without a definition the numbers are meaningless " she says the gao responds that it used the most complete and accurate data sources available in its proposal the centers for medicare and medicaid services said it hasnt yet determined exactly what the effect of the new regulation would be although the changes would have only a small impact on most pharmacies the proposal said "we are unable to estimate quantitatively effects on small pharmacies particularly those in low income areas where there are high concentrations of medicaid beneficiaries " mark merritt president of the pharmaceutical care management association a trade group for pbms says mail order prices and pbm rebates should be excluded because of the problems that would pose for pharmacies among other reasons "pbms rely on chain and independent pharmacies alike to provide access to prescriptions for their government and commercial clients and would not want to see that access put in jeopardy " he wrote in a comment on the proposal big chains such as walgreen co and cvs corp also object to the plan a lower reimbursement "can reduce the incentive to dispense generics " says michael polzin a spokesman for walgreen where medicaid reimbursements account for of pharmacy sales if as a result patients begin buying more brand name drugs "that can have the effect overall of costing medicaid more money than theyre saving " he says mr polzin adds that walgreen might have to cut costs perhaps by limiting operating hours at pharmacies with a high proportion of medicaid patients actuaries for the agency that administers medicaid figure that under the new formula pharmacies would likely lose &# million in revenue from medicaid this year and &# billion annually by the agency argues that the cuts would represent only a small portion of pharmacy revenue total retail prescription sales in reached &# billion in including chains independents supermarkets and mail order the government says but the cuts could hit particularly hard at independent pharmacies which get an average of of their revenue from dispensing prescriptions medicaid revenues make up one fifth of the average independent pharmacys business for some its more than many of these pharmacies are in rural areas and have little or no competition in a survey of independent pharmacists say they will consider not filling medicaid prescriptions if the proposal goes through as it is if so some customers might have to wait at an emergency room or drive miles to get their medications while others might not have any practical alternative two weeks ago senators both democrats and republicans sent a letter asking that the reimbursement plan be revised meanwhile the national community pharmacists association says it is meeting with officials in congress and working with state governments to try to increase dispensing fees to make up some of the predicted shortfall ms norwalk says the agency is reviewing the comments it has received but she declined to predict what the final rule will look like "we appreciate the importance of generic drugs and state medicaid programs and want to encourage their use " she says corrections &amp amplifications medicaid reimbursements for the cost of the medication and the dispensing fee are made by the states based on federal guidelines the federal government pays each state its share of prescription drug program expenditures based on that states matching rate a march marketplace article incorrectly stated that the federal government reimburses the pharmacy for the cost of the medication while the state pays the pharmacy a dispensing fee wsj april
