fiscally fit love isnt cheap terri decides to replace a trinket whose value cant be measured online edition when i came home on valentines day i found my seven year old son gerald standing at the top of the stairs practically dancing with excitement in his hands he held a small black box with a bow and as i reached the top of the stairs he said proudly "i bought this for you for valentines day " i opened the box to find a very pretty faux ruby and diamond ring that hed bought for &# at his schools student store the look on his face when he saw how much i liked it was the kind of mommy moment that instantly erases memories of pregnant days and sleepless nights that night i proudly wore his gift on my right ring finger even though it was two sizes too big at dinner gerald pointed at my wedding ring and said to my husband gerry "that ones your ring " then he pointed at his gift "and this ones mine " later gerry and i talked about how proud gerald was and agreed that in his mind the ring wasnt just a gift it was a symbol of his feelings and i felt the same way my ruby ring shows the world that im loved by my son just as my wedding ring shows the world that im loved by my husband it made the gift so much more special to me each morning afterward as i got ready for work gerald would ask if i would wear his ring and of course i said yes then it happened i lost one of the stones then another the flimsy metal prongs holding the stones were no match for my hands daily routine and i kicked myself for not taking the ring off when gerald wasnt around i put the remnants of the ring in my jewelry box and hoped he wouldnt notice i wasnt wearing it no chance as soon as he got home from school that day he looked at my hand and asked "wheres my ring " i showed him the ring explained that the prongs werent very strong and apologized for losing the stones "im sorry " i said "i should have taken better care of it " the look on his face when i told him that was the kind of mommy moment when you make a mental note to start saving for therapy wanting to ease my suffering and cheer up our son gerry jumped in and said "dont worry ill take it to the jewelry store and get it fixed " he patted geralds back reassuringly and with that gerald brightened and headed for the kitchen to start his homework gerry and i shot each other sheepish looks in our haste to make things better wed made a promise wed have to keep and it was going to cost us the following monday i called the school store to see if it had any more rings in stock naturally they were sold out the clerk gave me the number of the stores supplier and i found out the company sold the trinkets in bulk for &# for a moment i considered paying the &# and donating the remaining rings to the school but then it occurred to me that even if i replaced the ring with another just like it id be facing the same problem how to care for an extremely fragile ring forget about donating the rings in bulk id probably need them all after gerald asked about repairing the ring for the umpteenth time gerry told me hed try and find a real ruby ring to replace it wed given up hope that gerald would eventually forget about the ring after several trips to jewelry stores in our area he came up empty the ruby rings available looked nothing like geralds gift i spent an hour or two searching online stores also with no luck then a few weeks ago as i scanned the jewelry counter at our local mall i saw it not an exact match but close enough but the price made me pause &# i called gerry from my cellphone and asked "what do you think " go for it he said as luck would have it there was a sale going on and the ring cost &# at the jewelry counter the saleswoman asked whether the ring was a gift and i told her the story and how anxious gerald was to have his ring "repaired " she smiled and told me her daughter had given her a faux gold pendant for her birthday as with my ring her necklace was flimsy and so she spent &# on a gold replacement so she wouldnt lose it unfortunately she added the pendant itself was starting to turn green "the things parents go through to please our children " she said with a laugh that night i placed the new ring on my finger without mentioning it to gerald and i went about my business at home until he noticed it "my ring " he yelped "you got it back " then he dragged me by the arm into the living room to show my husband and we all admired it geralds happy "his ring" is back where it belongs and i know that every time i look at it ill remember the look on his face that valentines day is that memory worth &# absolutely did i go overboard in making a treasure of geralds &# ring maybe but ill remind him how much i cherish his gift and what it means to me and hope my appreciation will encourage him to be a more generous person still im not sure whether buying a replacement ring was the right thing to do by gerald mistakes are made in life that money cant always solve we bought our way out of an uncomfortable situation perhaps i should have set an example for my son to follow by simply offering a straightforward heartfelt apology and promising to be more careful with future gifts gerry believes i tend to overthink parenting and that we shouldnt worry so much about imparting life lessons at every twist and turn he argues that since the ring is symbol of geralds bond with me we owed it to him to replace it as proof he points to my anniversary ring for our th anniversary in gerry gave me a beautiful three stone diamond ring after which we agreed to "retire" my inexpensive wedding ring set "it doesnt matter to me which rings you wear as long as you wear my ring " he says when your children present you with a gift or something theyve made how do you decide
