boomer effect gloomy forecasts long term investors who ignore the impact of demographics on financial markets do so at their peril the surge in births in the two decades after world war ii has played a large role in fueling u s economic growth and investment returns in recent decades and has fattened the bottom lines of a variety of industries for example financial services and medical device companies as baby boomers have entered middle age as with most economic changes the bad comes with the good and according to some economists the coming decades could look nasty with boomers about to enter retirement some scary scenarios have been painted about the impact on the stock market and the nations solvency "i believe that over the next years the aging population is the most critical issue facing the developed world " said economist and stock market guru jeremy siegel in a debate at the milken institute last april he sees a worst case scenario of a to drop in asset prices as a result of portfolio liquidation a view echoed by a number of his colleagues other economists say the concerns about a baby boomer induced financial market bust are overblown and that supply and demand for stocks bonds and real estate wont be distorted as much as mr siegel has predicted on the other hand mr siegels theory may be the least of our worries the consequences of paying for entitlements in coming decades may be the greatest economic threat ever faced by the u s and could hammer financial markets if not remedied baby boomers defined as the generation born between and number million according to the u s census bureau or some of the population the surge in births during this period combined with rising life expectancy means that the over population is expected to grow from currently to almost by meanwhile the ratio of u s workers to retirees will drop nearly by half by to from today due to rising life expectancy the number of years spent drawing down savings in retirement are now nearly years up from in the scenario envisioned by mr siegel is that boomers will begin retiring in the next few years and will have a hard time finding enough young savers to buy their assets the next age cohort generation x number just million spanning years and now have a negative savings rate this could depress the value of boomers estimated &# trillion in financial assets as well as their expected &# trillion in inheritance from their parents "what happens when boomers retire and sell their assets are there enough people to absorb all that wealth " asked mr siegel it may be at sharply lower prices he said this gloomy scenario ignores the actual distribution of assets though according to quincy krosby chief investment strategist at hartford financial services many typical retirees will burn through their entire savings and rely on family or government help but it may not tank stocks average people "will be using up their k s but they dont own the majority of stocks " she said "its the top group " the richest of americans own about two thirds of financial assets the overall family net worth of the top is about times higher than the median and times the lowest quintile according to federal reserve data much of this wealth may remain intact and pass to the next generation said ms krosby under this scenario financial assets will come under some selling pressure but the impact will be far milder than mr siegels worst case former international monetary fund economist robin brooks went even further stating in a september presentation that he sees "no link between stock returns and demographics" and predicting that "real stock prices will keep rising as the baby boomers continue to age " mr siegel hedges his warning by saying that stock prices could be kept aloft by selling assets to foreigners dont count on heretofore thrifty countries elsewhere in the developed world though their demographic crunch makes the u s s look like childs play japan for example will see a ratio of one worker to one retiree by the middle of this century in the developed world as a whole the median age has gone from in to now and will reach by according to united nations forecasts developing countries with younger populations will make up of the world economy by versus just today and their savers may wind up owning majority stakes in todays blue chip companies mr siegel said the pattern of the old selling to the young has existed for decades but that it has simply moved from the local to the national level and if this scenario plays out to the international level even with young brazilians chinese and indians buying our assets people will have to retire at a later age to make ends meet but the adjustment wont be quite so severe a retirement age of rather than or more said mr siegel the focus of messrs siegel and brooks and others on the supply and demand for stocks may be ignoring a far more significant threat to financial markets the liquidation effect of the wave of retirees on asset prices is murky but the fiscal impact of the wave of retirees is better understood skyrocketing expenditures for social security and medicare are unfunded to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars by the situation could become so acute that the entire federal budget would be consumed by entitlements according to david walker comptroller general at the government accountability office "our government has made a whole lot of promises that in the long run it cant possibly keep " said mr walker in a speech earlier this month he likened the burden on each household to a hidden mortgage of &# or times median income but without the house the fiscal train wreck could effectively bankrupt the u s or lead to hyperinflation in coming decades if drastic changes arent made according to boston university economist laurence kotlikoff who said this would severely affect the value of stocks and bonds ms krosby acknowledges the fiscal strains noting that medicare is a particular problem but said such forecasts dont take into account measures that may be taken such as postponing retirement or a popular outcry for a reduction in health care costs "its very hard to extrapolate out into the future and the u s is a very resilient society " she said ms krosby predicts that boomers will use their electoral clout to ease the financial crunch the likely effect is a higher tax burden on the productive population but probably not enough to torpedo an economy as adaptable as the one in the u s as for the scary fiscal equation ms krosby said it is difficult to pin down such long term trends except for one for which she quotes the great economist john maynard keynes "in the long run were all dead "
