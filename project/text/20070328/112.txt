politics &amp economics south korea ready to open up in push for trade deal protectionism may fall in favor of new goals seoul south korea the fate of a possible free trade agreement between south korea and the u s hinges on a wrenching question for seoul is it prepared to throw out the clinging remains of its protectionist economic model and embrace the risks and returns of an open economy the two countries are negotiating what would be the biggest trade agreement for the u s since the north american free trade agreement in and the biggest deal ever for south korea but while they face a monday deadline differences remain in important areas such as rice and autos the agreement could get watered down or might not happen at all for the u s a deal would allow a wide range of companies from ford motor co to nike inc more access to increasingly prosperous south korean consumers for u s consumers a pact would bring lower prices on korean made cars appliances clothing and electronics a deal would also be a victory for the bush administration which has chosen to pursue bilateral free trade pacts as an alternative to the floundering multinational talks under the world trade organization a deal would be particularly welcome as white house hopes for winning quick approval on free trade deals with panama peru and colombia face hurdles amid a bid by democrats in congress to emphasize environmental protection and labor rights in all new trade pacts in south korea the impact of any free trade deal would be far greater than in the u s a deal could lead to restructuring of a long list of coddled industries from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals protectionist barriers are still a key defense for south korea and have helped in its transformation from one of the worlds poorest countries in the s to one of the richest south korea was mired in poverty for years after the korean war in the s a military dictator built a modern economy in the s and s by assigning large companies to build different parts of the economy and protecting them with sky high import duties that limited competition from outside last year south korea was the worlds th largest economy mainly by exporting products such as hyundai sedans and samsung flat panel television sets yet many trade barriers remain for imports including a tariff on beef and an tax on cars from other countries south koreas average tariff on industrial products is compared with in the u s and its average tariff on food products is compared with in the u s despite the protection south koreas economy now faces a problem while it grew by to a year for much of the s its growth has recently slowed to a key reason chinese competitors are taking away south koreas lead in low cost manufacturing and threatening south koreas higher value industries to boost the economy president roh moo hyun says south korea needs to do away with the old growth model and open up he initiated the trade talks two years ago hoping to attract more foreign investment and stimulate service industries which account for of the south korean economy compared with about in the u s mr roh has also started free trade negotiations with canada australia and new zealand and is exploring talks with the european union and the six arab states that form the gulf cooperation council the free trade talks come as south korea strives to make other efforts to speed up its economic growth regulators are pushing to make the countrys businesses more transparent in hopes of boosting global competitiveness addressing criticism that south korea had weak accounting and disclosure standards the country has opened its banking sector to foreign owners and competitors resulting in the fast growth of global players such as hsbc holdings plc and a variety of new financial services "the moment has come for korea to take the next step with their economy given their position in asia and competition from china thats different from what it was years ago " says william rhodes senior vice chairman of citigroup inc and chairman of the u s korea business council the free trade talks have a tight deadline because any agreement must be approved or rejected by the u s congress before july which is when the bush administrations ability to negotiate trade pacts on a fast track basis expires meanwhile south korea is gearing up for presidential elections in december making it difficult for major policies to pass later this year any agreement is expected to face challenges by lawmakers in both countries a survey last week of south koreas national assembly found support for a deal among of its members while there is broad support in the u s congress for moving forward with south korea some lawmakers worry the koreans will want to maintain barriers in certain sectors including agriculture and automobiles depending on the scope of the deal two way trade between the two countries which amounted to &# billion last year could grow to &# billion to &# billion in the next three to five years south korea would likely maintain its surplus which was &# billion last year though it would probably shrink according to several forecasts even so in south korea opponents have been much more vocal than supporters unions farmers groups college students and left wing activists have repeatedly staged demonstrations sometimes drawing tens of thousands of people the korean media have followed every wrinkle of the talks for the past year turning the debate into a kind of duel with the u s farmers stand to lose the most because so many crops are protected by high tariffs for beef and for oranges and they have won public sympathy "it is a right for a country to feed its own people and a right for a country to produce its own food " says oh jong ryul a union activist who is leading a group of hunger strikers in their third week of protest against a deal one major sticking point is korean rice which accounts for about half of south koreas agricultural output a high tariff allows farmers to charge more than three times as much for rice as in china if rice is left out of the free trade deal about one third of koreas potential economic growth from the deal wouldnt occur according to forecasts from both u s and korean economists because prices would remain high and land wouldnt be used more efficiently for other crops for the u s the biggest hurdle is autos only of the one million cars sold in south korea last year came from outside the country the most closed market in any major auto producing nation fewer than were from u s based companies the u s wants south korea to eliminate its tariff on all vehicle imports and a tax based on engine size that falls hardest on imports in return the u s would eliminate its tariff on south korean cars lina yoon contributed to this article
