a chef faces his worst fears a top creator of exotic flavors battles tongue cancer chicago a year after chef grant achatz opened alinea here in gourmet magazine named the restaurant the best in the country and the prestigious mobil guide gave it its highest rating of five stars the young chefs exotic lavishly presented creations a mango duck dish is served on a deflating pillow that releases lavender scented air have connoisseurs lining up to book meals that cost an average of &# a person but last month doctors gave mr achatz years old devastating news a cancerous tumor was growing inside his tongue the disease was so advanced that three doctors told him the only way to cure it was to cut out part of his tongue leaving one of the worlds most celebrated chefs to ponder life without the ability to taste "i was just in disbelief " says mr achatz pronounced ack etz there are about cases of head and neck cancer a year in the u s and most afflict older people and smokers "ive never had a cigarette in my mouth in my life " mr achatz says the diagnosis sent him looking for an alternative treatment that would save his life and his tongue the tumor had made it so painful to chew that mr achatz couldnt eat solid food and had lost at least pounds saving his tongue hinges on whether a team of doctors at the university of chicago can cure the cancer using an atypical method of treatment instead of the standard therapy removing the tumor surgically followed by radiation and chemotherapy his doctors are starting with a course of chemotherapy that adds a drug called cetuximab to two more conventional drugs then they will follow that with a combination of radiation therapy more chemotherapy and drugs everett vokes one of the oncologists treating the chef says there is a chance of recovery for these types of cancers though he wont give odds for mr achatz if the treatment doesnt cure him doctors will have to consider removing part of his tongue mr achatz skinny and boyish with scraggly auburn hair says he is optimistic about his recovery is feeling great and is determined not to let his illness slow him down alineas owners stress that so far nothing has changed at the restaurant and that they dont anticipate it will despite starting a typically tiring regime of chemotherapy a month ago mr achatz continues to spend long days creating and preparing dishes at alinea sometimes staying past a m already the treatments have improved his condition enough that he can chew more comfortably he grew up helping his parents prepare family style dishes at their st clair mich restaurant after graduating from the culinary institute of america in new york he worked under chef thomas keller at the prestigious french laundry restaurant in yountville calif then became the head chef at trio in evanston ill north of chicago it was there that his avant garde creations began to attract critical plaudits in chicago tribune restaurant critic phil vettel wrote a rave four star review of trio singling out a miniature ice cream sandwich of parmesan laced shortbread wafers around savory olive oil ice cream that mr achatz sent to his table as a starter in mr achatz detected a tiny sore growing on the side of his tongue a dentist told him it was probably from unconsciously biting at the spot and fitted his mouth for a night guard that year he left trio to open his own restaurant in chicagos tony lincoln park neighborhood he decided to call it alinea after the name for a typographical symbol that indicates a new train of thought his ambition wasnt only to present his food as art but to make the entire dining experience into a form of theater that would appeal to all of diners senses and elicit emotional responses for instance mr achatz had an architect design alineas entrance so that people would walk in not be able to see the dining room and briefly think they were someplace other than the restaurant creating a moment of tension as soon as alinea opened in critics began heaping praise on the hypermodern cuisine and eclectic dining experience meals consist of as many as small courses and have taken diners more than seven hours to consume to evoke autumn mr achatz served a piece of pheasant breast on an oak tree branch lit on fire so it would be smoking as it arrived at the table for a dish called "hot potato cold potato " mr achatz skewered a marble size potato and suspended it over a paraffin wax bowl of chilled potato soup so the palate would sense the temperature contrast but as mr achatzs reputation grew his ability to eat was deteriorating by may the sore on his tongue was causing him so much pain that it was difficult for him to talk and bite into solids he had trouble eating one of his favorite foods pizza one day in july doctors told him it was stage b squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue mr achatz says he brooded for a day then set out to find an alternative to surgery "i never said im done or what am i going to do or do i have to change careers " he says dr vokes says its too early to predict exactly what might happen if doctors removed the tumor from mr achatzs tongue typically removing a significant part of the tongue leaves a patient unable to taste and interferes with his or her ability to speak and to swallow the sense of smell isnt usually affected but other senses contribute to mr achatzs talent much of his acclaim derives from the way his dishes look before he cooks a new creation he writes down the ingredients he wants to use and how hell manipulate them then he sketches what it might look like on the plate before discussing it with the chefs who work under him "he has such a spiritual connection with food and the visuals and the taste is just a part of it " says rick tramanto executive chef at tru in chicago "hes way too connected to what hes doing to have a loss of one of the elements deter him at all " associates say it is mr achatzs passion not just his senses that make his food successful "you could take out his tongue and his eyes and it would be grants restaurant " says nick kokonas co owner of alinea "i cant imagine that he wouldnt be able to overcome any limitations " mr kokonas says theyre laying plans to open a second chicago restaurant and that hed "love to do something like alinea in san francisco " next month mr achatz will begin the more intensive combination of chemotherapy and radiation treatments that could slightly dull his ability to taste though dr vokes says taste gradually returns to patients after the treatments stop one recent night at the restaurant he hunched over a row of white platters assembling short ribs with a topping of peanuts and a guinness flavored covering moving intently from dish to dish he broke his concentration only to call out instructions "you bringing lamb or what " then refocused on his task as he sees it tackling cancer isnt much different "the thought process that goes into building these dishes are little miniversions of what i face with my illness " he says "your mind just deconstructs it and pulls it apart and youre left with the same challenges you face every day "
