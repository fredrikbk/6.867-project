ibm takes storage to atomic level researchers at international business machines corp measured a single atoms ability to hold information demonstrating a technique that could aid efforts to build computer hard drives with much more capacity another team of ibm researchers demonstrated a minuscule electrical switch that could someday be used to build faster computer chips both methods were published in science magazine scientists outside the company credited the ibm team with an advance in the field of nanotechnology the science of miniaturization at the atomic level "this is a very important step in terms of understanding the behavior of single atoms on surfaces as far as i know thats unique " said caroline a ross professor of materials science and engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology the techniques will have to be combined with many other advances before they can be used in actual products that could take more than a decade researchers caution ibm and other companies are trying to head off what may be an impending limit to hard drive capacities the companys technique might help break through that limit by suggesting a way to store information in single atoms future researchers will have many hurdles to overcome an atom that could "hold the information at room temperature" would be "the holy grail " said shan xiang wang director of stanford universitys center for magnetic nanotechnology but ibms method doesnt work at room temperature in tests the company cooled the atom to negative degrees fahrenheit and while the companys paper gives a method of reading information from individual atoms it doesnt describe how to store different pieces of information in different atoms the company and others are working to overcome those obstacles "if you can use a single atom to store a little bit of information youd have in effect a thousand times more stuff on your ipod than you currently have " said andreas j heinrich a member of the research team at ibms almaden research center in san jose calif ibms second paper by scientists at ibms research laboratory in zurich might some day allow chip companies to pack more circuits into a tiny computer processor boosting performance currently computer chips are built out of basic building blocks called transistors similar to a light switch but about a trillionth of the size ibm and other researchers competing in nanotechnology are racing to build switches that are smaller still roughly one thousandth the size of a transistor this would allow manufacturers to pack even more tiny switches onto a chip making computers faster and smaller in todays paper ibm demonstrated one such switch built out of fewer than atoms one significant advance ibm said is that the new switch doesnt change its outer shape when flipped from "off" to "on "
