the daily fix blake outlasts santoro to break five set jinx online edition after mostly dull early matches that served as warmups for the top seeds maria sharapova needed minutes to send casey dellacqua home yesterday the u s open served up an early round gem last night with james blake prevailing in five sets over fabrice santoro breaking his supposed jinx with his first five set win in tries hed fallen in fifth sets to lleyton hewitt twice stefan koubek richard krajicek stanislas wawrinka andre agassi fernando gonzalez gael monfils and max mirnyi mr santoro kept his rival guessing with a bewildering assortment of shots he had unforced errors to mr blakes but wore down after the three hour mark "theres an inherent contradiction in winning a five set match " notes bonnie d ford on espn com "it means you played poorly enough to put yourself in a hole and well enough to scramble out of it still the ability to gut out a five setter and preferably win more than you lose is considered a necessary part of a great players tool kit a gauge of stamina and mental toughness " tomorrow jonathan isner will take the court at the u s open he is not expected to win not with a guy named roger federer on the other side of the net a scouting report from andy roddick "isners going to be very tall and rogers going to be very good " but he is expected to be noticed at foot its hard to miss mr isner and to write another chapter in an interesting tennis story in the boston globe bud collins checks in with the year old college student mr isners "pro bio stretches all the way back to july when he lost his debut to a guy almost as tall dick norman at newport " he writes "so he tried the bush leagues for two tournaments worked his world ranking up to no then he decided to go to washington to lobby for himself with a serve they called big bertha back at the university of georgia he nearly devastated the town with aces won five straight decisive set tiebreakers and shook up andy roddick though losing the final nobody had done anything like that before why it was just like the good not so old days at georgia where he led the bulldogs to the recent ncaa team title and was an all american four years it was more nerve racking than pro tennis because you just didnt want to let your teammates down he said " mr roddick won yesterday on his th birthday as jose acasuso retired in the third set with a leg injury in the new york daily news an unimpressed filip bondy pens a kiss off to a dimmed american star "we cant endure your tennis anymore that snappy first serve and those artless groundstrokes " mr bondy writes "for the past four years since you won the u s open we waited for you to find your muse and inspiration you captured no major trophies you demonstrated little finesse you wont play doubles to sharpen those volleys and that net game you keep talking about never really materialized there you were again yesterday busy breaking promises in the injury shortened match " broadway in lower manhattan is known as the canyon of heroes because its the route for ticker tape parades the street is marked with plaques commemorating those parades and the fixs commute takes it past the one for althea gibson the opens first black champion this article from the daily news includes a photo from that parade accompanying a wonderful portrait in words by wayne coffey she was standing at center court at the center of the sporting universe a sepia skinned speck in a sea of whiteness there was nothing new about that the new champion thought but what about this sound this sound was new a convulsion of applause and appreciation that was rocking the blueblood corridors of the west side tennis club in forest hills leaving little doubt about how the fans felt about the angular artistry theyd just witnessed about the whitest sport on the planet suddenly having a champion of a different color thats how mr coffey begins and from there he lets a complicated story breathe explaining how "the jackie robinson of tennis" was very different from jackie robinson and capturing a slew of quietly devastating details like his description of gibson as "a self described traveling girl with quick fists her father taught her to box when he wasnt roughing her up himself " the boston red sox just got swept by the new york yankees but theyre still in first place the new york mets just saw the philadelphia phillies close to within two games but theyre still in first place and theres always the wild card the seattle mariners detroit tigers and milwaukee brewers have stumbled of late but their playoff hopes are alive not so for the baltimore orioles those al east dead men walking theyre games out in organizational disarray and still smarting from that beatdown at the hands of the texas rangers in the baltimore sun childs walker jeff barker and jeff zrebeic check in on a fanbase suffering through another dismal campaign the three talk with fans players present and past and even a sports psychologist but the fix thought the orioles fan with the almost too good to be true name of loyal hartmann jr had the best summation of expecting to lose and being proved right night after night "its very very disgusting " columnists find their calling when they have great athletic deeds to celebrate but sometimes those great athletic deeds dont materialize and a columnist must either turn chaff into some semblance of wheat or make chaff worthy of consideration in its own right in the kansas city star joe posnanski tries the latter after enduring the st louis rams victory over the kansas city chiefs in the two teams fourth preseason game "there are surely more meaningless and pitiful things in this world than the fourth nfl preseason game " he writes "a boxers retirement news conference for instance the th presidential debate the national league central thats really about it though thursday evening in front of several dozen interested fans the soon to be cut st louis rams beat the soon to be cut kansas city chiefs the game was every bit as exciting as the score indicated the rams set the mood right away by sending out an offense that did not have a single starter on it this was ticket money well spent " on espn com wright thompson has a love letter to college football in the south that had us after the first couple of paragraphs and the fixers are new yorkers and baseball guys two friends both unhinged football fans got married earlier this year during the wedding reception the brides father somehow got the ole miss band to march into the room a blaring chorus of starched uniforms and shining brass the groom conducted the crowd stomped and cheered youd have thought folks were celebrating a play scoring drive not holy matrimony soon after the wedding i watched video of this event immediately i recognized the feeling deep down in my gut its something ive felt in so many cathedral like stadiums i closed my eyes and the familiar notes sent me rushing months into the future longing for a tailgate that escalates from simmer to burn for the chill bumps that always come in the moments before kickoff for the evening breezes rustling the white oaks when the game is done my body sat in front of a computer screen my mind was in a stadium it was only april and i longed for september i missed football season its a wonderful mix of civic pride sports mania and explorations of the soul of the south get reading tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep
