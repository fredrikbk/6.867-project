mail here the freeze in global economic liberalization most evident in the moribund doha round of world trade talks only seems to be hardening in these tense geopolitical times especially when it comes to energy a confidential working paper at the european commission obtained by the financial times suggests the european union may try to restrict foreign companies access to the eu energy sector most poignantly through a "reciprocity clause that would keep out countries such as russia or saudi arabia where european companies face severe restrictions on investment " the ft reports proposals in the paper are tied to eu plans for greater energy market competition within the bloc which are due sept but a separate internal commission document says the eu could be "vulnerable to a strategy of third countries to dominate the eu markets not only in terms of supply but also by acquiring" gas and electricity transmission networks it goes on to warn that such investments could be "driven by other motives than economic ones " the ft notes there have been fears especially voiced by poland that russia a major petroleum supplier for western europe could use gazprom or other state owned firms or investment funds to gain control of the continents energy supply one measure envisioned to counter such a move would declare energy a "strategic industry" too crucial to open to non europeans a tactic notably used by france to shield big companies in some rather far flung fields from efforts by the commission to open competition within the eu this argument isnt limited to europeans similar sentiment prevailed in the rejection of chinese oil giant cnoocs bid for unocal and the american brouhaha over dubai ports worlds offer for u s port operations earlier this summer the wall street journal reported that congress was close to producing legislation that would further tighten scrutiny of foreign investments and chinese state media report that the peoples congress today passed an antimonopoly law requiring foreign firms to go through national security checks before they can purchase chinese companies russia and china are among the countries starting to turn their significant foreign reserves toward investment around the world such investment can indeed be harnessed toward a countrys own national interests as much as toward any quest for higher returns a factor that isnt going to reverse the current trend of tightening economic borders sadr takes another step back moqtada al sadr may be staging yet another tactical retreat after yet again overplaying his hand the anti american shiite cleric whose mahdi army fought the american military in the streets and later became a major destabilizing force in iraqs internecine warfare said the militia would be suspending operations for six months "the surprise declaration was widely taken as a tacit acknowledgment of the damage done to his movements reputation by two days of shiite on shiite in fighting which killed people wounded and forced thousands of pilgrims to flee birthday celebrations for the mahdi one of shiite islams most revered medieval saints " the new york times reports u s commanders leading the effort to rebuild iraqs security forces and bolster a faltering government tell the wall street journal the mahdi army has been increasingly stymieing their efforts iraqi brig gen falah hassan kinbar who barely escaped a mahdi army kidnapping attempt this month says some of his own men betrayed him "i am all alone on the battlefield " the general says according to the journal "i want to do my duty but i am very sure my own government will abandon me " separately a draft of a government accountability office report says "iraq has failed to meet all but three of congressionally mandated benchmarks for political and military progress " the washington post reports "the document questions whether some aspects of a more positive assessment by the white house last month adequately reflected the range of views the gao found within the administration " reading ben bernanke most big asian stock markets rose today and all the major european stock indexes were trading higher at midday following yesterdays point rally or rise in the dow jones industrial average the most widely credited reason for the reversal in u s equity trading after tuesdays chute on wall street was a letter to sen charles schumer from federal reserve chairman ben bernanke pledging to "act as needed" to help the economy but as the wall street journal reports there was nothing new in this pledge the journals greg ip points out that mr bernankes handling of his first financial crisis suggests how his approach as central bank chief differs from that of storied predecessor alan greenspan and that helps to explain "why mr bernanke hasnt cut the feds main interest rate yet and it could alter investors expectations of how the bernanke fed will function " historically the feds two duties have been to maintain financial stability while balancing anti inflation duties with the protection of the u s economy from recession "to mr greenspan market confidence and the economys growth prospects were so intertwined as to make the feds two duties almost inseparable " mr ip writes noting mr greenspan cut interest rates after the stock market crash and as part of the feds reaction to the near collapse of hedge fund long term capital management in "by contrast mr bernanke distinguishes between the central banks two functions " and thus turned to the feds discount window for direct lending to banks to help ease the credit crunch this month rather than to the federal funds rate that broadly affects borrowing across the economy european banks may settle u s probes several large european banks are
