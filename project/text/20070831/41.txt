fiscally fit college students watch your credit terri urges students to avoid the mistakes she made by taking on too much debt online edition some college students get into incremental trouble with debt they apply for a credit card one year one or two department store cards the next and over the years their credit limits rise just enough to allow them to borrow more debt than they can manage not me my introduction to credit in college was fast and furious it was my second day on campus and i ventured out with a friend to the student center to find my mailbox there i was approached at table after table and offered all kinds of free gifts t shirts radios coffee mugs discount coupons and other items adorned with our university logo all i had to do in return was apply for a credit card free stuff awesome where do i sign i didnt bother to read the fine print because i didnt actually think id get any of the four cards i applied for that day my parents had badly mismanaged their credit and by the time i left for college they werent able to get approved for credit cards i assumed their borrowing history would reflect badly on me and i wouldnt be approved either so i could barely contain my excitement when the shiny new cards started showing up in my campus mailbox and i wasted no time in using them before the end of freshman year i had run up a few hundred dollars in debt but i could afford the minimum monthly payments on my meager work study pay so i didnt fret much about it in fact i worried so little about it that occasionally id lose track of the bills and miss a payment here and there and throughout my school years i kept signing up for new cards and borrowing more it wasnt until i left school that i realized my careless borrowing habits would come back to haunt me i had amassed more than &# in debt including my student loan and wallet full of credit cards and i needed to borrow more to buy a car to get to and from my new job i cringed as the salesman at the car dealership chuckled derisively at one of the negative entries on my credit report "how could he possibly know about that " i wondered id never heard of a credit report and had no idea that making late payments might prevent me from qualifying for a car loan in the end i got the loan but because of my credit history i didnt get the low finance charges advertised the first few years out of college i struggled to keep up with my debt payments and spent more than a few nights lying awake worrying i was in over my head the day my husband gerry proposed i resolved to get my debt under control i spent the next year and a half working two jobs and living off soup and peanut butter until i got my debt down to just a few thousand dollars the silver lining is those months taught me a hard lesson about managing money but i could have saved myself a lot of grief and hundreds of dollars in interest payments if id learned about the dangers of abusing credit in high school there are signs that todays students are getting the message i missed the average outstanding balance on credit cards of undergraduates who applied for student loans was &# in down from &# in according to a study by nellie mae a unit of student loan company slm but parents who want to help their children build good credit and keep some control of their spending habits now need a new strategy it used to be that parents could add their children as authorized users on their own credit card accounts with a long history of on time payments to the parents account noted on the students credit history helping both of their credit scores but starting next month children will no longer be able to benefit from their parents good habits fair isaac the company that provides fico credit scores announced recently that as of september consumers who are added as an authorized user on someone elses credit card wont be able to benefit from the account owners credit history adding children as authorized users can still help parents monitor their spending while away at college however but its not a cure all before handing over a credit card sit down and give the child a crash course on how to use it wisely start by setting a monthly spending limit you can adjust the amount after the student starts school when you have a better idea what monthly expenses will be explain the difference between finance charges for purchases and for cash advances and the dangers of universal default where card companies penalize you with higher rates if you make late payments elsewhere then make a habit of going over statements with your child if after a year your child proves able to manage credit wisely consider opening an account in his or her name to start building a good credit history search for cards with low finance charges and fees here dont limit your search to cards marketed solely for students you may find better terms with other cards and stay away from cards with low spending limits of a few hundred dollars or so those could lead to steep over the limit charges urge your child to come to you if the debt becomes a burden dont just offer a bailout instead discuss ways he or she can repay you or perhaps repay the debt on his or her own this is a good time to educate your child about the value of developing good borrowing habits make sure he or she knows the consequences of making late payments in addition to late fees the interest rate on the card may rise and explain the dangers of late payments one late payment can shave your credit score by as much as points get a free copy of your own credit report at annualcreditreport com and go over it with your child showing how negative information is reported and that it can stays on your account for as long as seven years serious debt problems such as court judgments or bankruptcy filings can stay up to years fair isaacs myfico com has a helpful chart that shows how much more a borrower with a bad credit score will pay for a loan than someone with a good score college students may find it hard to get worked up about how their credit scores affect their ability to borrow after all car loans and mortgages are years away so make sure they know that their credit score may also hurt their chances of getting a job as this article explains more companies are checking credit reports to get an idea about the stability and creditworthiness of prospective employees when considering two qualified candidates the one with the low credit score may lose out finally encourage your child to resist the urge to open a bunch of new card accounts as i discovered the freebies and discounts offered are more than paid for by the fees and finances charges eventually racked up and having to keep track of a bunch of credit accounts may lead to late or missed payments damaging your childs credit score besides one credit card is all any student really needs how did you learn to manage your credit card debt were your parents
