unusual trading on s&amp p may be just a banking move its been a volatile few months on the stock market but some options traders may believe theres worse to come that is what the surprisingly high number of deep in the money options on the s&amp p stock index may lead some observers to believe but at least one observer said it is merely a complex trading strategy the open interest in the september s&amp p puts stands at more than after almost doubling last week when more than of these puts traded the heavy volume suggests some traders are expecting such a calamity that the s&amp p stock index which yesterday fell points to will lose more than half of its value by sept the date these options expire but jon najarian at optionmonster com said that isnt so instead the trading is part of complex strategy called a "box spread " which in this case serves more of a banking function "a trader wants to borrow money and negotiates a rate to borrow money from the crowd they negotiate the rate and then put on a box in the s&amp p options " mr najarian said a box spread is a four way trade where there is a call spread married with a put spread thus creating four sides of the so called box mr najarian explained he said the s&amp p was chosen because these particular options cant be exercised early the in the money options turn to cash only on the expiration day he said the trade here is the purchase of september calls and the sale of the same number of september calls this is followed by the purchase of september puts and the sale of the september puts "this would be an example of a point box at expiration this box will be worth come hell or high water " mr najarian said he said the box spread seen in the s&amp p reflects the billions of dollars regularly loaned on trading floors between people who have excess cash in their accounts and those who want to finance their obligations at less than what the banks are charging "on the floor of the chicago board options exchange hundreds of millions of dollars of such trades happen every day " mr najarian said
