real time the cd turns a medium designed to replace the record helped unsettle the recording industry online edition twenty five years ago this month copies of the compact disc "the visitors" rolled off a german production line the album the last studio effort by the swedish pop group abba was the first commercial pressing of a cd philips and sony imagined the cd as a replacement for the lp record which it certainly became they couldnt guess what else would happen to it they didnt predict that it would also become a medium for storing data they didnt know its first quarter century would neatly symbolize the life cycle of many a modern technological innovation and they almost certainly didnt expect the cd would eventually contribute to the demise of the entertainment format it was meant to dominate the bbc has a good overview of the cds history and an interesting sidebar on its development the cd hit every checkpoint on the typical technological path apprenticeship as a largely theoretical product check philips began work on the cds forerunner in and held a press conference touting the cds superiority in three years before that abba cd standards fight check while philips and sony wound up working together and are often held up as an example of corporate collaboration the back and forth over formats and the technological fine print wasnt always friendly and the delays left audio geeks grumbling early adopter cred check veterans of the cd era may remember how amazing it was to crank a cd up before a song started and hear nothing pain for those early adopters check sometimes you didnt hear nothing because lots of analog albums were basically shoveled onto cds without being properly remastered stubborn insistence from the rearguard that the old ways were better check vinyl lovers continue to carry the analog banner against the digital hordes all sorts of unintended uses evolution in ways no one could have expected shoved aside by something new check check and check i remember how cds gradually made their way into record stores first appearing as curiosities and then displacing more and more of the vinyl stock i remember first seeing one in the wild in in the dorm room of a high school classmate everything about it seemed impossibly modern from the expensive cd player which we kept marveling actually had a laser inside it to the shiny discs themselves to the almost unnerving clarity of the sound i had hundreds of records by then in condition ranging from good to trashed and i felt like a cargo cultist confronted with such wonders i didnt make the leap to cds until when i got a player for christmas and bought a couple of "nice price" cds with their indifferent remastering and lousy packaging then it was just a small matter of replacing my vinyl collection over several years marked by countless trips to used cd stores the cds success wasnt due just to superior audio quality in the beginning it was also a status symbol undeniably futuristic with its mirror finish and prismatic lines and whorls emerging from peek a boo depths it came with its own geek lore from the idea that outlining the circumference with a green marker would enhance the sound to the tale that it held minutes of music so beethovens ninth symphony would fit on a single disc wikipedia covers this in depth the story seems to be true but as a strategic gambit in a tug of war between sony and philips and eventually we discovered that cds had drawbacks album art photos and lyrics were much less satisfying when squished into a smaller format the hinges on cd cases broke if you so much as looked at them funny and cds actually took up more space on shelves than lps but they ruled the world for all that from that position of dominance the cd morphed into a medium for storing data as well replacing the " disk in the mid s cds still had enough cachet that i was amazed by the idea of junk cds but america online soon cured me and anybody else of that notion in the late s it was routine to find aol cds littering my neighborhoods street corners where theyd frisbeed away from the trash cans theyd been pitched at and today cds have gone from jetsons to jetsam theyre an annoyance &lt ndash&gt the leftovers from ripped albums and burns made for trips in rental cars and often left behind when i rent a zipcar seems like i find a forgotten cd mix about a third of the time most of my audio cds have been consigned to boxes to guard against a cataclysmic hard drive failure and because i cant legally sell them and keep the digital files a few weeks ago i threw out dozens of cds old unlabeled song mixes supplanted by itunes playlists obsolete versions of windows and generations of software that came with long gone pcs speaking of obsolete boxes of dusty " disks and random zip disks also got the heave ho this isnt to scorn the cd it really was a technological miracle one that helped make lasers a consumer technology as a data storage medium an adaptation of its original purpose its no surprise that its been supplanted by exponential gains in hard disk capacity increased bandwidth and the rise of remote storage but its the cds role as an entertainment medium thats most interesting to me according to nielsen u s cd sales fell to million last year from their peak of million in debating why music sales have cratered is like debating why the soviet union collapsed the industry puts the blame on piracy while others point to a shakeout in music retailers decry major labels pushing one hit wonders at the expense of developing bands for the long haul or argue that the net videogames and other activities have displaced time once spent listening to music the factor i think doesnt get enough attention is consumers longstanding disenchantment with the rock album as discussed here once the digital age allowed music buyers to reject the album they did so in droves whether by downloading single songs from itunes or stealing single songs from peer to peer networks and the cd presaged what would happen before the cd most rock albums had similar fingerprints you got odd minutes of music spread over to songs the cds longer length exploded that as the cd became established albums got longer and id argue weaker on cd albums running times were padded by additional material that once would have been left aside or released as the b sides of singles while music geeks like me welcomed the additional material it made albums too long for single sittings listeners were inclined to pick and choose among the tracks an easy process with cds skipping a track no longer meant lifting a needle or fast forwarding through tape you just pushed a button and cd players let you shuffle tracks or program cds to rearrange the order or skip songs jukebox software lets you do all that much more easily today but we first started experimenting with it in the cd era in the s the music industry saw the cd as its salvation with sales buoyed by consumers replacing records and tapes with the shiny new discs and it probably was but even as the cd was propping the record labels up it was also laying the groundwork for a transition that may prove their undoing what was the first audio cd you bought do you think the cd was good for music or not any thoughts on the medium itself join me and other online journal readers in the real
