ahead of the tape bank jockeying could obscure fed fund view investors have grown accustomed to watching the federal funds futures market for insight into the outlook for federal reserve policy but today as fed chairman ben bernanke delivers a much anticipated speech in jackson hole wyo fed funds futures might give misleading signals the fed funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans the fed controls this interest rate by adding and removing cash reserves from the banking system fed funds futures contracts reflect what traders think the fed funds rate will average in any given month their movement reflects if the market thinks the fed is going to move the target rate up or down the futures market is often wrong and recent market turmoil muddies the water even more the fed tried to prevent credit markets from seizing up this month by injecting money into the banking system that pushed the fed funds rate well below the feds target of wrightson icap chief economist lou crandall says the funds rate is likely to stay low in the days ahead as banks maneuver reserves ahead of the feds next policy meeting in mid september their jockeying could be especially confusing now for technical reasons a new two week "maintenance period" for bank reserves just started this week anticipating a rate cut some banks are keeping reserves lower and that makes the fed funds rate artificially low so with the fed funds rate likely to be well below the feds actual target at the start of september the average rate for the month will also be unnaturally low since the september fed funds future contract reflects the expected average rate for the month that creates problems the contracts price could leave one thinking the fed will be much more aggressive about cutting rates than it plans to be the market is currently pricing in high odds of a rate cut of half a percentage point rather than watch the market today investors might need to figure things out on their own this time will consumption data ease feds inflation fear if the fed is going to cut rates it will probably need some more comfort that inflation is within its comfort zone thats why todays release of the feds favored inflation gauge the price index for consumer spending excluding food and energy could have important implications for monetary policy economists surveyed by dow jones expect the core pce for july to have risen by from a month ago that would put the annual rate within the feds to comfort zone and mark the third straight month that the rate came in at or below potentially easing the feds worries that recent declines in the inflation rate are transitory at its aug meeting policy makers fretted that the core pce may have been restrained due to declines in volatile goods such as apparel three months of tamer prices wont mean the inflation genie is in the bottle but it could give mr bernanke more elbow room to argue its not the threat it used to be scott patterson send comments to justin lahart wsj com or scott patterson wsj com
