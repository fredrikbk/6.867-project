weekend journal review theater hes an old fashioned con man high button shoes goodspeed opera house route east haddam conn &# &# closes sept iphigenia peter norton space signature theatre w nd st new york n y &# through sept then &# extended through oct east haddam conn long before phil silvers was sgt bilko he was stopping the show as harrison floy the old time con man who is the star of "high button shoes " one of the biggest musical comedy hits of it ran for performances brought choreographer jerome robbins his first tony and then like so many other well received musicals disappeared into the theatrical memory hole except for two numbers restaged by robbins years later for "jerome robbins broadway " "high button shoes" has never been revived in new york goodspeed musicals which regularly exhumes forgotten shows put it on in but that appears to be the only time the show has been produced anywhere since its original broadway run now goodspeed is giving "high button shoes" a second outing at its handsome headquarters an immaculately preserved opera house overlooking the connecticut river i drove up there the other day to satisfy my longstanding curiosity about a long forgotten musical and discovered to my delight that "high button shoes" is not for antiquarians only the plot such as it is can be disposed of in a headline slick con man bilks jersey rubes gets caught with bag of cash out of this premise comes a sweetly silly fantasy about small town life circa set to a string of musical pastiches skillfully confected by sammy cahn and jule styne none of the songs is half so memorable as such cahn styne pop hits of the s as "ill walk alone" or "ive heard that song before " but the score works on its own down memory lane terms and greg ganakis and linda goodrich the director and choreographer have staged each number with enough zowie to knock down an elephant i especially liked their frenetic version of the silent movie "keystone kop ballet" that was by all accounts the high spot of the original production add to this the colorful and ingenious sets of howard c jones which create the uncanny illusion that the goodspeeds handkerchief sized stage is twice as big as it really is and you get a barrel and a half of laughs i wish that someone other than stephen bienskie had been cast as harrison floy for his ingratiating performance lacks the hard fraudulent edge that silvers must have brought to the part in the absence of such comic toughness "high button shoes" becomes a bit too soft centered for total comfort even so its bright festive genial and absolutely worth a trip to connecticut to see new york im not in the habit of praising stridently political drama but i know a good thing when i see one and charles mees "iphigenia " a contemporary rewrite of euripides"iphigenia in aulis" in which the audience is tacitly invited to reflect on the hubris and downfall of george w bush is an avant garde spectacular that is more than sufficiently exciting to overcome any objections you may have to onstage sermonizing the prolific mr mee is notorious in theatrical circles for his inconsistency "wintertime " the last play of his that i reviewed in this space was a pretentious pseudo farce so awful that i shunned his work for three whole years moreover mr mee is also a hard left activist of long standing and in my experience it is unusual for such folk to write nonpropagandistic plays so when the signature theatre company announced his appointment as its latest playwright in residence i cringed at the thought of what id have to stomach all season long imagine my surprise then when "iphigenia " turned out to be hot hard hitting stuff an intermission free theater of the absurd collage in which the terrible tale of agamemnon clytemnestra and their daughter iphigenia all played with the utmost effectiveness by tom nelis kate mulgrew and louisa krause is transplanted from the battlefields of ancient greece to a ritzy big city hotel the results suggest a cross between "full metal jacket" and "bridezillas " which may sound idiotic on paper but turns out to be staggeringly effective on stage much of the credit for the cogency of "iphigenia " goes to tina landau the director whose lurid staging is at once super showy and firmly rooted in classical performance practice her chorus for instance consists of four buff soldiers who sing and dance some of the effects well most of them are a bit on the noisy side but a play about an ambitious king who sacrifices his own daughter in order to persuade his reluctant troops to go into combat requires a pretty fair amount of noise and ms landau delivers the goods right down to the blood soaked blackout agitprop alert "iphigenia " opens with a long ponderous monologue by agamemnon full of clankingly obvious references to current events "they will have created new enemies along the way they will have created the causes of wars where there were none before
