weekend journal taste houses of worship chartering a new course when the tarek ibn ziyad academy opened four years ago in suburban minneapolis the school was a bold experiment and its survival was in question there was the scramble to attract students that any charter school faces but tarek ibn ziyad had the additional worry of a constitutional challenge given the schools sponsorship by a nonprofit called islamic relief and the curriculums emphasis on muslim culture and the arabic language the school has not only survived but thrived and there are plans for local expansion perhaps the surest sign that the experiment worked came last week when a new charter school opened up thousands of miles away in hollywood fla founded by jewish parents ben gamla charter school has kosher food in the cafeteria and hebrew posters in the classrooms in the planning of the florida school tarek ibn ziyads experience was taken into account the success of tarek ibn ziyads model and its adoption outside of minnesota heralds a potentially explosive new trend in americas charter schools publicly funded schools tied to a particular religion the founders of ben gamla are already promising more branches in other states and parents from other religions are sure to venture into similar territory pushing the constitutional limits even further as peter deutsch the orthodox jewish congressman who started ben gamla has said it "could be a huge paradigm shift in education in america " to be clear both ben gamla and tarek ibn ziyad have worked to ensure that their actual curricula have no discussion of religious doctrine their language classes have been carefully scrubbed of any mention of god and in ben gamlas case hebrew classes were suspended after state inspectors found a few questionable lines remaining the matter will be taken up at the next school board meeting in september aware of the constitutional questions ben gamla goes to great lengths to avoid ever using the word "jewish" to describe the motivation behind its creation tarek ibn ziyad similarly steers clear of the word "muslim" its mission statement says that students learn arabic because it is the "language of culture that holds together the peoples of the middle east south asia north africa and east africa " the schools can make a strong claim to being only the latest in a string of culturally specific public schools that have been set up during the past decade most of which provide language immersion alongside a normal secular education this week a german culture charter school opened in alaska while minnesota the charter school innovator has one school for hmong culture and another for chinese the most famous such school of late is the khalil gibran international academy in brooklyn which aims to create a student body fluent in arabic even before its opening on sept khalil gibran has been accused of being a front for islamists but unlike the charter schools this one was not set up by religious parents it is a creation of the new york city department of education with input from arab americans and initial signs indicate that it will be attended by few muslims there have been others though that blur the boundaries between religion and culture a bit more in new york a greek charter school was set up in the same building as a greek orthodox parochial school in minnesota the eci nompa woonspe charter school is dedicated to teaching dakota culture which has a religious component that would be difficult to excise in this educational landscape ben gamla and tarek ibn zayid are in one sense merely the furthest along a spectrum but they are entering legitimately new territory both schools for instance have religiously mandated food in the cafeteria and both have executive directors who are also spiritual leaders in florida an orthodox rabbi in minnesota an imam who has called himself a "quran thumper " it is no coincidence that ben gamla is the first charter school to retain legal counsel from the becket fund an organization defending religious freedom if the schools face some backlash particularly in the jewish community which has always been an ardent defender of church state separation precedent suggests that they would likely stand on firm legal ground in court "religious charter schools " a book that had a timely publication date earlier this summer argues that while a publicly funded school cannot endorse one religion the courts have granted schools a wide latitude in accommodating religion the books author lawrence weinberg says that for many religious parents the most important part of a religious school is what it does not teach and charter schools are allowed the privilege of excluding harry potter books if they offend christian sensibilities on the other side of the coin public schools have always been able to range widely over the culture and history as opposed to the theology of any religion "charter schools offer parents an opportunity to create schools that meet their needs " said mr weinberg "and religious needs are some of the most profound and important needs that people have " the most trenchant criticism of the new schools may be that they are part of an unhealthy atomization of american culture but theres nothing illegal about that so the natural question is what comes next not too surprisingly the most concrete planning has been within the jewish community where culture and religion dovetail the most seamlessly kevin hasson the irish american founder of the becket fund says he would like to see an irish school that touches upon the countrys catholic tradition and religious wars "only jews have approached us for now " mr hasson said "but i believe there is no reason in the world to limit it to that " mr popper is news editor of the forward
