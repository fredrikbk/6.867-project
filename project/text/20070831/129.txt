the song of bernanke and so did a cry of lamentation arise from the multitudes unto bernanke spare us oh lord from the wrath of subprime from the house of countrywide wailing was heard from the land of dodd and schumer there was gnashing of polls and from the kingdoms of bear lehman and cramer the rending of fine italian garments set your righteous hand glorious and merciful fed against our enemies among the rating agencies the risk averse and short sellers in your power and majesty you need only say the word and interest rates shall fall liquidity like manna shall descend from the skies and easy credit shall flow once again across the parched and barren land try as we might we cant find this passage in the old testament but you wouldnt know it from the increasingly desperate pleas for ben bernanke and the federal reserve to save the economy if not all of mankind from the august credit crunch judging from the media incantations youd think chairman bernanke could simply cut the fed funds rate and credit worries would crumble like jericho we think instead that mr bernanke has been doing well these last few weeks by resisting this belief in the fed as yahweh the central bank has been doing good work in its role as a financial system plumber plugging leaks as they spring up and in reassuring banks that its liquidity window is open mr bernanke has done especially well to resist being bullied by wall street the homebuilders automakers and easy money editorialists into opening the broader credit spigots when he speaks at the feds annual jackson hole retreat today chairman bernanke who favors transparency has a chance to explain how the central bank contributed to the current problems and why it cant be anyones savior mr bernanke is in part a hostage to the legacy of the alan greenspan era when the fed seemed to ride to the rescue during every financial crisis this is the famous "greenspan put " which is as much legend as reality the current market and media pleas to mr bernanke are in part an attempt to get the new fed chief to behave as if it is something of a guarantee but the fed doesnt have the same flexibility now in part because its reckless policy in the early part of this decade helped produce the credit excesses we are now trying to work off as dallas fed governor richard fisher has candidly acknowledged the central bank kept interest rates too low for too long for much if not all of through short term interest rates were below the observed rate of inflation this is a subsidy for debt creation and debt certainly was created flowing into the housing markets and causing a boom in prices out of all historic proportion the first chart suggests the magnitude of the housing bubble relative to median family income the same incentive for debt fed the boom on wall street where creative minds found all sorts of new ways to package and sell mortgage assets there was nothing corrupt in most of this and given the low cost of credit it made sense at the time everyone loved the boom while it lasted except that home prices cant increase at to a year forever the fed was feeding inflationary expectations that hadnt been seen since the late s the price of gold is one rough proxy for those expectations and the second chart suggests the magnitude of its mistake it hardly matters as some claim in defense of the fed that officially measured inflation only rose to from from what matters is the magnitude of the increase and altered expectations the u s didnt arrive at inflation in a single leap during the s it got there step by step as the fed was called upon again and again to save a sputtering economy with easy credit and it eventually lost all credibility thats one risk the fed faces now as it confronts the lamentations of the bubble boys a reckless reflation runs the risk of bigger problems down the road if it results in a global loss of confidence in mr bernanke or in the dollar as a store of value the feds first obligation isnt to reflate the bubble but is to protect the larger economy and especially price stability one economic reality today is that the feds debt subsidy led to a misallocation of resources into real estate and certain debt instruments that is in the process of being worked off the losses are real and someone will have to pay them housing prices will fall in some markets for some time to come there is no joy in saying so but this is what happens when credit is no longer subsidized and markets change their risk assessments one question looking forward is how much the housing recession will affect consumer spending and thus the overall economy the same commentators who said only two months ago that all was well now say that housing will tank everything if the fed does nothing yet the economy entered this period on an upswing as yesterdays upward revision of second quarter gdp to from the preliminary shows corporate profits rose smartly and last weeks industrial production numbers were good weekly jobless claims have been climbing but the overall labor market has been healthy the fed may well have to act if the economy does begin to stumble but if that happens the fed isnt the only or even the best policy lever fiscal policy is also available which means the bush administration and congress should be considering another tax cut a tax cut could revive incentives for risk taking among those feeling burned by the housing fallout the federal deficit is heading down to of gdp and nothing would be worse for tax receipts than a recession we realize tax cutting is taboo in todays washington but if the presidential candidates arent considering a tax cut proposal they should be the entreaties of wall street notwithstanding the federal reserve is no miracle worker see
