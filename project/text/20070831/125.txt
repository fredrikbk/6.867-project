the morning brief how bush would help beleaguered homeowners online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here low income borrowers on the brink of losing their homes are said to be the main target of plans president bush will outline today in his administrations first policy response to the wave of defaulting mortgages that has reverberated through the global finance system and so shaken the markets ahead of this mornings speech administration officials offered to news media a glance of what he will propose an expansion of the federal housing administrations loan insurance program to include borrowers who have missed payments but could still be helped by refinancing a higher limit on fha insurance premiums which could let the agency increase the number of high risk loans it insures and a suspension of taxes on mortgage debt that lenders forgive which could help people who still live in their homes and hope to avoid foreclosure by lowering their loan balance and payments but the los angeles times says its unclear how much the program will help many struggling homeowners in high priced markets like california and new york where "many people who took out adjustable rate loans in recent years at low teaser rates and now face sharp jumps in their payments may be unable to afford any new market rate loan even with government insurance " administration officials said the fha estimates the expansion of its default insurance program can help another homeowners qualify for refinancing next year raising the total number of its refinancing guarantees to the wall street journal reports but the fhas limits on loan size and borrower criteria mean the changes will only help a small portion of homeowners the journal adds and more than two million loans are expected to adjust to higher rates over the next two years beyond the rule changes the treasury and housing and urban development departments plan to work with lenders and other players in the industry to get less stringent loan products to people in danger of defaulting and the new york times cites an official saying there will also be a "jawboning of lenders to persuade them not to foreclose on some borrowers " some of the changes will require legislative backing to get them enacted the white house will have to work with a democratic congressional majority that has been increasingly vocal in its doubts about the banking environment that produced the default problem and resulting credit crunch backlash and it will be interesting to see who mr bush invites to his discourse today and how inclusive he is in promoting governmental action the other speech highly anticipated by the markets today will be ben bernankes address at the federal reserves annual monetary conference in jackson hole wyo but however much economists and traders want to read into what mr bernanke says fed chairmen have traditionally stuck to the conference topic and with more than two weeks of economic data and changes to come before the fed next meets it is hard to imagine mr bernanke will offer any real suggestion about what he and his colleagues will do next home investors s&amp p freddie mac are suffering among other subprime fallout news a survey by the mortgage
