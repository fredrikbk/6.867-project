weekend journal review television home of the brave alive day memories" is an extraordinary program about extraordinary people the hbo documentary in which actor james gandolfini talks with wounded iraq war vets wont be on tv until sunday sept pm et with labor day approaching however it seems fitting at this time to acknowledge the work of the men and women in the military the films stated purpose is to examine the "physical and emotional cost of war" through the "memories of those who narrowly escaped death in iraq " the title "alive day" refers to a term used at walter reed and elsewhere to mark the date someone is wounded by emphasizing their survival not all of the soldiers and marines interviewed here bought into that upbeat approach as army sgt bryan anderson lay in a military hospital contemplating the loss of one hand and both legs he found the "alive day" chatter from therapists annoying "were celebrating the worst day of my life " in sgt andersons case as with many others the story of how he got injured is accompanied by insurgent made video of u s vehicles exploding followed by almost orgasmic mutterings of "allah o akbar " god is great as horrible as that is on every level more affecting still is the film of sgt anderson before he was hurt as an army boxer and earlier as a magnificent gymnast when he lands after a flip and extends his lithe legs and arms in triumph we see with aching clarity what has been destroyed loss is not always apparent when first we meet these young men and women the camera initially shows us sweet fresh faces and what appear to be sturdy bodies then it shatters any initial complacency we feel as it pans back to reveal that the otherwise healthy looking body has no legs or no shoulder and arm or that the former marine is beaming at the camera perhaps because hes cheerful but also once we see that hes strapped into a wheelchair because the front part of his brain was shot away and he doesnt have a lot of control over his thoughts or movements a few bear no obvious outward scars when we first see pvt dexter pitts for example he is driving down the highway celebrating both his freedom after signing out of the army and the sense of a job well done "im a veteran of my country now " he points out "i did my part and nobody can ever question me about anything after that " in his not so cheerful moments however pvt pitts is tormented by memories and nightmares of what he had to do as a soldier at war in iraq in "infantryland" he tells us people dont believe in post traumatic stress disorder and some suspect its a cop out but do you think i want to feel like this he asks mr gandolfini ive seen those "crazy vietnam vets" on the street he laments and "i dont want to be like that " like mr gandolfini a patient listener and a quiet mostly off camera presence here we can only watch still as church mice and let these men and women tell their stories and try to explain how they view their radically altered bodies and lives none speaks of politics the closest many come to a comment on the war itself is a statement heard more than once in different ways that while they regret being maimed they wish they could still serve "everything there was worth it" they would "do it all again " even former marine sniper eddie ryan nearly immobile in his wheelchair with a devastating brain injury surprises us by bursting into an accurate rendition of "the halls of montezuma" after his attending mother explains that eddie wants to be a drill instructor once he gets better some may decide that sgt ryan also shown in better days doing a lively "crazy legs" dance in his iraq barracks doesnt have a clear perspective yet the others obviously do and while their injuries are impossible to ignore the shape of their characters is what emerges most vividly here perhaps the same determination that made them enlist is what is sustaining them now at any rate most seem more sure of themselves more together in nonphysical ways than those of us who have never been to war that is true of army spc crystal davis about three months after arriving in iraq she lost one leg below the knee and the other was so mangled that the bones show clearly through a thin layer of skin crystal enlisted in the military to get away from bad influences and escape from dreary small town life as she drives around the same town now with a cigarette hanging from her mouth and a huge tattoo about iraq on her arm she says "i cant wait to go back and finish what i started " watching her try to dance for the first time on a fake leg and then do perfect push ups instead to the music in a country bar we can tell that this was and still is one tough cookie like all of her comrades in arms however both present and former she is a breed apart when she receives a medal at a local vfw ceremony you realize that ms davis has more in common with the world war ii and korean war geezers who applaud her service than with any of the rest of us most unforgettable image may be that of marine lance cpl michael jernigans diamond flecked glass eye he is totally blind but one eye socket has so much scar tissue that he cant fit a prosthetic in it hes got a cocky attitude fueled in part by anger it seems at the wife who left him after his injury so he took his wedding band to his navy oculist and asked him to grind the diamond in it into pieces and set them in a glass eye he knows that it looks great and hes right even if he will never get to see it glittering alone but forcefully out of his face telegraphing the message "dont mess with me " in the end "alive day " is not about victims or even about survivors though that is the first lens through which civilians will be inclined to view it it is about ordinary men and women of extraordinary decency and courage that they were so badly maimed in iraq is a brutal reminder that war can extract a greater price than many of like to imagine when we toss around concepts such as sacrifice and duty yet even as they talk about their altered lives the men and women on this program do not seem to be asking for pity and perhaps are not even that interested in what we think of them they come from another world of those who serve whom they honor here with their accounts even as we are humbled by them for three decades now "top gear" has been a hit in the
