u s draws map of rich arctic floor ahead of big melt in the arctic this week researchers aboard the u s coast guard icebreaker healy are mapping claims to the spoils of global warming north of alaska the scientists of the healy are gathering the data legally required to extend national territories across vast reaches of the mineral rich seafloor usually blocked by arctic ice fathom by fathom multibeam sonar sensors mounted on the healys hull chart a submerged plateau called the chukchi cap in a region that may contain of the worlds reserves of oil and natural gas in an era of climate change these frozen assets are up for grabs as melting ice allows detailed mapping and one day perhaps drilling rising temperatures thinned the ice pack to a record low this month if current trends continue the arctic could become ice free in summer months by polar researchers say indeed the healy is finding easy passage this week through the arctic oceans archipelagos of ice "we have had a remarkable amount of open water good for mapping sad for the arctic " said expedition chief scientist larry mayer reached aboard the healy the head of the university of new hampshires center for coastal and ocean mapping the &# million healy expedition is the third u s seafloor mapping venture into the arctic since prompted by provisions of the u n convention on the law of the sea the u s has never ratified the treaty but commissioned new seabed maps in case it ever is adopted the u s senate foreign relations committee has set a hearing on the treaty next month framed decades before the politics of the greenhouse effect permeated international relations the u n treaty is taking on added importance in the arctic as an arbiter for countries determined to come out ahead in a world transformed by rising temperatures no country actually owns the north pole but with growing boldness this past summer russia denmark norway and canada jockeyed for control of the arctic seabed galvanized by the prospect of open waterways there "a little bit of global warming and a little bit of adventurism and now we are really starting to explore the arctic " said marine geophysicist stephen p miller head of the geological data center at the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego the u n treaty allows countries to extend their coastal economic zone up to nautical miles offshore depending on detailed technical evidence of undersea geology and topography under this provision all four countries claim an underwater mountain called the lomonosov ridge that runs underneath the north pole they are depending on seafloor data to bolster their cases before the u n commission on the limits of the continental shelf meeting this week in closed session to consider claims the healys voyage is part of a broader u s effort to extend its undersea zone of military and economic authority should it adopt the year old u n accord for five years the universitys mapping teams commissioned by the u s state department have been charting in unprecedented detail the deep ocean bottom of the arctic the aleutian islands the bering sea the mariana islands in the pacific the gulf of mexico and the u s atlantic coast "the better data you have the better case you can make " said hydrographer steven r barnum director of the office of coast survey at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which manages the effort overall maps of mars are about times better than maps of earths ocean floor until recently the best global seafloor maps were based on altimeter readings by military satellites and submarine depth soundings gathered during the cold war those miss anything smaller than six miles across two years ago a navy nuclear submarine rammed an undersea mountain that didnt appear on its charts killing one sailor and wounding the healys sonar sensors produce maps accurate to within about yards each new seafloor map is a revelation "every cruise turns up new discoveries " said noaa scientist andy armstrong reached aboard the healy the sonar sensors detected unsuspected seamounts vast sea slides and canyons the data are freely available online all told the undersea territories being mapped by the u s encompass an area larger than france "it holds potential riches beyond your imagination" through sea floor mining and drilling said unh marine geologist james gardner who has mapped square miles of ocean bottom as part of the u s law of the sea project in all maps are being prepared for eight major extensions of u s seafloor authority including several areas in the arctic also claimed by russia and perhaps canada "it is a little overheated to say this is now a race to the arctic " said john bellinger legal adviser to the u s secretary of state "at the same time we are very much aware that other countries most particularly russia have been exercising their rights under the law of the sea convention " for now the u s has no standing to protest email me at sciencejournal wsj com
