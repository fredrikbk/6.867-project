banks pare borrowings from fed window washington banks dont appear to want the federal reserves money borrowing from the feds discount window dropped to &# billion as of wednesday about half the &# billion level reported a week earlier the central bank disclosed yesterday the change suggests the fed has managed to calm markets even though banks havent taken its strong encouragement to borrow at the discount window as a credit crisis deepened two weeks ago the fed cut the rate on the loans it makes directly to banks by half a percentage point to which still is above the rate at which banks can borrow among themselves in the market roughly and extended the period for loans from one day to last week four big banks borrowed &# million each to support the feds efforts to rebuild confidence in the system at least some of those banks have repaid some of those loans the fed numbers indicate average borrowing during the week was &# billion up &# million from a week earlier a year ago the average weekly borrowing was &# million under the feds primary credit program top fed officials reached out to bankers to encourage them to use the discount window which generally carries a stigma as a source of cash for distressed institutions the fed hoped the banks would borrow and extend those funds to distressed customers that might be facing liquidity problems or that the availability of stigma free borrowing would encourage banks to lend more freely even if they didnt tap the window some analysts and banks said there is little reason for banks to borrow at the discount window because the rate remains above the federal funds target rate at which they can borrow in the markets the discount rate maneuver reflects fed chairman ben bernankes attempt to distinguish between the feds responsibility for financial stability and its responsibility for steering the economy and avoiding inflation
