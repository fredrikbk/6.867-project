the daily fix mlb division races heat up with head to head combat online edition five of six baseball divisions saw their first and second place teams meet yesterday in games laden with postseason implications the results second place teams front runners four games were comebacks a fifth was decided by just two runs and four division races remain very much undecided whether the fifth one remains unsettled is a point of contention in the new york tabloids this morning the yankees beat the boston red sox last night to move within seven games in the al east with to play including five more between the rivals "eleven other teams in the majors were closer to first place than the yankees " joel sherman writes in the new york post "for the red sox to fall out of first a ball would have to go off don zimmers bald head through bill buckners legs and break jonathan papelbons pitching hand " but new york daily news columnist lisa olson responds "even sox players who wouldnt know how to spell yastrzemski know the yankees have a habit of turning it on in august and september the yankees have won the al east title nine straight seasons the red sox have owned baseballs best record for much of the year those two sentences combined assure us a pennant race lurks in the bushes " to mr sherman the yanks real competition is the seattle mariners for the wild card spot but the ms have lost four in a row the last two to the al west leading anaheim angels after the mariners squandered a lead to lose they had outscored teams by just runs for the season but si coms tom verducci writes that seattles bullpen makes the team more formidable than its run differential would suggest last nights late inning collapse notwithstanding in the nl east the philadelphia phillies have taken two straight from the first place new york mets to narrow their margin to four games more important than last nights dramatics a th inning game ending ryan howard home run capping a victory was the impending return of cole hamels bob ford writes in the philadelphia inquirer the way mr ford figures it the phillies need to win of their last games to assure themselves of a postseason berth "no offense to the other starters and potential starters on the phillies pitching staff but the magical mystery rotation currently in place isnt going to get you " mr ford writes "perhaps nothing will but having any chance at all will require a healthy hamels it wont sound like much but hamels threw pitches yesterday and then shut it down he will throw pitches on friday mixing some curveballs in with the fastballs and change ups and then he comes back into the starting rotation sunday in florida against the marlins " in the nl west the san diego padres narrowed the arizona diamondbacks lead in the division to one game with a victory milton bradleys offensive firepower has helped san diego gain ground but his fiery personality may derail the teams chase for a playoff spot "in a perfect padres world they ride that to a third consecutive nl west title sidestep the first round pratfall that has plagued them in each of the past two octobers and play deep into the month " scott miller writes on cbssports com "in the real world it will be a race between that and the ticking time bomb that bradley has allowed to blow up at nearly each big league stop " the third nl division began the day with a first vs second matchup but the chicago cubs comeback to defeat the milwaukee brewers allowed the st louis cardinals to move into second two games behind chicago ben sheets returns to the starting rotation for milwaukee tonight after missing a month and a half because of a finger sprain milwaukee journal sentinel columnist michael hunt wonders if its too late for the staff ace to play the role of savior for a season that looks lost the cardinals leapfrogged the brewers to win their third straight over the houston astros and improved to for the first time since april st louis post dispatch columnist bryan burwell isnt sure how tony la russa manages to maintain success or at least what passes for it in the nl central but hes impressed nonetheless "this is one of the eternal mysteries of tony la russas success how he seems to seamlessly shift from a deep thinking semi intellectual baseball wise guy who can outthink anyone on the other dugout steps to a self deprecating ordinary joe who obsesses over goofy superstitions and quirky rituals " mr burwell writes "last week it was a pregame jog and caramel candy from a receptionists bowl this week if the cardinals keep on their surprising winning ways la russas just as likely to believe it has something to do with a lineup card thumb tacked sideways on a clubhouse bulletin board a piece of tape on his fingers or a timely late inning double switch or hit and run " for those teams not involved in one of these late season grudge matches its time to play the role of spoiler the san francisco chronicles ray ratto would love to see one of his local teams the giants or the oakland as dent the hopes of a contender "the only showdown series in the last week of the year is cleveland seattle " mr ratto writes "everything else will be split screens and scoreboard watching and the giants and as are just as worthy under those circumstances as anyone and its as close to worthy as they have any right to expect " another columnist is already looking ahead to the washington posts thomas boswell worries that the nationals will have trouble drawing fans to their spiffy new ballpark and if they do come where will they all park "perhaps we should not worry so much " mr boswell writes "maybe a gaudy new ballpark will be such a fan magnet that it makes all other considerations irrelevant especially since lerner now says that his familys contribution to stadium upgrades to attract larger crowds originally estimated at over &# million last winter will be every bit of &# million nonetheless this seasons slack attendance should give anyone pause " chicago bears coach lovie smiths moderate reaction to word that linebacker lance briggs totaled his car under questionable circumstances has provided further evidence to chicago tribune columnist rick morrissey that mr smith is an enabler of bad behavior "if im a bear im looking into forgery and embezzlement as a way to supplement my salary " mr morrissey writes "im deer hunting out of season to put food on the table im getting into racketeering just to be able to get an up close approximation of tony soprano " on monday the fix noted that the us open would pay homage that night to althea gibson the tournaments first black champion roger federer missed the column when asked about her after his first round match monday he said "its before my time isnt much i can really say about it i dont know im sorry " "a tennis purist who hates instant replay a traditionalist who reveres rod laver ought to have at least heard of a pioneering wimbledon champ particularly when her name has been inescapable at this event " jon wertheim writes on si com "i suppose that in a way this opens a window into just how tunneled a top tier athlete must be " southlake texas about minutes northwest of dallas is perfect city usa according to d magazine all the school teams are called dragons and they win titles with astonishing regularity "theyre good at everything in southlake " paul kix writes "if youve never been theres something a little pleasantville about it the streets are cleaner than your streets the downtown more vibrant the students more courteous their parents more prosperous everyone is beautiful in southlake everyone smiles in southlake everyone is a dragon in southlake this last fact especially is central to understanding the city the kids
