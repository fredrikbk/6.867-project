weekend journal the wealth report channeling blake carrington twenty years later tv still doesnt get the rich right ogling and dissing wealth this fall broadcast networks are making their biggest run at portraying the rich since the s and they still arent getting it right the s gave us "dallas" and "dynasty " the popular nighttime soaps that chronicled the outsized wealth battles and shoulder pads of two western oil clans they never pretended to be realistic opting instead for camp and cartoon characters even as the ranks of new reagan era rich were swelling in america from finance and deal making the ewings and carringtons continued to make their money the old fashioned way by drilling the s werent much better "beverly hills " showed the predictable spoiled brat side of wealth while "the fresh prince of bel air" gently mocked wasp culture through the eyes of a wealthy african american family forget the fact that dominant wasp culture was long gone by then as dot commers and financiers helped to redefine the rich as a younger more diverse and more geeky crowd "the sopranos" touched on the daily banalities and struggles of the nouveaux riches like tony sopranos ill fated attempt to have his portrait painted blue blood style with a thoroughbred horse yet given his unconventional line of work tony and his family were hardly representative reality tv shows have taken over the wealth theme in recent years with mtvs "my super sweet sixteen" about &# birthday parties and "the simple life " which depicted paris hiltons attempt to live on a farm yet the shows had little to do with reality with a record number of millionaires and billionaires in america television has yet to capture the dramas and conflicts of the new american upper class its fertile territory with the self made young rich storming the gates of old money a conflicted new elite trying to reconcile middle class values with huge fortunes a boom in big ego philanthropy and the endless quest to find a good household manager suzanne patmore gibbs abcs executive vice president of drama development says she had been looking for a way to do a show about new wealth without falling into the old tropes "we felt like everything we did about the super wealthy was too much like dynasty and dallas " she says yet this fall expect more of the same rather than probe whats new and interesting about the rich the new series fall back on old stereotypes consider abcs "dirty sexy money " the most hyped of this falls wealth shows it follows a young upright lawyer named nick george peter krause of "six feet under" as he gets pulled into the slimy world of the darling family a billionaire clan in new york the darlings gray maned patriarch tripp donald sutherland reeks of old money the daughter is a predictable paris hilton type who responds to a nasty question from a reporter by saying "well youre poor " the darlings also include the stereotypical ruthless mom the drug addled wastrel son and another son a politician who is captivated by a transvestite hooker the pilot has a few good moments when the wastrel son jeremy laments that hes failed his father and has the "worst life in the world " nick responds "you have all the money youll ever need youll never need to work a day in your life thirty thousand people die from starvation every day your life is not the worst life in the world by any stretch of the imagination " "you wouldnt understand " jeremy shoots back unloading all the weight of inherited wealth in a single line yet most of the show is a throwback including nick few rich families today hire a consigliere type attorney to handle all their affairs from a sons gambling related arrest to the fathers business deals todays family offices would be more likely to use multiple specialized though still discreet lawyers for each problem craig wright the shows executive producer says it isnt trying to reflect whats new about wealth but "whats always been the case" about the rich which is that money can distort or ruin peoples lives he adds that the show plans to introduce a new money character later in the series a second abc show "big shots " is even more off the mark the series about four ceo types focuses more on the bedroom than the boardroom tracking the frat boy exploits of four buddies who belong to the fernwood country club wealth in this show is just a backdrop rather than a theme like "dirty sexy money " the pilot of "big shots" also features a transvestite hooker a new trend in depicting the rich in cbss "cane " wealth also takes a backseat to the larger family soap opera involving affairs murder and deception the family is engaged in a realistic battle over selling its core sugarcane business a predicament faced by many of todays asset rich but cash hungry family businesses and the cuban american family at the center of the drama shows the increasing diversity of american wealth but their money is old school from farming as are the characters another new fall show the cws teen soap "gossip girl " about upper east side aristokids in manhattan has a few snappy one liners when one of the characters explains that her family is staying at the palace hotel because theyre renovating their townhouse she adds "you know my mom if its not broke break it " which is as good an explanation as any for todays construction crazed rich all in all however the networks this fall are serving up "dallas" and "dynasty" with this years clothes and cars while wealth has changed television hasnt why the disconnect maybe todays producers are simply sticking with the tried and true since wealth cliches worked in the s they may fly again or maybe they dont understand the new culture of todays rich but i suspect the real reason is americas own conflicted attitudes toward wealth we enjoy the fantasy of being rich and love gawking at the mansions and the yachts but our envious side also likes to watch people at the top take a tumble the result miserable rich people in fabulous settings as nick says about the trouble with wealth on "dirty sexy money" "perhaps too much of anything is the problem " perhaps the same is true for wealth shows
