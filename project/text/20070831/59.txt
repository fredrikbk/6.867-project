justice delayed budget crunch hits u s attorneys offices amid antiterror focus prosecutions decline rep lewis probe slowed los angeles whoever succeeds alberto gonzales as attorney general will face a long list of challenges at the justice department from unfilled senior positions to sagging morale one of the most pressing according to dozens of current and former federal prosecutors is a budget squeeze at u s attorneys offices that has led to declines in crime prosecutions and delays in major investigations in the past few years u s attorneys offices around the country have been unable to fill vacancies lawyers sometimes cant travel to interview witnesses even funds for basic office needs such as photocopying documents and obtaining deposition transcripts have been cut according to current and former officials overall funding for the offices has grown well below the rate of inflation as a result "fewer cases were getting charged and bigger investigations were taking longer because there werent enough prosecutors to do them " says debra yang who stepped down in october as the u s attorney in los angeles department of justice data show the impact prosecutions are down overall with large drops in categories such as drugs violent crime and white collar offenses in the civil divisions of u s attorneys offices which defend federal agencies and file lawsuits on behalf of the government the problem is actually costing washington money contends kenneth bauman a recently retired veteran assistant u s attorney in portland ore many offices have raised the bar for filing suit against people who owe the government money mr bauman and others say the government has settled suits against it for more than it would normally after the sept terrorist attacks federal priorities shifted to terrorism from routine crime fighting the cost of the iraq war also prompted congress and the white house to slow the growth of many types of domestic spending people familiar with the matter say the then republican controlled congress was mainly responsible for the small increases in the budget for u s attorneys priorities set by the justice department also played a role the department hired additional federal bureau of investigation agents to fight terrorism but didnt push for u s attorneys offices to get big increases they say in written answers to questions the justice department confirmed that "budget constraints have affected operations" in the u s attorneys offices and have had an impact on the numbers of cases brought but it said the offices "continue to pursue cases in these priority areas where federal prosecution is appropriate " the department also noted that congress this year provided funding to restore some earlier cuts some prosecutors say the impact has been largest in big cities such as los angeles chicago miami and san diego which have the heaviest case loads and plenty of private law firms able to offer generous salaries in los angeles a federal criminal investigation of rep jerry lewis a california republican stalled for nearly six months due to a lack of funds according to former prosecutors the lead prosecutor on the inquiry and other lawyers departed the office and vacancies couldnt be filled george cardona the interim u s attorney in los angeles declined to comment on specific cases but confirmed that lack of funds and unfilled vacancies caused delays in some investigations thomas heffelfinger until february the u s attorney in minnesota says tight funds mean "you cant take as many cases " remaining prosecutors are asked to take on bigger workloads when colleagues leave and the jobs arent filled but "an individual can only do so much work " he says the number of lawyers working in u s attorneys offices fell to between sept and sept after rising in earlier years according to official figures the head count has continued to fall during the current year according to the justice department the firing of eight u s attorneys last year and other controversies prompted the resignation of mr gonzales earlier this week shortly after the firings the white house and justice department said several of the dismissed prosecutors hadnt brought enough cases one senior official said they were fired for "performance reasons " the prosecutors defended their performance to the extent that the number of cases declined it was more likely due to the shortage of funds and unfilled vacancies than any inadequacy on the part of the u s attorneys mr heffelfinger and others say through funding wasnt a major headache lawyers salaries were far below what they could earn in private practice but money was available to replace departing prosecutors with lawyers eager to try their hand in major league criminal cases law enforcement was also a popular priority says a current justice department official "we were fairly well insulated here because nobody wanted to vote against putting people in jail " that changed after congress appropriated small annual increases for u s attorneys offices that totaled from fiscal to bringing funding in to &# billion however congress made "rescissions " in which it decided later not to pay all the money it had appropriated it also declined to fund required cost of living increases for justice employees so these had to be paid out of the u s attorneys budget the actual annual budget increase came to from to overall federal spending including money for the iraq war was up an average of a year during the same period adding to the staffing pressure more than lawyers and administrative personnel from u s attorneys offices have gone to iraq to help the fledgling government there the offices generally pay the salaries of the seconded attorneys which would typically be about &# a year plus an additional in combat pay "i understand that if you wage a war overseas thats going to affect your budget " says chris steskal a veteran prosecutor who left the san francisco u s attorneys office in january to go into private practice "but id rather spend the money protecting society within your borders " worried by the vacancies congress provided funds to begin filling some of them in a supplementary funding bill for the current fiscal year however the impact of earlier shortfalls wont be mitigated right away because it takes up to a year to hire a new prosecutor some offices now are filling vacancies with attorneys fresh from law school waiving standards that require several years of trial experience justice department statistics show that the total number of criminal cases filed by u s attorneys offices peaked in fiscal and dropped by between then and the latest available data the falloff was more dramatic and began earlier in certain categories drug prosecutions dropped between and after a jump between and violent crime cases fell between and white collar crime prosecutions increased somewhat in after declining steadily for several years but still remained below the peak in of "the fact that prosecutions are down is very worrisome " says david burnham co director of a syracuse university affiliated organization that tracks justice department statistics he believes priorities may have shifted too far away from criminal prosecution to fighting terrorism of the categories detailed in the statistics only immigration cases showed an increase these rose to cases in from in or before dropping back to in justice department statistics also show significant drops in cases filed by the civil division which is a big revenue raiser for the federal government in fiscal the u s attorneys civil divisions collected a total of &# billion in unpaid debts owed to the federal government in written testimony for a september senate subcommittee hearing william i shockley an assistant u s attorney who had just retired after years said many offices have chosen not to take on some difficult cases because they lack the prosecutors and other resources to pursue them "americans are less safe today and our system of justice less secure because of these shortfalls " he said one way budget cuts led to fewer cases was the raising of "thresholds" for filing cases prosecutors say for example an office might raise the minimum for filing drug cases to those involving at least five kilograms of drugs instead of two guy lewis who was u s attorney in miami from to and later served as director of the executive office of u s attorneys says that in his jurisdiction especially on drug cases "the office really did have to raise thresholds because you just couldnt deal with everything " the same has happened in the civil arena for example one office will seek to recover unpaid agricultural loans only if the amount is &# or more instead of &# previously mr bauman the recently retired portland prosecutor says that during his final years the office settled cases it previously would have brought to trial because funds were short he says "i was told i couldnt hire expert witnesses and in some cases couldnt travel to take depositions " in san francisco disruptions caused by the departure of prosecutors slowed down the u s attorneys recent investigation of corporate executives who backdated stock options people close to the office said mr steskal the former assistant u s attorney in that office was the lead prosecutor in some of those cases he declined to comment on them but said that in general the san francisco office had to cut back on cases because "our budget had been cut back significantly " a spokeswoman for the office declined to comment in los angeles federal prosecutors were in the middle of a wide ranging investigation of rep lewis of california who until january was chairman of the powerful house appropriations committee he remains its senior republican the investigation focused on earmarks or special spending measures that benefited clients of a now defunct lobbying firm to which he had close ties people with knowledge of the case said that by the time the investigation stalled in december it had branched out into other areas including mr lewiss june role in passing legislation that helped giant hedge fund cerberus capital management people associated with cerberus around the same time gave at least &# to a political action committee controlled by mr lewis cerberus officials didnt respond to phone calls or emailed questions concerning the lewis inquiry money from the pac was distributed to republican congressional candidates facing difficult campaigns the largesse was credited with gaining mr lewis enough support from republican house members to be chosen as appropriations committee chairman in january in addition federal agents were looking into whether mr lewis may have improperly paid for personal expenses with pac funds barbara comstock a spokeswoman for mr lewis said "we have no comment " in response to emailed questions about the investigation after the lead prosecutor in the lewis case quit others assigned to the case took time getting up to speed brian hershman a former deputy chief of the los angeles offices public corruption section declined to comment on specific cases but confirms that his groups work overall was derailed by the departure of experienced prosecutors like several others he says he left for more money to support his family replacements "are mostly rookies " he says "it will be some time before theyll be able to restore the section to what it was before " with additional funds recently made available by congress the los angeles office has filled of lawyer vacancies and is expecting an additional lawyers to start soon to jump start the lewis investigation mr cardona the interim u s attorney in june called on a veteran prosecutor michael emmick to revive and supervise the investigation people with knowledge of the investigation say
