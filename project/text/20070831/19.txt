her advisers the move raised the tax to from and expanded it to a range of new products and services including gasoline that politically risky step showed investors the nation was serious about putting its house in order after years of half hearted attempts to cut its budget deficit crack down on corruption and do something about its decaying ports and power grid a j p morgan report in may predicted that the philippines could have a balanced budget by next year and a budget surplus by "i knew the risks but i decided that if we had to bite the bullet then thats what we would do " said ms arroyo in a recent interview the nations economic comeback shows the kinds of remedies that struggling developing nations must consider to compete in the global economy following chinas rise as a manufacturing power the nations of southeast asia once one of the worlds most popular manufacturing hubs have been trying to make themselves more attractive to foreign investors and markets "the whole region is going through the same process and its all in response to china " says luz lorenzo an economist who covers the region for atr kim eng securities inc in manila "how do these countries survive china " many problems remain in the philippines one of the richest countries in asia before world war ii the philippines saw its economy deteriorate during decades of misrule punctuated by military coups and economic mismanagement ms arroyo herself has survived two attempts by military officers to grab power the country has called in u s military advisers to help tackle a persistent islamist insurgency and it continues to be criticized widely for human rights abuses and corruption the recent economic progress could be undermined by problems that have long plagued the economy the country has a legacy of crony capitalism that has left former business associates of late president ferdinand marcos in powerful positions in the business sector political analysts say ms arroyo must avoid spending the growing tax receipts on unnecessary projects that benefit her own political supporters and questions remain about the governments ability to collect corporate taxes moreover the philippine economy is heavily dependent on exports which account for around of gross domestic product a significant economic slowdown in the u s could harm that sector but economists contend that domestic investment and demand has become a more important driver of the economy and could help buffer it from global economic problems "the growth story here is changing from one which is export driven to one which is domestic led " says ms lorenzo of atr kim eng ms arroyos current six year term expires in its unclear whether the next president will continue her economic policies or will resort to past practices prior governments have limited the business opportunities available to foreign companies allowing local tycoons to build lucrative monopolies ms arroyos father diosdado macapagal was president of the philippines in the early s after studying economics at georgetown university she returned home to teach at the university of the philippines then entered politics she was elected vice president in she quickly set about distancing herself from her unpopular boss president joseph estrada a former action movie star who became embroiled in a series of corruption scandals in she openly began plotting his removal in january after the armed forces joined hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the streets of manila to force him from office she was sworn in as his successor ms arroyo whose short fuse has led her to slam cellphones on tables and publicly berate her deputies for making mistakes has proved to be a tough political infighter shes stood up to two failed military coup attempts by rallying her allies in the armed forces and the powerful roman catholic church of which she is a devout member when the business dealings of her husband began drawing political heat in she exiled him to the u s for several months until the fuss subsided her priority after winning the presidential election was to put the nations chronically ailing finances in order a key problem anemic tax revenues due to endemic corruption among tax officials and loopholes in the tax code in tax revenues were of gdp thats a lower rate than in poverty ridden countries such as indonesia and india and far below rates in developed countries such as the u s where government revenue totaled of gdp in a combination of weak state revenues and high foreign debt of the governments

jaime augusto zobel de ayala chief executive officer of ayala corp one of the companies redeveloping fort bonifacio the philippines he says "needed to send a signal " ms arroyo warned in that if the philippines didnt act decisively to improve its tax collection rate it risked becoming the next argentina where economic problems led to a currency collapse she and her advisers began looking for ways to raise new money she increased tobacco and alcohol taxes but that wasnt enough she and her economic team began working to push another unpopular measure through congress in an expanded sales tax demonstrators took to the streets to contest her tax plans one of her advisers former stock analyst joey salceda suggested that she limit the new sales tax to soften the political backlash gasoline prices he said should be excluded because they were already spiking she ignored the advice "i was determined not to sacrifice long term gains for political expediency even though we had to do it at the worst possible time " ms arroyo says at first the sales tax hike appeared to make things worse her opponents challenged the legality of the legislation and the supreme court suspended the tax law the day it was to take effect in july stock prices slumped at the philippines stock exchange and ratings agencies moodys and standard &amp poors lowered their already dim outlooks on the nations ability to pay its debt ms arroyos popularity took a pounding eventually the supreme court dismissed the objections and the tax hike took effect in early that greatly reassured business leaders and foreign investors who were worried about the burden of the governments &# billion in foreign debt "the single turning point that changed peoples minds about the philippines was that she was able to pull off the expanded tax and at such a difficult time " says fernando zobel de ayala brother of ayalas ceo and head of its ayala land unit the tax take in was higher than in lifting government revenue to of gdp to further reduce the deficit ms arroyo started privatizing the nations debt burdened power industry in in addition she encouraged foreign investment in the mining sector which
