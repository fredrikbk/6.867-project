itt is surprise winner of air traffic contract itt corp s surprise win over two larger competitors for the first major contract to upgrade the nations aging air traffic control system puts the company in position to have a major role in the potentially lucrative arena for the next two decades itt and its team beat out teams led by raytheon co and lockheed martin corp for a contract to begin replacing antiquated ground based radars with a system that relies on satellites to keep closer track of airplanes the contracts value is estimated at &# billion over the next years it represents the first part of a planned &# billion plus overhaul of u s air traffic technology the federal aviation administration awarded the contract yesterday once the new system is in place planes will be able to fly closer together and along more direct routes saving time fuel and money "in just a few years our aviation system is going to change dramatically " said bobby sturgell the faas deputy administrator the faa said it picked the proposal from the team led by itt because it posed "no technical risks " the choice of itt came as a surprise because lockheed and raytheon are major players in the air traffic control arena lockheed in particular has made air traffic control contracts one of its priorities it will be several years before the system can reduce the rising number of flight delays and cancellations travelers experience each summer the faa plan calls for &# million to get the new u s network up and running in four areas by juneau alaska louisville ky philadelphia and at various points along the gulf of mexico that will serve as something of a test case before ground stations are installed nationwide by it will take another decade or so beyond that before every airport and plane is using the new system this part of the air traffic modernization program is known as automatic dependent surveillance broadcast or ads b the faa said the technology has already helped reduce small plane accidents in alaska by by providing radar like service in remote areas where pilots previously flew at their own risk it also is gaining ground internationally the faa envisions a system that would rely on a network of ground stations able to receive signals from airplanes and instantly distribute them to controllers and other aircraft it would use a separate frequency to beam live weather information to all flights moreover the added capacity and flexibility provided by the ads b network will be vital if the air traffic control system is to keep up with an expected surge in air travel in coming years the faa estimates that one billion passengers will strain the system in up from the current million freeing up airspace may solve only part of the problem another obstacle will be adding capacity on the ground while miles of runways have been added at some of the nations largest airports since much more is needed the u s hasnt added a major new airport in years steve gaffney president of itt defense electronics and services said the companys experience with the agency helped it win the contract over its rivals he said the company plans to make sure its system is compatible with other air traffic systems that are already being developed in europe and elsewhere
