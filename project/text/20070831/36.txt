eyes on the road decluttering the commute ford microsoft again try to develop a way to link gadgets with cars online edition i am not a tech savvy guy still when i get into my car for the morning commute i bristle with digital devices i have an ipod full of music a blackberry that doubles as a phone and a cd loaded with mps of tunes passed along by offspring or friends who want to upgrade my musical tastes on the way to work i am tempted to fumble with the ipods touchy selector wheel to locate the podcast of that saturday morning npr quiz show i like or i might punch a number into my phone handset to make a call either way i am endangering myself and my fellow citizens i know email messages are stacking up in the blackberrys inbox i know i must not read them at miles per hour despite my anxiety about missing a time sensitive note that will betray my abuse of the "present while absent" function that comes with a blackberry subscription tech aficionados with long memories might remember microsofts push for the "autopc " that was supposed to revolutionize in car infotainment systems back in the late s by bringing email and the internet safely into the car using voice activated hands free technology sadly the voice recognition technology central to the autopcs operation wasnt ready for prime time and the product flopped but the dream of turning cars into digital communication hubs didnt die now car makers and technology suppliers are rallying to take another shot car makers and inventors have been trying to develop a safe way for drivers to manage their digital clutter and connectivity angst while on the road ford motor co for example hopes to generate some buzz with a system called "sync " developed in collaboration with microsoft and rolling out this fall on about a dozen ford lincoln and mercury models fords effort to develop a new kind of onboard entertainment system grew out of the frustration of a small group of ford engineers with the auto industrys tendency to lag behind personal electronics trends says gary jablonski manager of infotainment system engineering for ford in dearborn mich "customers want the same stuff in their cars that they see in best buy " mr jablonski says "we are generally a year behind " their idea develop a system using a variant of microsofts windows ce software that can link to various digital devices using either bluetooth wireless technology or a usb port then no matter what kind of device is involved the system can operate it using a voice recognition system or the buttons knobs or touch screens provided for the cars basic audio system if i had a sync equipped car my morning drive might go like this i would plug the ipod into a usb port in the storage bin under the center armrest and pair my blackberry with the cars audio system using bluetooth that is if my phone has the right kind of bluetooth to get the ipod to play i could tell the system "play genre jazz" and the ipod would start playing tunes in that category to make a call i could say "phone " and then say the name of a person listed in the phones contact list i could also sound out numbers using the phone hands free would keep me legal in states that have rules against juggling the handset while in motion however theres considerable evidence that just carrying on a phone conversation is a distraction that undermines driving performance whether you have your hands on the phone or not provided i had the right kind of phone i might command the system to read aloud text messages &lt ndash&gt a better choice than reading them from the phone screen at highway speeds perhaps not better than simply waiting until i stopped the sync system will even translate text abbreviations such as "lol " or "culr " mr jablonski says demonstrating the capability with a sample message at a recent demonstration of a sync system installed in a ford edge crossover perhaps ford and microsoft could develop a home edition of this technology to decode the speech of teenagers for the benefit of their parents the most impressive trick mr jablonski performed was locating a british radio site on his web enabled phone and then piping the broadcast wirelessly from the phone to the edges sound system not every phone could do that he cautions "we havent found a phone that can do everything sync can do " he says so how will all this go over in the real world where internet radio broadcasts time out phone calls drop bluetooth earpieces produce annoying echoes and pc software crashes the marketing research firm j d power and associates earlier this month released an outline of its latest survey of consumer interest in new automotive technology which offers some encouragement and some caution for products such as sync the good news is that half of the consumers polled for powers emerging technologies study said theyd be interested in paying as much as &# to get a usb interface in their next car asked if theyd pay &# to get an ipod interface about of the respondents said yes at a theoretical price of &# "wireless connectivity" came in at no among different technologies listed according to power ford plans to charge almost double that about &# for sync as a standalone option it will be standard on the lincoln lineup however powers survey indicates that consumers are generally more interested in certain safety technology specifically smart airbags backup assistance systems and run flat tires which ranked and respectively when it comes to entertainment systems consumers want to be able to use their digital music players in the car but they also express considerable enthusiasm for premium sound systems and particularly systems bearing recognized high end audio brands says powers mike marshall among consumers who say they are interested in "premium audio" at a cost of &# about are willing to pay double that to get a name brand such as bose he says the top three brands mr marshall adds are bose alpine and sony this is no longer a luxury phenomenon nissan is offering a rockford fosgate system on its nissan sentra compact "i am surprised the market is not responding to that as fast as it could " he says send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
