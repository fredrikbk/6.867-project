millions of acres of trees up in smoke kyle wingfields aug editorial page commentary "europes carbon con job" identified discrepancies in europes war against co emissions while i find it amazing that co emissions can actually be measured on a continental basis i would like to point out some discrepancies in our own battle against co emissions and global warming here in the u s for the fourth consecutive year more than six million acres of forests have been destroyed by fire in our country www blm gov for environmentalists this seems to present an "inconvenient truth " nowhere do we hear outcries against this gargantuan source of co and global warming no one decries the annual loss of over six million acres of shade and oxygen producing trees why not get serious about fighting forest fires instead of punishing industries that produce a relatively small amount of co while providing services to society as a graduate of the university of montana i recall the angst of state and national forest service officials in dealing with environmentalists in the s the forest service had extensive thinning programs to reduce the incidence of wildfires these programs also created many jobs for thinning crews who sold much of the harvested wood for pulp though clearcutting had been discontinued by the s many environmentalists protested even the thinning of state and national forests on the basis of its ostensible damage to particular species and to the natural forest ecology rather than thin forests to reduce the incidence of forest fires environmentalists argued we should let them burn since that is a part of natures ecological process today as a result of persistent lobbying by environmental groups the forest services robust thinning programs have been all but shut down it may be inconvenient for some of us to admit that doing little or nothing in the way of forest management has not worked but god did not put us here to do nothing while our world burns though we may not be able to harness the energy from the millions of acres of forests that are scorched annually perhaps a more globally responsible approach to the management of our state and national forests would benefit us all e w strong roseto pa
