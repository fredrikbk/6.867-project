markets while deflecting demands for a bailout in prepared remarks delivered friday morning at the kansas city feds annual seminar in jackson hole wyo the federal reserve chairman emphasized that the fed will keep a watch on financial markets to see that these essential engines of the american economy run smoothly "the federal reserve stands ready to take additional actions as needed to provide liquidity and promote the orderly functioning of markets " he said echoing earlier fed remarks on the topic but before investors had time to develop a warm fuzzy for mr bernanke a stern next line reminded them that they shouldnt expect the fed to save investors from poor decisions "it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions " he said then after giving them the verbal stiff arm he brought them back with more reassurance saying "but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy " the highly anticipated speech was mr bernankes first

greenwich capital likewise drew matus of lehman brothers wrote that mr bernanke "did not commit the fed to any course of action while reminding market participants that the fed is not out of touch "

financial markets " markets paused to digest mr bernankes utterances but then plowed forward around midday the dow jones industrial average was ahead at the standard &amp poors stock index was up at
