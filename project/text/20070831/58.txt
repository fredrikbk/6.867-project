investors default on outsize share of home loans investors played a big role in pumping up home prices during the housing boom now they account for an outsize proportion of loan defaults mortgage bankers and builders say a survey by the mortgage bankers association found that mortgages on properties that arent occupied by the owner mostly investment homes account for between and of the defaults on prime quality home loans in arizona california florida and nevada states where overdue payments are mounting fast defaults were high on both prime and subprime loans those made to borrowers with shaky credit histories the four states were among the favorites of speculators during the housing boom when the market was hot many speculators bought homes hoping to flip them for a quick profit but now that home prices have turned lower that strategy is backfiring as a result some investors have "simply walked away from their mortgages " said doug duncan chief economist of the mba echoing recent comments from executives of countrywide financial corp the nations largest mortgage lender investor defaults are likely to add to the spate of foreclosed homes hitting the market over the next year or two even as much tighter lending standards cut many potential buyers out of the market the darkening outlook for the housing sector has prompted economists at goldman sachs group to predict that home prices nationwide will fall an average of about both this year and next alarmed by such prospects a group of top executives from home building and supply companies are scheduled to meet next wednesday with federal reserve chairman ben bernanke to argue for fed actions to support the housing industry in nevada arizona and florida loans for properties that werent owner occupied accounted for nearly a third of all home mortgages issued in the figure was for california and for the nation as a whole the nationwide share for these primarily investor loans was in a range of about to in the s then jumped to in in and in in nevada homes that werent occupied by the owner accounted for of the prime mortgage defaults recorded as of june the mba said such homes accounted for about a quarter of prime loan defaults in florida and arizona and a fifth in california for the nation as a whole the figure was the mba defines defaults as loans that are days or more past due or in the foreclosure process but not those already taken over by lenders sazzad khandakar years old an information technology manager and father of three in monroe township n j is among the nations distressed home investors in early he bought a &# condominium and a &# newly built single family home both in orlando fla "everybody around me bought an investment home in florida " mr khandakar said "florida was all over the news my friends were doing it i didnt want to miss out " he planned to keep the condo as a second home and sell the detached house for a quick profit for the condo mr khandakar made a down payment but he borrowed of the cost of the house assuming that its rapid price appreciation would soon provide him with equity instead prices began falling and he has been unable to sell the home or find a tenant now mr khandakar said he is behind on both loans "my credit is shot for the next six or seven years " he said and he has run through &# of retirement savings "it will take me another five to years to recover that " he added many home builders say they tried to rein in sales to investors dom cecere chief financial officer of kb home a major national home builder based in los angeles said his company used contractual clauses barring home owners from renting out their properties but many investors bought anyway "people do infiltrate whether you like it or not "" he said thanks to easy lending standards many investors were able to get mortgages even though they put down deposits of as little as to on homes that werent yet built some watched gleefully as a rising market boosted the value by or before the home was ready for occupancy "for a while it went their way they bought two or three homes and continued to roll the dice "" said mr cecere "but that goes the other way when the prices go down "" in the end some investors may have made money by flipping a series of houses and lost out only on their last investment which they couldnt sell before the market collapsed mr cecere said jerry howard chief executive of the national association of home builders said "its probably a pretty good bet" that the trade group will press the case for cutting interest rates when it and housing industry executives meet with mr bernanke on wednesday on aug in response to a credit crunch that grew out of problems in the markets for mortgage linked securities the fed reduced its discount rate the fee charged on direct fed loans to banks to from in an effort to boost confidence amid near panic among investors over the surge in mortgage defaults and risks on other types of loans markets are betting the fed eventually will have to cut the more economically important federal funds rate charged on loans between banks the benchmark for short term borrowing costs lower rates tend to stimulate the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money home prices are weak in most of the country largely because of a glut of houses and condos on the market in july the number of homes listed for sale nationwide was enough to last months at the current sales rate according to the national association of realtors thats well above the five to six month supply thats considered balanced meanwhile lenders keep setting tougher terms particularly for investors who are viewed as higher risk borrowers guidelines sent out to mortgage brokers last week by countrywide specified that investors must make down payments of at least on some types of loans and must document their income and assets during the boom many lenders provided financing and often didnt insist on seeing the borrowers tax forms and pay stubs underscoring the growing pessimism about housing economists at goldman sachs in new york raised their forecast for the drop in u s home prices this year to from a previous the forecast is based on the s&amp p case shiller national home price index considered the best such gauge by some housing economists the goldman economists expect a further decline in house prices next year in this years second quarter the index was down from a year earlier another house price index produced by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight or ofheo showed that prices in the second quarter were up from a year earlier the federal regulator announced yesterday the ofheo index based on loans guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac excludes homes financed with mortgages above the current &# limit of the two federally sponsored mortgage giants as a result it misses much of the market in california and other high price areas the ofheo index has lagged other gauges in tracing the housing slump of the past two years
