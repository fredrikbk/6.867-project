go figure stocks woes help dollar flight to safe treasurys gives currency a boost in a sign of the unease that still pervades the markets bad news for stocks is paradoxically translating into good news for the dollar as concerns about subprime mortgages have deepened and stocks tumbled the beleaguered dollar instead rallied against a host of currencies from the euro to the brazilian real the dollars recent performance is an indication of just how skittish investors have become many analysts say the dollar should be weakening because the subprime crisis may slow economic growth and the u s remains burdened with huge deficits but during times of turmoil the dollar also stands to benefit that is because investors flock to the safety of plain vanilla treasury bonds so even as other u s investments suffer the dollar and treasurys have rallied "we do offer the deepest markets where money can be parked " says john mccarthy manager of currency trading at ing capital markets in new york "in an immediate crisis theres a bit of a flight to quality " the dow jones industrial average is down by more than from its july peak yet in that period the dollar has risen by against the euro by against the canadian dollar and by against brazils real the main exception is the japanese yen which has strengthened during this period the dollars run is emblematic of the disarray still nagging at markets as the u s heads into a long holiday weekend two weeks ago federal reserve officials lowered borrowing rates from the feds discount window which banks can tap for short term loans but since then stocks have seesawed and the bond market remains in many ways out of whack the fed reported yesterday that issuance of commercial paper a kind of short term loan often used by banks and corporate borrowers dropped &# billion in the week ended aug bringing commercial paper levels outstanding down more than &# billion this month meanwhile the interest rate on safe harbor three month treasury bills is down more than one percentage point in the past month to a drop that is comparable to the declines right after the sept terror attacks currency markets are also demonstrating some unorthodox behavior the dollar often moves based on investor views about economic fundamentals like the outlook for growth or the size of the u s trade gap by those measures it seems destined to fall as it was doing until a few weeks ago economic growth has slowed substantially in the past year and seems likely to slow further meanwhile the difference between what the u s spends and what it saves known as the current account deficit is widely considered unsustainable over the long run but rather than focusing on fundamentals investors and traders are now preoccupied with barometers of risk when perceptions of risk spike they pile into safe u s investments like treasury bonds since late july the value of the dollar relative to the euro has been closely correlated to a widely followed indicator of expected stock market turbulence the chicago board options exchange implied volatility index better known as the vix when volatility as measured by the vix has risen the dollar has largely strengthened against the euro for the year until then however the correlation was negative at the moment news about the economy is "second tier" information for how currencies will behave adds jonas thulin a senior currency strategist at calyon the investment banking arm of credit agricole he says his firm is looking at measures of risk in the stock and bond markets on a daily basis and even tick by tick to determine trades another key factor for risk watchers is the movement of the japanese yen when markets are calm investors take advantage of japans rock bottom interest rates to borrow inexpensively and reap profits elsewhere but when investors get nervous such maneuvers known as the "carry trade" are reversed and players have to buy back yen strengthening the currency that is also why the yen has been the main exception to the dollars recent stamina the dollars latest performance stands in contrast to the longer term trend which has seen the currency weaken substantially in recent years in july a federal reserve index that charts the dollars strength against a broad range of trading partners fell to its lowest point in a decade the dollar has suffered from perceptions that growth in the u s is slowing in comparison with other economies in both the industrialized world and emerging markets but the weaker dollar has also helped invigorate the overseas earnings of u s multinationals since they are worth more when converted back into dollars those points were underscored by a government report yesterday u s profits earned overseas were up in the second quarter from a year earlier domestic profits rose just if the dollar continues to strengthen it could hamper u s exports and overseas profits but many analysts dont expect that to happen if the fed pushes short term rates lower as many investors expect it could put some downward pressure on the dollar lower interest rates could mean the returns on dollar denominated bonds are relatively less appealing than bonds denominated in other currencies "once the dust settles " predicts mr mccarthy of ing "youll see a weaker dollar into the end of the year " dollar gains on euro but falls against yen the dollar traded in narrow ranges as investors grew weary of following u s stocks on their month long ride related to fears about global liquidity the dollar ended up slightly against the euro and down a bit on the yen investors held their positions ahead of a speech today by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke that might yield clues about interest rates in new york the euro was at &# down from &# late wednesday while the dollar was at yen down from yen the euro was at yen down from yen the pound was at &# down from &# while the dollar was at swiss francs up from francs dan
