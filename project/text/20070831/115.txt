the evening wrap bush bernanke soothe and scold online edition both president bush and fed chief ben bernanke today offered soothing words for those feeling financial pain but added stern warnings not to expect a bailout first the more anticipated speech in prepared remarks delivered at the kansas city feds annual seminar in jackson hole wyo mr bernanke emphasized that the fed will keep a watch on financial markets to see that these essential engines of the american economy run smoothly "the federal reserve stands ready to take additional actions as needed to provide liquidity and promote the orderly functioning of markets " he said echoing earlier fed remarks on the topic but before investors had time to develop a warm fuzzy for the central bank chairman a stern line reminded them that they shouldnt expect the fed to save them from poor decisions "it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions " he said then after that verbal stiff arm he brought them back with more reassurance saying "but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy " the speech was mr bernankes first public appearance since the fed cut its so called discount rate on aug and investors who are trying to figure the odds of a federal funds rate cut next month took a close look at the text which also included a professorial examination of the history of the american mortgage market stretching back before fdrs new deal drew matus of lehman brothers wrote that mr bernanke "did not commit the fed to any course of action while reminding market participants that the fed is not out of touch " mr matus also noted that the speech "reflected long held fed values moral hazard remains an issue for the fed to be concerned about what this means is that the fed focuses on the real economy not financial markets " not long after mr bernankes speech president bush stepped up to white house microphones offering details of a plan to assuage some of the pain felt by homeowners caught in the mortgage morass he offered a host of proposals including allowing the federal housing administration to guarantee loans for borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments a change that would allow struggling homeowners to stay in their houses "these reforms would allow the fha to reach families that need help those with low incomes and less than perfect credit records or little savings " mr bush said mr bush also put forward a temporary tweak to the tax code to help strapped homeowners refinance mortgages and avoid an unexpected tax bill under current law canceled mortgage debt on primary residences is considered taxable income while the message offered some help mr bush like mr bernanke tempered his words with a reminder of the responsibilities of investors "the governments got a role to play but it is limited " mr bush said "a federal bailout of lenders would only encourage a recurrence of the problem its not the governments job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford yet there are many american homeowners who can get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or little help from their government " stocks push higher on statements from bush bernanke investors paused to digest the remarks from messrs bush and bernanke then pushed stocks higher in light trading as some concluded a rate cut is in the works "everybody is taking away from the speeches that there is going to be a rate cut thats what really took
