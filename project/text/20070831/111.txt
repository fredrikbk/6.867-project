the daily fix sheets returns to lift brewers over zambrano and the cubs online edition in the national league pennant race fever is breaking out in the american league things are more sedate in chicago the reeling milwaukee brewers came off the mat in unlikely fashion riding a solid start from disabled list returnee ben sheets for a win over the cubs and carlos zambrano who finished august with a era the cubs lead in the mediocre nl central is now games over milwaukee with the st louis cardinals two back "wasnt carlos zambrano the guy who stomped stormed and threw helmets when negotiations for an extension werent going his way " asks jay mariotti in the chicago sun times "didnt he admit that the stress was affecting his performances didnt he use his shaken equilibrium as leverage in landing the biggest average per year contract for any pitcher in baseball history then why after finally winning his fortune and vowing again to lead the cubs to the world series is zambrano gagging on his dollar signs zeroes and commas " in the milwaukee journal sentinel michael hunt notes that the cubs whose starting rotation generally resembles a trauma ward have used just six starters this year a clear contrast to the mix and match patch jobs of the cardinals and brewers "which was why ben sheets comeback was of such particular interest " mr hunt writes "players indeed have to play and for once during this miserable swoon brewers fans were reminded how gratifying such a simple platitude can be with the return of the ace imagine that taking the ball with gusto and finally giving the bullpen a break no one even stirred down wrigley fields right field line until sheets reached his prescribed limit exactly when did the brewers think that sheets would be ok when his first pitch was mph manager ned yost said i relaxed from that point on " in san diego the padres marched into first place if moving a percentage point ahead can be considered marching beating the arizona diamondbacks in the san diego union tribune nick canepa tries to write a column in praise of milton bradley despite mr bradley not wanting anything to do with that endeavor "oh well " mr canepa writes "others were more than willing to talk for the player who almost single handedly has charged the offense helped greatly on defense and the bases and maybe just maybe kept the padres in the national league west race think if he hadnt missed starts with a hamstring problem and a strained oblique " and then mr bradleys numbers with san diego speak eloquently on their own since arriving in a trade with the oakland as on june mr bradley is hitting with runs scored nine home runs and rbi in philadelphia the new york mets looked like theyd tied the phillies with two outs in the ninth as shawn green beat out tadahito iguchis relay to stay out of a double play and score endy chavez from third but the mets marlon anderson was called out for interference on a too hard takeout slide of mr iguchi that ended the game gave the phils their third straight win over new york and brought them within three of the nl east lead "three nights of big plays scoreless innings by the bullpen and lets be honest a break or two have resulted in three huge wins " jim salisbury writes in the philadelphia daily news adding that whether or not the phils complete the sweep today they "have fared well in this series a poor showing could have buried them and turned all the sporting attention in this town to the football team the three biggest wins of the season have ensured that the baseball season will last a little longer who gets credit for that pick a name contributions have been made up and down the roster " never mind the interference call the new york posts jay greenberg tells met fans citing their teams numerous mistakes such as this one "oliver perez walked a pitcher old enough to practically need a walker marching the mets up against a wall " in the american league the races arent as tight the cleveland indians are up by games the anaheim angels have a five game lead and the boston red sox have a six game cushion in seattle the angels beat the mariners leaving the timess steve kelley to mourn a season that feels like its slipping away "this was their fifth loss in a row " he writes "already this season theyve had two losing streaks of six and one of seven the clock is ticking eventually the holes these losing streaks dig become too deep to escape but the way the mariners played these games was as disturbing as the final scores they played like it was april they need to look at tape of derek jeter in october or roberto clemente in a world series they need to see a replay of roger clemens throwing that broken bat back at mike piazza they need to be shown and told that these games are more important that the intensity gets amped in a playoff race it isnt april anymore " in new york the yankees beat the boston red sox behind the aforementioned clemens while first place in the al east is probably out of reach for the yanks the win moved new york into a virtual tie with the mariners for the al wild card in the boston globe dan shaughnessy ponders the former red sock still laboring at he notes that the last time boston faced an opposing pitcher with more career wins they were squaring off against walter johnson he observes that he clemens remains tied for first place with cy young among bosox career leaders in wins he marvels that clemens made his major league debut the year after carl yastrzemski retired and faced current red sox manager terry francona who was for and unsurprisingly recalled a brushback from the rocket "socks high in old timey fashion the old guy finished his warmups at p m then went to the back of monument park and touched the plaque that honors the great bambino " mr shaughnessy writes "the house that ruth built is closing down for good next summer and you wonder if clemens and public address icon bob sheppard might still be around for the famous final scene " mr shaughnessy doesnt seem worried about boston losing its grip on the al east but he has a word of warning for red sox nation nonetheless "after five months of underachievement and occasional humiliation the yankees are in great shape to make the playoffs and the prospect of another boston new york al championship series is very real though the sox may not have needed clemens to win the division he could still come back to haunt them in october " tuesday nights red sox yankees tilt featured the odd sight of a confused squirrel running up and down the right field foul pole why was that an ill omen for the yankees well you have to know your th century viking tales "believe it or not the squirrels actions closely resembled those of ratatosk or gnawing tooth a squirrel in norse mythology that climbed up and down a tree that represented the world " writes terry kider in the new york times adding "as the story goes ratatosk carried insults as it traveled to opposite ends of the tree fueling a rivalry between the evil dragon residing at the bottom of the tree and the eagle perched at the top " the eagle like challenger the eagle an oft seen yankee trope the yankees are the eagle the game was in the bronx so the red sox are the dragon it all makes sense the problem for yankee fans as yale professor roberta frank explains the dragon winds up destroying the world in norse mythology with the eagle "on the losing end of a battle that was only made worse by the malicious squirrel " tip of the fix cap to reader craig nesbit
