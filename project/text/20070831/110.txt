the daily fix nearing mlbs rock bottom astros decide to start fresh online edition two years removed from their exciting run to the world series the houston astros have been one of baseballs worst teams this season despite playing in the majors worst division the nl central houston is in an exciting eight team race for the second worst record in baseball tampa bay has a stranglehold on first worst thanks in part to games scheduled against the red sox and yankees until monday that didnt disrupt houstons image as a cuddly franchise "from owner drayton mclane a man who spends a few innings at every home game wandering around minute maid park talking with fans right down the front office line and all the way into the clubhouse the astros are a genuinely fun group " john donovan writes on si com "nice guys easy going friendly " but then mr mclane fired general manager tim purpura and manager phil garner their successors have a lot of work to do mr donovan writes "the astros as they stand now are a terribly imperfect team they are young and shaky in the rotation after starter roy oswalt and just as wiggly in the bullpen their shortstop and catcher positions are offensive black holes and there are questions to be answered at both second and third base they are weak defensively " yet there is also some talent and reason to hope for the future among them many prospective gms would like this job "mclane will have a long list of qualified candidates to choose from " richard justice writes in the houston chronicle "with enough revenue to support a &# million payroll and a history of winning the astros provide one of the majors plum jobs he can go for a numbers guy like david forst of the as or paul depodesta formerly of the dodgers he can hire an old school baseball guy like kevin towers of the padres phillies scouting guru mike arbuckle is another possibility " former milwaukee brewers star cecil cooper meanwhile takes over as interim field manager mr justice thinks he deserves to lose the "interim" tag but that hasnt worked out so well for dave trembley in baltimore as the fix noted last week his orioles promptly lost their first game under the skippers new contract in historically inept fashion more quietly the os have lost their next five games too by a combined score of baltimore sun columnist peter schmuck ventures that maybe this has all been a clubhouse prank "hotfoot too pedestrian " the clubhouse chatter went in mr schmucks imagination "and anyway trembley is so intense during a game that he wouldnt have noticed it until he lost a couple of toes ink inside the hatband logistically impossible trembley has not removed his cap since he got the interim job in june theres a rumor he sleeps in his uniform whoopee cushion who would even notice with millar around im guessing somebody just sort of threw it out there hey how about for the next week we make it look like well never win another game " many astros observers lament the departure of andy pettitte and roger clemens to the new york yankees after last season as one contributor to the franchises collapse yet the two havent brought instant success to the bronx combining for a moderately impressive era over starts this season mr petttitte has improved as the season has gone on making him the ideal pitcher to start against the boston red sox as the two rivals begin a series tonight with bigger implications for the struggling yanks than the first place bosox "he is an incredibly hard worker year round who does not abuse his body with a partying lifestyle " new york post columnist joel sherman writes of mr pettitte "so while others are wilting he is thriving and his makeup is superb the significance of a game never submerges him " the same couldnt be said of mike mussina last night who took the loss in the yankees loss to the detroit tigers the worst pinstriped performance since a washout in it was a "perfect game" for the tigers now three games back in the al wild card race michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press the seattle mariners lead the al wild card race by two games over the yanks yet didnt look playoff ready in a loss last night to the first place angels who play in anaheim "the mariners manager started the madness by being thrown out of the game after his first batter in the first inning " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times "thrown out for arguing a strike three call thrown out by the third base umpire " manager john mclaren was apparently right but his ejection "set a tone of desperation on a team that didnt need it " mr plaschke writes "playing one of the coolest teams in baseball the mariners began the night in chaos and never recovered " michael vick pleaded guilty friday admitting to dogfighting charges to helping to kill pit bulls and to supplying gambling money then the atlanta falcons quarterback apologized at a press conference you can read the apology here to most columnists his contrite actions werent enough to earn forgiveness but it was a step in the right direction "when he stood before a federal judge and admitted his guilt then apologized to everyone he had tried to hoodwink into believing that he was just some unknowing dupe it should have been enough for a forgiving society to allow him to move towards a path at redemption " bryan burwell writes in the st louis post dispatch that path is likely to lead to a prison sentence into what happens when that sentence and his league suspension expires "when vick becomes a free man in or some team will quickly sign him " mark purdy writes in the san jose mercury news "how do i know not even the mothers against drunk driving could persuade the st louis rams to cut lineman leonard little after his manslaughter dui conviction how can the humane society persuade an entire league to boycott vick if he follows the proper game plan of accepting public shame while uttering all the right regrets vick will get another chance and in fairness should " but san antonio express news columnist buck harvey isnt so sure quarterback poor teams will take a flyer on a released mr vick "they will wonder about a rusty quarterback who had always struggled with the conventional aspects of football they will wonder how their fans will respond and they will wonder if the headache is worth it " obscured by the vick headache is a problem of greater import for the nfl as a whole the preseason stinks two many games too few stars too many injuries "watch the patriot sideline thursday night in foxboro " peter king writes on si com "itll look like the sideline at a montana six man football game youll say hey where is everybody and everybody youve ever heard of will be in back bay having dinner with the family on a peaceful night off " mr king runs through some options for fixing the exhibition season though sadly he writes that theres zero chance of eliminating the thing entirely last week the connecticut sun beat the indiana fever in an exhilarating wnba playoff game that stretched into three extra periods last night indiana revenged the loss with an overtime victory to clinch the series the fever trailed by as many as and by with fewer than nine minutes left "these are the kinds of games that athletes and their hardcore fans remember and theyre the kinds of games and playoff series that make an otherwise nonchalant football crazy town take the time to notice what the fever are doing down the street " bob kravitz writes in the indianapolis star harsh words from si coms chris mannix about the host city for team usas demolition of the rest of the american continents basketball teams "las vegas should never have an nba team the crowds here have been pathetic never topping more than and generally less than the fact is that las vegas is a transitional city that doesnt have the fan base to support a team for games a season this tournament was proof of that and the arena stinks " tip of the fix cap to readers
