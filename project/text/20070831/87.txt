pyongyangs upper hand the six party talks on north koreas nuclear weapons program have now descended into a miasma of "working groups " one of which on u s north korea bilateral issues will meet this weekend in geneva it is worth paying attention to the outcome of this gathering north korea wants to be taken off the u s list of state sponsors of terrorism and as soon as possible to enjoy full diplomatic relations with washington pyongyang may well succeed as many in the u s state department seem more eager to grant full recognition to the pyongyang dictatorship in north korea than to the democracy in taiwan this would be a profound mistake on our part nearly days have passed since feb when the six party talks on north koreas nuclear weapons program produced an "agreement" to eliminate that program despite encomiums about the virtues of diplomacy little real progress has been made in eliminating pyongyangs program negotiations in july ended without agreement on a timetable despite repeated state department assurances since february that the north would be held to strict deadlines the yongbyon reactor is shuttered but that reactor was not frequently operational in the recent past and may well be at the end of or even beyond its useful life the return of international atomic energy agency inspectors to yongbyon provides north korea with a new patina of respectability despite the near certainty that significant nuclear activity is happening anywhere but yongbyon in fact the key change is that economic assistance is once again subsidizing and reinforcing kim jong ils hold on power heavy fuel oil food and other "humanitarian" assistance from south korea and substantial unpublicized aid from china are all flowing north cheeky pyongyang is once again demanding that the outside world supply it with light water nuclear reactors the second north south summit in pyongyang postponed until october closer to south koreas presidential elections will provide renewed legitimacy to the north korean dictatorship and may bolster the political chances of south korean advocates of appeasement in turn providing kim jong il even more breathing room kim is once again besting the u s in accomplishing his two central strategic objectives staying in power and preserving his nuclear weapons program the working groups currently underway do nothing to achieve the proper ends of u s foreign policy a few weeks ago in shenyang china the "denuclearization" working group met without visible progress even on permanently dismantling yongbyon there is still simply no evidence that pyongyang has made a decision to abandon its long held strategic objective to have a credible nuclear weapons capability this inconvenient fact should make it impossible for the state department to concede on other issues even if it were inclined to do so creative minds are therefore working on ways to explain that any forthcoming north korean declaration of its nuclear capabilities is "full and complete " thus eliminating the remaining troubling obstacles to full normalization of relations consider a possible north korean "declaration " perhaps drafted with states coaching which would say something like this "we manufactured two nuclear devices one of which we detonated last october we detonated the other earlier but you didnt recognize it as a nuclear explosion we currently have no nuclear devices our plutonium reprocessing efforts were not very successful which explains why we only had two devices neither of which produced large yields we ultimately disposed of our limited remaining plutonium to others and we have no idea where it now is we currently have no plutonium on uranium enrichment we purchased some uf and a small number of centrifuges for a test cascade from a q khan but we could not progress due to inadequate funds accordingly we long ago sold all but a small amount of the uf and the centrifuges to third parties we will produce what little we have at yongbyon shortly thats it are we done now " many will fall for this pretense of "full disclosure " especially those needing a diplomatic "success" to justify long years of faith in the six party talks the alternative is to reject any north korean declaration without full and timely verification iaea inspections alone are not enough its capacities are limited indeed much of the iaeas work is accomplished on the basis of intelligence provided by governments precisely because our knowledge of the norths nuclear program is incomplete we need an intrusive indeed invasive verification mechanism before having any confidence that north koreas nuclear program is in fact being dismantled we need smart and extensive verification activities inside north korea including no notice inspections a full range of sensors and sampling unrestricted interviews and document reviews if the north rejects effective verification that is yet another basis to repudiate the feb quicksand deal we need to know among other things precisely how many nuclear weapons the north has manufactured how and where it manufactured them how many it now has and how much reprocessed plutonium remains available for weaponization if any devices fissile material or nuclear manufacturing equipment have left north korea we need to learn the specifics we need to understand the full extent of its uranium enrichment program and if weapons grade enriched uranium was produced where it is and how much there is of it we also need to know specifically if north korea possesses any enriched uranium metal or any weapons or missile warhead design information president bush has stressed that we must also deal with pyongyangs biological chemical and ballistic missile programs we must address these programs especially the missiles soon failure to make explicit the important connection between weapons and delivery systems will certainly come back to haunt us and we are on the verge of allowing this point to slip away entirely finally we need to learn the details of north korean nuclear cooperation with other countries we know that both iran and syria have long cooperated with north korea on ballistic missile programs and the prospect of cooperation on nuclear matters is not far fetched whether and to what extent iran syria or others might be "safe havens" for north koreas nuclear weapons development or may have already participated with or benefited from it must be made clear for our own safetys sake and that of allies like japan and south korea there can be no compromises on these points mr bolton is a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and the author of "surrender is not an option defending america at the u n and abroad " forthcoming this
