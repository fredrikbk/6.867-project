qa building a brand around a personality online edition uncle wallys may not be as famous as famous amos but the same person is behind both brands wally amos once a show business promoter mr amos started selling chocolate chip cookies in in his store in hollywood calif the business took off as mr amos rode a gourmet cookie craze and advocated for adult literacy mr amos eventually lost the business and became its paid spokesman it changed hands several times and now is owned by kellogg co s keebler brand after false starts with two new companies in he co founded uncle wallys muffins corp a firm in shirley n y hes chairman and spokesman for the firm which has employees mr amos also owns chip and cookie a cookie store in kailua hawaii with his wife christine and is the founder of the chip and cookie read aloud foundation we spoke with mr amos about building a product brand identity around a personality wsj whats key to branding a product around a person wally amos heres wally amoss philosophy youre in business to make friends for someone to buy your product they really have to like you which is key to personality branding if im your friend youre going to do whatever you can to help me as a business owner i have a responsibility in that though i have to honor the friendship with my customer by producing a quality product with integrity by doing what i say im going to do by being a company that gives back to the community by being a civic minded company sure youre in business to make money and you have to make a profit but what are you going to do for the customers why would the customer buy your product over another product what if you have two muffins and both of them taste good i would believe that if someone had their choice between two muffins or two cookies that both tasted great that they would choose the wally amos product thats what branding is the brand stands for something the brand creates the income people buy the product because they know that the brand has integrity has credibility and the company stands behind it if customers have a problem with the product they can pick up the phone and get satisfaction but all of those things create profits why should someone buy your product it satisfies a need that they have there are so many choices today what are you going to do to stand out wsj whats the hardest part of building a personality based brand mr amos ive always operated on a very personal level because if i can meet you one on one im going to be your friend im going to win you over youre going to taste my product and youre going to like my product and youre going to like me and thats genuine youve got to have a personality you have to be somewhat of an extrovert because youre before the public all the time and you have to be passionate about your product this doesnt work for everybody everybody doesnt have the personality to be out front when you put your name and your picture on a product its a double edged sword if people dont like you or you do something that discourages them or that is not ethical you can go out of business when you and the brand become one whatever you do will ultimately affect the brand if youre exposed to something other than credibility and integrity then ultimately your brand is affected wsj how does uncle wallys build its brand mr amos word of mouth is huge word of mouth is the best way to promote a product or to brand a product which is what i did with famous amos we had huge word of mouth we had a lot of media attention because i opened a store selling only chocolate chip cookies and we tied famous amos in with literacy to use all of those avenues to bring attention to your product is important public relations becomes a huge part of that thats why weve always used cause marketing when i had famous amos i hooked up with literacy volunteers of america i became as identified with adult literacy as i did with cookies and that endeared me to people because they knew that i meant it wsj whats different about how you promote uncle wallys compared to how famous amos was promoted mr amos i dont know that there is anything different with uncle wallys we believe in giving muffins away and letting people taste muffins because the best way to sell a food product is to let someone taste it i always tell people you cant fool your mouth we align ourselves with nonprofit groups to help their causes which helps our cause and it helps their audience taste our product well give away muffins in a heartbeat to charities sometimes at events its all basic common sense stuff there are a lot of companies that sell muffins there were no cookie stores there are some limitations i can carry cookies around very easily i cant carry muffins muffins are more of a breakfast food rather than a snack that you can eat all day ideas are not all transferable from one product to the next just because you do it with one thing doesnt mean that you do it with another even with cookies i thought starting chip and cookie would be a breeze its almost two years and we havent had a profit yet we had a big opening party and i said ok this is going to catapult me but it didnt it did when i had famous amos but these are different times its a different location im in hawaii with famous amos i was in hollywood everything is different it was years later when i started chip and cookie its a whole different audience wsj what advice do you have for small business owners looking to brand a product around their personality mr amos you cant compete with the big guys so dont even attempt to do that you dont have the money you dont have the resources but many small businesses today because they dont have the budgets and they cant compete with all these big companies are personalizing their business in this day and age when everything is so big big is not better big is just bigger people buy from other people people do business with other people if you have a product that lends itself to you being the spokesperson for it you can be the person out front be consistent in who you are you have to use what you sell and youre going to have to know everything there is to know about what you sell you have to be passionate about what youre doing because otherwise youre not going to be able to convince people to buy it you need to do what you like too many people get in business to make money you have to make money but if thats your single motivation thats not enough its important to have fun if you dont have fun i dont give a damn what youre selling youre not going to be successful with it i know a lot of people who have a lot of money who are miserable and i dont want to be one of them
