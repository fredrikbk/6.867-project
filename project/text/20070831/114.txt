the evening wrap a lifeline for musharraf online edition associated press negotiations for an alliance with an old adversary could show a way forward for pakistans pervez musharraf as he contends with islamic extremism skepticism in washington and renewed demands for democratic reforms on wednesday benazir bhutto pakistans exiled former prime minister told the that president gen musharraf had agreed to step down as military chief as a key component of a possible power sharing agreement "were very pleased that gen musharraf has taken the decision to listen to the people of pakistan by taking the decision to take off the uniform " ms bhutto said as to the timing she said "i expected that he will step down as army chief before the presidential elections but that is for the president to say " a senior pakistani official confirmed that a deal had been reached but it wasnt clear whether gen musharrafs retirement from the military would come before a presidential election expected next month in which he will likely seek a fresh five year term the issue of gen musharrafs uniform is central to his effort to remain president opposition leaders argue that pakistans constitution requires him to give up his military title before he asks lawmakers to renew his mandate something he must do between sept and oct for his part gen musharraf has previously insisted that the constitution allows him to remain in uniform until the end of and has left open what will happen after that still the jostling over his military status reflects just one aspect of the erosion of gen musharrafs power in recent months amid confrontations with islamic extremists and democratic activists after taking control in a bloodless coup in gen musharraf was initially cheered by some groups for restoring order to a country that had been practically bankrupted by corruption and economic problems under the leadership first of ms bhutto and then of nawaz sharif the prime minister whom gen musharraf toppled but in recent months gen musharrafs rule has begun to grate on some of his secular supporters most notably his suspension of the head of pakistans supreme court in march prompted protests from lawyers and political opposition groups sapping support from what had been considered his principal constituencies pakistans business community and middle class then in july pakistani commandos killed about during a raid designed to clear islamic militants from the red mosque in the center of islamabad a raft of revenge attacks and bombings ensued the same month as the raid another cornerstone of mr musharrafs rule staunch u s support also showed signs of weakening as a national intelligence estimate reported that al qaeda terrorists have established a safe haven in pakistans semi lawless tribal areas which border afghanistan that same month think tanks began churning out papers on the problem pakistan poses for the u s one recent offering from the carnegie endowment for international peace argues that "the united states and other international actors vital to pakistans future must stop taking the metaphorical bribe of partial pakistani cooperation in fighting al qaeda terrorists in return for propping up an unrepresentative military government " likewise the center for strategic and international studies said "rather than simply sticking to musharraf like velcro we should emphasize the larger dimension pakistan itself u s policy and public diplomacy should focus on the need to respect pakistans law and constitution and carry out genuinely free elections to achieve legitimacy and long term stability " the details of any power sharing deal between ms bhutto and gen musharraf remain unclear as does any washington suasion and gen musharraf will surely have stressful times ahead foremost among them could be the return of mr sharif just last week pakistani courts ruled that exiled former prime minister can return before parliamentary elections mr sharif has already denounced gen musharraf as a dictator saying he should be gone from the political scene in light of such opposition an alliance with ms bhutto could offer a way forward for gen musharraf since she is the leader of the largest political party in pakistan and her backing could help win popular support his government and policies as to whether a more democratic pakistan would be an effective counter terrorism partner ms bhutto said that "the u s would have a lot to gain in the democratization of pakistan which is armed with nuclear weapons and in danger of becoming a failed state " " stocks rise on techs fed letter stocks rose wednesday as technology shares helped lead markets higher the dow jones industrial average was up or to erasing most of yesterdays loss
