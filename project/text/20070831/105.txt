the afternoon report smoking overseas online edition cigarette maker altria today moved a step closer to separating its fast growing international operations from its u s business where smoking bans and health concerns have had fewer puffing in recent years after a board meeting altria confirmed what had been widely expected by announcing that it plans to spin off philip morris international with a final decision on the move and its timing coming by jan the company is betting that investors will take to the idea of unhooking its international operations from the drag of sluggish sales in the u s where taxes smoking bans and repeated warnings about health risks have cut into the number of smokers overseas smokers have been some of altrias best customers of late in the most recent quarter cigarette volumes at philip morris usa dropped from a year earlier while international cigarette volumes rose morningstar analysts see domestic cigarette sales volumes declining annually by to over the next years while overseas volumes should rise by about the same rate altria shareholders also contend that a separation of foreign and domestic operations will give both companies greater flexibility to develop new products and zero in on acquisitions that would transform the companys substantial free cash into more profitable ventures disentangling altrias operations may also help shield the two businesses from smoker liability issues arising in each others markets some investors seemed pleased by todays news "we will continue to hold positions in both units but i would think philip morris international is really the crown jewel " said charles norton portfolio manager of the vice fund which holds altria shares spin offs are certainly not new to altria or its investors in

its business mix drop slower growth projects and target areas with more potential to add pop to earnings kraft has since set it sights on buying companies in emerging markets such as eastern europe and latin america still it remains to be seen whether the spin off of kraft can meet expectations the companys shares rose after the march move but have since fallen back toward pre spinoff levels
