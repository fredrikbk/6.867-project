justice the murder of top russian journalist anna politkovskaya in october highlighted the dangers faced by russias independent press which has crumpled along with opposition political parties as the

stiff market discipline but perhaps nowhere are both more needed than in chinas banks our editorial writers argue markets have been surprised by the scale of the subprime exposure some of chinas biggest banks recently disclosed yet though some analysts expect them to eventually revise the estimates of their exposure upward the worst appears to be over at least for the publicly traded banks
