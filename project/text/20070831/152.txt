weekend journal taste de gustibus sex and the citizenry why scandals still scandalize with the revelation this week that sen larry craig r idaho engaged in "disorderly conduct" in a mens bathroom of the minneapolis airport republicans are looking less and less like the party of family values and more like the party of sexual scandals and there is no doubt that the habits of rep david vitter r la who was found to have been a client of a washington prostitute or mark foley the former florida representative who was accused of sending suggestive emails to congressional pages have left many voters aghast but why after all we live in a culture awash in sex television movies billboards the internet after watching a few minutes of mtv is it really so shocking to find celebrities or even prominent politicians engaging in these sorts of activities sure theres the hypocrisy of it all the three involved here are outspoken social conservatives and to be doing what they were doing while they were saying what they were saying does require a certain amount of cognitive dissonance or as my grandmother would say chutzpah the scandals are as much about hypocrisy as sex of course but i would submit that the activities of these men are if anything more of a shock to the publics sensibilities than they would have been years ago take mr vitter for instance before the sexual revolution a man with the congressmans desires might well have had to resort to cavorting with women of ill repute prostitution was widespread and as the recent book "sin in the second city" by karen abbott demonstrates brothels were hardly hidden from public view "the line of brothels and dives on state street from van buren to nd was known as satans mile " ms abbott writes there was even a "guide to neighborhood brothels titled the sporting and club house directory " but it wasnt just chicago historic walking tours of cities from charleston s c to new york will inevitably include reference to the location of the old whorehouses everyone knew about them and the politicians were frequent customers today most respectable citizens of new york and chicago would be hard pressed to tell a visitor where they could find such businesses why in part the demand for their wares has dwindled mr vitter and the rest of us live in an era where sex outside of marriage is pretty common and sex before marriage is becoming universal sure many people still frown on extramarital affairs but one imagines that if mr vitter had a capitol hill fling rather than purchased his companionship his constituents might not be so disgusted and to be honest in an era where sex is so widely available mr vitter also looks a little pathetic having to pay for his what about messrs craig and foley who seem more interested in playing for the other team well luckily they live in a society where homosexuality is pretty widely accepted too there are gay bars in washington minneapolis and even boise one imagines heck some states will officially sanction a homosexual relationship shortly after mr craigs guilty plea was revealed he told the press unconditionally "i am not gay " but hes missed the point if he were just gay no one would even blink join the log cabin republicans for heavens sake even some of his more religious supporters might just decide to love the sinner and hate the sin if this were a century ago and mr craig were living in some sexually repressed society where he could fulfill his sexual desires only in a seedy back alley voters might feel a little bad for him but in a nation that offers practically free rein to anyone interested in gay sex why does mr craig have to engage in this illegal and furtive not to mention yucky activity mr foleys particular proclivities for teenage boys are thank goodness still off limits legally and the general public is still repulsed by them but perhaps it is precisely because social boundaries are drawn so widely that we guard them so vigilantly ms riley is the journals deputy taste editor
