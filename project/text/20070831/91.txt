readback a book that takes some bravery in the railway man eric lomax recounts torture reconciliation online edition eric lomax a british prisoner of war during world war ii was waterboarded by a japanese interrogator "he directed the full flow of the gushing pipe on to my nostrils and mouth at a distance of only a few inches water poured down my windpipe and throat and filled my lungs and stomach this is the sensation of drowning on dry land a flood welling up from within and choking me they alternated beatings and half drownings for i know not how long " "the railway man " mr lomaxs biting but gallant memoir of his more than three years in captivity in the far east is the opposite of escapist reading it is a little bit of torture infinitesimal compared to mr lomaxs suffering but painful in its way i forced myself to keep reading several pages of savage suffering but mr lomax is the quintessential scot narrator he grew up in edinburgh plainspoken but eloquent his emotions muted but not denied before mr lomax enlisted in the royal corps of signals in he was working for the post office as his father had before him but his greatest passion was trains "my hobby had grown into an obsession by the time i left school in in fact steam engines occupied most of my free hours between and the moment when i volunteered for the army in " for both his father and him "great machines were not fearful or distressing but things to be celebrated as fascinating as the natural world creatures made by men " in the army mr lomax a communications specialist was posted to malaya where he and thousands of other allied soldiers were trapped when the japanese invaded like many of the pows he was put to work building a new railway connecting burma and thailand "a route so terrible that our british colonial engineers had rejected it as too brutally hard " mr lomax couldnt believe that he "had become a prisoner only to be sent to work on a road for the machines that had given me such immense pleasure when i was free " while in camp mr lomax and some of his buddies built a small radio using cadged and stolen parts the radio hidden in the false bottom of a coffee can received badly one station all india radio from new delhi but the morale boost the soldiers got from hearing news of allied victories probably saved some of their lives months later their captors discovered the radio and in a subsequent search they found a map that mr lomax had been drawing of the route of the burma thailand railway before mr lomax was waterboarded the japanese secret police had beat him with pick ax shafts fracturing both his arms cracking several ribs and permanently damaging one hip for weeks he lived in a cage where he could neither lie down nor stand comfortably he was constantly thirsty and so hungry that he once spotted a single grain of rice on a floor picked it up and ate it mr lomax and several others were charged with subversion sabotage and being a "bad influence " and sentenced to five years in prison he only survived this lower ring of hell by learning to feign mortal illness to get transferred temporarily to a hospital it wasnt a big stretch for him to feign being near death both crafty and lucky mr lomax survived the war and returned to scotland where he tried with limited success to resume normal life he regained most of his physical strength but he knew he was deeply scarred emotionally he was he says "a strange combination of stubbornness passivity and silent hostility " retired in his s mr lomax located a witness to his torture the japanese interpreter who had asked the questions and relayed the answers while mr lomax was nearly drowning the interpreter nagase takashi was publicly repentant for his wartime job and had spent the decades since trying to atone for it the two men met and after spending several days touring japan with their wives mr lomax formally pardoned mr nagase mr lomax was a brave man and it takes a minuscule but not zero amount of bravery to read his memoir i assigned it to myself because ive been thinking about torture "the railway man" only confirmed what i had already suspected it isnt always the bad guys who get the waterboard treatment
