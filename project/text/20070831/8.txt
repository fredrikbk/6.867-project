bmw opens door to tech alliances sharing costs may help independent car maker rev up profit growth bmw ag chairman and chief executive officer norbert reithofer has a simple way of stating the problem confronting the luxury car maker "if you have increasing turnover " mr reithofer said referring to company revenue "the profit has to increase with it that is the real issue " that isnt happening now at bmw second quarter profit fell despite a rise in revenue mr reithofer in an interview at bmws u s headquarters in woodcliff lake n j said hes "not satisfied " the solutions arent simple with european and u s regulators and consumers demanding that all car makers significantly boost fuel efficiency bmw faces rising costs from developing and deploying new fuel saving technology complicating that effort the company faces cost issues related to the strong euro and higher commodity prices mr reithofer acknowledged that bmw will need to do more of what others in the industry have done forge alliances with rival car makers to spread costs over a larger volume base the challenge will be balancing the need for partners with bmws long term commitment to remaining independent and staying above the competitive fray in the automotive mass market "independence is in our genes " he said rival high end german brands with big corporate parents such as daimlerchrysler ags mercedes and volkswagen ags audi have reported surging sales and profits lately asian luxury brands such as toyota motor corp s lexus and nissan motor co s infiniti are more aggressively targeting bmw in the u s and europe mr reithofer has launched a management board review of bmws structure and strategy accelerated the companys efforts to expand production outside the euro zone and pushed to roll out new fuel saving technology across bmws model lines the cost of the latter move includes a boost in advertising budgets to sell its fuel efficiency efforts to consumers typically drawn to bmws speed and power mr reithofer said bmw wont fall short of its previously stated goal to bring in profit this year above the billion euros &# billion earned last year excluding a million euro gain on the sale of certain securities "not with me as chairman " he said mr reithofer said he wont be ready to discuss conclusions from the management review until october still some elements of a revamped bmw approach are becoming visible including the possibility that fiercely independent bmw will rely more on rivals to share the burden of costly new technology bmws planned initiatives are costly particularly for a relatively small company bmw expects to sell about million vehicles this year compared with more than million projected by toyota bmw and rivals face pressure from european regulators to drastically reduce the carbon dioxide output of its fleet effectively a mandate to boost fuel efficiency this year bmw says of its cars will meet a voluntary emissions target of grams per kilometer but european union regulators are talking about grams per kilometer as a standard the u s government meanwhile is weighing proposals to boost fuel efficiency standards by more than mr reithofer said bmw is responding by pushing across its fleet a suite of fuel saving technologies among the features are technology that shuts off the engine when the vehicle is stopped turns off accessories such as the air conditioner compressor when they arent needed and dashboard lights that prompt the driver to shift gears to achieve the best fuel efficiency bmw will outfit its european series sedans with these technologies this fall in the u s bmws big technology push will be the introduction next year of vehicles with a new three liter diesel engine clean enough to be sold in all states diesel engines can achieve significantly better fuel economy than like size gasoline motors in the u s diesels have remained a marginal technology in the passenger car market in part because of tough clean air standards and consumer perceptions that diesels are noisy and dirty bmw said research and development costs jumped during the first half to nearly billion euros that represented of revenue compared with a year earlier big tie ups in the auto industry have largely fallen out of favor after the collapse of daimlerchryslers global strategy and the expensive breakup of the cross owning alliance between general motors corp and italys fiat spa mr reithofer said bmw isnt looking for a strategic partner and he doused speculation that bmw might seek to expand its sales base by acquiring volvo from ford motor co but with competition intense and costs high the industry is developing looser alliances to come up with the industrys next generation of technology bmw already has deals to develop hybrid gasoline electric drive technologies with gm and daimlerchrysler and builds four cylinder engines for its mini line with psa peugeot citroen sa the difficulty with more such alliances bmw would become more dependent on the moves of its partners which may also be competitors in some markets also high on mr reithofers to do list is accelerating the growth of bmw production outside western europe bmw is ramping up capacity in the fast growing economies of russia india and china where demand for the auto makers vehicles is high among the newly wealthy bmw has expanded its reach by broadening its vehicle lineup next year the company will take a coupe version of its european series model to the u s offering consumers who have the means to buy a well equipped honda accord or chrysler the chance to own a bmw instead mr reithofer indicated bmw will focus next on the upper end of its range at last falls shanghai auto show bmw showed a concept for a large sporty sedan called the cs "i want to have that car " mr reithofer said
