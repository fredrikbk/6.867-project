weekend journal sports by the numbers the nfls strange success story playing in a super bowl can do a lot for a team not only does it draw attention and fans it also places them in the elite group of nfl teams that have truly arrived but theres one thing that it doesnt do provide any indication of how theyll fare the following season for example after wining super bowl xl last years pittsburgh steelers posted an mark that left them out of the playoffs and theyre hardly the exception in recent years the philadelphia eagles the carolina panthers and even the first new england patriots championship team didnt make the playoffs in the season following an appearance in the big game baseball analyst bill james uses what he calls the law of competitive balance to explain this trend "teams which win tend to slack off they dont work as hard they dont take risks to make themselves better they think defensively " mr james wasnt talking just about players he was talking about how team managements tend to react to success they think "if we could win with mr x at cornerback last year then why cant we do it again this year " such complacency can find itself reflected in the win loss column in the nfl this effect is especially strong due to several factors that can undermine a championship teams future prospects good teams face harder schedules they also have less of a chance at nabbing top rookies and when their players become free agents they tend to ask for more money given the leagues hard cap teams are faced with the difficult choice between overpaying him which can prevent them from signing other free agents or letting him go to a rival but mr james cites a corollary to his law teams that are contenders but dont get to the championship game can be dangerous "when a team combines the talent of a championship team with the attitude of a runner up the combination can produce historically often has produced a team of exceptional quality " thats been the case in the nfl recently the team with the leagues best regular season record tends not to win the title but look out the next season in the regular season the indianapolis colts won a league best games but were upset in the playoffs by the pittsburgh steelers last season they won the title the steelers won games but their super bowl win came the following season what does that say about this years contenders many of last years also rans made significant upgrades the baltimore ravens complemented the leagues best defense with running back willis mcgahee the former miami star who toiled in obscurity in buffalo two other contenders can expect better play out of their quarterbacks philip rivers of the san diego chargers after his first full season as a starter should be better able to exploit the opportunities that arise when defenses focus on running back ladainian tomlinson who broke the league record for touchdowns in the nfc eagles quarterback donovan mcnabb was having one of his best seasons ever until he got hurt but the success of his backup jeff garcia shows the soundness of the brian westbrook led offense the eagles who traded for linebacker takeo spikes outgained their opponents by an average of yards per play best in the nfl but the team that most closely fits mr jamess model is the new england patriots the pats held a halftime lead against the colts in last seasons afc championship game before seeing that lead and their shot at the title vanish with the sting of that loss still fresh the patriots traded a low draft pick for former all pro wide receiver randy moss along with free agent signee donte stallworth mr moss will give quarterback tom brady the deep threats hes lacked on defense they signed adalius thomas an anchor of baltimores best in the nfl defense and the patriots still have two of the key pieces of their championship run mr brady and head coach bill belichick so what does a super bowl contender look like a team as ruthless in identifying its weaknesses as in picking apart rivals and that has the incentive to take the gambles that can be necessary for improvement this year that team looks like the patriots
