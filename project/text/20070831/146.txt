weekend journal review film in deep water sailors story is tense turbulent expert documentary of man in over his head unnerving manda bala the umbrella term documentary keeps unfurling ever wider these days its as likely to mean an impassioned polemic or provocation a la michael moore or al gore as it is to denote a calm work of reportage or historical narrative yet calm surfaces can conceal roiling passions thats the case in "deep water " an enthralling documentary about an englishman named donald crowhurst who in set off on a solitary nonstop circumnavigation of the globe he was a quixotic figure in a race sponsored by the sunday times a sunday sailor attempting a feat that no adventurer had ever achieved by the time crowhurst left his wife and young children behind in the seaside town of teignmouth he had taken leave of at least one of his senses common sense would have told him that unlike his seasoned competitors he lacked sufficient skill to pit himself against the implacable fury of the southern ocean this was long before the era of global positioning satellites and pinpoint navigation he also lacked aptitude for the months of physical and spiritual isolation that lay ahead whats more his innovative but hastily constructed trimaran had already capsized and sprung a series of alarming leaks but he needed money to provide for his family the newspaper was offering gbp for the fastest voyage and he craved celebrity so he persevered when he belatedly realized that he had embarked on a suicide mission don crowhurst chose another course with stunning consequences some documentaries promise more than they deliver "deep water " which goes into national release today delivers more than it promises one expects a good yarn about a lone man against the cruel sea and drama abounds from the start crowhursts chaotic preparations his emergence as a homegrown hero an amiable exemplar of british derring do on a shoestring his relentless good cheer in public appearances with his wife whose lovely features are darkened by anxiety beyond that though the films directors louise osmond and jerry rothwell have brought together a wealth of material then orchestrated it with uncommon expertise we see among many fascinating interviews in the present crowhursts wife clare and one of their sons simon both of them still sorting out their hurt and anger still trying to comprehend why the man they loved did what he did we see and hear crowhurst at sea playing to the mm camera and tape recorder with which he documented part of his adventure in a similar mode a french yachtsman in the race bernard moitessier says "on the boat you can discover who you really are " as crowhursts situation grows desperate the scope of the film expands from a good yarn to a haunting complex tale of self promotion media madness self delusion and finally self destruction having discovered who he was not the sunday sailor passed his point of no return manda bala a documentary about brazil "manda bala" "send a bullet" fits the category of impassioned polemic reportedly the film cant be shown in brazil the broad subject here is corruption with an emphasis on the urban kidnappings that have made helicopters the only safe way for wealthy brazilians to get around in their crime ridden cities broad may be putting it narrowly the director a new yorker of south american extraction named jason kohn serves up a bewildering yet seldom uninteresting assortment of subjects they include a frog farm that turns out to be a money laundering operation though its also quite graphically and repulsively a frog dismembering operation and a plastic surgeon who specializes in creating replacements for the ears that kidnappers cut from the heads of their hostages rib cartilage is the material of choice according to graphic repulsive footage of the surgery mr kohn is unpersuasive when he sets up a rough equivalency between the rich stealing from the poor and the poor stealing the rich a cold hearted thick headed kidnapper who appears on camera is obviously prosperous what the film does best is document the lengths to which people are going to protect themselves subcutaneous microchips for identification ever heavier armor for fancy cars "im just a citizen trying to survive " says the owner of a bullet proof porsche that cost half a million dollars he questions his investment however after taking a driving school course in evasive maneuvers "it made me actually feel a little bit unsafer " "manda bala" aims to make its audience feel a lot unsafer live in maid even if i knew how things turned out in "live in maid " a fine argentinean film with english subtitles i wouldnt give away the ending but i dont know with ten minutes to go in the screening at a shopping center multiplex in west los angeles a fire alarm sounded strobe lights strobed exhaust fans roared and the whole mall was evacuated for half an hour not once but twice since the alarm system went off again after wed returned i finally had to go off to another screening now that the movie has opened however im determined to go back take that as a measure of how engaging jorge gaggeros debut feature proved to be and discover what becomes of beba an aging sophisticate played by the great norma aleandro and her faithful maid dora a wonderfully taciturn performance by norma argentina the story is set in buenos aires in during an economic crisis that has left beba unable to pay doras salary as in a southern hemisphere version of chekhov beba is slipping into flat out poverty while dora struggles upward toward the middle class both women need each other desperately of course which gives me hope that everything will work out in the end in brief the funny trailer for "balls of fury" inspired guarded hope that this ping pong cum kung fu comedy would be idiotic enough to be enjoyable its only idiotic enough to be idiotic if you liked the trailer go online and watch it again dvd tip documentaries dont have to be feature length to tell epic tales three decades ago "the flight of the gossamer condor " a minute film directed by ben shedd won a richly deserved oscar for its thrilling account of how the california inventor and scientist paul b maccready built the first aircraft to fulfill the dream of human powered flight it was powered by a bicycle racer pedaling furiously inside a mylar shrouded cockpit maccready died earlier this week after a long and illustrious career until last week the film that celebrates him was available if at all only as an out of print vhs tape through collectors or online auctions but now the condor flies again in a th anniversary dvd thats being sold online at www gossamercondor com the disc is resplendent thanks to digital remastering in hd a rejuvenation that has wisely left traces of the imperfections that characterize all films of a certain age yet its essential brilliance lies in the inventiveness of maccready and his team in their eagerness to learn from successive failures and in the broad winged condor itself a thing of fragile beauty but a timeless monument to the man who made the dream a reality
