managing the digital dilemma marketers weigh keeping stand alone divisions or bringing tech into core on aug jean marie dru the chairman of omnicom groups big ad agency tbwa worldwide flew from his office in new york to halifax nova scotia for lunch his task sealing a top secret deal to lure colleen decourcy then top digital executive at wpp groups jwt to take the reins as chief digital officer for tbwa it was the final touch on a wooing process that began on the deck of the majestic hotel during the advertising festival in cannes in june ms decourcys appointment was announced last friday mr drus willingness to travel to halifax where ms decourcy was on vacation demonstrates the lengths to which advertising agencies go nowadays to beef up their digital operations so far traditional agencies are lagging behind independent digital firms in the competition for digital business one of the fastest growing sectors of the ad market one major factor is the shortage of digital talent at the older agencies indeed despite building a digital division dubbed tequila over the past couple of years tbwa still finds that some clients such as visa continue to use other "pure digital" firms such as akqa for most of their interactive ad duties a visa executive said earlier this year that tbwa didnt have "capabilities in that area " persuading clients that its digital offerings are as good as specialist firms will be ms decourcys big challenge as she confronts that shell have to decide whether to keep the employee tequila as a stand alone division or roll it into the main agency which has about staffers its a contentious subject some marketers believe digital should be at the core of an ad firm not relegated to a specialized division folding it in many believe will help digital ideas become part of the early planning stages of a marketing campaign rather than seen as an add on agencies on the other hand have been leery about folding in these digital offshoots because theyve been able to charge separate fees for the digital services if they were folded in clients might expect such services to be part of the traditional fee ms decourcy joins tbwa after a year at jwt where she tried to build jwts digital offering and helped create digital ad efforts for clients such as hsbc smirnoff and ford motor before that she spent six years at omnicoms interactive ad agency organic aside from her interactive experience ms decourcy brings something else of value to tbwa shes a self described "full on addict" of sonys playstation the popular videogame player is one of the ad shops marquee accounts but one the firm is fighting to keep sony which spends an estimated &# million a year advertising the playstation placed the coveted account up for review last month ms decourcy talks below about the lack of digital talent in the ad business the wall street journal over the past couple of years many ad firms have hired a digital bigwig or named a "digital czar " is that approach enough ms decourcy of course not i think many are keeping digital in the theoretical every general needs an army wsj because of the steep prices for digital ad shops many traditional ad agencies have said they will build digital competencies instead of buying them is this really feasible given the digital talent crunch that exists ms decourcy i think it is if you are the right agency and the right culture a lot of it depends on size if you drop digital people into a person ad network guess what you have people who are not sure where they belong i think the larger agencies need to understand that digital is going to be more than the digital extension of an ad campaign wsj tbwa keeps its digital expertise in a recently built division dubbed tequila does this group need to be folded completely into the ad agency ms decourcy all options are available to us at this point i have to sit down and do some due diligence and hear what people have to say what is fascinating is that both parties are willing for either answer to be the right one do they become one or dont they that is the question everybody just wants to get to work everyone is so leery of the discussion what i hear is i am a creative director i want to make great things but every time i walk in the room i get questions like what about digital did you invite the digital guys in at the right time or are the digital guys part of this party the discussion is strangling wsj every agency talks about training old school creative executives who grew up on tv ads to be digital is this really feasible or is it simply lip service ms decourcy i think that people who continue to be culture eaters regardless of their age are trainable in my mind digital is ubiquitous you use it across your life in all its various forms and if you live doing that you understand what it needs to give you to be a good experience if you do not you will never get it i have had creative and media people say i get it i am reading up on it and i understand interactive is important i point out to them its the same if i came to their shop as a junior creative and said i totally get tv commercials they would say where is your reel i have shot of them people are mistaking recognizing digital as an object of conversation with having the craft to throw down lets face it even the people who grew up in digital are still learning the craft im the longest i could have been making digital is or years and there are people who are talking about a tv shoot that took place years ago lets not forget there has to be craft applied here i wouldnt want anyone to let me loose on a &# million tv shoot yet
