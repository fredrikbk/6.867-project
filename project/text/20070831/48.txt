from seattle with lattes and russian rivals await moscow when starbucks corp founder howard schultzs book "pour your heart into it " was translated into russian three years ago vlad lozitsky bought a pile of copies for his employees at shokoladnitsa one of russias largest coffeehouse chains "we ordered them to read it in one week " says mr lozitsky the chains general manager mr lozitsky also watched and rewound scenes from the film "i am sam " in which sean penns character works as a starbucks barista to study how he makes cappuccinos its all helping mr lozitsky get ready for the arrival next month of the first full service starbucks in russia an important market in the seattle chains strategy to drive growth by one day having cafes outside the u s five times as many as it does now but local chains say starbucks already has made a big mistake "if i were starbucks i would have done it five years ago " says vladislav dudakov president of coffee house russias largest cafe chain in parts of moscow his store chain has locations every few blocks adds mr lozitsky "they missed their time " as starbucks waited spending several years trying to win back the rights to its name from a russian trademark squatter local coffeehouses built heavily in large cities real estate became more expensive and the labor market tightened making it difficult for restaurants to find good workers and starbucks wont be competing only against homegrown rivals but against other giant western chains mcdonalds corp is putting more mccafe sections in its restaurants to serve cappuccino and dessert "we do not spend a great deal of time focusing on our competition " says martin coles president of starbucks coffee international who will start as the companys chief operating officer next month he adds that the growth of other coffee chains can actually help starbucks by increasing the overall coffee market "were at our best when we have some competition " starbucks has been touting its international growth prospects to shore up waning investor confidence its shares have fallen about since their peak in november but a handful of recent setbacks overseas show how tricky it is to operate in other cultures in july starbucks closed its store in beijings ancient forbidden city amid complaints that its presence was disrespectful also that month the company postponed its entry into india without giving an explanation starbuckss executives stress that the chain has been welcomed in the overwhelming majority of places it has opened although russians historically have drunk tea or more recently instant coffee starbucks predicts its beverages will appeal to muscovites affinity for western brands they say the experience of sitting at a starbucks will attract customers regardless of whether they like the taste of coffee "what weve found everywhere weve opened is we become a landmark overnight " mr coles says in russia starbucks plans to offer more croissants sandwiches and other food than in the u s since food is typically a bigger draw in its overseas cafes mr coles says the chain may adapt its offerings using cinnamon and other flavors popular with russians however the drink menu will offer most of the same lattes and other beverages as in other parts of the world and will be priced similarly to the u s starbucks even has an employee trying to match the taste of its blueberry muffins for russia to those sold everywhere else in the world mr coles says while starbuckss trademark paper cups are a common sight in the hands of u s commuters the company expects that the vast majority of its business in russia as it is in other international locations will come from sit down customers the chain plans to start by building in moscow with a goal of having no more than russian locations by years end the first will be in a mega shopping center on the outskirts of moscow starbucks plans to use the same color scheme and other design aspects as its locations in every other part of the world a starbucks spokeswoman declined to comment on other details of the opening to enter russia starbucks has joined in a partnership with m h alshaya a kuwait retail firm that operates starbucks locations in the middle east some analysts have questioned why starbucks picked that company to open in russia since theyre not russian and specialize more in mall locations than the main street sites starbucks typically prefers mr coles says the company picked alshaya because it has successfully operated other retail brands in russia such as the body shop and because starbucks has a good relationship with the firm to get out in front of starbucks russian coffee chains are adopting some of its techniques an old russian cafe that was revived in shokoladnitsas stately locations cater to sit down customers with waiters dark wood chairs gold framed paintings and a page menu featuring pancakes with caviar pina coladas and marlboro cigarettes mr lozitsky made a detailed plan to ready shokoladnitsa for starbuckss arrival it includes prominently displaying paper to go cups and cutting the price of take away coffee by hes adding stations for cream and sugar trying to speed service and whittling the menu to make it easier for customers to choose since russians typically dont walk down the street while drinking he has walked around moscow with a cup in his hand to study the reactions of passersby shokoladnitsa plans to add about locations by the end of the year for a total of as many as in russia and ukraine outpacing starbuckss projected growth this year still mr lozitsky is worried that starbucks may make it more difficult for his company to get new sites the cachet of the western brand is a lure to some landlords at one big shopping center in moscow mr lozitsky says the owner "just denied us completely they want starbucks and they are waiting " coffee house is redesigning some of its espresso hued locations to make them more appealing and adding a line of cups thermoses packaged coffee beans and chocolates embossed with the chains emblem to "get prepared for the starbucks invasion " says mr dudakov the chains president hes also trying to teach customers how to use to go cups the preparations havent made much of an impression on irina nikanorova a year old moscow resident she used to visit starbucks almost every day when she lived near one in london starbucks "is much better than this one or the other ones around " the tourist agency worker said while she sat at a coffee house one afternoon drinking a cappuccino and smoking a thin cigarette "its nice especially in the morning when there are croissants " other restaurant operators say that starbuckss western allure may not hold as much sway in russia as elsewhere "the american influence in russia has diminished " says rostislav ordovsky a russian restaurant magnate who operates t g i fridays outlets here the u s "used to be an aspirational place " but because of what he sees as an unfriendly u s government he says russians are now looking more to countries like italy for cultural trends
