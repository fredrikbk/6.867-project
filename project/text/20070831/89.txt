politics &amp economics turkmenistans energy rush vast natural gas stores spur scramble for access by u s russia europe with a new leader flinging open the doors to the outside world the central asian nation of turkmenistan is emerging as a crucible of regional rivalries as russia china the u s and europe compete for access to its vast energy reserves since the death in december of saparmurat niyazov an eccentric and reclusive dictator who charted a fiercely isolationist course for turkmenistan the country has begun to open up unleashing a stampede of western and russian oil and gas men executives from chevron corp royal dutch shell plc total sa bp plc and its russian venture tnk bp have flocked to the capital of ashgabad to meet kurbanguly berdymukhamedov the new president who has reached out to the west in ways his predecessor never did they have been joined by a steady stream of u s officials keen to revive a plan to build a pipeline across the caspian sea that would ship turkmen gas westward bypassing russia and loosening moscows grip on central asias energy riches "theres been a sea change " says atul gupta chief executive of burren energy plc a u k independent that has been producing oil in turkmenistan since "weve got a bit of a great game being played out in turkmenistan now " he added referring to the th century struggle for regional influence between the u k and russia the rush comes amid a global hunt for fresh energy supplies most of the worlds proven energy reserves are in the middle east mostly off limits to foreign investors europe is eager to diversify its supply of natural gas to rely less on russia which has shown its willingness to withhold supply to advance its political agenda so far the race to open up turkmenistans hydrocarbon reserves the country is thought to hold one of the worlds most abundant stores of natural gas is being won by russia and china in may president vladimir putin became the first world leader to visit mr berdymukhamedov in a coup for moscow the two parties agreed to build a new gas pipeline around the caspian sea and northward to russia and to upgrade soviet era infrastructure in central asia that would increase deliveries of turkmen gas to russia to billion cubic meters a year from billion cubic meters a year now russian officials said the deal was a blow to the european union which has long sought to free turkmenistan from moscows grasp there were fears in brussels that the russian deal could undermine the viability of the eus grandiose nabucco pipeline project to bring gas from central asia and iran to turkey and eastern europe yet russia too has suffered setbacks in july mr berdymukhamedov went to beijing and endorsed a plan to build a pipeline from turkmenistan delivering billion cubic meters of gas a year to china he also signed a landmark deal allowing china national petroleum corp to drill for gas in one of turkmenistans most promising fields bagtyyarlyk beijing hopes gas from there will fill the new pipeline the deal was bad news for russias oao gazprom which relies heavily on imports of turkmen gas to offset declines at its own big fields in western siberia and ensure it can meet its long term export commitments to europe despite russian and chinese advances europe and the u s havent given up hope of getting a slice of turkmen gas encouraged by president berdymukhamedov who has said his country has a long term interest in diversifying its export routes u s officials have been visiting ashgabad to talk up the trans caspian gas pipeline idea this month the u s gave azerbaijan a &# million grant for a feasibility study to build oil and gas pipelines across the caspian most observers think the western plan stands little chance against gazprom and the chinese "the trans caspian pipeline needs three things gas markets and finance " says prof jonathan stern director of gas research at the oxford institute for energy studies "at the moment it doesnt have any of them " some analysts wonder whether mr berdymukhamedov has promised too much to too many countries christof van agt an expert on central asia at the international energy agency in paris says turkmenistan would need &# billion in investment every year for the next years to boost output to billion cubic meters by the amount it needs to meet all its export commitments it is forecast to produce billion cubic meters this year "if its going to be able to supply china russia europe india and pakistan as it says it wants to it needs to start moving fast to get this investment in place " he says turkmenistans new leader who was niyazovs dentist and went on to serve for several years as his health minister is already drawing parallels with his predecessor who had a reputation for selling more gas than he could produce still the foreign energy companies keep coming in july mr berdymukhamedov invited chevron executives to discuss developing a big oil field serdar in the turkmen section of the caspian sea geologists have long known about the deposit but big oil shied away from it because it was also claimed by azerbaijan with niyazovs death observers say there is hope the two countries will work out how to share serdar known as kyapaz in azerbaijan hanging over the future of such projects is uncertainty about the precise size of the oil and gas reserves mr niyazov decreed such information a state secret
