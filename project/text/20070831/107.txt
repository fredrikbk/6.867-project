the daily fix from federer to the williams sisters tennis stars turn out for the open online edition buckle up sports fans this week is going to be quite a ride the u s open begins today in new york city but will be competing against a slew of baseball series with postseason implications or at least a lot of spit and vitriol the anaheim angels will battle the seattle mariners the minnesota twins will take on the cleveland indians the boston red sox will visit the new york yankees the milwaukee brewers will face the chicago cubs the new york mets will battle the philadelphia phillies and then the atlanta braves and the san diego padres will face the arizona diamondbacks and then the los angeles dodgers whew in the new york times murray chass writes that "as the baseball executive in charge of the schedule katy feeney is often the target of criticism from clubs and fans who dont like some aspect of the schedule it is only fair then to salute feeney for her efforts for week no of the week season this without any question is her week how did the schedule happen to have all of these matchups at this stage of the season magic feeney said yesterday" regarding tennis in the san francisco chronicle bruce jenkins surveys the mens and womens draws at the u s open with two questions  can anybody derail the next meeting between roger federer chasing his th grand slam title and his nemesis rafael nadal  who set up the womens draw anyway "with federer looming much too soon in both cases andy roddick and james blake arent likely to make a major dent in this tournament " mr jenkins writes "the big story for american mens tennis might be the first week performances of sam querrey and john isner and fans are advised to pay close attention to the points they arent likely to last very long " on the womens side maria sharapova has half the draw seemingly to herself with justine henin serena and venus williams ana ivanovic and jelena jankovic all crammed into the other half "the final may be an anticlimax especially with potential injuries looming over so many of the top women players but dont miss the three rounds before it " mr jenkins advises "after a remarkably drama free set of important matches at the french open and wimbledon flushing meadows is likely to serve up some gems " for more read joel druckers u s open primer on espn com a sample scouting report "jankovics ability to smile after a big point shows a rare perspective but one wonders does she really believe she deserves to be among the very best or does she merely play so much in hopes that the spell doesnt wear off breakdowns in the semis in los angeles versus ana ivanovic and the final in toronto against henin showed traces of tactical and technical rigidity particularly on her too flat forehand and so so second serve goofy candor makes her extremely likeable but maybe a bit of the irrational also is necessary if she is to win big " tonight althea gibson the opens first black champion will get some long overdue recognition at a ceremony inside arthur ashe stadium in the new york daily news filip bondy acknowledges this belated honor but laments that arthur ashe somehow seems missing from the stadium named after him arguing that many of the folks filing in to see the open "have no idea what ashe looked like or even that he was an african american few of them will learn a thing about the man not even his race from their experience at the national tennis center it is a sad irony that the u s tennis association despite the best intentions has badly botched its presentation of this pioneer whose name is everywhere but whose likeness and good deeds are largely absent from the grounds " fix preview michael vick faced the world today said he was sorry and seemed believable his apology sounded genuinely humble and refreshingly nonevasive with none of the grudging subjunctives usually employed by athletes in trouble mr vick apologized to nfl commissioner roger goodell atlanta falcons owner arthur blank his teammates and "all the young kids out there " whom he asked to "use me as an example to use better judgment and make better decisions " he took full responsibility for his actions called dogfighting "a terrible thing " and said "i need to grow up " itll take a lot more than one day of contrition to return mr vick to the nfl but the falcons qb has probably already done more in that regard than many thought he would manage "i will redeem myself " he said "i have to " lots for columnists to mull over tomorrow the fix will be there priest holmes is in training camp with the kansas city chiefs after two years away from the football field a comeback attempt thats been every bit as fascinating and odd as priest holmes himself in the kansas city star joe posnanski considers the latest chapter in the year olds story "ok well lets begin by looking back one more time over priest holmes amazing life so far " mr posnanski writes "youve already heard his story more than once no doubt but to understand you have to feel his story for instance go back to that was the year when holmes while playing for the university of texas blew out his acl that should have ended things holmes was an undersized back to begin with he did not have blazing speed he was not even a starter then he blew out his acl in spring practice thats the time when dreams end and real life begins only holmes went on " and on and on mr posnanski runs down a litany of injuries that would have stopped many players but not mr holmes "it seems ludicrous like the black knight from monty python who keeps fighting even after both of his arms have been cut off " "and how was your weekend " asks michael rosenberg in the detroit free press "the tigers did the usual they beat the yankees at saturday morning after a four hour rain delay watched jeremy bonderman continue his descent from near all star to a guy you watch with your hands covering your eyes lost their starting pitcher and catcher by the fourth inning sunday used five pitchers for at least one inning each of a nine inning game heard joel zumaya who normally throws one of the hardest fastballs ever say its been awhile since i had a strikeout heard gary sheffield their injured designated hitter say he could come back next week but acknowledge he might not come back at all and looked absolutely pathetic against the indianapolis colts oh wait that last one was the lions i should probably add that it was the tigers best weekend in a long time " rick ankiel has been one of the better baseball stories of the summer returning to the st louis cardinals as a power hitting outfielder after a lengthy saga as a pitcher but mr ankiel isnt the first to make the transition from pitcher to hitter and no the fix isnt talking about babe ruth in the los angeles times jerry crowe checks in with bobby darwin a pitcher for the los angeles angels and dodgers in the s who resurrected his career as an outfielder for the minnesota twins in the s mr darwin made the switch while playing for triple a spokane under a manager named tommy lasorda dont miss mr lasordas tale of mr darwins first game as a hitter negro league veteran willie smith also made the switch in the s earlier this month on the st louis post dispatchs bird land blog derrick goold discussed mr smith and other pitchers turned hitters not to close on an andy rooney note but why dont they make nicknames like "the hondo hurricane" anymore tip of the fix cap to reader michelle alessandri found a good column from the world of sports dont keep
