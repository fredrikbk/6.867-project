weekend journal the home front re engineering espresso the complex world of coffee research and the quest for a better shot since the dawn of coffee humanity has taken few breaks in its quest for a better cup our inaugural coffee buzz according to legend came after a shepherd in africa noticed his goats grew frisky after eating the fruit of a certain bush early fanatics took theirs straight chewing whole raw beans then came roasting grinding steeping in water and the skinny white chocolate half caf venti the search continues in september italian roaster illycaffe will introduce a coffee machine in the u s called hyper espresso it pairs a custom machine produced by illy &# to &# for home versions with a coffee filled plastic capsule also made by illy like other single serve systems including nestles nespresso and krafts tassimo its meant to make it easier for groggy consumers or harried waiters to make a serviceable cup but it also represents a departure current one cup setups take the familiar brewing process of an espresso or drip coffee maker and put it inside a disposable disc or cartridge illys system on the other hand tweaks the espresso recipe changing parameters like temperature and pressure that baristas and jittery espresso geeks long considered absolute it also moves illys coffee into eye popping price territory the company figures hyper espresso cartridges will cost home users about cents a shot thats the equivalent of &# a pound of beans compared with say &# for a pound of starbucks italian roast the goal is to position the company for a bigger slice of the market in coffee filled capsules and cartridges illy already makes espresso "pods" for a variety of machines though the single serve segment is a small part of the &# billion u s retail market in whole beans and ground coffee it has grown about a year since to &# million last year according to datamonitor national coffee association of u s a for science nerds or anyone whos tried even briefly to impersonate a roman barista the new system represents some noteworthy physics illy hasnt exactly split the atom but the company that more or less taught the world how to make espresso is now rewriting the rules "illy was doing espresso education before anyone else " says bruce milletto president of the american barista &amp coffee school in portland ore which trains more than baristas and coffee shop owners each year "theres only one way to prepare espresso its chemistry and physics " over the decades illys researchers say they have isolated no fewer than factors from coffee growing to brewing that must be controlled to make one good shot fresh beans must be ground and tamped just so before exposing ounces worth to one ounce of water at degrees fahrenheit give or take three degrees and nine bars of pressure for seconds in a clean machine per favore do so and you get a shot of rich but not bitter espresso topped with a tiger striped layer of coffee foam that italians call crema bungle a step and its how do you say in english swill much of illys thinking occurs in company labs in the hills outside of trieste italy with the aid of some quarter million dollar machines mass spectrometers gas chromatographs researchers there have isolated and analyzed more than volatile compounds that lend espresso its smells says illycaffe chairman andrea illy the companys third generation head and a chemist by training good aromas tend toward chocolate almonds and peaches theres also linalool a jasmine like scent that mr illy calls "the ultimate flowery aroma " undesirables include wood which can signify too high brewing temperatures and green peas a sign of bad beans a few years back the researchers also identified a crisis that legions of coffee drinkers never knew they had with traditional brewing the scientists knew water is forced through a bed of packed coffee grounds as this hot pressurized water percolates through the grounds it picks up emulsified oils bubbles of carbon dioxide water soluble compounds and even tiny bits of coffee bean the result in lay terms is a shot of espresso but having dissected spent espresso pucks the scientists knew that water doesnt percolate evenly through the grounds instead it flows where theres the least resistance like rain running down a hill in rivulets water courses through some grounds while leaving others practically dry to illys ground control team this was the problem not every piece of bean was yielding up its peaches and linalool other parts of the coffee grounds were being flooded thinning the espressos taste so some researchers and engineers undertook what became a four year espresso reinvention "we had coffee geysers " mr illy says the system they came up with works like this hot water goes into a coffee packed capsule instead of merely dripping out the bottom and missing grounds along the way as in old espresso the water stays put pressure builds all of the grounds mr illy says are infused once the pressure inside the hyper espresso capsule hits a certain level a small valve inside it opens illy has taken out international patents on this valve then the coffee spurts out into a second chamber more patents where it bounces against a plastic wall and aerates creating lots of crema for aficionados a thick layer of crema marks a good cup and there it is espresso blasphemy two brewing chambers instead of one in scientific terms the process is no longer percolation but extraction and one more thing because high pressure not hot water is doing much of the work of extracting the desirable stuff from the grounds illy has found it can lower the brewing temperatures of its machines by about five degrees fahrenheit resulting in what it says is a better cup fifty years of espresso rules dio the steps out the window others in the single serve niche are also adding new touches next month nestle whose nespresso machines work at higher pressures than most home espresso makers will roll out lattissima cappuccino and latte machines with a removable milk container that can be kept in a fridge italian roaster lavazza recently introduced a single serve system blue that it says replicates traditional espresso brewing for now it says its for places like offices and restaurants not homes illys machine and capsules will debut in coming weeks in the kitchens of more than a dozen new york restaurants including nobu lever house and the michelin three starred le bernardin other restaurants around the u s will follow illy says the company will offer home machines next spring we saw a couple of hyper espresso machines at illys new york offices admittedly not neutral tasting grounds the hardware was operated by barista heidi rasmussen a quality assurance manager for illy caffe north america before drinking she gave us an espresso tasting primer identifying aromas wed probably notice such as toasted bread and lemon ms rasmussen pulled a few shots of traditional espresso using the companys standard beans freshly ground it tasted mellow and nuanced like maybe it was the power of suggestion toast and lemon the crema was thick we skipped milk or sugar then she made two shots of hyper espresso for one she used a restaurant grade machine modified to take illys capsules for another she used the home hyper espresso machine made by illys francis francis division that the company will introduce next year those shots too were mellow and nuanced we tasted toast and more lemon back at illys labs the scientists say that while hyper espresso is made with the same blend of beans it is empirically different than the traditional stuff thirty seconds after a shot is made hyper espressos crema layer has more volume and more height than a traditional shot they say the crema lasts up to an hour instead of five minutes true enough in our experience and unlike beans brewed in the traditional maker which the white coats found to have more chocolate and toasted bread tastes hyper espresso has more flowery aromas thanks to a boost in compounds like linalool which version a person likes better is a matter of taste mr illy says as for the cost he says its still cheaper than buying a coffee in a cafe the upshot we detected subtle differences between old espresso made by a ringer barista and hyper espresso from a capsule for those without home access to a ringer barista the capsule might do as a stand in the downside for home users is that only illys coffee fits into its machines so owners who tire of illys blend will have to fire up a second coffeemaker for a change of taste or they could wait for coffees next leap forward
