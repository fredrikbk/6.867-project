the doctors office families weigh drugs for attention deficit with school about to start kids are coming in for their physicals and for medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder im seeing more kids each year with symptoms of adhd some just have the attention problems and others are hyperactive too new treatments can be given once a day they are relatively easy for kids to take at home and dont require the involvement of the school nurse during the day as shorter acting older medicines do the medicines are even easier for doctors to prescribe a trial of medication is the quickest and easiest thing to try for kids with symptoms given the limited impact a doctor can have on complex family dynamics it may be too easy an option considering the rising sales of these heavily marketed medications ads for attention deficit medications are everywhere in the popular press where a parent might see them including people good housekeeping and family circle magazines at our house part of the increase in use of the medicines is better awareness of the condition by parents and doctors but critics say we are raising a "ritalin generation " in an effort to leave no child behind were medicating our kids so they can conform enough to pass standardized tests and sit inside for eight hours a day if youre a parent of one of these kids you have a lot to think about kids grow up in an increasingly complex and fast paced environment some find it difficult to navigate without the assistance of medication the medicines are often derivatives of amphetamines with potential unknown long term side effects and were using the medicines at the same time were telling kids to say no to illegal drugs one of my year old patients struggled last year with his schoolwork he was disorganized and often forgot assignments he labored for hours over work that should have taken minutes he had a tough time in school due to his attention problems and lack of focus he had similar trouble in earlier grades and he had not improved as he got older when the workload got heavier he couldnt keep up during the last half of the year his enthusiasm flagged his frustration level was high and he got into fights twice summer couldnt come fast enough my patients concentration at home wasnt much better he couldnt seem to follow through with the most basic chores unless nagged constantly he couldnt keep his baseball equipment together the whole family got used to last minute treasure hunts for his missing cleats ball and glove before every little league game now as he faces fifth grade with even more homework and more difficult material to master his parents came to me looking for some help i prescribed a medicine called concerta he takes it every morning before school but not on the weekends typically rural public schools have limited resources for helping add and adhd kids the schools generally prefer that kids with attention problems or hyperactivity be evaluated and potentially put on medication so theyll fit into a regular classroom i rely on reports from teachers to help get a handle on a patients symptoms and then adjust medication some kids do have attention deficit problems but some problems stem from sleep disorders enlarged tonsils caused one year old girls troubles the swollen tonsils blocked her airway during sleep and caused her cranky and inattentive behavior at school taking out the tonsils and restoring a normal pattern of sleep cured her stress at home can mimic add adhd one boy with an alcoholic father and a mother with generalized anxiety disorder only improved after they divorced his problems were mainly a reflection of his parents and their home life its often a hard decision for parents to put their kids on medication one family opted to have their son repeat fifth grade rather than put him on medication for add though i dont think that was necessarily the best approach denial of the problem is common despite the controversy about the rising use of adhd medications in children they do have a place in preventing school failure and reducing risky behaviors the problems dont necessarily go away just because a student graduates from one grade to the next untreated teens and young adults with these disorders have a higher rate of car accidents unintended pregnancy and drug use many adults have untreated symptoms and dont know there is effective treatment ive had more than one parent of an add child walk off and leave a purse or a set of car keys behind in the exam room these parents often forget appointments show up on the wrong day or forget to bring the notes from the childs teacher along so far my year old patient is doing well in fifth grade the best part is that his college educated parents are still able to keep up with his math its still early in the year due to his schedule and the volume of email he receives dr brewer may not be able to respond to all reader email he does participate in his forum where readers are urged to post his email address is thedoctorsoffice wsj com
