politics &amp economics paul grabs attention of alienated voters web helps to amplify presidential campaign of iconoclastic texan computer engineer jonathan morey says "i have never voted for a republican ever " nathan hansen a lawyer says "ive been a republican all my life " yet a political meeting in st paul minn brought the year old friends together for the first time in support of presidential candidate ron paul officially mr paul is a republican elected to congress times and now running for the partys presidential nomination but the party label hardly describes the obstetrician from south of houston and it certainly doesnt explain his appeal to a growing if still small number of voters across the political spectrum many of them much younger than their spry year old idol the iconoclastic "dr paul" is a libertarian advocate of minimalist government a foe of the federal reserve and anything else not explicitly allowed by the constitution and perhaps the most antiwar candidate in the race thanks to the unprecedented number of early debates he has been able to share the stage with his better funded republican establishment rivals but it is the internet that has amplified his message and introduced mr paul to voters alienated from both parties his rise though modest is testament as well to the power of his noninterventionist message even in a party led by president bush as polls track the publics disaffection political strategists are on alert for a third party movement paulites insist their man can win the republican nomination though he has gone from zero to just in polls if he cant their fervor suggests they would push him to run independently but having run as a libertarian in when he took just of the vote mr paul has discouraged such speculation the web "is redefining what a grass roots campaign looks like " says mr morey the computer engineer more than other candidates fans paul supporters take matters into their own hands planning events and raising money in a decentralized process that parallels mr pauls vision of what government should be aside from his own web site there are free lancers dailypaul com and ronpaullibrary org "the worlds largest collection of writings by ron paul" among others myspace "friends" groups and youtube video sharing it has meant &# million to mr paul making him fourth among eight republicans in fund raising and first among the five dark horses in cash on hand but the netroots bottom up energy poses challenges too for a campaign trying to channel if not control it "were running a campaign and wed like to think we know what were doing " says deputy campaign manager joe seehusen "and then theres this thing called the internet and that has a life of its own " messrs morey and hansen met late last spring at a local paul gathering they had learned of through meetup com such social networking web sites have become an organizing and fund raising tool for other campaigns but they are particularly valuable for shoe string operations such as mr pauls the men recall about people at that meeting a number that grew at subsequent gatherings to more than before members began breaking into subchapters the pair still occasionally attend minneapolis area gatherings but mostly they have taken to acting independently though from different parties they got behind mr paul for similar reasons they share his stands against what they see as an illegal war erosion of individual rights and a government that is too big secretive and corrupt mr morey who bikes to work in t shirts he emblazoned "who is ron paul " drove alone to iowa in june after learning online that mr paul was being excluded from a republican debate co sponsored by the iowa christian alliance and iowans for tax relief organizers said mr paul didnt have enough support in des moines mr morey joined about others responding to online alerts outnumbering the debate audience they marched past shouting "ron paul freedom " and drew sympathetic media attention statewide in early august on a lark messrs morey and hansen drove south to iowa state university for state republicans straw poll a traditional barometer of candidate strength in the state with the first nominating contest the decisions of former new york mayor rudy giuliani arizona sen john mccain and former tennessee sen fred thompson not to actively campaign for the poll raised the stakes for underdogs like mr paul rivals especially wealthy former massachusetts gov mitt romney bought thousands of the &# tickets that supporters need to vote paulites launched "adopt an iowan" online and raised more than &# for tickets while mr romney had buses hotel rooms and meals for his supporters messrs hansen and morey came at their own expense as did hundreds of others from as far as new york nashville tenn and seattle even though only iowans could vote arriving on the friday before the straw poll the two headed to a live music club on the campus for "ronstock" paulites woodstock of local bands though the men were too late to catch mr pauls brief appearance mr paul punctuated his stump speech "regardless of what happens the fight continues" for "national sovereignty and to defend our constitution" by urging supporters to have fun on saturday messrs morey and hansen pulled into a parking lot alongside romney buses as mostly older passengers marched off in line behind romney aides holding "follow me" signs the two men chuckled at the contrast with the free thinking free lancing paulites the iowa republican party rented space to candidates mr paul had one of the smaller most isolated locations but his tent was among the most crowded despite scorching heat unsure how to help the friends drove to a sams club and spent &# on bottled water they walked around with a cooler in their "who is ron paul " t shirts doling out bottles to parched republicans that night long after most people left scores of paulites stayed for the straw poll results mr paul was fifth of candidates with nearly twice the tally of absentees mccain giuliani and thompson combined on aug the men learned from a meetup group of a minnesota straw poll sponsored by republican state legislators for &# a ticket to be held that night "i was a little hesitant to go and spend a hundred bucks " mr morey said "but id driven all the way to iowa for a straw poll so " they joined roughly voters he said and mr paul came in third with behind mr thompsons and mr romneys mr paul has placed high at a series of local party straw polls this summer given such self motivated fans and has high hopes for tomorrows republican straw poll in his home state messrs morey and hansen insist mr paul "absolutely" has a shot at election mr morey says he used to lose sleep thinking of the countrys problems "now i sleep fine at night " he says "because im taking action "
