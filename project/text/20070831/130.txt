time waster with lolcats internet fad anyone can get in on the joke online edition eric nakagawa was between jobs last january when he came across a funny picture while surfing the web a high strung cat with an open maw making a garbled request for a cheeseburger mr nakagawa couldnt really say why he found the picture so funny he passed the digital photo to a friend and on a whim they created the web site "i can has cheezburger " borrowing from the caption something about the strange image or syntax struck a chord with readers "we started getting hits " he said in a phone interview from his home in hawaii "i was shocked " he shouldnt have been the out of work computer programmer had stumbled on to one of the bigger inside jokes on the internet and at the same time stumbled into his next job mr nakagawas simple web site has become the center of the "lolcats" phenomenon a booming online subculture built around digital images and deliberately bad grammar theres not much to it take a digital photo often one of household pets particularly cats and purposefully place misspelled text on top anyone with elementary skills in adobes photoshop or microsofts paint software can make their own nearly nine months after launching icanhascheezburger com mr nakagawas site receives around unique visitors and a half million page views each day according to mr nakagawa visitors can browse a sprawling gallery of lolcats vote for their favorites and post comments mr nakagawa says he receives up to submissions a day thanks in no small part to his sites tool that helps people build their own he says every entry is screened for merit and originality before earning inclusion only or so submissions make the gallery a day "its ridiculous " mr nakagawa admits "but we do go through all of them " he certainly has the time revenue from ads on the site is "more than enough to pay my bills " a lesson in lolcats its possible to use the internet every day and never encounter a lolcat here for beginners is an archetypal example if lolcats were jazz music the refrigerator invading cat would be a standard an example of the art form that every practitioner is assumed to recognize and understand and much like a well known melody the "in ur " phrasing is a recurring source of riffs and references within the lolcat community thus the fridge setting is changed to an office environment before long the "in ur" set up is applied to schrodingers cat a paradox used to illustrate quantum mechanics despite its impressive viral spread and apparent staying power the lolcat fad is just the latest online thing to make people laugh itd be tough for even the most dour person to keep a straight face when confronted with a walrus and bucket example which has spawned an offshoot genre of its own known as "lolrus " what makes lolcats appealing is that its simultaneously obscure and accessible its an inside joke told in an online lingua franca but with a bit of effort anyone can become an insider "an in joke used to be constrained by geography and who you knew socially " says anil dash occasional lolcat critic and vice president of six apart which creates several popular blog software programs "this is a very large in joke" that blurs the old distinction "between net geeks and the normals " he says an essay on mr dashs blog in which he analyzes what he terms "kitty pidgin" the misspelled and mixed up phrases used in lolcat captions has been read over a million times since april he says beyond its idiosyncratic grammar the lolcats fad has also helped popularize oddball online expressions like "oh hai " what helps give lolcats staying power is that the in joke evolves freely "people respond to each others efforts what succeeds and is funny inspires the next round " mr dash says there arent just cats dogs rabbits and other animals speaking in broken english but presidents star trek characters and rappers scott beale who writes the blog "laughing squid " created a helpful taxonomy of the many lolcat offshoots this image for example plays on the viewers familiarity with the classic walrus example to make a joke about teddy roosevelt another common lolcat caption trope is to declare some object invisible as if its been erased from the photo and familiarity with the invisible gag as well as the classical precepts of capitalism makes this otherwise unremarkable image of the economist adam smith taken from a "lolphilosophers" pool on flickr much more what may ultimately keep lolcats from expiring as a meme is the pictures themselves have widespread appeal "those ladies who work at the reception desk in your office they might be sharing these lolcats with their friends " says david mcraney a year old from mississippi who has written an interesting lolcats history "and some of these references maybe they dont really get it but it doesnt matter im in ur fridge eatin your foodz is funny to everyone even if you dont get the reference "
