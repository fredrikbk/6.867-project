for the e mail here the dog days of early august may seem another era before long known pitfalls of mortgage derivatives gained urgency by driving billions of dollars out of stocks and anything deemed risky and credit seemed to dry up but minutes from the federal reserves aug meeting show this isnt the case the fed was already wary of market fallout and the minutes give clear signs about what policymakers will watch for ahead of their next meeting since their previous meeting in june financial markets had become more volatile members of the policy making federal open market committee observed using terms that would feature in front page headlines in the weeks that followed investors seemed to be seeking shelter in low risk treasurys conditions were deteriorating sharply for subprime mortgages and the investment instruments tied to them affecting even the asset backed commercial paper market financial firms shares were falling on concerns about their exposure and credit was tightening for speculative grade corporate borrowers one big difference with what was to come "investment grade businesses and prime households were relatively little affected by the market turbulence " the feds staff had lowered its forecasts for economic growth a bit but this was partly due to technical reasons and left unchanged were predictions for "resource utilization" how much the economy is using the available work force and infrastructure which to the fed is a potential source of inflation worries recent easing of the feds preferred inflation gauge the core personal consumption expenditures index or pce caused the staff to lower its pce predictions for the second half of this year but not for because of slower growth in productivity and the prospect of greater pressure from import prices and reasons for the downgrade were seen as partly transitory the housing market remained the biggest source of growth worry but committee members felt mortgage loans were readily available to most potential buyers and that lower interest rates on conventional loans would help support the housing market moreover while the declining housing market was widely seen as a problem for consumer spending with much less home equity available to fuel spending sprees they saw a sizeable upward revision in personal savings rates of the past three years suggesting "less need for households to rebuild their savings " thus the committee still considered likely moderate economic expansion supported by solid job gains rising real incomes and increased foreign demand for u s goods "recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic growth " they observed but "members expected a return to more normal market conditions" even as they "recognized that the process likely would take some time particularly in markets related to subprime mortgages " inflation thus remained the most significant policy concern with any consideration of lower interest rates kept on the shelf and yet "a further deterioration in financial conditions could not be ruled out and to the extent such a development could have an adverse effect on growth prospects might require a policy response " ten days later with markets tumbling around the world amid a credit freeze a policy response came though the fed turned to the discount rate for the feds loans to banks rather than the influential fed funds rate essentially it was a liquidity easing move rather than a lowering of the cost for borrowed money and it hasnt stopped the clamoring for more significant fed action what next before the fomc meets on sept it will get some key data to digest and some of it very much a part of the aug discussion the commerce department will report on personal income for july on friday and this will give the fed information on both the direction of personal savings and the pce index on sept it will get the labor departments second quarter productivity report and a day later the august employment report which could offer some of the first hard data on how the market tumult is affecting a tight labor market then on sept the import price index for august will offer more hints about inflation and the feds own industrial production report for this month will provide the latest look at u s output and the important question of resource utilization short of another big crisis these reports more than the markets will likely tell us what the fed will do the big three uaw scrum as summer labor talks between the big three automakers and the united auto workers enter a critical phrase general motors ford motor and the newly independent chrysler are "competing intensely to be picked as the lead company to negotiate a pattern setting agreement " the detroit news reports the deal which could make revolutionary changes to how autoworkers are compensated will also address the companies specific competitive needs and they all want first crack "but uaw president ron gettelfinger has yet to tip his hand on which company will go first or even if the union will choose a front runner for in depth negotiations " the paper says meanwhile chrysler now controlled by private equity firm cerberus capital management may follow gm and ford in getting rid of its noncore assets the wall street journal reports it proposed to the uaw that it shut down or sell its mopar parts making unit and the plant delivery operations of chrysler transport people familiar with the matter tell the journal but the uaw opposes both divestitures goodbye to the
