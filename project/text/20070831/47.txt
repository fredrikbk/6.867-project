finale for fidel castro gets buried in rumors again but reports of his death are greatly exaggerated perez hiltons fake news if its friday fidel castro must be dead again for the past two fridays miamis cuban american community has been swept up by waves of rumors that mr castro is either dead or on his deathbed last week some parents anticipating huge celebrations pulled their children out of school early calls from anxious cuban americans seeking confirmation of fidels death flooded the miami police the mayors office the coast guard and the state department as the fake intelligence spread reporters around the country tried to confirm the story while some bloggers printed premature death notices celebrity blogger perez hilton a cuban american whose popular blog usually deals with the changing fortunes of britney spears and the like ran pictures on his web site suggesting mr castro was a goner one had the word "dead" written across his forehead another had a big x over his face mr hilton also announced online that miami police had mobilized to deal with the crowds of people expected to flood the streets a report which proved to be false mr hilton whose real name is mario lavandeira could not be reached for comment almost five decades after mr castro took power in havana and a little over a year after he underwent emergency abdominal surgery the recurrent rumors of the communist dictators demise are proof of the enormous hold he retains on the psyche and imagination of cuban exiles the death reports also reflect the paucity of information surrounding his health which remains a state secret in cuba the information void has given rise to outlandish claims a caller to miamis spanish language radio mambi said a relative on the island had reported there had not been any flowers available anywhere in havana for two weeks proof positive that the cuban government was hoarding blossoms for a massive state funeral another caller said that two egyptian embalmers were en route to havana charged with the mission of preserving mr castros body a third caller said the embalmers were russians "i said why russians they did such a bad job on lenin who looks green " says ninoska perez castellon popular host of the talk show "ninoska en mambi " "it was nonstop it was nuts my telephone battery died " one of ms perez castellons listeners phoned in to say he had confidential information from swiss banking sources that mr castros death had already sparked a family fight for control of various bank accounts he is alleged to hold mr castro years old may well be headed for the great beyond although rambling articles on everything from sports to u s politics are still published under his signature he has declared that a presidential ticket of sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama would be "seemingly invincible" the bearded dictator hasnt been seen in public in more than a year his last "appearance" on cuban television was june part of a prerecorded program earlier this month mr castros niece mariela a havana sex therapist said that cubans collective anxiety about living without mr castro "was drawing closer " on aug mr castros birthday the well respected mexican newspaper reforma cited castro family confidants as saying that he had suffered a medical setback requiring more operations and that he was no longer receiving visitors and on saturday venezuelan president hugo chavez a close ally said fidel was alive but in terms that seemed more like a eulogy than any reassurance of his health "fidel castro will never die " mr chavez said during a speech "he will always live among people who fight for a better destiny " then again mr castro could be getting ready to outfox those who have counted him out before last year u s government officials said mr castro appeared to have terminal cancer this time around the state department has hinted that cuba may have rigged its own propaganda campaign in hopes of whipping up emotional cuban refugees "i would say that the cuban government has always been very good at stirring the nest whenever they felt a need to " said state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos on monday he added that he had no reason to believe mr castro had died cuban officials said mr castro was continuing to recover other theories abound a widely read cuban american blogger believes wall streeters may be to blame for the rumors "i learned about the hogwild market activity in cuban funds before i learned about the dead castro rumors which always makes these funds go up " wrote the blogger known as mora on the babalu blog "there may be some crooks looking to make tremendous fortunes " no one has yet to offer an explanation as to why the death chatter heats up on fridays nicknamed "el caballo " or the horse mr castro has always been known for his physical stamina he is said to visit a special oxygenation chamber for energy boosts one of his doctors eugenio selman leads a research project known as the year club whose aim is to boost human longevity dr selman has told reporters that mr castro is a charter member but for the past decade or so speculation about mr castros health has intensified "ive never seen anything like this " says brian latell a retired longtime fidel watcher for the central intelligence agency buzz about the old caudillos failing state ramped up after he fainted while giving a speech before thousands of cubans in rumors spiked again in when he tripped and broke his knee and arm during another address since then mr castro has denied reports by the cia that he suffers from parkinsons disease hes joked that the agency which in the s targeted him for assassination is still trying to kill him off when mr castro finally goes miami does have a plan to declare a state of alert known as "alpha bravo " calling in all police hands to deal with what the city predicts will be a big party part of the plan calls for securing the area around the landmark versailles restaurant a nerve center of cuban american life located in little havanas main avenue after mr castro took ill last year jubilant cuban americans gathered on the street outside versailles for most of the night the coast guard will also be on alert to prevent a flotilla of cuban americans from leaving the u s to pick up relatives and to stop any exodus of cuban boat people miami police chief john f timoney says he first got wind of last weeks rumors late wednesday night from the local office of the fbi the next day miami mayor manny diaz called the police chief after hearing on television that the citys police forces were on emergency footing other local police departments called him as well mr timoney who has been in miami for five years says the citys cops never did go on a special alert
