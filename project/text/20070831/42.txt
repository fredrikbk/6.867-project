central detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox al west anaheim not of los angeles oakland texas seattle nl east new york mets philadelphia atlanta florida nl central st louis chicago cubs milwaukee houston cincinnati nl west los angeles san diego arizona san francisco colorado about bostons sustained success alex belth writes "the luckiest man in baseball might be j d drew for a guy who has been intensely booed during the course of his career hes got to be thankful that the red sox are playing so well if they werent in first place hed be in line for a boston baked beatdown hes got seven home runs no boston rightfielder has hit fewer than since " jon bois the tigers and indians are pretty even talent wise and both teams are well managed i believe that either the yankees or red sox will claim the wild card so detroit and cleveland will have no safety net below them this might make the al central race the most interesting in baseball seattle has been giving los angeles of anaheim some serious competition in the al west but the mariners possess inferior pitching and inferior hitting plus theyre only from one city how can they expect to contend the nl easts mets braves phillies race is going to be fun i have no difficulty envisioning any of those three teams or even two of those three reaching the playoffs the braves deadline trade for mark teixeira is one of the most significant that baseball has seen in years but atlantas fourth and fifth starters are killing them trotting out jo jo reyes era lance cormier or buddy carlyle is just not going to work especially if they keep getting pulled after three or four innings the braves need to continue winning against the mets and pray that the phillies terrible pitching eventually sinks them if atlanta can somehow get themselves into the playoffs they can revert to a three man rotation of john smoltz tim hudson and chuck james which will give them a serious shot at the nl crown wait a minute i think i just called the braves a better playoff team than a regular season team i need to re think this as i write this every other division in baseball has a second place team with an equal or better record than the nl centrals first place cubs i find st louis the most interesting team in the division because a theyre platooning like mad and b rick ankiel id really really like to see that guy in the playoffs again the cardinals arent "for real " but neither is anyone else in that god forsaken division the diamondbacks are going to give up their division lead and miss the playoffs in the last years teams have reached the playoffs and only two the padres and giants allowed more runs than they scored during the regular season even if the d backs make it theyll be worthless in the postseason both of those teams were swept in the first round larry borowsky irony watch failed pitcher rick ankiel returns to the majors as an outfielder and the cardinals pitchers suddenly catch fire between his recall on august and last saturday the tattered st louis staff has posted a era and held opponents to a batting average vs a era and average previously if the cardinals do manage to flag down the cubs and win the central mark down august as the turning point carlos zambrano threw three perfect innings vs the cardinals that night and looked like he could have gone unscathed for another six or or but the rains came and washed out the game a cubs win would have been their third straight over the cards and would have pushed st louis games back instead the cards beat the cubs the next day to stay within games id love to see the rockies get into the playoffs and do well by pythagorean record theyre the second best team in the west behind the padres and the fourth best in the nl they have the best left handed pitcher youve never heard of jeff francis the best unsung slugger matt holliday and the most underappreciated rookie troy tulowitzki over their final games the rockies will play the teams theyre chasing times i hope the ball bounces their way through july the day ben sheets got hurt the brewers had a team era and were games over from that date through saturday their era is and theyre nine games under it has been a staff wide collapse the rotation has posted a era over that span the bullpen nick dallamora am i the only person who isnt clinging to the edge of my seat watching the nl central granted the cubs pitching has been stellar this year but im just not going to spend too much time talking about ball completely unrelated to my houston pick none of these teams the cardinals included could do much damage in the postseason i dont think the al wild card race is as exciting as everyone is making it out to be either who would have thought that the yankees would score runs and be a prominent team in the playoff picture well uh everyone thats why you saw talking neckties on espn saying "the yankees are done their season is over " every day for a week straight in june now its shocking and interesting that the all star team is making a run at the big show boston came to town on tuesday but seattle has a series with the angels so that keeps the waters relatively steady for the time being after that i give the mariners a few days of wild card reign whereupon the yankees will develop a strategy to score runs on defense i had said previously that the tigers were going to run away with the al central but this is easily one of the best races going right now the indians have my bid as the fan favorite going into the stretch but unless you get to start voting for runs in a game i dont think theyll matter much arizona taking control of the nl west is a pretty big surprise but i cant see san diego letting that happen for too much longer the padres run production is low but the diamondbacks at second worst in the league is even lower their pitching is obviously worse and its not going to catch up anytime within the next five years sorry d backs but the partys over will leitch are the cards for real they are in a sense that if their pitching holds up they can be the best team in the nl central but im not sure its gonna hold up and besides the best team in the nl central isnt all that much of a prize anyway well actually yeah it is a prize last year tells us it can be a rather awesome prize people can laugh all they want but seriously when you win the world series youll never remember how many games your team won trust me bitter met fan editors note not to steal sheehans thunder here but i love the diamondbacks statistical analysis is great but teams like arizona remind me of when i was a kid and i didnt know anything about pythagorean theorems and win shares i just knew my team was winning and i didnt know or care why enjoy it arizona joe sheehan as i write this with a few games to go on august i count teams within five games of a playoff spot and with about of the schedule left to be played thats an enormous about of parity and if its in part because there are no great teams its the same thing that makes people get wet over the nfl so where is the effusive praise why do the same people who love it when the packers have a chance at the playoffs with two weeks left not sing songs about this season because baseball celebrates greatness not mediocrity these races are interesting and fun and entertaining but theyre not great is great this is something else anyway i might end up picking five of six division winners missing only the yankees but i dont think that means much the mariners and diamondbacks arent nearly as good as their records its also possible ill only pick two of eight playoff teams thats how close things are the best teams in baseball right now are in order the angels red sox yankees cubs and mets  which two teams will win the wild cards each al boston new york yankees cleveland detroit minnesota chicago white sox toronto anaheim oakland baltimore tampa bay nl philadelphia new york mets atlanta los angeles san diego st louis chicago cubs milwaukee arizona houston florida colorado pittsburgh san francisco in each of the last five years at least one wild card team made it to the world series this year readers think their pick for the al wild card will win the league championship while think the same about the nl wild card kansas city and washington are the only teams chosen by no one to make the playoffs the mariners and yankees are tied in the al the diamondbacks and padres in the nl both are also tied for the nl west lead and therefore in line for a playoff spot just two readers picked the mariners to win the al west and no one picked them to win the wild card  which two teams will go to the world series each al new york yankees boston anaheim detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox oakland toronto baltimore nl los angeles new york mets philadelphia st louis atlanta chicago cubs milwaukee san diego arizona san francisco cincinnati houston florida the top four al picks are all in the thick of playoff races the dodgers remain in the nl west race and just three and a half games out of the wild card spot  which team will win the world series new york yankees boston new york mets detroit los angeles anaheim minnesota chicago cubs cleveland philadelphia atlanta milwaukee oakland san francisco st louis san diego arizona baltimore chicago white sox houston every team with five or more votes has a winning record belth one thing is for sure there will be at least two very good american league teams who dont make the postseason bois the discrepancy in quality between the american league and national league seems to be widening further there are three teams in the al yankees red sox angels that could beat the nls best team mets looking further down the line there are probably three more al teams indians tigers mariners that could beat the nls second best team a pitching machine and eight sacks of cornmeal leitch the al is better than the nl and as we know in the world series that doesnt really mean much  which team will have the best regular season record new york yankees boston new york mets anaheim detroit philadelphia st louis cleveland los angeles oakland atlanta chicago white sox minnesota san diego houston  which team will have the worst regular season record washington kansas city tampa bay pittsburgh baltimore colorado seattle cincinnati florida the devil rays have opened up a big lead with nine mediocre teams fighting it out for the more exciting second worst race sheehan i had the nationals as the worst team in baseball losing games and manager manny acta has them closing in on wins that would be amazing given his roster who knew the white sox could be the worst team in baseball  who will win the al and nl cy young awards each al johan santana roy halladay daisuke matsuzaka rich harden c c sabathia jeremy bonderman john lackey mariano rivera josh beckett andy pettitte erik bedard bartolo colon kei igawa kevin millwood jonathan papelbon francisco rodriguez curt schilling justin verlander chien ming wang nl roy oswalt carlos zambrano ben sheets jake peavy chris carpenter barry zito brett myers jason schmidt brandon webb dontrelle willis john smoltz chris young tim hudson randy johnson derek lowe pedro martinez bronson arroyo matt cain zach duke cole hamels chuck james anthony reyes in a lone bright spot of oaklands dismal season dan haren has excelled he and anaheims kelvim escobar who is enjoying a career year are a step ahead of johan santana and erik bedard western division pitchers are also dominating the nl where jake peavy beats out padre teammate chris young on the strength of a more complete season and edges brad penny and red hot brandon webb belth erik bedard has been tremendous this summer and hes going to make a run for the cy young i read something interesting about him earlier in the week unfortunately i cant recall where in his most recent outing against the yankees bedard was pitching to derek jeter and jeter swung at a one strike fastball that was high and out of the strike zone later a scout said the reason batters will swing at those kinds of pitches is simply because they dread going to two strikes vs bedard where he is deadly kind of like ron guidry was except bedards breaking ball is more of a curve than a slider  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each al alex rodriguez david ortiz grady sizemore vladimir guerrero derek jeter travis hafner joe mauer manny ramirez mark teixeira robinson cano justin morneau ivan rodriguez gary sheffield vernon wells michael young bobby abreu johnny damon carlos guillen nick markakis hideki matsui johan santana jim thome kevin youkilis nl albert pujols ryan howard alfonso soriano david wright chase utley carlos beltran lance berkman nomar garciaparra jose reyes miguel cabrera andruw jones derrek lee aramis ramirez jason bay barry bonds carlos delgado adam dunn bill hall chipper jones carlos lee jimmy rollins for a trio of al candidates their respective cases rest in part on whether their teams make the postseason if the yankees make the playoffs alex rodriguez who leads the league in homers and runs batted in should win his second mvp in three seasons if the tigers make it and the yanks dont magglio ordonez will probably win thanks in part to his majors leading batting average ichiro suzuki has a shot if the mariners hang on to the wild card spot in the weaker nl field albert pujols has gotten hot along with his cardinals and could contend if the diamondbacks hold on in the nl west eric byrnes deserves a look the mets david wright and jose reyes will split votes bois im looking at the mvp predictions that were posted here in april andruw jones and jermaine dye and i just realized i made a terrible mistake due to a file naming mishap i accidentally sent the daily fix my preseason predictions from years ago when i was a spry years old in a related manner i also mistakenly sent a picture i drew of fred mcgriff high fiving sonic the hedgehog please do not post this while a rod is still a lock for the american league mvp the national league race is a little tougher to call if the season ended right now id have to award it to prince fielder but give me a break when i was he was best known for crashing through an outfield fence in an mtv rock n jock softball game belth the al mvp race is essentially a two man contest david ortiz has been wonderful again though his slugging has dipped due to injuries ichiro is having a nice season and jorge posada is in the process of having the best season ever by a year old catcher but the race is between alex rodriguez and magglio ordonez it seems like it is rodriguezs to lose but ordonez is nipping at his heels ordonez has the better average and on base percentage and more doubles rodriguez leads in slugging homers rbi and runs their numbers really are very close so the award will go to the guy who a has a better september or b the guy whose team comes closest to reaching the post season the nl mvp debate is more interesting especially when you consider the fact that hanley ramirez and miguel cabrera are leading the league in vorp but considering the fact that they play on a lousy team you know they wont garner much mvp attention next on the vorp list comes david wright chipper jones and albert pujols that said prince fielder is the popular choice chase utley would have been a likely vote getter if he hadnt been hurt i like jones having a great year but right now my vote would go to wright leitch you know if pujols could get hot in the last month and a half and send the cards to the division title its wide open enough that he would win it not that either of those will happen sheehan a rod and field hanley ramirez maybe david wright as a sleeper pujols too  who will win the al and nl rookie of the year awards each al daisuke matsuzaka alex gordon

matt morris who is making slightly more than &# million this year was dealt by the giants to the pirates in a surprise move mark teixeira making &# million has had the biggest impact on his new team hitting home runs and batting in games since the rangers dealt him to the braves dallamora the mark teixeira trade really wasnt going through my head at the beginning of the season i like the rangers but its hard to see what theyre doing i think that maybe by freeing up his contract they may be planning on trying to develop some sort of pitching staff maybe kevin millwood has been an absolute bust so a few steps backward were definitely in order if they make another move this offseason i can see a decent signing landing them back into contention in the al west  starting pitchers greg maddux

increase the average so far is runs per game down from last year but up from runs the first time we checked in on the contest and runs the second time dallamora i really hadnt noticed how out of

will have only one all star counting those who are on the active roster for the game and those who are chosen but skip it for each team you get correct washington kansas city pittsburgh tampa bay

playing another year at this rate hell finish with home runs and enough rbi to make it worth putting him out on the field even if the team is really just looking to spike ticket sales as much as i hate the guy i dont want him to retire yet i have this sort of fixation with making it to games where my least favorite players are playing so i can boo them until my throat bleeds ask sammy sosa who
