and took no questions at a midday press conference president bush reiterated his support for mr gonzales "its sad that we live in a time when a talented and honorable person like alberto gonzales is impeded from doing important work because his good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons " mr gonzales told mr bush on friday that he intended to leave his post and then formally
