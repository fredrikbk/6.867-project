industrial strategy turning managers into takeover artists how conglomerate itw mints new deal makers to fuel its expansion last july illinois tool works inc bought bagco inc a maker of reclosable plastic bags in kennesaw ga for about &# million it was itws th acquisition in but it was john stevenss first ever mr stevens a year old mechanical engineer with a soft southern drawl has spent most of his career in the gritty world of plastics manufacturing now as his fast growing company faces ever more pressure to acquire hes become one of the newest foot soldiers in its expanding takeover army many nights the onetime plant manager sits at his dining room table in new braunfels texas drinking diet dr pepper and poring over financial statements of potential targets around the world he has learned the rules for haggling in china he no longer feels "like a horse with blinders on " he says never seeing his businesss big picture now he says "i feel like my heads on more of a swivel looking in all directions " itw based in glenview ill has been acquiring companies nearly nonstop for years and its business model depends on its blistering purchasing pace the conglomerate which started as a toolmaker has nearly tripled its size in the past decade to business units world wide its stock has far outperformed the s&amp p during that time and its annual revenue has reached &# billion most of itws acquisitions are small low margin and industrial among its products are screws auto parts deli slicers and the plastic rings that hold together soft drink cans as well as devices to vary the speed of windshield wipers and to measure the breaking point of toothbrushes itw boosts its bottom line by remaking the profit margins of each company it buys focusing narrowly on its most lucrative products and customers in an unusually strict application of a business school concept known as in the past two decades the companys earnings have grown at a compound annual rate of but around this little known takeover machine hit a slump potential targets were valuing themselves highly despite a recession and then the rise of private equity firms trolling for acquisitions drove prices higher itw couldnt find enough companies to buy at a price it wanted to pay the conglomerate had never had a mergers and acquisitions department instead counting on its executives and other managers to initiate deal making now it decided to decentralize further by turning hundreds more managers like mr stevens into takeover specialists "we werent necessarily banging on doors as we should have " says david speer then president and now ceo and chairman "it was a question of getting people trained and re energized " the companys goal is to have more than business units in the next four to five years with of their sales overseas up from today itw is "probably the single best company in the world at optimizing small manufacturing operations " says robert mccarthy an analyst with robert w baird who has covered the company since but "part of the story today is what have you done for me lately " he said the company may one day need to split itself up to keep growing thats what conglomerate tyco international ltd is doing after buying hundreds of companies over several years tycos spree ended with the company admitting accounting lapses that magnified its earnings and declaring a whopping &# billion loss in fiscal stoking growth through serial takeovers can turn perilous when attractive prey become scarce unless the revenue of each acquisition also rises growing by acquisition may not be sustainable steven kaplan a professor of finance at the university of chicago said itw is known for its ability to integrate new purchases but added "at what point do you get too big to do that successfully " itw officials and some analysts who follow them say the company is insulated from those risks because most of its purchases are small at under &# million cheap at times annual earnings or less and complement its existing business "people used to always chide us for not being like tyco you need to acquire faster you need to make bigger deals " john brooklier itws vice president of investor relations said by email "after tyco blew up many investors told us thank goodness you didnt listen to us and stuck to your long term operating model " two years ago top itw executives began giving two day acquisition workshops at headquarters for business unit managers so far about people with backgrounds in everything from production lines to sales have been trained last year the company emerged from a period of relatively flat acquisition activity to establish a new record for the firm purchases with a combined value of about &# billion doug marciniak who joined itw as an internal auditor at its headquarters in and now manages an auto parts maker went through the training last february months later he negotiated the purchase of a korean automotive supplier fielding evening conference calls to hammer out the deal in his basement home office lined with autographed chicago cubs bats and balls mike zimmerman was in sales and marketing before he was promoted to manage an itw company that makes chemicals for the automotive industry also trained last february mr zimmerman spends at least half a day each week pitching business owners on deals though none have developed yet "you cannot be shy about this " he says in his opening pitch he tells prospective targets "were itw we make acquisitions " itw had unusual beginnings in four businessmen were brought together by a newspaper advertisement taken out by a chicago financier he wanted to invest in a manufacturing company and eventually install his son as president the venture first made metal cutting tools but over the years itw expanded into truck transmissions and pumps filters fasteners for the construction industry plastics electric switches and other industrial components in the s one of its engineers developed a plastic ring carrier for six packs of soft drink cans by itw which then ran about business units saw its margins squeezed amid a retrenching in the u s auto industry and increasingly stiff competition from japanese manufacturers john nichols then the new ceo ramped up acquisitions and gradually turned to the strategy the concept derives from the pareto principle named for a th century italian economist who observed that of italys population earned of the income for itw it means focusing on the or so of products and customers that can generate of a business units revenues itw first applied the idea to some of its assembly plants where production lines had to frequently be reset to make a wide variety of products losing time and money the company simplified the production lines to concentrate on the most important items that worked so well that mr nichols had other departments apply the principle says james farrell who took over from mr nichols as chief executive in the concept now is so integral to itws business model that its managers use " " as a verb when itw acquires a company and revamps it along lines it often shrinks revenue initially but typically doubles its profit margin in three to five years over time the company often reduces staff at its acquisitions by about to it says "we say around here complexity creates chaos creates focus " mr speer says "we tell our acquisitions we expect youre going to shrink before you grow " mr stevenss unaccustomed role has meant many added business trips and led him to delegate more of the running of his business units to subordinates at least one of whom now also has been trained to do acquisitions but he sees the shift as natural for someone used to negotiating prices and contracts as part of running a business "a lot of times its no different than negotiating a price increase with a customer " mr stevens says his new focus allows him to rediscover an entrepreneurial streak he first showed as a boy growing up in knoxville tenn at he had a job selling university of tennessee football programs competition at the stadium made it tough so he walked a mile and a half up the street to a traffic light where he caught motorists looking for something to read as they waited in traffic to park "i remember how that excited me how you could beat the competition " he says mr stevens joined itw in as the operations manager for its minigrip business a maker of resealable plastic bags based in seguin texas northeast of san antonio in his job interview mr stevens suggested reconfiguring the assembly machines so that bags could be made and packaged in fewer steps he got the job and soon made over the plant so that a single manager instead of three could oversee the whole process in mr stevens was promoted to general manager that summer he wrote a long range plan that listed four companies he wanted to snag bagco a strong minigrip competitor that outsourced its manufacturing to thailand was second on the list in april mr stevens was copied in on a five page letter mr speer sent to top managers emphasizing the importance of acquisitions mr stevens recalls "when i was copied on that letter i interpreted that to say this means you now john " he says in late mr stevens heard that bagcos owner nossi taheri was looking to sell mr stevens invited mr taheri to fly from his georgia headquarters to san antonio to meet figuring that if the owner took the trouble to travel he would be ready to deal with his boss jim kohl mr stevens initially met with mr taheri for two hours and over the next three months there were weekly conference calls mr taheri didnt respond to requests to be interviewed for this story mr stevens worried about the deal as he headed into itws two day acquisition workshop in early february there a parade of top itw managers made powerpoint presentations on identifying and wooing potential targets appraising a business and implementing the process mr stevens took pages of notes in a composition notebook he learned for instance that its better to walk away than end up with a bad deal "with a machine you know what youre getting into " he says "when you buy a company you really dont know it till you buy it " finally the bargaining with bagco over its price ended after itw sweetened the deal with a six month consulting fee for the owner said mr stevens itw wouldnt disclose the purchase price but says it was in line with bagcos average annual revenue which was about &# million after the deal closed in july mr stevens faced his new employees who numbered about the acquisition workshop had prepared him with dos and donts for his opening speech he set up a projector to show an image of the company logos merging and stressed the benefits of the takeover the room was quiet he recalls he promised to meet with each bagco employee to hear their concerns since then mr stevens often has been on the road for to days at a time on trips he spends hours at night with his laptop scouring web sites for information about takeover prospects he laments time away from his three daughters and frequently missing sunday church services with his wife sandra but it also has paid off late last year he was promoted again to a group vice president overseeing four units he is now spending more time seeking acquisitions especially among plastic bag makers he recently negotiated to buy another bag maker which itw would not name in southern china to prepare he read the harvard business reviews book on doing business in china which noted that haggling is part of chinese culture after four trips to china in six months sometimes alongside a company acquisition specialist he sat down alone early last month with the business owner and an interpreter to hammer out final details in a conference room overlooking a dirt field after half a day of talks mr stevens says he abruptly pushed back his chair and started to pack up his things the owner asked if he was angry mr stevens says he firmly but politely said he didnt think itw corporate managers would approve the owners requests the owner handed mr stevens a whiteboard marker and told him to draft a proposal that would get the deal done the owner took a picture of it with a digital camera and emailed it to mr stevens so itw could use it to draft a letter of intent nine days later mr stevens learned the chinese company had accepted gary putka contributed to this article
