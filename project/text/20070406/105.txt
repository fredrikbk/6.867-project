weekend journal taste usury for beginners of all the wonders that the internet has brought us none is as special as web the next generation of internet empowers you me some might say we the people to click our way to self actualization were an army of davids taking the world back from the corporate goliaths one web site at a time the new internet lets us be who weve always wanted to be yes we all have lofty goals like helping the infirm reaching out to shut ins or starting a catering service but what weve always wanted to be may seem to some a bit less commendable for instance ive always wanted to be a loan shark theres something luridly poetic about outlaw lending getting the juice ticking at on some hard luck mope making profits off of the backs of the union guy who lost it all at the race track or the stock broker with the expensive drug habit sending minions like "bobby bats" out to do collections its like being a banker only cooler thanks to prosper com my dream has come true sort of prosper was launched in february by chris larsen and john witchel two silicon valley entrepreneurs mr witchel was the brain behind flashmob computing a process that links personal computers allowing them to function as one supercomputer mr larsen was the founder and ceo of e loan they wanted to merge the fundamental principles of web with the trendy economic theory of microcredit i wasnt daunted by the fancy nobel prize winning idea though i was sure prosper would help me find some sweet action the idea behind the site is that people can serve one anothers financial interests better than banks can so if you need a small loan between &# and &# you can go to prosper com register and explain why you need the money prosper does a credit check on prospective borrowers assigns them a credit grade and then publishes their loan request with the amount they want to borrow and the maximum interest rate theyre willing to pay prospective lenders sort through these pitches to find attractive loans on which they bid lenders propose an amount they want to give at an interest rate they are willing to charge they can fund as little as &# or as much as the full loan as more lenders bid on the loan the interest rate drops until it reaches a floor beneath which no lenders are willing to go the typical loan is for a three year term prosper gets its beak wet by charging a transaction fee to each borrower when the loan begins and an annual servicing fee to lenders so far the company has processed loans worth more than &# million likening the concept to jimmy stewarts building &amp loan in "its a wonderful life " prosper bills itself as a virtuous community where people help their neighbors and everyone benefits its such a big happy family that there was even a prosper community conference last february in where else san francisco there are however two small holes in this tapestry of virtual virtue the first is as prospers faq puts it "no one guarantees the loans at prosper " if a borrower defaults prosper will "ding" his credit score and send a collection agency after him but if the borrowers credit was already wrecked thats not much disincentive after all collection agencies dont do kneecaps anymore to desperate or unscrupulous borrowers with ruined credit scores prosper might look like free money the other niggling concern is about unscrupulous lenders would be loan sharks who view prosper as a way to leach interest from poor struggling borrowers looking for a lifeline i set off into prosper territory armed with a couple hundred bucks hoping for the frisson that my real career has never given me after going through the verification process i chose a screen name "loanbruce " after the mechanical star of jaws which is the only piece of identification prosper users see about each other a substantial number of the listings are from people wanting loans to pay off their credit cards just the kind of desperate fish i was looking for for instance one prospective borrower requested &# at to pay off her credit cards and boost her soy candle business her pitch was "since my bankruptcy in i have not been late or delinquent on a single payment " some of the businesses sound rather suspicious "alidixon " for example claimed to be a private investigator in california who wanted &# to expand his operations in the course of detailing his financial situation alidixon explained why he owed money on two cars "vehicle gbp is a luxury car used to entertain millionaire and celebrity clients who expect high class treatment from their private investigator vehicle gbp is a common suv used for surveillance operations in an attempt to remain covert " clearly a scammer i was too wise to fall for that routine even shadier was a supposed cornell alum "barry " who sought a &# loan for the express purpose of re lending the money out at higher rates to other prosper borrowers a man after my own heart in the end i purchased three loans all of which went to the type of high risk borrowers that normally resort to getting in hock to degenerates like me the first was to someone named "shannon" who said he or she was starting a small town newspaper the second was to a yahoo employee who runs a side business selling refurbished electronics equipment the third was to a down on her luck single mom who had no assets and needed cash to get out of credit card debt she has an ex husband who did her wrong and the picture of her year old son was awfully cute this cold blooded loan sharking racket is harder than it looks i could imagine myself being tough on the first two borrowers because deep down i thought that there was a chance that they could make good but the single mom seemed hopeless i gave her the loan anyway all told the average interest rate i was getting on the loans was not usurious perhaps but high enough to make me feel pleasantly evil after making my loans i talked with prospers communications director tiffany fox turns out im just a piker with my three baby loans while prosper doesnt release many statistics about lenders ms fox told me that "there are more than a few who have more than &# out on the platform " my career as a bad boy money lender was deflated even further when i received my first payments which totaled &# &# once prosper took their cut all three borrowers made their first collection i didnt even get to have anyone roughed up not that i could have afforded it even bobby bats must make more than &# an hour mr last is online editor of the weekly standard and a weekly commentator for the philadelphia inquirer
