cable tv group bails out of ebay ad sales trial a cable industry groups decision yesterday to withdraw from further trials of ebay inc s online tv ad buying system could seriously set back plans to create an alternative advertising marketplace the cable television advertising bureau a trade group that represents most major cable networks said it wouldnt participate in further testing of the online media exchange system created last fall by a consortium of about high profile advertisers including home depot inc toyota motor corp and microsoft corp without cooperation from a television network the ebay exchange wont have airtime to sell to marketers the ebay consortium said it was "disappointed" by the cable groups decision it added that it will "continue to pursue cable networks and is confident that the emedia exchange will have traction with cable and other media " ebay didnt return calls seeking comment the advertiser group teamed with ebay last year to create what it hoped would be an internet auction site for tv advertising time right now most tv ad time is sold through negotiations done over the phone or email after writing the software to create the system the group had planned to test it by selling national ad time available on one cable network the cabs decision will put that plan on hold the decision to withdraw comes after several cable networks including espn mtv discovery networks lifetime and turner studied the system for several weeks "clearly one picture was emerging and it was universally negative " says sean cunningham president and chief executive of the cab he says the networks believe the system failed to capture important parts of the buying process mr cunningham says many of todays media deals involve complicated product integrations in addition the system didnt allow for media deals to have web promotional or retail extensions the networks withdrawal also reflects opposition within the tv industry to the new system tv executives fretted that the system would commoditize the value of tv ad time while some big advertisers which get price breaks in the current system were also opposed even some big media buyers on madison avenue were leery about the implications of the system much of these firms business rests on their ability to pool clients ad dollars and use the resulting leverage to negotiate better rates an open auction system could undercut that approach ad executives suggest the cab decisions could also have bigger ramifications for others such as google inc that are looking to digitize the media buying and selling process "google is going to realize not everyone is rooting for this " says greg smith chief operating officer of the north american operations of neo ogilvy an interactive ad agency owned by wpp groups ogilvy &amp mather google didnt return calls seeking comment
