weekend journal review television the sopranos returns theres no mistaking the aura of final days that surrounds the beginning of the new and last season of "the sopranos " sunday p m edt on hbo the elegiac tone sets in early with pictures of a brooding tony strength sapped by gunshot wounds inflicted by his deranged uncle junior and by advancing age hes facing his th birthday the gift he gets from his sister janice a film compilation of their childhood photographs underscores the mood played out in superbly orchestrated scenes its a tone that should be familiar by now that longing for the past for an older eras way of doing business and for a society in which children were brought up to obey parents and to respect flag and country has been central to "the sopranos" from the start a line from one of the early seasons summed the theme up memorably its the s a snippy meadow points out when her father objects to something shes said or something outrageously revealing shes about to wear she should get one thing straight her irate father informs her "in this house its still the s " tony is not kidding the first episode there are eight more to come of this sixth "sopranos" season dwells on family not the mob kind class and cultural attitudes in ways not seen on the series in some time its a focus that has always yielded some of the seriess best writing and this season opener with its exquisitely right lyrical ending atop a shocking scene of bloodletting is no exception that any such scene can after all this time still produce feelings of shock in a "sopranos" viewer is itself a remarkable achievement the prelude finds tony and carmela off on a weekend visit to the lakeside retreat of janice and her husband bobby were to see a lot of janice now a contented wife and mother all affection expansiveness and a smile never free of its touch of the sinister the soprano children only periodically in sight are off doing in character things this weekend meadow pursuing her medical studies a j sneaking around his parents house with his girlfriend a character distinguished by a sullenness even deeper than his its tonys birthday but hes not feeling celebratory the law has been harassing him still janice and the devoted bobby offer a comforting retreat theres food talk scenery the couples adorable little daughter and a side trip into the woods where tony gets to practice with the gun the subservient bobby has given him as a gift he hunts deer the wonderfully earnest bobby tells tony but with a bow and arrow to even the playing field as happens so often in "the sopranos " new characters or newly powerful sides of one lurch up out of the old and this is bobbys time quietly inexorably the sunny weekend turns dark in a clash of wills and social codes turned nightmarish theres no way to avoid the feeling of menace in the air even when the conflict has been smoothed out and is presumably all over some things can never be over a now grim janice knows as she watches her brother sitting outside looking at the lake "i know that sitting in a chair" is all she can find to say about what it is she knows and fears and its altogether eloquent the same can be said about the entire first episode of season six thats not going to help fans of "the sopranos" now contemplating the series end soon to come a population unlikely to lose its fascination for this family and what happens next in their lives any time in the foreseeable future as janice understands some things can never be over some things can never be over soon enough that would include
