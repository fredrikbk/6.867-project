weekend journal tastings swirl sip discuss times ripe to start your wine group the blending game wine tasting groups are the book clubs of the new millennium theyre everywhere just ask manning voorhees the person group at his retirement community in toms river n j the wine appreciation society of lake ridge meets every month to taste four wines most recent tasting the wines of argentina "were having a grand time " he says or pat luks whose wine group in minot n d is strong and growing "i attended a wine tasting at the state fairgrounds in late august hundreds of people from every walk of life were there trying different wines including local wines grown right here in the frozen north i knew that i would find others who would enjoy wine as much as i did and could talk about subjects other than just the weather and the farm report " he told us adding "the social connection at the monthly meetings is just as important as the wine " we receive thousands of notes from readers throughout the year and its amazing to us how many people mention in passing that they are members of wine tasting groups the groups are usually informal though they can sometimes be very serious five years ago we mentioned a member wine group in boston called divas uncorked sisters who sip since then the group has become quite famous and now is even releasing its own wine label what is a wine group like and what do they do meet some of them in piedmont calif the east bay winos group has been meeting for years holding a blind tasting of six wines each month one recent tasting of pinot noir had a surprise ending when the winner was chasseur and second place was chasseur in swansea mass linda and tom pendergast and three other couples meet every month sometimes they take trips to wineries too including westport rivers vineyard and winery in massachusetts "its been a wonderful experience for us all " says mrs pendergast "out of all eight of us i have the most wine knowledge and am called the sme subject matter expert of the group i just know what tastes good " in cincinnati a group of eight women has been meeting every month for the last three years "our group is called pinot nv and we have been exploring wines from all over the world " says reeta brendamour in punta gorda fla a group from a condominium met monthly during the winter and spring last year tasting five or six different wines "each host provided notepads and typed notes about the wines the grape varieties and the regions where they were produced in addition there were crackers and water " cotter tharin told us "we brought our own glasses and thirst " he added "we did have a chance to taste two buck chuck made me decide to spend more on wine i can say that the tastings were enjoyed by all and the conversations about particular wines were spirited and indicate how people differ in their tastes " in minneapolis paula denmans group of around people has been meeting monthly for years a highlight of last years tastings was wines from the veneto region of italy with this menu gorgonzola and pear crostini with acacia honey stuffed tomato salad veal and wild mushroom risotto parmesan cheese with year old aged balsamic vinegar and tiramisu sigh in greensboro n c the grape nuts wine club includes members and has been meeting once a month for more than four years "our most interesting tasting of happened right after my wife and i along with another couple returned from the paso robles zinfandel festival we both had sent back wines from several small wineries that are unavailable in our area and opening and introducing these wines to our friends made for a very enjoyable evening " says group member brian surette in beaufort s c the dataw wine group a member all male group meets regularly to taste six to eight wines and even publishes its own newsletter most interesting tasting last year bordeaux reds spanning the years to "interestingly only once in the years our group has been together has the highest priced wine been the most highly rated wine " says member larry bernard we know how much fun and how important informal wine groups can be because we had our own little group in miami for years a few of us would get together every month or so and taste wine and talk all night one sample tasting california cabernet sauvignon in with louis martini "slightly vegetal" montelena "creamy" beaulieu "rich woody dark chewy" and sterling "soft rich beautiful" if you think you might be interested in starting a wine tasting group our advice would be to keep it very simple at first just ask a few friends to come over with a specific kind of wine in a brown paper bag keep the focus fairly narrow say sauvignon blancs from around the world under &# or american syrah between &# and &# we find that tasting similar wines blind gives the tasting focus and makes each wine more interesting its important to have food at a wine tasting but wed keep it simple even takeout to begin with ideally there would be a separate glass for each wine but thats a lot of glasses so its fine to give everyone one glass and have a spit bucket to pour out one wine and move to another should you rinse between wines thats a controversial question we would not because we find the water in the glass is more destructive to the next wine than whats left of the previous wine its really not important that anyone take notes but theres bound to be at least one person in the group who wants to in our group it was john at some point take a vote on your favorites and then unbag the wines be sure to leave plenty of time for retasting people often want to try wines again once they know what they are unless you live within walking distance and many wine groups are based in neighborhoods be sure to have a designated driver or a taxi standing by and one other thing we really hate it when people play "gotcha" with wine if someone in the group thinks its really funny to trick everyone by bringing a very cheap wine or a very expensive one that might seem humorous at the time but youll have trouble getting people to do this a second time no one enjoys being tricked and no one wants to be on the defensive at a wine tasting finally be prepared for something that henry gillis of okatie s c noticed after he joined a wine tasting group last year "after serving the wine or champagne the talk is all about everything but the wine itself " to some extent really thats the best thing about a wine tasting how often do people just get together and talk anymore and its not a bad thing in terms of the tasting either its possible to focus so much on a wine that its like staring too hard at a painting or smelling a rose too aggressively by talking about everything but the wine you relax and let the wine speak to you in subtle ways that are more emotional than intellectual if the wine is a winner youll notice it soon enough and come back to that subject even if youve been a member of a wine group that has been meeting for years there are always new ideas because there are always new wines it would have been difficult to do a tasting of austrian whites just a few years ago but now theyre all the rage and perfect for a tasting in addition long time groups looking for ideas should think about new concepts tasting the same wine from bottles of different sizes for instance or tasting the same wine in different glasses truly when it comes to wine there is always something new to try gary miller of chaska minn can vouch for that he and his wife started a wine club in their community four years ago that meets every four to six weeks "i have gained immeasurably in my knowledge and passion for wine " he told us his most memorable recent tasting here it is about a year ago i had two wines within the same week that each seemed to be lacking what the other had in abundance i thought it would be fun to base a wine club program on the blending of wines to teach what it takes to build on the strengths of a wine and hopefully produce a blend that was better than the sum of its parts when the club members arrived they were greeted by four "winery" stations we divided the members into team australia team france team chile and team usa each team was given magnums of three different varietals sourced from their country and consistent with a bordeaux type blend each team also had graduated cylinders for careful measuring empty bottles and a packet of information their mission in this "wine survivor" game was to blend a "reserve" wine and a secondary "trade" wine from the wines they were given upon hearing what was going to happen that evening more than one club member said "i do not come to the wine club to work " but the club very quickly got into the challenge we were amazed at how the individual characteristics of a wine can be carried through to the final blend even in very small concentrations and unfortunately some teams found there is nothing you can do to cover up a bad or very strong flavor profile all the wines were then tasted by the group and a best "reserve" wine best "trade" wine and winning winery were announced in the end the level of enthusiasm for the event and the amazement that the members expressed at the knowledge or understanding gained during the game greatly exceeded my expectations you can contact us at wine wsj com
