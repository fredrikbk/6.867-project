nokia qualcomm joust in patent dispute arbitration is requested as pact deadline nears a good faith payment nokia corp and qualcomm inc both made surprise maneuvers to gain leverage in high stakes negotiations over patent royalties that are approaching an important deadline the two cellular kingpins have filed several lawsuits against each other and have vowed more litigation if a licensing agreement between the companies expires late monday without a new deal nokia is pressing qualcomm for lower royalties than the finnish cellphone maker pays under the current pact qualcomm a san diego chip maker gets most of its profits from patent royalties on handsets it is known for a technology called cdma for code division multiple access though cdma networks were a minority when cellular networks first went digital qualcomm has successfully sought patent royalties for all "third generation" networks including those using wideband cdma or wcdma technology rather than exercise an option to extend the current agreement at the same rate nokia yesterday said it made a &# million quarterly payment to qualcomm based on its own valuation of patents covering nokia handsets that use wcdma "they have no right to do that " responded louis lupin qualcomms general counsel arguing that the amount greatly understates how much nokia should pay "what they have done is they have simply made up a number " qualcomm in turn invoked a clause to seek arbitration of the dispute it plans to ask the american arbitration association to rule that continued use of its technology by nokia would result in the automatic extension of the companies current agreement maintaining nokias current royalty rates qualcomm also said it will ask for a ruling that it can terminate all of nokias patent rights if it sues qualcomm for patent infringement as widely expected after the contract expires nokia had no comment on the arbitration request william plummer its vice president for external affairs said the &# million figure was based on "good faith" estimates of the value of qualcomm patents it expects to be using after the agreement expires prudential analyst inder singh said the payments by nokia were a smart idea since they could influence a court not to issue an injunction against sales of nokia products in any qualcomm patent infringement suit "it shows a willingness on their part to compensate qualcomm " he said mr singh predicted that nokia was unlikely to accept the request for arbitration at least until the companies get a bit closer together in their negotiating positions the latest moves may delay a settlement he said but he expects the two companies to reach a deal in perhaps under pressure from cellular carriers that dont want the issue to linger how much nokia pays qualcomm isnt known though analysts have estimated qualcomms charges at an average of of the cost of a cellphone nokia as part of its announcements yesterday asserted that "until " it has paid less than in cumulative license fees for wcdma products under all licensing agreements mr lupin called that figure "deceptive and misleading " speculating it may average in royalties for wcdma products besides cellphone the company has been paying qualcomm alone more than on wcdma handsets he said nokia has argued that qualcomm shouldnt be able to charge the same royalty rates on wcdma technology as it did on earlier generations qualcomm contends its patents are just as important for wcdma as earlier technologies before nokias &# million payment qualcomm had estimated an interruption in nokias regular payments would initially reduce quarterly net earnings by four cents to six cents a share daniel thomas contributed to this article
