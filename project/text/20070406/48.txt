judging the bush legacy few things focus the mind like a howler of a judicial decision and that may be one bright point in this weeks supreme court blather on global warming its reminded conservatives that theres still hard work to do on judges and just in time for a senate judicial battle all has been quiet on the judge front which is the way senate majority leader harry reid and judiciary chairman patrick leahy like it busy running a war and ginning up bush scandals the democrats would rather not give a demoralized republican base something juicy to get het up about that calm is about to give way for a critical few months during which democrats will be forced to tip their hand on their confirmation strategy and the bush administration will get a last shot at adding to its judicial legacy the key words here are "adding to " six years in even the most critical conservative activists are concluding that president bush has had an impressive judicial run the base may be disappointed with other aspects of this president and his party but theres a rock solid feeling the texan has lived up to his campaign promises to change the judiciary with distinguished conservative jurists "i could nitpick here or there but bush really has won this issue and it will be a long lasting part of his legacy " says curt levey president of the committee for justice which advocates constitutionalist judicial nominees its not so much the numbers since president bush may come in below modern averages in the crucial area of appellate judges bush so far clinton reagan then again neither presidents clinton nor reagan faced an opposition so willing to abuse its advise and consent power and to filibuster even lower court nominees what voters have appreciated more has been the white houses rigorous attention to judicial philosophy no souters here and the amount of political capital the president plonked into his picks names were submitted and submitted again the withdrawals miguel estrada william haynes terrence boyle others came only after it was dismally clear the fight was lost the payoff was two stellar supreme court successes john roberts and sam alito which alone qualify the prez for bragging rights but consider too the appellate all stars michael mcconnell brett kavanaugh jeffrey sutton william pryor janice rogers brown dennis shedd john rogers some of these confirmations also helped swing what had been liberal circuits the sixth court of appeals for one back toward the conservative side yes thereve been flubs harriet miers for one republican senators also rightfully gripe the white house has moved too slowly with names squandering the last year of its majority then again senators can talk theyve squawked over their right to submit names and to shoot down picks south carolinas lindsey graham is right now sitting on a qualified nominee plumping for his own favorite virginias george allen and john warner squabbled over names until mr allen lost his seat a few notable senators aside mitch mcconnell jon kyl john cornyn the reality is that few republicans have matched mr bushs passion that helped hand democrats victories lost in the broad obstructionism was that the left always had a targeted twofold strategy one goal was to take down those candidates who had the best shot of later ending up on the supreme court in particular women and minorities so long miguel estrada and carolyn kuhl the other was to keep qualified nominees off those circuits that handle big stakes issues take mr allens fourth circuit home of the cia the pentagon and the brig at charleston which hears the biggest war on terror suits president bush was mau maued into re nominating one of president clintons choices and gop squabbling helped democrats ensure three vacancies what has been a reliably conservative court could well flip if mr bush doesnt get names through soon which brings us to today despite a democratic senate the white house has shown no signs of backing down on its judicial philosophy insiders say those being interviewed are top notch minority leader mitch mcconnell has also brought a renewed commitment to judges he notes that the senate confirmed an average of circuit judges in the last two years of each of the reagan bush i and clinton presidencies and is demanding the same courtesy to hit that democrats would have to do one confirmation a month and so far they largely have norman randy smith ninth circuit was confirmed in february and thomas hardiman third circuit last month but democrats are no dopes mr reid knows the judges issue has hurt his party in past elections and believes there is a benefit of being seen to play nice for now yet they are also acutely aware they have a good shot at the white house sen leahy has already indicated his intention of shortening the confirmation window invoking the so called strom thurmond rule and bringing confirmation votes to a halt next summer the question is whether they now use their power to submarine the most qualified nominees and those destined for the most crucial circuits in short its not the numbers that count so much as who they afford a hearing and who they run out the clock on the big test will be peter keisler up for the d c circuit court of appeals hes possible supreme court material which might explain why his nomination is one of the longest pending of current nominees republicans are pushing to make his confirmation next and if they fail itll be a good sign democrats intend to slow walk the most important appointments another indicator will be raymond kethledge and stephen murphy both nominees to the sixth circuit those slots are viewed as judicial emergencies and both men are fine legal scholars yet the sixth circuit is hanging in the balance and a few nominees could swing it one philosophical direction or the other watch to see if messrs kethledge and murphy get through meanwhile all this political calculus flies out the window should a supreme court slot open at which point judges dominate the political landscape from now to the far reaches of numbers and names aside perhaps the presidents biggest judicial gift is on display right now sitting square in the middle of the republican presidential primary mitt romney john mccain rudy giuliani voters are demanding contenders state what sort of judges they would appoint and dont think the candidates arent weighing their answers carefully mr bush set a high bar for what the base expects from its leaders that alone is a legacy
