the gippers mideast playbook it is easy to exaggerate the importance of the palestinian problem solving it will not affect the situation in iraq where disagreements over the eventual borders of a palestinian state may be the only reason iraqs sunnis and shia are not killing one another solving it will not affect the pace of iranian efforts to enrich uranium nor will establishing a palestinian state end terrorism or reconcile islam with the modern world still pushing for a settlement makes sense it would combat anti americanism and bolster u s standing not just in the arab and muslim worlds but throughout europe it would do wonders for israelis who could live a more normal life and focus their security concerns on iran it would allow arab regimes to likewise concentrate on the iranian and shia challenges and give them confidence to undertake internal reform and of course a solution would give palestinians a state of their own and the chance for a prosperous and peaceful existence alas a settlement any time soon is not in the cards this is not because of the absence of a reasonable plan that exists rather what is missing is leadership in either israel or the palestinian areas that is both able and willing to compromise for peace and make those compromises stick prime minister olmerts popularity is in single digits mostly the result of last years lebanon debacle he is too weak to make big decisions and sell them to a skeptical israeli public as for the palestinians and akin to "democratic" republics that are anything but their newly minted unity government is hardly unified it is more a prelude to civil war than a formula for cooperation in short the situation on the ground is not ripe for negotiation this is not an argument for doing nothing neglect is not always benign the idea that things have to get worse before they get better is not always the case in the middle east history suggests that things get worse before they get even worse outsiders have provided little help of late the "road map" promoted by the current u s administration lacks any specifics regarding what lies at the end of the road and sets up any number of roadblocks that must be navigated before such talks could begin the palestinians have no interest in the road maps call for a state with temporary borders fearing they may become permanent for its part the arab league peace plan first introduced five years ago and recently restated on a "take it or leave it basis " will for good reasons not be supported by either israel or the u s in its current form all of this argues for a new initiative by the u s one more ambitious than twice monthly meetings devoted to discussing "practical measures" between israeli and palestinian leaders here one can do no better than quote the president "its become evident to me that some clearer sense of americas position on the key issues is necessary to encourage wider support for the peace process " but it wasnt this president speaking it was ronald reagan a quarter of a century ago reagan came to this position when he realized that limiting the u s role to that of mediator would not be enough that even though the parties would need to agree voluntarily to any peace accord they needed considerable help in getting there including american help in defining just what was meant by "there " the same holds true today president bush needs to create a diplomatic context in which his secretary of state can effectively operate doing so would not constitute a total departure just three years ago this month he reassured then prime minister sharon that any territorial settlement would not involve a return to the armistice lines but rather would reflect "new realities on the ground including major israeli population centers " he also promised sharon that any solution to the palestinian refugee issue would be predicated on settling palestinians in a new state and not through the exercise of the so called right of return to israel something that if exercised in full would spell an end to israels defining jewishness what is needed now is for president bush to take a page out of ronald reagans playbook and spell out his vision for middle east peace such a vision must include but not be limited to what was pledged to sharon in particular any change in territory from the lines given to a new palestinian state needs to be offset by compensation i e land swaps generous financial help would be forthcoming to resettle the bulk of palestinians prepared to live in the new palestinian state the palestinians would gain a foothold in jerusalem and muslims would gain authority over their holy places israel would agree not to create new settlements or carry out targeted killings while this was being negotiated in return all armed attacks by palestinians on israel would need to stop palestinians would recognize israel and agree that the struggle against it was over if much of this sounds familiar it is because it is there is very little new under the sun when it comes to viable middle east peace plans the failure at camp david in the last year of the clinton administration was not one of ideas but of leadership or a lack of it in yasser arafats case and orchestration not enough was done to create a political environment in which arafat could be confident he could compromise and receive political support from arab states and the economic support of the developed world the reason to restate these ideas in public now is not to convene leaders at camp david or anywhere else to negotiate rather it is to bring about palestinian and israeli leaderships that could make peace this could involve new leaders or existing leaders adopting new positions a u s plan would give president mahmoud abbas the means to challenge hamas he could argue he could deliver a viable state without violence hamas would have to sign on or risk being defeated at the polls similarly an american plan would give mr olmert a second chance he could back the u s plan and run with it or it would become the basis for an election that could produce a new israeli government able and willing to work with the u s only once such leadership was in place on both sides would negotiations begin this would all take some time there would be setbacks it might not happen on this presidents watch nevertheless articulating a bush plan would underscore u s support for a comprehensive peace in the middle east in a detailed way for the first time something that would change debates in the area and create the possibility that one day the sides could return to camp david with a very different result to show for it mr haass is president of the council on foreign relations and the author of "the opportunity americas moment to alter historys course" public affairs see related letters "letters to the editor do palestinians really want a permanent peace with israel " wsj april
