weekend journal taste de gustibus a civic action new rochelle n y on the wall in the mayors office hangs a photograph of robert f kennedy jr visiting this city during his senate campaign he appears to be stumbling as he climbs atop a car to address a crowd looking up at the old photo i couldnt help thinking that this time around it was the city that was stumbling what brought my wife and me to mayor noam bramsons office several weeks ago was a chance encounter that we had had while walking home one night through the citys downtown we had come across a group of perhaps a dozen young men standing outside of a darkened parking garage they were yelling taunting remarks and making obscene gestures at two women who were quickly crossing the street to get away from them wed only recently moved to new rochelle just north of new york city attracted by affordable real estate prices in a place that gave all appearances of being on the rise in the early s new rochelle was the third wealthiest city in the country in the s it was the placid suburban setting for "the dick van dyke show " by the s public housing had forced the city into a sharp decline in recent years though it has been experiencing a resurgence one luxury apartment building went up next to the train station and two others are currently under construction new restaurants have been opening up some of the old building facades along main street have been restored and new roc city a mall with a large movie theater is bustling at the north end of town but the new new rochelle is still a work in progress the hooligans were gathered outside the public parking garage for which we had just received a permit graffiti covered its stairwell the toll gates in an adjacent parking lot been broken off one day on her way home my wife saw a group of young teenagers clustering around a boy on the ground kicking him one of the attackers had a stick and appeared ready to start beating him luckily a police officer just then happened to drive by he stopped and ended the ugly scene that incident came later though merely confirming our suspicions on that first night it was already clear that some citizen action was called for my wife put in a call to the police nonemergency number it was clear from the uninterested tone in the dispatchers voice that he wasnt really going to send along a patrol car i suggested that she write the mayor she did and ccd every member of the city council cynic that i am i was more than a little shocked when the responses started coming in a few city council members checked to make sure that someone had addressed our complaint and the mayor personally promised a vigorous response the graffiti would be cleaned up he said and he had asked the police to step up their patrols of the parking garage he had even listened to the tape of the my wifes phone call and agreed that the dispatcher was too dismissive the mayor said that he would be sent for additional training this all sounded promising a few weeks passed in our many travels through the same downtown neighborhood we never saw a squad car and the graffiti remained so we decided to try our luck and ask for a personal meeting with the mayor we got an appointment why not seize the opportunity we thought and mention a few other city problems as long as we had his attention on the way to the mayors office we went over a list of things wed like to see improved in the city there was of course the stairwell graffiti and the potholes along route needed filling we wanted the city to set up a police kiosk near where the hooligans had gathered and another thing we wanted the front doors of city hall opened the th century structure has a grand three story entrance hall with an inviting set of stairs and oversized doors but they are locked visitors are forced to walk around back and enter what was likely an old service entrance the mayor said that he was disappointed to hear that the stairwell had not been cleaned up and promised to get right on it it was indeed painted soon after he also said that he had wanted to open the city hall front doors but that the employees objected citing security concerns but he did promise to take up our idea of the police kiosk with the city council a few weeks later with the graffiti back i lodged another complaint by email i again suggested a police kiosk expecting little response lo and behold the mayor wrote back that the city council had debated the idea and decided to go ahead with it it was only now a matter of where to build it and what type it should be we fought city hall and won but no one bothered to tell us mr miniter is the assistant editor of opinionjournal com
