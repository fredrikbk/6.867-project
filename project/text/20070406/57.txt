kerkorian offer to buy chrysler may fuel battle bid hinges on getting acceptable uaw pact a long term view billionaire investor kirk kerkorian raised the prospect of a more intense bidding war for daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group with an unexpected offer to buy the ailing auto maker for &# billion in cash the move by tracinda corp mr kerkorians investment firm came as daimlerchrysler was entertaining bids for from three other potential buyers cerberus capital management lp a partnership between blackstone group and centerbridge partners and auto parts supplier magna international inc mr kerkorian has a long track record as both a hard nosed investor and combative chrysler shareholder and his leap into the bidding could give daimlerchrysler more leverage in any negotiations with chryslers other suitors his chrysler bid which follows an unsuccessful effort by mr kerkorian to shape the future of general motors corp contains an unusual twist tracinda said it would offer the united auto workers union which represents about of chryslers employees a "substantial portion" of chrysler equity as part of a deal to lower the cost of providing health care for hourly workers the offer is also contingent on reaching a "satisfactory" labor contract agreement with the uaw and working out a plan with daimlerchrysler to share chryslers roughly &# billion in unfunded pension liabilities and retiree heath care costs "it certainly raises the stakes and it has to be taken very seriously " said david kudla chief executive of mainstay capital management llc an investment firm based in grand blanc mich mr kerkorian he added is "saying here hell put up money upfront " the competition among high profile private equity firms like cerberus and blackstone for one of the auto industrys iconic names comes amid a continuing struggle by detroits big three gm chrysler and ford motor co are racking up heavy losses in their north american auto operations in addition to being saddled with billions of dollars in health care obligations to retirees the auto makers have been pummeled by high gasoline prices competition from foreign rivals like toyota motor corp and a consumer shift away from the trucks and sport utility vehicles that generate most of their profits all three have suffered sluggish sales this year private equity buyers typically acquire public companies and take them private seeking to refurbish them out of the public spotlight in hopes of reselling them later at a profit mr kerkorian likewise envisions taking chrysler private to undertake a long term restructuring in a letter to daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche jerome b york mr kerkorians longtime lieutenant and former chrysler chief financial officer said tracinda would be a "long term" investor that would aim to improve quality speed product development and fund the development of more "green" vehicles daimlerchrysler spokesman han tjan declined to comment on the tracinda letter but he reaffirmed that the company is talking to interested parties and that all options are still open daimlerchrysler shares jumped on news of tracindas interest hitting their highest level since july in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange the stock was up &# or at &# it has risen since the company announced on feb that it would consider alternatives for chrysler the conditions of mr kerkorians offer highlight the critical role the union is likely to play in determining which bidder prevails other bidders are also likely to make their offers contingent on chryslers reaching a deal with the uaw magna and the blackstone centerbridge team have begun talking to labor leaders in hopes of establishing solid relations ahead of a potential sale in the past few weeks representatives of daimlerchryslers canadian and german workers have said they would fight a sale to a private equity buyer saying such a buyer would look to slash jobs wages and benefits and possibly break up chrysler a uaw spokesman also declined to comment the chrysler offer marks mr kerkorians second attempt in two years to take the wheel at one of detroits faltering giants in he bought a stake in gm and subsequently pushed the company to speed up its restructuring efforts promoting an alliance with renault sa and nissan motor co but he made little headway and sold his gm stake last fall at a modest profit most of mr kerkorians investments are in the hotel and casino industries but he has a long and complex history with chrysler in the early s he made an unsuccessful hostile bid for the company then pushed the auto makers management to improve shareholder returns an effort that ultimately led to chryslers combination with daimler benz ag of germany he later sued chrysler claiming that he and other chrysler shareholders should have been paid a bigger premium for giving up control of the u s company but lost the case mr york mr kerkorians lieutenant has been on the scene at chrysler during most of its ups and downs in the past years he joined the company in just before it was saved from bankruptcy by a government backed bailout in the s when chrysler prospered on minivan sales he rose up through the ranks becoming cfo in when mr kerkorian made an unsuccessful hostile bid for chrysler he then left and served as international business machines corp s cfo for two years before joining forces with mr kerkorian in his next showdown with chrysler which ended in the tie up that created daimlerchrysler although mr kerkorian made billions on the deal he later sued the company and then ceo jurgen schrempp claiming chrysler shareholders should have been paid a higher premium to give up control to the german side daimlerchrysler prevailed although the decision is under appeal the two men began contemplating a bid for chrysler shortly after daimlerchrysler announced it was looking at options for chrysler according to terry christensen a los angeles attorney who works closely with mr kerkorian last month tracinda sent a letter to j p morgan chase &amp co expressing its interest the investment company received a "friendly response" but it wasnt given a copy of the detailed financial and product development data that the investment bank prepared for other bidders mr christensen said mr york then began his own analysis of chrysler using whatever data he could pull together from public sources and the long list of contacts he has in the auto industry he also began contacting current and former chrysler executives he has stayed in touch with to glean additional details on the companys condition according to a person familiar with mr yorks thinking the picture he pieced together showed a company with valuable positions in pickup trucks minivans and suvs although the dodge ram is the nations no pickup behind the ford f and chevrolet silverado it sells in high volumes and has good margins mr york also concluded chryslers minivans were also big sellers and make money while the jeep brands suvs have maintained a strong reputation with consumers but most of chryslers other vehicles mr york found are weak performers the chrysler sebring and dodge avenger midsize sedans although just redesigned still dont match up to the toyota camry or honda accord and face improved offerings from gm and ford in this segment in his letter to daimlerchrysler mr york suggested tracindas plans for chrysler would differ from those of private equity firms "investors that feel the need to show mark to market results in their funds in relatively short time frames just a few years will not be willing to invest as necessary over an unusually lengthy period of time to achieve the necessary end results " he wrote "long term patient investing has been tracindas approach " stephen power gina chon and stephen wisnefski contributed to this article
