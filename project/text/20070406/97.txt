weekend journal review books the meter is still running taxi a social history of the new york city cabdriver by graham russell gao hodges johns hopkins pages &# back in the early s i drove a taxicab for several years while i was trying to figure out not all that successfully how to make a living as a writer the hours were grueling typically or hour shifts and the work nerve racking in rattletrap vehicles with bad brakes slippery transmissions and untuned engines that often conked out in heavy rain but there were compensations discovering some new corner of the city cruising empty avenues in their stark nocturnal grandeur encountering the unexpected on one occasion richard burton climbing into the back seat of my cab tipsily clutching an antique chair the money was pretty good for a single guy with modest needs and once i was on the road i felt that for the rest of the night i owned the streets of the greatest city in the world for generations new york cabbies occupied a peculiar place in american culture part roughneck and part homegrown philosopher simultaneously celebrated and despised by writers filmmakers and ordinary taxi riding new yorkers in "taxi " graham russell gao hodges journeys into this paradoxical world of the taximan extricating him from the limbo of folklore and offering him up in his multiplicity of forms working stiff hollywood invention perennial problem for organized labor as a template for the transformation of new york in the th century "taxi " is not only lively and erudite social history it is probably the best account of taximen that is ever to be written through most of the th century the cabby served as an icon of the american urban working class a cocky wiseguy who cruised the boundaries of class and respectability flaunting his unsavory independence like the red flag on old style taxi meters virtually from the start new yorkers "regarded the world of hacking as loose and lawless and recommended that aspiring young men learn to drive cabs as a lesson in how to gain life goals ruthlessly and without rules " writes mr hodges himself a former taxi driver who now teaches history at colgate university the first self propelled cabs appeared on new york streets in they were battery powered requiring a long recharge every miles but they were popular and for good reason in the first decade of the th century horses dropped more than a million pounds of manure a day on new yorks streets inevitably the internal combustion engine accelerated the shift away from horsedrawn carriages by the s taximen had acquired a colorful reputation as key players in the nighttime world of illicit sex booze and crime chaos often reigned in the streets as fare wars raged and cabbies slugged it out with their fists for spots in the hack lines in front of popular hotels scare stories about their wild driving habits were commonplace frightened new yorkers called them the "yellow peril " playing on the eras racist fear of asian immigrants within a few years however cabbies were being lionized as colorful "characters" with an oracular knowledge of everything from politics to the human heart a notion that seems to have taken root when wartime prosperity boosted income and temporarily elevated many drivers into the middle class mr hodges reminds us of a fairytale time when fleet drivers were required to wear jacket and tie and magnificent desoto taxis sported roll top roofs that were convenient for drunks to rise through to make speeches to pedestrians as the cab flew past the city then seemed like the center of the world and in the art of the era the taxicab was often portrayed as a streaking emblem of a new age for the new yorker writer e b white however the taxi and its driver were metaphors for a city that was now changing in ways that he didnt quite like "taxis roll faster than they rolled ten years ago and they were rolling fast then " white wrote in the late s "hack men used to drive with verve now they sometimes seem to drive with desperation toward the ultimate tip " mr hodges is particularly good on the portrayal of taxi drivers in the movies from harold lloyds manic comedy "speedy" to martin scorseses dystopic drama "taxi driver " taximen were cast as adventurers attempting to penetrate the forbidden world of the elite by romancing one of their upper class passengers occasionally they succeeded like dick powells operatic cabby in the film "broadway gondolier " far more often they were kicked out of the park avenue boudoir and back onto the streets their good natured smiles though suggested that they had learned their lesson and now knew along with other working class mugs where they belonged despite low pay and the abuse by fleet owners taxi drivers proved hard to organize labor activity reached a violent climax in the s when during strikes passengers were physically dragged out of taxis driven by scabs and cars were wrecked and burned in the streets by the scores repeated efforts by the transport workers teamsters and other national unions met with no more than temporary success until the mid s as often as not collective action was thwarted by the cabbies notorious independence "red mike" quill a s radical and head of the transit workers union once observed "we had a feeling they were not like us they didnt understand the meaning of solidarity " mr hodges devotes the final portion of his book to what might be called the travis bickle era from the s to the present the sociopathic bickle of scorseses "taxi driver" incarnates every paranoid driver that new york taxi riders have ever met but he is also the last gasp of a certain white american working class type bickle represents mr hodges says "the angry threatened white driver who is aware that the older segregated world of hacking is declining and that african americans and immigrants are encroaching on his preserve " since the s the once monolithic fleet dominated taxi industry has undergone a succession of upheavals including the rise and fall of minifleets the collapse of the drivers union a precipitous decline in the percentage of drivers who own their medallions and a dramatic ethnic transformation of the work force in keeping with his scholarly approach mr hodges takes no firm position on most of these matters his years as a driver however clearly lead his heart to sympathize with the quixotic desire of some asian drivers no less than of todays taximen are from the indian subcontinent to resuscitate the industrys moribund labor movement contemporary passengers are far less likely to hear an irish american cabby swearing in yiddish as james cagney memorably did in his film "taxi " than they are to hear a recent immigrant from india or pakistan schmoozing over his two way radio about a chota or short run to laguardia a badda or long one to jfk or a fare asking to be taken to babba the "old man " otherwise known as lincoln center but in many ways the cabby remains the same overworked underpaid working stiff he has always been the cabby is fortunate however to have found his sociological poet laureate in graham hodges in the taxi trade we would have called this fascinating trip in his gregarious company "a great fare " mr bordewich is the author of "bound for canaan the epic story of the underground railroad americas first civil rights movement "
