radical islam threatens indonesias moderate democratic unity sadanand dhumes "playboy in indonesia" editorial page march highlights an issue that should be of major importance to the united states but often travels under the radar screen the battle of ideas and the creation of a democratic civil society in the worlds largest muslim nation in terms of population size as mr dhume correctly asserts the court case of erwin arnada the editor of playboy indonesia on charges of breaching the countrys indecency laws is "the latest round of the global culture war between islamists and the west " what is interesting is that playboy indonesia has no nudity but has caused a gut reaction from radical islamic groups in indonesia who regard the publication as a beachhead for cultural pollution these groups are also using intimidation to get their way threats of bodily harm already forced playboy to move its offices from jakarta to bali two further points could have been made by mr dhume first radical islam threatens indonesias unity beyond the fact that not all of the countrys million people are muslim with small minorities of hindus buddhists and christians most indonesians are more moderate in their interpretation of how their religion fits into daily life this explains why indonesia has made a number of important steps in creating a democratic political system since when president suharto was forced to step down after more than years in power the introduction of a more radical form of islam would certainly increase tensions in indonesia pushing non muslim groups to seek an exit much like east timor which was predominantly christian second indonesia is an exceedingly important country to global geopolitics through its waterways travel vital oil and other commodities destined for east asias economies and east asian exports heading for europe africa and the middle east it also has a wide range of natural resources including oil natural gas copper and timber furthermore indonesia is the largest muslim country in terms of population size with a long history of moderate islam considering the messy situation for winning hearts and minds in iraq the existence of indonesian democracy with a deepening civil society should be of acute interest to washington as well as the rest of the global community scott b macdonald white plains n y mr macdonald most recently co authored "separating fools from their money a history of american financial scandals transaction he has written about indonesia in current history and the asia times i am pleased that sadanand dhume regularly receives our email alerts theres a reason he never got one about the legal harassment and intimidation of playboy indonesia in this instance islamist groups have harassed editors intimidated models and filed criminal complaints that helped fuel the ongoing prosecution for indecency but the islamists as far as we can determine did not take action in response to any journalistic content they appear to be angry about the publication of photos of scantily clad women in the magazine which they see as a symbol of the decadent west since mr dhume regularly receives our correspondence he must know we are not shy about denouncing the use of blasphemy or indecency laws to suppress journalistic speech for example we denounced the egyptian governments jailing of blogger abdel karim suleiman who was sentenced to four years in prison for criticizing islam not to mention president hosni mubarak we have also denounced the liberian government for shutting down the the independent newspaper after it published a front page photo of ex presidential affairs minister willis knuckles in flagrante delicto with two women joel simon executive director committee to protect journalists new york mr dhume ridiculously wraps himself in the "noble cause" of freedom for smut peddlers as one against terrorism he states that "the affair captures the muslim countrys steady slide toward intolerance " but the slippery slope he fails to mention is pornography here in the u s indecency used to be considered a woman pictured in her undergarments now hardcore porn is a widespread multi billion dollar publicly traded business child porn internet predation stds and sexual assaults are now endemic while i am no proponent of the fanatical tactics of jemaah islamiyah i am an ahmadi muslim whom they brutally persecute the overall opposition to pornographic license is a justified one ignored is the sex slave child prostitute industry of many nearby asian countries largely fueled by "liberated" western perverts and the meteoric rise of aids in the region are we to believe that these realities have nothing to do with the ever increasing laxity and spread of "free" moral values mr dhume attempts to frame this as a "choice between an open society and a repressive one " it is not the issue is people voicing dissent against harmful trends engulfing their lives democracy in action why is it when rudy giuliani cleaned up the filth in times square he was hailed a hero but when muslims in their own lands try to avoid such degeneration in the first place they are accused of "islamic totalitarianism" ronald d hubbs jr chino calif
