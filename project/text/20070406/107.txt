stanford "you cant verify whether they put two or three years into the chess club " says richard shaw stanfords dean of admissions "to a great extent its an honor code " but threats to that code often start in high school according to a survey of high schoolers by the josephson institute of ethics in los angeles of students admit to cheating on tests and more than say that within the last year

become soft on cheating he cites a desire to give students a second chance a reluctance to commit resources to cracking down and the fear of crossing parents who direct anger at schools rather than at kids when improprieties are brought to light "what you allow you encourage " he says last year at campbell hall a year old episcopal school in north hollywood calif long time college counselor vince garcia was fired for putting false information on student recommendations mr garcia who was well regarded by colleagues at other private schools cited awards students hadnt won and quoted teacher

and columbia "fake degrees grade inflation employment titles or dates that arent true weve seen it all " says krolls brian lapidus who oversees the division medical schools have also raised their guard last june the association of american medical colleges asked all of its members to include criminal background checks in their admissions processes admissions officers say they have ways to identify heavy handed parental editing embellishments and outright lies tainted applications can be easy to spot because they lack "internal validity" a polished essay may raise eyebrows for example coming from a student with mediocre english grades a simple internet search can be used to spot check athletic activities or scholastic honors the latest innovation downloadable sat writing samples since the standardized test added a written component two years ago colleges have been able to compare students writing proficiency on their sat essays more or less guaranteed to be their own work with the prose that accompanies their applications the pressure to create a memorable application is growing as admissions brochures trumpet the importance of factors such as leadership writing ability and out of school activities as a result colleges have helped fan the perception that exotic pursuits and flawless essays are more important than ever lloyd petersen a former director of admissions at yale and vassar says the crush of applications "forces people to do things that they wouldnt normally do " filling out applications charlie covey mentioned his nascent modeling career the high school senior in roswell ga says he signed with a modeling agency in atlanta last fall though he hasnt yet booked a job on the advice of a private college counselor he added the agency to the applications"work experience" section "ive done headshots " says the year old who has been accepted to the university of georgia university of southern california and new york university "i felt kind of bad because i didnt have tons of stuff like a lot of my friends " last year sonia mindens heart fluttered when she received a solemn letter from the university of california undergraduate admissions staff the note asked her to verify the experience she wrote about in her application essay an archaeological dig in switzerland led by a stanford professor ms minden who had a gpa and

lie " she says ms minden it turns out was among some applicants the uc schools randomly picked for its authentication program the students are instructed to submit material to confirm details in one of seven application categories such as volunteer history and personal statements though the program started in theres barely a mention of it on the uc application one sentence in the instructions notes that students may receive a "request for further information " susan wilbur the uc director of undergraduate admissions says the point is to "send a message that were committed to the highest degree of integrity " ms minden says the certification process was disconcerting mostly because she didnt see it coming "it was kind of a stressful time " she says the professor who led the dig wrote a letter on ms mindens behalf and now she is a freshman at her first choice school uc san diego some transgressions are clear a few years ago the massachusetts institute of technology asked applicants to come up with their own essay question two picked an identical topic "what if superman had sex with lois lane " both students excerpted material from "man of steel woman of kleenex " an essay by author larry niven both were rejected marilee jones mits dean of admissions calls the episode "hilarious " but worries that colleges have helped ratchet up the pressure of applications in an effort to discourage puffery she reduced the number of lines mits form gave students to list extracurricular activities "kids felt like they needed to fill up all of them " she says for all the steps colleges are taking to safeguard admissions theyre also eager to boost applications which in turn increases their "selectivity" rate an important factor in school rankings some colleges fear that aggressive screening could scare off potential students says john barrie chief executive of turnitin com a web site that high schools and colleges use to check papers for plagiarism the nine year old site which screens more than student papers a day added an admissions essay service in over the last three years mr barrie says the site has screened more than admissions essays and found included at least one

in new york and miami says she occasionally sees parents tacitly encourage their children to stretch the truth on applications the most troubling cases she says involve students who feel theyre at a disadvantage because theyre not lying last year a white client in miami was distraught because her friends were falsely identifying themselves as hispanic "she asked me with a straight face why cant i do that " says ms norman a former admissions officer at barnard college admissions officials at the haas school of business at uc berkeley saw the desperation first hand in admissions director jeff pihakis tried to call an applicant to tell her she had gained admission after several failed attempts he reached a woman who gave him a cellphone number for the applicant looking again at the file he
