why no wendys finds vanilla so exciting dublin ohio for nearly four decades wendys international inc served only one kind of frosty a vanilla and chocolate hybrid thicker than a milk shake yet creamier than most fast food ice cream no matter how many customers pleaded with him wendys founder dave thomas refused to add another flavor fearing it would slow operations behind the counter but now struggling to connect with younger diners wendys is revamping the frosty along with the rest of its menu inspired by the success of starbucks corp s frappuccinos wendys is adding new flavors of frosty that come with wide straws and bubble shaped tops and tinkering with a coffee flavored frosty in its test kitchen at headquarters here the chain also is taking an ambitious stab at relaunching a breakfast menu the steps could be vital as the nations no hamburger chain faces pressure from investor nelson peltz whose affiliates have three seats on wendys board and are pushing the chain for stronger financial results fast food industry observers have speculated that wendys is a takeover candidate and the rumors could heat up in june when mr peltzs agreement not to acquire a controlling interest in the company expires a wendys spokesman said the company doesnt comment on speculation and a spokeswoman for mr peltz didnt respond to a request for comment wendys executives say theyre in the early stages of a turnaround akin to the resurgence that mcdonalds corp started in when it stopped building more restaurants and began improving existing locations but besides facing stiff competition from the reinvigorated mcdonalds wendys will have to overcome some self inflicted wounds part of the companys problem is that it has catered to the same generation of customers who began visiting wendys after its first location opened in "people in my generation in their mid s or late s frankly dont consume as much fast food " says ian rowden wendys chief marketing officer mr rowden wants wendys to instead focus on consumers ages to many of whom are drawn by cheaper food and internet marketing but some wendys franchisees worry that by targeting younger customers and pushing low priced items wendys could alienate its loyal older customer base and cheapen its reputation for quality franchisees also havent forgotten that an earlier attempt at breakfast during the mid s flopped when kerrii anderson took over as wendys chief executive a year ago the chain began tackling its biggest problems weak marketing a dearth of new products poor relations with franchisees tired looking stores and unfriendly employees behind its counters expanding the frostys palette became a key part of its effort to have more exciting products research showed that the frosty is the no reason people go out of their way to visit wendys behind the chains square hamburgers chicken offerings and salads but some longtime employees bristled when mr rowden suggested adding another flavor he says because mr thomas hadnt wanted one mr rowden pressed ahead convinced that an additional frosty flavor could grow sales the company polled consumers to ask which new flavors including vanilla cherry and strawberry they liked best wendys settled on vanilla mr rowdens original favorite because it is the most popular flavor of ice cream and in late began creating it with so much riding on tinkering with the signature dessert picking the exact type of vanilla took months suppliers brought wendys different varieties of vanilla flavoring wendys food scientists were surprised by the variation within the flavors some tasted like cotton candy or had notes of bourbon says cynthia ottavio a wendys director of research and development the worst had hints of smokiness or a slight taste of wet cardboard wendys narrowed the vanillas to two varieties and brought more than consumer testers into stark white tasting booths at headquarters the testers were told to take at least three bites of each sample before deciding which they preferred they picked the sample with a stronger cotton candy flavoring but a few said they didnt like the idea at all "vanilla is just not wendys " one tester wrote after sampling it since wendys launched the vanilla frosty in july frosty sales have increased mr rowden says vanilla now accounts for about of frosty orders a wendys spokesman said the company doesnt track whether that item is getting repeat purchases from customers but said vanilla frosty sales have been consistent the versatility of vanilla opened the door to other frosty creations the company has begun selling frosty floats a frosty mixed with soda to its menu ms ottavios team has been experimenting with a frosty with coffee flavoring and in february brought in suppliers to brainstorm new dessert ideas using it wendys also is testing bottled beverages and plans to add a new branded coffee its also bolstering its salad line to appeal to women breakfast will be more difficult to pull off wendys is serving buttermilk "frescuit" sandwiches french toast sticks hash brown patties and other items at about locations and hopes to have breakfast in more than half its north american locations by wendys has nearly stores wendys is the last major hamburger chain to enter the competitive breakfast business the last time wendys tried consumers griped that omelets took as long as minutes to serve and the chain dropped breakfast today many wendys locations arent positioned on the right side of the road to lure the most commuting breakfast eaters but mr rowden says new menu items are faster to prepare and easier to eat another challenge will be emphasizing wendys super value menu made up of items as cheap as cents to draw more cash strapped customers without jeopardizing what the company sees as a strength a reputation for higher quality food franchisees have pressed wendys to raise super value prices because they say they cant make money off of the menu but price is important to attracting younger diners and wendys has to compete with mcdonalds and other chains whose cheap offerings have been critical to their success "the differentiation of wendys from the other fast food concepts was the fact that we were recognized as being the quality player " says dave norman chief financial officer of crofton md based davco restaurants inc which operates wendys "for us to compete at that cent threshold we either have to give away food or we have to damage our quality image because we cannot purchase the quality commodities " wendys mr rowden concedes that emphasizing both quality and value may seem "at odds " he says wendys will add new items to its value menu that cost more than cents he also said that the chain plans to re emphasize the freshness of its hamburgers much as it did during early marketing campaigns yesterday wendys said preliminary first quarter same store sales rose at u s company restaurants while same store sales at u s franchise restaurants increased that marks consecutive months of positive same store sales growth though some wall street analysts are skeptical wendys can continue similar sales increases amid more difficult comparisons "we remain cautious " ubs analyst david palmer told investors yesterday mr palmer is concerned that franchisees profit margins arent widening enough to make them want to invest in the costly upgrades necessary to improve sales such as installing new store interiors wendys biggest challenge though may be reviving its brand without the presence of mr thomas the companys longtime pitchman the company plans to create new marketing that taps into mr thomass spirit "weve got to deliver the personality without him " mr rowden says "its not an easy thing to do "
