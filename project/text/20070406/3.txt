boos vs moos nyse deal gets one or the other at closing bell traders show their displeasure over euronext merger new york stock exchange executives faced two potential image problems as they prepared to celebrate the completion of their merger with euronext nv at the closing bell on wednesday first floor traders feeling bitter and abandoned by the computerization of trading have occasionally taken to booing chief executive john thain when he brings honored guests to the balcony over the floor to ring the ceremonial bell then there was the look of the floor itself in the wake of the big boards embrace of technology about one quarter of the or so traders and others who used to work the floor have had to look elsewhere for employment leaving a tangle of wires where computers and humans used to be that wasnt the ideal setting for exchange executives to welcome their new european merger partners at the ringing of the p m bell on wednesday but the nyse was ready in the days leading up to the big event it installed flat panel monitors at some of the idle workstations giving the appearance of hustle and bustle on the floor big board officials also handed out ceremonial cowbells to employees there was good reason to expect trouble back in march when the nyse bought electronic exchange operator archipelago holdings inc floor traders some of whom would lose their jobs as a result of the new technology booed loudly mr thain managed to keep smiling the traders boos drowned out the jingling of dainty silvery bells that the nyse had distributed as souvenirs beforehand this time around loud low register cowbells helped to mute the traders booing the bells even prompted some to conclude that the brokers were having a little fun some observers thought they heard traders utter "moo" rather than "boo " which seemed to fit the barnyardlike tone of the event the floor brokers meanwhile were prepared with their own prop earlier in the day they had constructed a dummy trader described as having a round pita bread face and sporting a jacket and tie and set him up at one of the "fake" workstations as they were referred to by some traders "if youre going to be phony well go along with your gag and make it even more ridiculous " said warren meyers a longtime floor broker who saw the fake trader being assembled but didnt participate in its creation "there are some obvious barren spots where people have left it looks embarrassing so they the nyse put some computers in " big board officials quickly banished the dummy from the floor traders say but not before the fake clerk was snapped by at least one cellphone camera in the end it didnt mar the closing bell ceremony which was attended by scores of euronext executives and other bigwigs from europe and elsewhere among them jan michiel hessels chairman of the newly formed nyse euronext entity and nyse board member bill ford of private equity firm general atlantic llc a big board spokesman offered an explanation for the new monitors that the traders considered to be props "were continually upgrading conditions on the trading floor " he said the episode highlights the increasingly emotional rift between floor traders and nyse euronexts management and shareholders the floor traders long held exalted status at the big board but big investors have pressed in recent years for more electronic trading which advocates say is faster cheaper and less vulnerable to cheating by dishonest floor traders now some floor veterans many from families that have worked at the big board for generations are taking their bitterness out on mr thain one of the leading advocates of electronic trading he recently allowed the exchange to shut one of its five trading rooms the resentment is most evident at the ringing of the nyses famous bell which is televised live every day when trading opens at a m and closes at p m every day different honored guests are invited to ring the bells frequently chief executives of companies on the first day their stock trades when the exchange has big news of its own mr thain sometimes takes to the podium with key associates to ring the bell himself in the hours before wednesdays event nyse officials asked brokers to refrain from booing a trader said many refused to comply but the cowbells were much louder and the clanging made the boos all but inaudible some brokers suspected that the cowbells served another purpose to deliberately make exchange guests and tv viewers think they were making "moo" cow sounds which though strange presumably dont bear the negative associations of rowdy boos if so the ruse worked during the event a cnbc reporter informed viewers that traders were mooing "this is not booing this is mooing like a cow " said cnbc on air reporter dylan ratigan an nyse spokesman said using the cowbells was "consistent with past merger celebrations" and that the exchange also decorated the exchange with international flags and had a large celebration in paris for much of the year old exchanges history the trading floor was the driving force of american capitalism and served as a powerful marketing tool for the nyse which offered tours to tourists and presidents alike and provided access to filmmakers spreading the image world wide "i think the floor is a fantastic icon and a fantastic symbol " said mr hessels "i personally hope it will be around for a long time " the reduction in the size of the floor is just the latest change for the nyse once a members only not for profit organization which is now a publicly traded company owned by shareholders in recent years it has closed its storied luncheon club where famous types from jack bouvier to dick grasso held court though a smaller version of the club recently reopened it has also eliminated services such as a coat check valet as well as an in house barber
