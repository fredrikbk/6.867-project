politics &amp economics battle for the airways fcc weighs responders needs against commercial spectrum use washington the fight over how to provide police firefighters and ambulance crews with a state of the art network for communications during a crisis will culminate soon in a decision by the federal communications commission spurred by huge communications gaps during the sept terrorist attacks and hurricane katrina in debate has raged on capitol hill at the fcc and within the telecommunications industry over how much valuable radio spectrum should be set aside to meet emergency services needs and how much to sell for commercial use now a large portion of spectrum some megahertz will become available as television broadcasters convert to digital signals from traditional analog transmission in the fcc is expected to decide by the end of this month how the spectrum should be allocated "the countrys not going to have this opportunity again in my generation " says janice obuchowski a telecom official in the first bush administration whose new company frontline wireless is one of several with mixed use proposals on the table "theres no other spectrum this attractive that is not occupied " ms obuchowski says a portion of the airwaves will come up for auction later this year when the fcc sells off megahertz to the commercial wireless industry analysts figure the auction could raise at least &# billion for the treasury and some figure it could approach &# billion wireless operators want the auction to go forward unimpeded the airwaves are highly sought because the frequencies and wavelengths being given up by television allow signals to penetrate buildings and travel long distances winning them at auction would allow wireless companies to expand their broadband offerings in densely populated areas and to reach rural areas with fewer cell towers lawmakers and regulators are torn setting aside spectrum to improve emergency communications would slash revenues to the treasury by billions of dollars it is a matter of debate how the public good would be better served congress has already pledged of the megahertz for emergency services frontline wireless and others say public private partnerships are the way to go frontline proposes to take half of the megahertz spectrum already set aside by congress for emergency purposes bid in the auction for an additional megahertz and then build a broadband network for joint use giving priority access to emergency services during crises backing the plan ms obuchowski joined forces with reed hundt fcc chairman during the clinton administration and haynes griffin a founder of vanguard cellular systems inc which was bought by at&amp t in lawmakers withdrew support last month for another plan cyren call which would sell half the megahertz that is designated for auction to a not for profit trust for joint commercial and emergency use with the latter getting priority access when disasters strike that plan is backed by nextel communications founder morgan obrien the association of police chiefs and other first responder groups continue to advocate for the cyren call proposal which would give them more spectrum to use down the road first responders see an explosion of wireless gadgets including sensors in firefighters clothing that would track their whereabouts and monitors that would send medical data on victims directly to a hospital but lawmakers rejected cyren call largely because it would require rewriting legislation to redistribute spectrum and in a way that would essentially benefit the single company that would manage the trust some lawmakers add that the megahertz already promised to emergency services is enough "the burden of proof rests with those who advocate that an even greater amount of spectrum should be made available to emergency services over and above what they have already been given " says rep rick boucher of virginia an influential democrat on the house commerce committee frontline argues that more spectrum is needed for a nationwide broadband network and that the private sectors involvement is crucial to funding the massive project for which congress has set aside &# billion by comparison new york city plans to spend &# million in federal money received after to build a broadband network for emergency services just for manhattan all eyes are on the fcc which could stipulate that companies that acquire spectrum give emergency services priority access that step would make the airwaves less attractive to commercial bidders fcc chairman kevin martin says the commission will decide this month in order to allow the auction to proceed by october "in general public private partnerships do serve a very valuable purpose and can achieve very good goals " mr martin says "but in this case youve got to make sure that when first responders have an emergency they get the kind of access they need " mr martin says the fcc could opt to set national standards and leave it up to local emergency services to find the funds to build a broadband service that fits their needs the fcc chairman says the frontline plan raises questions because it essentially seeks to limit bidders for the megahertz of spectrum fcc commissioner robert mcdowell says he likes the frontline proposal but it was submitted too late to allow the auction to be completed on time and to ensure the treasury gets its money by a legal deadline of june nevertheless mr mcdowell finds "intriguing" an alternative approach put forward by fcc staff that plan melds the frontline and cyren call approaches and would turn over megahertz of spectrum from congresss emergency allotment to a not for profit trust that would find a commercial partner to build the wireless network like frontline and cyren call commercial operators would be the primary users offering wireless broadband services to customers but emergency services would take over the network during crises the big wireless carriers like that approach best if only because it leaves megahertz on the auction block for commercial use corrections &amp amplifications new york citys emergency communications network covers the entire city and will be paid for with federal and city funds a politics &amp economics article friday on the effort to build a nationwide broadband network for first responders incorrectly stated that the new york network covered only manhattan and was paid for by the federal government wsj april
