the numbers guy ill take probability for &# alex odds of three way tie karpagam rajagopal almost made game show history on july thats the day "jeopardy" aired her second appearance after she won &# on the previous episode entering the final round of wagering the library specialist from fallon nev known to her friends as "jeeks " was tied with her opponents at &# the other two bet everything a typical strategy on the long running long studied tv quiz show but ms rajagopal feared she might face a pop culture question in the category " " which was years before she emigrated to the u s from india she bet &# all three contestants correctly answered the question about the cuban missile crisis albeit with variations on the spelling of khrushchev the show had just missed its first ever trio of co champions by a margin of &# ms rajagopals loss left her to face endless second guessing starting with host alex trebeks "darn jeeks i was hoping youd bet it all too " it persists to this day "my family and pretty much everyone from my town has never let me forget that im from nevada and i didnt know how to wager " ms rajagopal says in good humor what has become known as "jeekss rule" in the event of a tie bet all or nothing is commemorated on "jeopardy" fan sites and the online trivia hall of fame last month she was watching the show when jamey kirby anders martinson and scott weiss each finished with &# and became the shows first trichampions they got their winnings and a rematch which got better than usual ratings the ap covered the trio and they appeared on cnn the news outlets repeated a number released by the shows distributor sony pictures television the probability of such a three way tie was in million has lightning really struck once almost twice in the shows run of about episodes would we really have to wait about another years at the shows current rate of episodes per year for another three way tie not likely david k levine the washington university economist who made the probability calculation at the request of the show cant recall ever having watched "jeopardy " prof levine assumed that each dollar amount between zero and the contestants total was an equally likely wager that all three contestants entered final jeopardy after the initial two quiz rounds with roughly &# which he was told by the shows staff was a typical scenario and that all three got the question right then he figured contestant would have a in chance of wagering the correct amount to finish in a tie with contestant if that happened contestant in turn would have a in chance of choosing the bet that forced a three way tie multiply those two probabilities and you get in million after that number was publicized prof levine heard from fans of the show who pointed out that wagers are placed strategically not randomly and in increments of &# sometimes with &# added on to prevent a tie he told me "to be honest its all questionable " sony pictures also consulted gary lorden a cal tech mathematician and consultant to the cbs show "numbrs " prof lorden a "jeopardy" fan who submitted his more sober estimate two days after sonys deadline says he was "stunned" by the million number he used a similar method to prof levines but figured each contestant would be choosing from among bets multiples of &# in a range of &# to &# his result in that sounds more reasonable but any effort to quantify the likelihood of the three way tie will be confounded by unpredictable human nature who could have forecast ms rajagopals reaction to the category " " or mr weisss strategic and selfless decision to wager an amount that could force a three way tie the year old computer scientist says he realized his two opponents tied at &# were likely to bet it all and decided to bet &# of his &# rather than the more common shut out wager of &# "i just thought wow i have this opportunity to make this happen that has never happened before " skeptics who think mr weiss is rationalizing a flawed bet should know hes a "jeopardy" buff who knows the betting schemes and who was less excited about winning than about the hope since fulfilled that hed get a notation next to his name on the "jeopardy" fan site j archive mr weiss saw another potential benefit a three way nonzero tie meant theyd all get to keep their winnings "i just gave away &# to two people " he says mit game theorist david mcadams adds "for the front runner tying may be better than winning since it allows him to play again against relatively weak competition " in the rematch however mr weiss led going into final jeopardy but mr kirby overtook him and went on to win &# the three remain friendly and have kept in touch mr weiss who calls himself a "math guy " says human unpredictability complicates the probability calculation about this piece of "jeopardy" history he asks "what are the odds theres someone else like me who would do that " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily
