how sweet it isnt maker of equal says ads for j&amp js splenda misled chemistry lesson for jurors a battle between makers of artificial sweeteners stands to turn bitter next week as a trial begins over what a judge has termed a veritable "sugargate " the fight pits merisant co the maker of equal and nutrasweet against health care giant johnson &amp johnson which sells market leader splenda merisant alleges that a j&amp j consumer products unit mcneil nutritionals llc deliberately confused consumers over whether splenda is a natural product the dispute could prove to be a black eye for j&amp j at a time when sales tactics at its drugs and medical device units are already under scrutiny revenue from splenda is a tiny slice of j&amp js &# billion in annual sales but the case is the first in a string of pending suits that could threaten the reputation of a highly visible product splenda entered the market in touted as a breakthrough because the process used to make it includes sugar ads for splenda carried the line "made from sugar so it tastes like sugar" followed by "but its not sugar " unlike other artificial sweeteners splendas chemical composition can stand up to heat and freezing making it suitable for cooking capitalizing on that advantage mcneil has rolled out a series of related products a bakers bag in a sugar blend for baking in and a brown sugar blend in the brand is an ingredient in over products including those of coca cola co and nestle sas edys brand and its offered at food chains in the u s including outlets of starbucks corp and mcdonalds corp splenda was also adopted widely by popular diets such as the atkins nutritional approach on its web site atkins permits dieters to choose most any artificial sweetener but says "the atkins preference is sucralose splenda the only sweetener made from sugar " mcneil and merisant dont break out sales for their products but splenda is now the runaway leader in the sugar substitute category with &# million in u s sales according to market research firm information resources inc while equal brought in &# million merisant alleges that splenda sales shot up in after mcneil shifted marketing tactics to more aggressively and inappropriately tie splenda to sugar for example splenda ads dropped the final "but its not sugar" statement from their tagline and around a new campaign took off that was packed with sugar imagery "what are little girls made of splenda and spice and everything nice " went one ad others featured images of children putting splenda in their drinks and being fed treats baked with the sweetener merisant also alleges that splendas sweet taste has nothing to do with whether its chemistry includes sugar mcneil says that it has used the same promotional claims for splenda "made from sugar tastes like sugar" and "made from sugar so it tastes like sugar " in all packaging and advertising since its launch it declines to comment on having dropped the "but its not sugar" line mcneil stands by its claims merisant lodged a complaint with the national advertising division of the council of better business bureaus in late four years after splendas launch and two years after privately complaining to mcneil mcneil then sued merisant in puerto rico seeking a judgment that its ads are not misleading and alleging that merisant complained after a judge in puerto rico had barred merisant from selling a product with packaging that closely resembled splendas merisant responded by filing suit in the u s district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in november where the case will now be heard before a jury mcneil then consented to the dismissal of its case in puerto rico according to a memorandum by federal district court judge gene e k pratter jurors will have to endure a heavy duty chemistry lesson one of splendas main ingredients is sucralose a chemical entity manufactured in a lab that mcneil makes from sucrose or table sugar its patented technique replaces some of the chemical groups found in sugar with chlorine creating a substance that mcneil says is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate and has no calories merisant alleges that splenda shouldnt be able to claim that its "made from sugar " since sugar is not one of the ingredients on its product label and the use of the phrase misleads consumers into thinking the product is natural or contains sugar mcneil said in a statement that splenda is made from pure cane sugar by a patented process that makes three atomic changes to the sugar molecule all sides agree that splenda is not a natural product a web site run by mcneil called splendatruth com states that sucralose "is not natural " and that splenda marketing materials "do not represent the product as natural " but the chemistry may not be intuitive to the average consumer and merisant argues that mcneil has intended for consumers to be confused some of mcneils own documents may bolster that argument judge pratter noted in a march ruling sending the case to a jury trial "merisant cites to internal mcneil documents or third party documents provided to mcneil that indicate that at the very least mcneil was aware that the perception existed among consumers that splenda was natural or was not an artificial sweetener " judge pratter wrote she cited an advertising presentation by an outside consultant for mcneil that listed among "carefully considered decisions" the choice to position splenda as "not artificial " the presentation said "think of it as sugar without the calories" and the message should convey a "strong natural healthy playback " other documents show company executives walking a fine line an april letter from mcneils then president colin watts told merisants then chief executive arnold donald that "splenda has never been promoted as natural " but shortly after a document cited by merisant from mcneils files to the court noted that the consumers perception of splenda as "not an artificial sweetener" was one of the largest gains in response to the companys marketing a may email from an outside consulting firm to mcneil executives discusses perception research for new packaging for splendas sugar blend for baking product the consultant wrote that there is "some confusion" among consumers about the main splenda product "about to of respondents think that base splenda contains sugar is a mix of splenda and sugar most likely due to our made from sugar tastes like sugar messaging " the consultants report states eric paul mcneils head of market research responded in an email on may that "youre still getting consumer confusion around base product ie you put the statement contains sugar in front of consumers as it relates to base splenda and youre going to get a sizable percentage agreeing with it " mcneil has sought to have the documents excluded from the trial arguing that the survey was flawed mcneil said in a statement that merisants allegations are "based upon its selective out of context quotation from documents obtained by its lawyers from mcneil nutritionals files" and that none of them reflect an intention to confuse consumers "to the contrary the documents demonstrate that mcneil nutritionals consistently rejected experimental advertising approaches that might have led to consumer misunderstanding " mcneils arguments and court filings claim that merisant waited too long to bring suit having realized belatedly that it had been outmaneuvered on the marketing front the trial will provide a test for some other cases now pending the sugar association and mcneil have filed suit against each other over advertising the cases are scheduled to be heard in november by the u s district court for the central district of california the sugar associations suit claims that mcneil engaged in misleading advertising to draw consumers away from sugar mcneil alleges that the sugar association and its members engaged in false advertising aimed at misleading consumers about splenda
