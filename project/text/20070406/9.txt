ahead of the tape long weekend and jobs data will fuel angst today poses an unusual dilemma for investors the biggest economic report of the month the labor departments jobs data for march comes out early in the morning in the u s but stock investors wont really be able to react to it until monday that is because trading on the new york stock exchange is closed for good friday meanwhile treasury bond trading ends early with few staffers manning bond desks that market is susceptible to wider than normal swings "those light volume days tend to be the ones where you get moves that are out of whack " says thomas higgins chief economist at payden &amp rygel in the past year says mr higgins the monthly jobs report has generally caused bigger moves in treasury bonds than any other economic report adding to the market peril is uncertainty about the economic outlook a year ago economists surveyed by the wall street journal said the probability of a recession in the next months was around in march theyd raised the odds to recessions go hand in hand with job declines meaning todays report could matter a lot analysts surveyed by dow jones newswires estimate businesses added jobs to their payrolls in march after a gain in february economists believe job growth picked up a bit in march after bad february weather constrained hiring if theyre right that would help put recession worries to rest pushing long term interest rates a bit higher while possibly helping stocks but beware of downside risks usually in march construction workers start to fan out across the country to break ground on new homes housing market troubles probably meant there was less hiring than is typical for this time of year economists run the risk of under accounting for that either way theres going to be lots of time and nail biting before its all sorted out and the trades are logged worlds big central banks are in wait and see mode the operative words for the worlds big central banks increasingly look like this wait and see the federal reserve has said its pretty much in neutral while it sees how the economy performs meanwhile both the bank of japan and the european central bank have interest rate setting meetings next week and neither is expected to make a move the ecb raised its target short term interest rate to last month most economists believe it will raise rates one or possibly two more times this year to or but not until later the boj tightened in late february when it brought its target rate from to a still uber low it doesnt have nearly the same political autonomy as the fed thanks in no small part to its missteps of the s its hands are likely tied until after julys parliamentary elections and if the u s economy sinks it could stay on hold for a while stable rates tend to be good news for investors especially ones who borrow cheap money in japan and invest it elsewhere something known on the street as a carry trade it helps explain why stocks have started moving up again justin lahart email scott patterson wsj com or justin lahart wsj com
