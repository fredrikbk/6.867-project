every business day sign up for the e mail here an international panel of experts this morning finally reached agreement on the dire and globe sweeping effects of global warming but not before government participants managed to soften some of the language to the exasperation of contributing scientists at midday hours after the promised deadline a final text of the report was still unavailable at the brussels discussion site and le monde reports overnight negotiation on the language had gone line by line among the government delegations rajendra pachauri chairman of the intergovernmental panel on climate change said approval of the accord the ipccs second of four reports on global warming "has been a complex exercise " while one frustrated participant told the associated press "the authors lost " several scientists objected to government delegates editing of the final draft and some said they would never take part in the process again the ap reports while the first ipcc chapter released in february concluded there is a probability that the burning of fossil fuels and other activities contribute to global warming as nature explains todays report offers the most extensive international effort yet to define the effects and thats where the ipcc scientists were clashing with governments specifically china russia saudi arabia and the u s the financial times and other media reported among the changes in language was removal of the phrase "strong evidence" in discussing how global warming would hurt biodiversity according to dow jones newswires anne jolis instead the finished report says "available evidence shows that global warming would have negative effects on biodiversity " the report does offer the first evidence that man made climate change is having a discernable effect on plants and animals around the world co chairman martin parry said adding "for the first time were no longer arm waving with models this is empirical data we can actually measure it " as the bbc reports the most vulnerable areas of the world he said are "the arctic where temperatures are rising fast and ice is melting sub saharan africa where dry areas are forecast to get dryer small islands because of their inherent lack of capacity to adapt and asian mega deltas where billions of people will be at increased risk of flooding " increases of just one degree to two degrees celsius can hurt the production of cereal crops at low latitudes even as it helps such crops at higher latitude regions like scandinavia "there is some evidence that cereal yields are already declining in semi arid areas " mr parry said the ipcc finds that by the end of this century the rising seas and spreading deserts caused by global warming could hurt the economic growth of all countries with poorer nations suffering the worst dow jones reports citing delegates those figures may undermine the white houses current arguments on the regulation of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming earlier this week president bush in discussing a supreme court decision on the subject asserted that any means of addressing global warming "cannot hurt economic growth " the report says areas of the world with rain shortages are likely to get drier even as threats of flooding severe storms and coastline erosion increase for coastal areas the ap reports a new study in science shows a broad consensus among climate models that "anthropogenic climate change" will have serious implications for water resources across the american southwest "if these models are correct the levels of aridity of the recent multiyear drought or the dust bowl and s droughts will within the coming years to decades become the new climatology" of the region science says the los angeles times notes that "the transformation may already be underway much of the region has been in a severe drought since which the science studys analysis of computer climate models shows as the beginning of a long dry period " what kerkorian adds to the chrysler bidding kirk kerkorian just cant keep his hands off the auto business and as low as his offer for chrysler may be it seems sure to roil the bidding mr kerkorian offered &# billion to take the struggling u s car maker off daimlerchryslers hands as the detroit free press puts it and that makes him the fourth known bidder with more aspirants expected to join the fray in a letter to daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche mr kerkorians tracinda investment company said it could bring experience expertise and financial strength to the company that "will greatly benefit chrysler and its employees suppliers and customers " in a separate letter to mr zetsche former chrysler finance chief jerry york who is also mr kerkorians right hand man on auto issues added that chrysler "needs a new owner with patience to do what is needed to turn chrysler into an independently viable company again " which could take five to seven years the free press says mr kerkorians bid looks likely to raise the stakes for rivals which already include cerberus capital management an alliance of blackstone group and centerbridge partners and auto parts supplier magna international as the wall street journal notes "mr kerkorian has a long track record as both a hard nosed investor and combative chrysler shareholder and his leap into the bidding could give daimlerchrysler more leverage in any negotiations with chryslers other suitors " the journal says in one way his offer echoes another prominent takeover deal these days sam zells agreement to take control of tribune that deal would leave much of tribunes equity in the hands of tribune employees and the journal reports that mr kerkorians bid "contains an unusual twist tracinda said it would offer the united auto workers union which represents about of chryslers employees a substantial portion of chrysler equity as part of a deal to lower the cost of providing health care for hourly workers " web watching undercuts the repeats anathema to some television viewers repeats are nonetheless a lucrative source of income for the networks and production companies that turn out the series or so they have been until now in the wake of television episodes migration to the networks web sites ratings for on air repeats are eroding variety reports "there are some shows i dont even bother tivo ing because i know i can just watch the episodes on the website " one network exec admits to the trade publication "at some point it has to have an impact on the ratings youre training the audience to watch these shows on other platforms " still the networks are charging for the ads that accompany the online streaming of their shows and many think that will ultimately be a bigger source of overall viewership variety notes "were trying to create a circle of life " abc scheduling executive jeff bader says adding that "there are many places to watch a show but primetime is where it begins " still variety points out online revenue doesnt come close to matching that generated by traditional television viewing on another potential old media new media battle line sam zell the real estate magnate set to assume control of the tribune empire last night told a silicon valley audience that there needs to be "a new deal and new formulas" between newspapers and internet companies the los angeles times reports "if all the newspapers in america did not allow google to steal their content for nothing what would google do and how profitable would google be " mr zell asked his answer according to the times not very tonight mr zell is scheduled to meet with entertainment mogul david geffen in what the wall street journal describes as "the latest in a series of discussions about the future of the los angeles times " perhaps the most prominent division of tribune people close to the situation tell the journal talks between the two men are a continuing informal conversation about

is i think people dont know right now how long this will last i believe that the thinking of those involved in the process was that it would be a period of months not a period of years or a year and a half or something like that so the honest answer is that nobody knows for sure it will depend on the circumstances on the ground " defense secretary robert gates told reporters yesterday when asked about comments from commanders in iraq that the "surge" in increased troop levels there may be needed well into and whether that affects overall military readiness "we will have the capacity to ensure that those who are going into iraq those who are going into afghanistan are properly trained for those missions but when you only have one year between or less between deployments instead of the two that you would like to have you then do not train to what we call full spectrum so that if an unexpected event were to happen somewhere in the world where you needed your full combined arms team that you had been training to that on a routine basis so you end up with your troops who are well trained for the mission theyre going to but you do forfeit some of the kind of training you would like to do just to have a little bit more readiness in case something happens that youre not expecting " gen peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said in response to the same question write to
