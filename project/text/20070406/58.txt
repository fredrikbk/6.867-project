recently announced plans to buy the boutique investment bank run by former new york mayor rudolph giuliani for an undisclosed price comes as local governments begin to look for new ways to raise money historically u s city governments have relied on municipal bond markets for funding now many are warming to the idea of selling infrastructure assets to private investors allowing them to get cash upfront to fund expenditures on roads and bridges alone the federal highway administration estimates &# billion is needed for upgrades through some of that will come from state run toll roads replacing freeways but increasingly states are looking to lease the assets to private companies that is a trend that is under way elsewhere in the world but many of the best assets have been snapped up the u s offers a fresh market for one of macquaries strong points though political resistance to private sector control over public assets is growing the market in the u s is increasingly competitive because the stable safe cash flows attract financial investors who apply debt to boost returns private equity firms are growing rapidly and other banks such as goldman sachs group inc and

think " in the coming year the banks earnings growth is expected to cool as the company is expected to sell off fewer assets in the year ended march asset disposals contributed a&# billion to macquaries earnings according to morgan stanley estimates which predicts that figure could fall in the next months still david humphreys an analyst who covers the bank at morgan stanley in australia believes macquarie could still surprise on the upside because of the volume of assets the bank has on its balance sheet for instance the bank just sold down its stake in mining services company boart longyear ltd s a&# billion initial public offering in the past nine months mr humphreys has upgraded his earnings forecast for the bank four times the growing u s investments come as macquaries
