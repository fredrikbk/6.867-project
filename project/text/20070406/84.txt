the new inflation equation were accustomed to finding the roots of inflation in too much money chasing too few goods for too long however weve brushed aside the issue of whose goods just our own at one time maybe but not in todays globalized economy in teaching inflations causes and cures economics professors have for generations invoked the famous equation of exchange with mathematical clarity it tells us that prices are directly linked to the amount of money in circulation and the speed at which we spend it so print money faster than the economy grows and the value of a dollar will fall luckily transaction velocity remains relatively stable over the years allowing us to conclude that inflation mainly depends on money growth an instrument of policy and the pace of economic expansion the implications are powerful and quite familiar first too much money ignites inflationary fires a path the u s traveled in the s second faster output growth dampens inflationary pressures a scenario played out during the countrys long lasting boom of the s this simple link between inflation and money and output has held a revered spot in economic doctrine because it offers a good representation of the forces determining prices at least for an economy where global interactions didnt matter much but were now in an age of globalization freer movement of goods services people and ideas stretches production to the far reaches of the planet china india and other newcomers with huge labor resources and productive capacity are becoming important players each year the part of our economy isolated from global competition becomes smaller it seems unlikely that inflation would remain a purely domestic affair in our globalizing economy research by a handful of economists like harvards ken rogoff has found important links between foreign production and u s inflation the empirical studies are changing some minds on the subject of globalization and inflation but we also need new doctrine an equation of exchange for the new economy a new formula emerges from an economic model being developed by the federal reserve bank of dallas it reveals something the traditional doctrine misses inflation varies inversely with growth not only in the domestic economy but also with growth in other countries the relative importance of domestic and global growth depends on four factors country size as a countrys share of the world economy diminishes overseas growth tends to produce a greater reduction in domestic inflation home bias foreign influence on inflation increases as consumers preference for their own countries products shrinks relative to imports ease of substitution the rest of the worlds impact on domestic inflation rises when consumers view foreign goods and services as suitable alternatives for domestic ones production tradeoffs foreign growth reduces domestic inflation more when labor displaced by imports is redeployed effectively into home export industries each of these factors in some way gauges the importance of foreign goods in domestic consumption a country that produces everything it needs will find that other countries output means nothing at all to its prices a country that consumes only imports will find inflation responds to foreign gdp growth alone the real world of course lies between these theoretical extremes the more imports come into play the more the world wide supply of goods matters to the price level demand pressures that bid up prices dont build as quickly or as powerfully when consumers can switch between domestic and foreign suppliers just as important increasing global interaction helps nations more effectively convert microeconomic productivity gains into macroeconomic ones it allows economies to better reorganize and squeeze more output from existing resources the more integrated nations become the more they can take advantage of each others technological progress by shifting labor and capital to industries with the greatest relative productivity countries that join the globalizing economy benefit from faster growth at home and abroad the s illustrate the benefit of focusing on global rather than strictly domestic output as the u s economy picked up steam policy makers worried about the prospect of an inflationary outburst the spike however never came and most analysts attribute the price stability to information age technologies that boosted u s growth but global economic interaction also increased in the s providing a productivity spur that boosted u s output and shifted consumption from domestic to foreign goods at the same time capitalisms spread raised growth rates in other nations most notably china like advances in domestic productivity global progress helps ease inflationary pressures an insight our revised quantity equation captures but the classical formula misses had we understood the links between foreign growth trade and inflation we might have contemplated the booming s with less anxiety about inflation we didnt pluck our globalized equation of exchange out of thin air it derives from the dallas fed models equations and computer simulations all economic models simplify the real world but theyre powerful tools for analysis ours provides new insights into the role of globalization in determining consumer prices the most closely watched barometer of inflation and a key measure of living standards its results hold even under flexible exchange rates and they apply regardless of whether there is a trade deficit an important tenet of the classical equation of exchange holds in a globalized world inflation still varies positively with money growth only domestic money matters a significant finding that suggests reckless monetary policy in one country wont spread across borders the classical exchange equation makes no distinction between producer and consumer prices no wonder with trade relatively small domestic production and consumption are the same and their prices move together the old formula led to straightforward guidance to achieve price stability central banks need only match money supply growth to the rise in national production getting policy right only required data on the factors affecting domestic gdp growth supplies of labor and capital any slack in the form of idle resources the pace of technological change and productivity gains our revised equation of exchange tells us that central bankers can no longer afford to contemplate inflation without regard to world wide output getting policy right will involve a great deal of additional data and overcoming blind spots about whats going on in key parts of the world we dont for example know as much as wed like about chinas capital stock work hours and rural unemployment we have no reliable estimates of the productive capacity in brazil india and russia all the data shortcomings will be maddening but they arent reason enough to deny the fundamental fact that globalization is changing the way our economies work the new equation of exchange may not simplify central bankers decisionmaking but its far better attuned to todays increasingly interdependent and interrelated world economy globalization has been changing how we consume as well as the way we do business its high time economic doctrine caught up mr fisher is president and ceo and mr cox is senior vice president and chief economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas see related letter "letters to the editor importing inflation" wsj april
