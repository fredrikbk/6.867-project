democrats at war democrats took congress last fall in part by opposing the war in iraq but it is becoming clear that they view their election as a mandate for something far more ambitious to wit promoting and executing their own foreign policy albeit without the detail of a presidential election their intentions were made plain this week with two remarkable acts by their house and senate leaders majority leader harry reid endorsed senator russ feingolds proposal to withdraw from iraq immediately cutting off funds entirely within a year he promised a vote soon as part of what the washington post reported would also be a democratic offensive to close guantanamo reinstate legal rights for terror suspects and improve relations with cuba meanwhile speaker nancy pelosi made her now famous sojourn to syria donning a head scarf and advertising that she was conducting shuttle diplomacy between jerusalem and damascus if there was any doubt that her trip was intended as far more than a routine congressional "fact finding" trip house foreign affairs chairman tom lantos put it to rest by declaring that "we have an alternative democratic foreign policy i view my job as beginning with restoring overseas credibility and respect for the united states " americans should understand how extraordinary this is there have been previous battles over u s foreign policy and fierce domestic criticism in the s these columns defended bill clinton against "the republican drift toward isolationism and political opportunism" amid the kosovo conflict but rarely in u s history have congressional leaders sought to conduct their own independent diplomacy with the speaker acting as a prime minister traveling with a secretary of state in the person of mr lantos yes congressional republicans have visited syria too but ms pelosi isnt some minority back bencher without a democrat in the white house she and mr reid are the national leaders of their party even newt gingrich for all his grand domestic ambitions in took a muted stand on foreign policy realizing that in the american system the executive has the bulk of national security power he also understood he would do the country no favors by sending a mixed message to our enemies at the time slobodan milosevic what was ms pelosi hoping to accomplish other than embarrassing president bush "we were very pleased with reassurances we received from the president that he was ready to resume the peace process " she told reporters after meeting with dictator bashar assad "we expressed our interest in using our good offices in promoting peace between israel and syria " she purported to convey a message from israels ehud olmert expressing similar interest in "the peace process " except that the israeli prime minister felt obliged to issue a clarification noting that ms pelosi had got the message wrong israel hadnt changed its policy which is that it will negotiate only when mr assad repudiates his support for terrorism and stops trying to dominate lebanon as a shuttle diplomat ms pelosi needs some practice mr lantos probably got closer to their real intentions when he told reporters that "this is only the beginning of our constructive dialogue with syria and we hope to build on it " the pelosi cavalcade is intended to show that if only the bush administration would engage in "constructive dialogue " the syrians israelis and everyone else could all get along this is the same syrian regime that has facilitated the movement of money and insurgents to kill americans in iraq that has been implicated by a u n probe in the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri and that has snubbed any number of u s overtures since the fall of saddam hussein in perhaps if he works hard enough mr lantos can match the visits to damascus that bill clintons secretary of state warren christopher made in the s trying to squeeze peace from that same stone in fact ms pelosi and mr lantos both voted for the syria accountability and lebanese sovereignty restoration act of that ordered mr bush to choose from a menu of six sanctions to impose on damascus mr bush chose the weakest two sanctions and dispatched a new ambassador to syria in a goodwill gesture in only later in the wake of the hariri murder and clear intelligence of syrias role in aiding iraqi baathists did mr bush conclude that mr assads real goal was to reassert control over lebanon and bleed americans in iraq with her trip ms pelosi has now reassured the syrian strongman that mr bush lacks the domestic support to impose any further pressure on his country she has also made it less likely that mr assad will cooperate with the hariri probe or assist the iraqi government in defeating baathist and al qaeda terrorists back in washington harry reid says his response to mr bushs certain veto of his iraq spending bill will be to escalate he now supports cutting off funds and beginning an immediate withdrawal even as general david petraeuss surge in baghdad unfolds and shows signs of promise if mr bush were as politically cynical as democrats think hed let mr reids policy become law then democrats would share responsibility for whatever mayhem happened next so this is democratic foreign policy assure our enemies that they can ignore a president who still has months to serve and wash their hands of baghdad and of their own guilt for voting to let mr bush go to war no doubt democrats think the presidents low job approval and public unhappiness with the war gives them a kind of political immunity but we wonder once we leave iraq americas enemies will still reside in the mideast and they will be stronger if we leave behind a failed government and bloodbath in iraq mr bushs successor will have to contain the damage and that person could even be a democrat but by reverting to their vietnam message of retreat and by blaming mr bush for all the worlds ills democrats on capitol hill may once again convince voters that they cant be trusted with the white house in a dangerous world
