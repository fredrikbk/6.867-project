satellite radio play has low key driver xm chairman parsons skilled problem solver may guide sirius deal as xm satellite radio inc and sirius satellite radio inc pitch their controversial proposed merger to regulators swashbuckling sirius chief executive mel karmazin has been the deals most prominent public face but it is xms quieter chairman gary parsons whose regulatory and problem solving background could help steer the deal to approval mr parsons has a long history of seeking creative solutions to thorny problems and a reputation for clever behind the scenes horse trading that produces results everyone can live with earlier in his career he worked with the late mci chairman bill mcgowan the visionary executive who fought to end at&amp ts monopoly in long distance today mr parsons works at a polished stone desk that once belonged to mr mcgowan "he broke down a lot of laws and government regulations in order to allow competition to come to telecommunications " says mr parsons of mr mcgowan similarly mr parsons sees the xm sirius deal as a way to create greater competition to traditional broadcasters who until recently had the airwaves to themselves but while mr mcgowan worked to break up a monopoly xm and sirius are trying to convince regulators that their combination wont create one key to the companies argument is their contention that they compete not just with each other but with broadcast radio ipods internet music services and other audio offerings the satellite companies say a merger would help consumers by creating a single strong company that would give people more choice on one platform now they argue consumers must choose between baseball on xm and football on sirius oprah on xm and martha stewart on sirius and bob edwards on xm and howard stern on sirius broadcasters strongly oppose the deal they fear a single stronger satellite service would cut deeper into their audience through the national association of broadcasters radio companies have moved their offensive into high gear bringing local broadcasters to testify in congress against the deal running advertising decrying it and sending out regular press releases maintaining that a merger would amount to creating a satellite radio monopoly that would hurt consumers siriuss mr karmazin has been the deals main spokesman at congressional hearings and the like and at first glance mr parsons an engineer by training seems like an unlikely choice to counter high powered opposition he is "a little bit more low key than most folks " says alex good president and chief executive of mobile satellite ventures of which mr parsons is chairman "but he is formidable " in his year career mr parsons has a history of taking on established players his leitmotif has been gearing up "a new entrant trying to compete against the entrenched interests " he says the pattern started when he joined telecom usa in an upstart early adopter of fiber optic technology it eventually became the fourth largest long distance company in terms of both subscribers and revenue after at&amp t mci and sprint when mci bought telecom usa in mr parsons moved to washington d c to work for mcgowan as an mci executive vice president for corporate and public policy in he joined american mobile satellite corp which provided satellite tracking and communications services to trucking companies cruise ships and fishing fleets the following year despite broadcaster opposition its american mobile radio corp subsidiary won a license to offer satellite radio services it later became xm satellite radio mr parsons developed a knack for sorting out tough problems when an amsc offshoot found so many companies had been granted rights to a key piece of spectrum that it was impractical to use mr parsons paid cash to some in exchange for relinquishing those rights so government regulators could reallocate their portions to his company and others mobile satellite ventures another company that emerged from amsc is developing a mobile phone service that blends terrestrial and satellite signals msv originally won a license for satellite service only but with some other companies persuaded the federal communications commission to let it add a network of terrestrial towers to complement the satellites making its phone service much more robust critics chiefly existing mobile phone companies say the provision amounted to a giveaway worth billions of dollars msv says the approval created a more efficient use of spectrum and produced other benefits such as additional ways for emergency personnel to communicate when regular phone networks become overloaded xm and sirius too have broadened their services beyond what many people expected when they won their licenses in both offer local traffic and weather services which furious local broadcasters say violates an understanding that satellite radio service would stay away from local programming the satellite companies say they never made such a promise a frustration for mr parsons is his companys low stock price xm went public in at &# a share today the stock trades at around &# "satellite radio has been enormously successful for almost everybody involved consumers the government got what they wanted out of it programmers car companies except for shareholders " he says "im not going to rest until theyre successful too " mr parsons says this was a major driver in getting him to consider a merger with sirius mr parsons believes regulators will come to see the value of a merger to consumers but if they dont he says it wont be devastating for the company xm says that by next year it will take in more cash than it spends jonathan jacoby an analyst at banc of america securities expects the company to generate &# million of operating cash on revenue of &# billion next year "i hope the merger goes through " mr parsons says "but were going to survive no matter what "
