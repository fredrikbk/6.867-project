weekend journal review theater avast ye matey this musical is bilge the pirate queen hilton theatre w nd st new york &# &# ah wilderness centerstage n calvert st baltimore &# &#  closes april new york has there ever really been a musical so bad that it was funny i mean an actual show not "springtime for hitler " "taboo" and "in my life" both began promisingly but my sense of humor was swamped by their sheer awfulness well before intermission "the pirate queen " on the other hand is a gift that keeps on giving it starts out dumb then gets dumber and at no time does anything other than preposterous ever take place on stage or in the orchestra pit if it were somewhat shorter it might actually be worth seeing but at hours i cant recommend it in good faith to anyone who isnt a a full fledged hit me again masochist and or b deaf "the pirate queen" is the latest effort from alain boublil and claude michel schoenberg the "les miz" boys it sounds very much like that fatuous faux opera only with fiddle harp and the maudlin squeal of uilleann pipes thrown in so youll know that its set in ireland the crummy sounding synthesized string section was presumably thrown in so youll know that youre on broadway mr schoenbergs yappy score runs more or less continuously throughout the show meaning that you get to hear the undistinguished cast sing thousands of leaden couplets and quatrains in between the heavy footed step dances "here i stand no crown no land and yet prepared to tender my unconditional surrender " thats as good as it gets as for the plot its a semi rehash of "the sea hawk " with maureen ohara replacing errol flynn tis an honest to god true story of th century irish feminism that ill be tellin you me fine lads and lassies grace omalley stephanie j block dresses up as a boy stows away on her fathers pirate ship proves that shes tougher than any six men and prettier to boot pals around with queen elizabeth i linda balgord and saves the emerald isle from ruin singlehandedly if politically correct blarney set to unmemorable music is your thing be my guest "the pirate queen" was blitzed by every reputable drama critic in chicago when it opened there last fall since then its been subjected to extensive and expensive show doctoring that reportedly knocked the cost of the production up to &# million yes eugene lees sets are gorgeous this makes me wonder might it actually have been worse before it got to broadway i tremble at the thought baltimore eugene oneill wrote only one comedy and its a near photographic negative of his greatest tragedy first performed in "ah wilderness " is an unabashedly autobiographical play about a turn of the century irish american family whose members include a charismatic patriarch a sensitive young author in the making and a drunken uncle any resemblances to "long days journey into night" are strictly intentional only this time oneill made it come out happy portraying the connecticut childhood he wished hed had instead of the one that scarred him for life yet theres nothing phony about the warmth of "ah wilderness " like thornton wilder in "our town " oneill wasnt afraid to show us the shadows with which his not so imaginary new england town is dappled and the result is a nostalgic yet emotionally complex comedy that is at once open hearted and open eyed "ah wilderness " requires four sets and a biggish cast making it hard to produce on a shoestring and meaning that it doesnt get done nearly as often as it should thats why i made a point of going down to baltimore last weekend to see centerstages revival which im pleased to say is tip top some of the acting is too broad but all of it works and tom bloom couldnt be bettered as nat miller the small town newspaper editor who isnt quite as provincial as he looks mr bloom is genial yet strong you never feel that hes coasting on his charm and his performance gives the play a hard core of credibility centerstage always goes out of its way to get everything right and "ah wilderness " is an especially fine example of the companys wide ranging resourcefulness oneills plays invariably run to the verbose but melia bensussen a director whose name is new to me keeps this one bustling along with unhurried energy while james noones quick change sets which suggest a grant wood painting retouched by mondrian add a tart touch of modernism to the proceedings lawrence j cione the onstage pianist and music director tosses off a hatful of gay s ballads in engagingly flashy player piano style and the well designed program which is crammed full of smart essays about oneill and his times is worth reading at least twice if youre not in the habit of thinking of baltimore as a theater town maybe you should think again ive never seen a bad show at centerstage and this production of "ah wilderness " is a model of what regional theater can and should be even if you dont care for eugene oneill and i dont usually its worth seeing mr
