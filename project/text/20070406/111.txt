weekend journal the wealth report palm beach vs the jungle students in exclusive town ponder plight of the poor dad worked his way up palm beach fla every year high school students around the country pore over upton sinclairs "the jungle " the stomach churning novel about life in the chicago slaughterhouses in the early s most come away with a better appreciation of socialism and a strong aversion to hot dogs but here in palm beach one of the richest towns in the world students have a slightly different reaction "i think upton sinclair took all wealthy people and set out to make them look as bad as he could " says henry a shaggy haired year old who comes from a wealthy palm beach family "were never told about the good sides of capitalism or the wealthy " "like philanthropy " says maia a chipper year old brunette in a perfectly pressed oxford cloth button down "my dad he gives to all these foundations and he helps all these people but they dont show that kind of stuff in the book " its "the jungle " palm beach style where silver spoons replace pitchforks and cries for justice and inequality are replaced by a budding noblesse oblige the median income in palm beach a barrier island off floridas southeast coast with a year round population of is about twice the national average the median sales price of houses last year was &# million every year eighth graders at palm beach day academy are assigned "the jungle" as part of their english and history courses while students in middle america who read the classic tend to dwell on the brutal working conditions contaminated meat and hopeless plight of the lithuanian immigrant jurgis rudkus palm beach kids raise other questions like are the rich inherently bad do our nannies gardeners and chefs mostly immigrants live better than jurgis how can the wealthy best help the poor through jobs or charity scott thompson a history and art teacher says he teaches "the jungle" to give palm beach kids a greater awareness of how the other half used to live and on a small piece of land packed with millionaire and billionaire families in a school that costs &# a year in tuition "the jungle" also serves as a prism for bigger issues like class capitalism and the growing wealth gap in america the top of american earners controlled of total personal income in the u s in the highest rate since according to data compiled by economics professors emmanuel saez and thomas piketty "palm beach is a unique strip of land and most of our kids come from very wealthy families " mr thompson said "we teach this book to give them a broad perspective to show them how fortunate many of them are " the discussion in last weeks class started with food in "the jungle " meat is shoveled from dirty floors sausage contains dead rats and workers who die on the job are boiled down into lard "some parents have complained that their kids become vegans after the book " mr thompson says james a soft spoken blond with surfer bangs offers a simple solution "dont buy low grade meat " he says "what if you cant afford it " mr thompson asks the students shrugged their shoulders then they turned to the plight of immigrants then and now "i felt really bad for the immigrants they had such a bad life " says ali a skinny outgoing blonde "the american dream is supposed to be about getting a better life " maia says "for the immigrants their life just kept getting worse the dream kept getting crushed " as for whether the same holds true today the class was divided their experience with immigrants comes mostly from their filipino nannies mexican gardeners and guatemalan cleaning ladies compared with jurgis working in a deadly factory the lives and pay for immigrants are far better today the kids say "immigrants can get educations today " maia says "they have more opportunities and respect today because of education " "but not everyone goes to a school like this " ali says working conditions for factory workers have also improved since the s they say as the government imposed regulations and worker safety standards "my dads working on a deal with a company that can test to see if a workers muscles were injured on the job " says a super achieving blue eyed blonde named liza "they didnt have those back then " coco a curly haired year old in a cable knit sweater offers another view "what about all the migrant workers in the sugar fields in florida " she says "they all come here looking for the american dream like jurgis and they get paid next to nothing and they all get stuffed into rooms its the same " the kids were more united on the question of capitalism versus socialism when "the jungle" came out in unions and socialism were on the upswing after the glaring inequities of the gilded age today despite a rising tide of populism in government and growing concentration of wealth at the top wealth is celebrated and capitalism is seen as inevitable especially in palm beach "everyone has a little capitalism in them " ali says "everyone wants to make money " henry cautions "it all depends on what family youre born into if youre born at the top youre for capitalism if youre on the bottom you probably like socialism more " even so most kids at palm beach day academy have a special faith in the ability of americans to rise up the wealth ladder the island has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decade from seasonal vacation town for blue blood families like the hearsts huttons and phippses to a year round home for younger "working rich" families with kids and businesses the parents of most of todays palm beach children made their money themselves rather than inheriting it and many rose from modest backgrounds "my dads family was so poor he had to wear shoes with holes in them " ali says "he worked his way up " and all agreed that despite the changes in government and society since "the jungle" was published one thing has stayed the same "there will always be someone at the top " says coco "and there will always be someone at the bottom its human nature " contact us at wealth wsj com
