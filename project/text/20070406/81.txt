the evening wrap employment easter egg online edition the good friday employment report turned out to be quite good indeed as it appeared to offset an armful of worries about the economy investors have been presented with a buffet of reasons to believe the u s economy is sliding down the tubes a charred housing market has been further scorched by the subprime mortgage meltdown flimsy capital spending numbers would suggest that businesses have lost their checkbooks and manufacturers have seen demand for pricey products like refrigerators and cars crash through the factory floor no matter employers added jobs to nonfarm payrolls last month a robust rate of hiring that suggests that worry that the economy is headed into recession is so much fevered babble its of course dangerous to draw sweeping conclusions from any single data point but hiring in january and february was revised up by a net jobs there was also good news on the wages front as average hourly earnings came in higher than the same time a year ago and the unemployment rate fell back to matching its lowest level since may nigel gault of the consulting firm global insight says the data should press the mute button on all that nervous chirping about growth slamming into reverse he wrote that if "businesses were pulling back on both capital spending and hiring then recession scenarios would gain credibility but businesses are still hiring the unemployment rate has fallen again and earnings growth remains solid " some economists pulling the report apart noted that the big rebound in construction jobs was probably a case of firms staffing back up after some bad weather in february snowed in many framers and masons and is therefore unlikely to be repeated david resler of nomura securities said that residential construction employment is still "continuing a year long downtrend that seems unlikely to end anytime soon " economists at bear stearns noted that nonfarm payrolls posted a monthly average

investors in fed funds futures backed out most of their expectations that the fed will cut interest rates before the end of this summer economists also seemed to be quite certain that the data mean that a rate cut isnt even a remote possibility drew matus a senior economist at lehman brothers said it "further limits the feds options " since the low unemployment rate and climbing wages will keep policy makers on inflation watch stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital is even more strongly convinced that the next few fed meetings will be pretty dull "with the labor market tight and if anything getting tighter and core inflation above the feds comfort zone there is no way the fed will ease for the foreseeable future unless we get a highly improbable economic collapse "

federal judge ruled that vonage holding will be allowed to continue servicing existing customers but wont be allowed to sign up any new ones after previously determining that the company violated patents held by verizon communications vonage said it is planning an immediate appeal its lawyers said the injunction posted by u s district judge hilton is almost as devastating as an injunction that would have affected vonages million existing customers "its the difference of cutting off oxygen as opposed to the bullet in the head " vonage lawyer roger warin said verizons lawyers had suggested the compromise injunction as a way to avoid shutting down the entire vonage network judge hilton said that he had weighed a number of factors in reaching his decision including whether a stay could in fact lead to vonages bankruptcy he also said he had to evaluate how the publics interest would be affected and decided that given the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry there would be
