weekend journal review film grindhouse revels in genres tawdry thrills gere brings real energy to hoax black book is observant on war grindhouse " an exuberant double feature by robert rodriguez and quentin tarantino evokes the exploitation flicks that used to play several decades ago in moldering theaters with flypaper floors thus a go go dancers leg goes missing during a zombie attack and the action is occasionally interrupted by title cards that proclaim "missing reel " that touch is more affectionate than factual since projectionists and sleazy distributors of the slasher horror genre didnt brag about such omissions little else seems to be missing from this work of wild eyed archaeology not the slime or drool spurting blood throbbing engines screeching tires or jeopardized women yet value has been added as well the most thrilling car chase ever committed to film a sequence that also shows by cutting to the psychosexual chase why fans embraced the tawdry genre in the first place the whole thing runs a bit over three hours goes by swiftly contains countless film references and includes hilarious fake trailers the first half of the program "planet terror " is set in a small texas town where zombies have been spawned by a chemical experiment gone awry mr rodriguez wore all the hats wrote directed produced shot and edited just as he had done on a &# budget for his debut feature "el mariachi " but this like its companion piece is far from a low rent affair its only made to resemble one with simulated scratches unless youre partial to pustules needle sticks and necrotizing lesions youll find plenty of dull spots in the elaborately choreographed loathsomeness at the same time though "planet terror" is enlivened and bedeathened by the bizarro husband and wife doctors played by josh brolin and marley shelton by freddy rodriguezs wray a mythic loner descended from zorro by way of spaghetti westerns and especially by rose mcgowans cherry the dancer whose munched off limb is replaced first by a table leg and then by a machine gun as heroines go cherry is in a class by herself and a grind house emblem straight out of krafft ebbing a beautiful babe whos both maimed and all powerful quentin tarantinos film "death proof " is much the superior of the two a high speed hybrid that juxtaposes comedy jeopardy a psycho killer and an action climax of remarkable emotional intensity the writer director also served as cinematographer unlike mr tarantinos convoluted "pulp fiction " this shortish film has a linear plot thats easy to convey so easy that ill pass on conveying it for fear of spoiling the grisly fun suffice it to say that the story starts in an austin restaurant where three attractive young women are making sweet music out of casual conversation no kidding the flow of language is at once musical and intricately feminine the psycho killer stuntman mike hes played with malign brio by kurt russell sits watching them at the bar while mikes lethal weapon his muscle car sits waiting on the street more than one chase ensues and more women become involved one of them is played by a real life stuntwoman from new zealand zoe bell she was uma thurmans stunt double in both volumes of "kill bill " her stunts look too preposterously dangerous to be real but none of the action is fake neither in the end are the nuclear explosions of rage and revenge that make thelma and louise look like rogue girl scouts real feelings such as those fueled the grind house furnace the hoax truth takes a holiday in "the hoax " this study of world class mendacity stars richard gere as clifford irving the writer who in the s faked an authorized biography of howard hughes mendacity hardly hints at irvings m o he embroidered on an epic scale told ever bigger lies with ever more indignant conviction about his access to the reclusive billionaire mr gere an actor with a quick wit and a nimble mind gets at this sociopath energy wonderfully well so in one sense my first sentence is a lie his portrait feels essentially true yet mr gere is also a movie star of uncommon charm and he makes his subject much more dynamic than irving has seemed to be in public in a " minutes" interview for instance thats included in the dvd set of orson welless "f for fake " its a good thing he does whether or not the truth always outs we dont always need it to at least half of "the hoax" is a giddy pleasure the director lasse hallstroem must have been as high on the storys savor the period details the workings of the publishing industry as clifford irving was on his own cockeyed enterprise william wheeler adapted irvings book of the same name its fascinating to watch the perfervid irving trying to channel howard hughes as he writes his bogus bio marcia gay harden channels shelley winters as irvings wife and alfred molina is sensationally funny as irvings co conspirator and sancho panza dick susskind that almost amounts to a co starring performance official credits notwithstanding but the narrative engine leaves the rails when irving like hughes plunges into paranoia though irving actually is the object of a high level plot and the style turns to the sort of intensely manipulated surrealism that charlie kaufman practiced not successfully in "confessions of a dangerous mind " if truth be told this story works best when its allowed to tell itself black book like it or not and i like it a lot "black book" made in the netherlands mainly in dutch and german functions as a kind of anti anne frank thats not to say paul verhoevens film is anti semitic to the contrary its valiant heroine is jewish a former cabaret singer and current drop dead beauty named rachel stein carice van houten whos been living in a hidden room with a gentile family in rural holland during world war ii but "black book" is serious about its subject in some startlingly unserious ways once rachel is forced to leave her hiding place she dyes her hair starts calling herself ellis de vries and attains as a resistance fighter a level of erotically infused heroism usually reserved for mainstream action thrillers mr verhoevens previous work in that stream includes "robocop " "total recall " "basic instinct" and "showgirls " and rachel is no more an angel than the nazi officer she falls for is a devil hes played magnetically by sebastian koch who was the admirable east german writer in "the lives of others " "black book" is its own kind of thriller the film is filled with the genres conventions suspense betrayal melodrama violence music and its hugely enjoyable from start to finish ms van houtens fire and beauty reminded me of the young helen mirren shes a certified star yet the script which gerald soeteman wrote with the director finds time to deal with dutch collaborationists to suggest the shades of virtue and vice that colored hollands resistance and to dramatize the chaos that accompanied the liberation as if that werent enough a preface and coda provide a reminder of what israels sanctuary meant to europes jews not so shabby for commercial entertainment killer of sheep thank goodness milestone film &amp video with some help from generous friends has made it possible for movie lovers to see first in theaters and soon on dvd a seminal american feature thats been all but invisible until recently charles burnett shot "killer of sheep " in mm black and white as his thesis film when he was a graduate student at ucla in the s though it won festival awards and was declared a national treasure by the library of congress the national society of film critics called it one of the essential films of all time the movie rarely showed in public partly because of poor print quality and partly because of legal problems involving music rights those problems have finally been solved and the film meticulously restored looks and sounds lovely in a mm blowup so what does it turn out to be after all these years a delicately poetic essentially plotless vision unblinking but not unhopeful of life in watts where little but the ghettos name recognition had changed a decade after the riots children play are they the sheep and poverty the killer while grown ups strive scheme and dream ill discuss this singular film in detail when the dvd is released in the fall but for now please seek it out if its playing in a theater anywhere near you theres more than enough beauty to fill the big screen
