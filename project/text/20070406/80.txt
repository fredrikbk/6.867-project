the daily fix stingleys death leaves columnists pondering his life and his legacy online edition darryl stingley died early yesterday at years after a hard hit on the football field left him paralyzed mr stingley a star receiver with the new england patriots was left a quadriplegic after an august exhibition game in which he was leveled by a helmet first hit by the oakland raiders jack tatum mr tatum wasnt penalized on the play which was legal in a more violent era while he released a statement yesterday expressing his sadness and saying that "darryl will be forever remembered for his strength and courage " the title of his first book sums up his attitude "they call me assassin " while mr stingley said he forgave mr tatum in order to move on the two men never reconciled in the boston globe bob ryan writes about the aftermath of that hit how mr stingleys foundation helped many chicago youths and what mr stingley meant to his extended family but mr ryan cant shake wondering about that awful moment when mr stingleys life changed "who among us could possibly imagine what it would be like to be darryl stingley to be a superb athlete just reaching the peak of your career and then find your life changed irrevocably by one incomplete pass and one questionable hit " mr ryan writes "one minute youre going out for a pass and the next instant youre in a wheelchair for the rest of your life i cannot imagine " ron borges article in the globe begins shortly after mr stingley got the news that mr tatum was in a wheelchair after losing his left leg below the knee "darryl stingley didnt say the human thing when he heard the news about jack tatum instead he said the right thing which is what has separated him from a lot of people for a long long time " was the play dirty you can see it here with commentary from michael david smith of aol sports minnesota vikings blog on si com dr z a k a paul zimmerman calls it awful and vicious but not uncommon at the time "in those days players used the helmet to punish each other and along with that philosophy went the desire to inflict maximum punishment on anyone in an unprotected or vulnerable position on the field " he writes "which played right into tatums style " at augusta national the first day of play ended with brett wetterich and justin rose atop the leaderboard with some of golfs best players farther back discomfited by stiff winds and speedy greens apparently there are exceptions to augustas draconian no cellphones rule as discussed in yesterdays fix brett quigley was allowed to take a call during a monday practice round but there were extenuating circumstances as geoff calkins explains in the memphis commercial appeal mr quigleys wife was in labor with their first child "quigley stayed awake right through dawn tuesday " mr calkins writes "and then well he heard his wife say something men dont often hear in those circumstances im fine honey you go play golf no really so it was that at p m thursday quigley walked to the first tee still wearing his hospital bracelet and became maybe the first player to accept congratulations before hitting his first shot at augusta national " in the kansas city star joe posnanski takes inventory of changes at augusta and notes that the added length took away the illusion that the old guard could compete at the masters "there was a wonderful illusion around here that time could stand still among the pines " he writes "ben hogan was years old in when he had his magical saturday shot low round of the tournament pulled within a couple of shots of the lead everyone in augusta went crazy sam snead was when he battled with a young jack nicklaus on that sunday in and of course people still remember that sunday when nicklaus was and shot in talk about crazy eights and it was so electrifying that nobody even remembers who won that masters it was mark omeara but you didnt care sure it was only an illusion none of those guys actually won the golf tournament nobody older than ever actually won the masters but it was a beautiful illusion the impossible seemed possible here well thats gone now this is one long golf course and the simple truth is that an old guy isnt going to win the masters an old guy isnt even going to come close " in the herald bruce selcraig offers an entertaining portrait of david feherty beginning with the puckish announcer jumping on a trampoline in a cheerleaders outfit for a tv ad and moving from there to golf alcoholism atheism and a rather unique rivalry with tiger woods while were on the subject of augusta click here to read our print colleague katherine rosmans marvelous tale of how she got her stepfather a round of golf at the fabled club after an offseason of hype and &# million spent daisuke matsuzaka made his debut for the boston red sox against the kansas city royals and the results were encouraging for red sox nation seven innings one run six hits strikeouts and a win "for the most part royals hitters appeared baffled " jeffrey flanagan writes in the kansas city star "they stood at the plate with that same puzzled look you get when you hand your dog the phone when they werent lunging or leaning they were waving weakly at his pitches but thats matsuzakas secret and its as old as pitching itself mess with the hitters head he will wind then pause then wind up some more then pause then unfurl his entire upper body as if hes heaving a piano only to squirt out a mph change up and when he really wants to when he really needs it matsuzaka also can bring it at mph " so far the philadelphia phillies arent living up to the hype hype created by phillies such as jimmy rollins and brett myers who spent spring training running their mouths about their rivals in the nl east the atlanta braves showed their umbrage with a three game sweep and now philadelphia is reacting in its usual sympathetic supportive manner "the phillies a team of exceptional promise again this baseball season continued their annual april quest to lower expectations yesterday " begins bob ford in the philadelphia inquirer adding "after losing the first two games in narrow extra inning fashion games that were essentially botched by an unreliable bullpen the phils showed their versatility yesterday this time the starting pitching let them down " given the state of their bullpen maybe the phillies could use pat venditte a reliever for creighton throws hard fastball hits miles an hour tumbling curve except when hes coming sidearm or relying on a biting slider sounds like a david cone array of pitches and arm angles except mr venditte is ambidextrous an over the top righty and a sidearming lefty in an entertaining article for the new york times alan schwarz anticipates all your questions how often can he throw how many warm up pitches does he get what kind of glove does he use and what happens when he faces a switch hitter "vendittes mound versatility could become an interesting test of baseballs trend toward specialization " mr schwarz writes "major league teams have long forced college stars who both pitch and hit players like dave stieb john olerud and brad wilkerson to focus on either pitching or hitting as professionals claiming that one is difficult enough but as bullpens become ever more segmented with left handed and right handed specialists entering games for only one or two batters apiece a pitcher who can do both for one salary would certainly be intriguing " tip of the fix cap to readers john falck ron marr and james gould and to the
