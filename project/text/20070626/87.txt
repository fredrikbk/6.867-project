the afternoon report stockpile squeeze online edition the housing sector appears to be suffering from two inventory headaches one is an enormous backlog of unsold homes the other a seemingly inexhaustible supply of bad news following on a report yesterday showing flagging demand for existing homes the commerce department said sales of new single family homes dropped last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of down from april when sales showed a surprisingly robust increase the decline was not as steep as economists expected forecasters polled by dow jones newswires predicted a plunge on average but much like yesterdays small slide in existing sales a benign headline masked more troublesome news deeper in the report builders have been scrambling to bring inventories in line with demand but the stock of homes for sale grew to a bit more than seven months supply at the current pace of sales that was only slightly fatter than the seven months inventory seen in may but appeared to be no source of comfort to the economists tracking the numbers "the supply problem may now be stabilizing but it remains huge " ian shepherdson of high frequency economics

increased that followed a dramatic fall in prices during april when many builders slashed prices amid their efforts to clear out unwanted inventory just the same richard moody chief economist at
