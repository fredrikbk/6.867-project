&# million pants every now and then a lawsuit comes along that should embarrass even the trial lawyers if that were possible the "great american pants suit" was such a case and its denouement yesterday was a bow to judicial sanity in roy pearson an administrative law judge in washington d c took a pair of pants to his neighborhood dry cleaners for a &# alteration the pants may or may not have been misplaced mr pearson sued the proprietors jin soo and ki chung claiming that their "satisfaction guaranteed" sign entitled him to between &# million and &# million in damages including &# million for mental suffering he turned down a &# settlement offer and noted "never before in recorded history have a group of defendants engaged in such misleading and unfair business practices " gosh judge judith bartnoffs page decision in mr pearsons non jury trial dismantles his claims she says his case was pursued "without regard to the facts or to any notion of reasonableness" and that he is "not entitled to any relief whatsoever " still that an officer of the court was forced to sift through the minutiae of claim tickets and pinstripes is itself a case for tort reform no doubt the missing pants will take their place in the twilight zone of american over litigiousness alongside such injustices as spilled coffee and "toothbrush abrasion " there are however serious lessons here judge bartnoff ordered mr pearson to pay the chungs miscellaneous court costs such as filing fees though not their actual legal bills which run to the tens of thousands of dollars she may do so at a later date but if not the chungs will have to counter sue "loser pays" rules would curb frivolous suits in the future more to the point and incredibly mr pearson arrived at his &# million using a compensation formula prescribed by d c s consumer protection laws the judicial system wouldnt be subjected to so many junk lawsuits if it werent so easy
