a nother very political show venice it isnt every day that you find yourself sitting beside robert de niro in a water taxi as he tries to lose two boatloads of paparazzi pursuing him in a slow speed chase down the grand canal or that bobby d asks you to explain matthew barney the shock jock artist now on display at venices peggy guggenheim collection whom the new york times once called "the most important american artist of his generation " "installation art and vaseline " i say which he repeats with a down turned smile then again it isnt every day that youre there for the start of the year old international art exhibition of the venice biennale when the renaissance city fills to the brim with contemporary art leading up to the official opening which took place june the art world descends on venice for its biggest most spectacular and certainly oddest schmoozefest and departs just as the gates open to the general public the biennale mainly takes place in the docklands past san marco and in a park nearby the giardini here the exhibition space is divided up among nations that maintain permanent pavilions and an international group show this year organized by robert storr dean of the yale school of art and formerly a curator at moma seventy six nations are participating this year spread out not only in the pavilions across the giardini but also in palazzos and other buildings throughout venice for the preview days which began on june hotels in venice booked up months in advance "collateral" art events filled the city mr de niro was in town with the gallery owner larry salander to meet with journalists and present an exhibition of work by the actors father the accomplished and under recognized new york school painter robert de niro sr the de niro show is now taking place at the san marco casa daste in the center of town timed to the opening of the biennale but unconnected to the official exhibition neither mr salander nor mr de niro even made plans to see the central shows of the biennale for many its been a long time since the biennale hosted must see art the biennale will remain open through nov but visit venice past the preview time and you miss half the point indeed while the biennale as an art fete may never be more important the biennale now faces stiff competition as a pre eminent international art show from more nimble gallery driven art fairs frieze in london the armory show in new york basel miami and basel in switzerland which took place a week after the biennale preview even dubai now hosts its own contemporary art fair the biennale has not been a "selling" fair since and with so much world wide attention now focused on the marketplace the exhibition has felt the pressure enter bob storr the biennales first american born curator at the preview press conference in venice mr storr spoke only in english as he introduced this years group show an exhibition he calls "think with the senses feel with the mind art in the present tense " the title is meant to bridge the gap as he sees it between "conceptual" and "perceptual" art "it is not a political show " mr storr promised but a "sober show at a time that lots of people are intoxicated by cash the cash will go away some day i hope the works in this show will not " in fact mr storr has put together a very political show meant as a catch all "think with the senses" is instead an international survey with an all too narrow tidy scope rare is the art here without a conceptual if not overtly political component the arsenale a former naval factory building that houses his shows less established artists comes off as a gantlet of gloom steps away from multimillion dollar yachts parked outside one of the first rooms here is dedicated to the theme of crashing airplanes by the artists charles gaines and leon ferrari there is a work that explores the "politics of flowers" by yto barrada there are machine guns by nedko solakov there is a meditation on the pinochet coup by melik ohanian there is a video of a child playing soccer with a human skull paolo canevaris "bouncing skull" there are portraits of tenured radicals like edward said and eric hobsbawm by rainer ganahl the other half of mr storrs group show which as usual is displayed in the padiglione italia of the giardini may contain more established artists but the message is often the same here in a video mr ganahl repeats the words "i am not a terrorist" in different languages at the biennale terrorists are the grievance group of the moment elsewhere raymond pettibon has graffitied up a room with a diatribe against american politics "america loves adores israel " "hillary clinton hillary kristol hillary kramer post op or same person" and "alan dershowitz david horowitz" are scrawled besides images of the star of david one can only imagine that anti americanism and anti semitism are the natural extensions of mr storrs understanding of avant garde art the national pavilions outside of mr storrs control do offer some relief at the french pavilion sophie calle has put together a chic piece occasioned by her break up with a boyfriend in a building off the arsenale the italians have created a sensuous exhibition by guiseppe penone a sculptor once associated with italys arte povera movement which sought to create art from common "poor" materials and a humorous for once meditation on the american political process by francesco vezzoli the russians have a sophisticated work by aes+f group computer artists who channel wagnerian mythology and symbolism the u s meanwhile under the aegis of the guggenheim museum and the state department has put on an uninspired posthumous show of felix gonzalez torres a cuban born artist who died of aids in mr storr promised to bring to venice a diverse display of international contemporary art but most of the artists in his padiglione italia gerhard richter elizabeth murray nancy spero can be seen in any major museum often in exhibitions organized by mr storr several of the younger foreign born artists in the arsenale now work and exhibit in new york mr storrs show at the center of the biennale will be a disappointment to anyone who believes there is a place for art outside politics the message here can also be downright bizarre in his opening statement mr storr maintained that "the social barrier to enter a gallery is enormous the barrier to come to venice is not " they must be laughing on their yachts at that one on my way out of venice past the parking lots of the piazzale roma and a world away from the biennale i met up with augustus rylands the year old anglo american son of the director of the peggy guggenheim collection this year timed to the preview days of the biennale mr rylands organized a modern and contemporary art fair called cornice it featured galleries "unofficially the biennale is extremely commercial " he told me as we walked up and down his tent of gallery stalls "to complain about art fairs is hypocritical to say the least the gallery is always the greatest champion of the artist " outside mr rylands showed me the mockup of a monument to a work by helidon xhixha sponsored by the young artists foundation in association with cornice the sculpture reconfigures the twin towers as a vertical american flag a stirring tribute destined for battery park city and unless i am mistaken it does not include a single reference to halliburton this summer should you find yourself in venice be sure to check out the scuola di san rocca the guild hall with venices original art installation a th century cycle of paintings by tintoretto culminating in a foot "crucifixion" and side shows like the de niro before making your way over to the biennale daniel buren the curator of this years sophie calle show once noted "increasingly the subject of an exhibition is less likely to be the exhibition of works of art than the exhibition of the exhibition as a work of art " if you really want to experience the latter in venice best get yourself on the preview list for mr panero is the managing editor of the new criterion
