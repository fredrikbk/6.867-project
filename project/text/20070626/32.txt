eyes on the road an ecotopian view of fuel economy in portland ore debate goes beyond gas mileage rules i paid a visit last week to a foreign land a place with volcanoes vineyards and rain forests where the natives hold social and political views at odds with the prevailing ideology in my homeland fortunately i didnt need my passport it was just a trip to portland ore a temporary perch in ecotopia the name coined by ernest callenbach for a fictional environmental utopia situated in the pacific northwest provides a different angle on the debate between washington and detroit over automobile fuel efficiency in washington and detroit the discussion has devolved into an argument about technology and credibility washington thinks the auto industry has more technology to reduce oil consumption than it wants to let on and therefore isnt credible when it complains that a new vehicle fleet that gets miles per gallon isnt feasible detroit quietly cheered on by toyota motor corp sees washington as a gaggle of technology know nothings grandstanding for political advantage without any understanding of the real world this argument is worth having but the two sides miss a critical point which is that "fuel economy" is really a code word for a more fundamental debate about the way americans live portland is a green place surrounded by temperate douglas fir rain forests and dotted with lush gardens portland is also green in the political sense more so than detroit at least years ago portlands political leaders blocked construction of a freeway through the heart of downtown and took other measures designed to limit suburban sprawl and put the automobile in its place as a servant rather than a master in portland was the first american city to craft a global warming action plan mayor tom potter recently told a congressional committee mr potter said that since portlands local greenhouse gas emissions are down portland isnt the garden of eden i spent a half hour or so stuck in rush hour traffic negotiating my way through a maze of intersecting highways where the freeways that ring portlands downtown interconnect portlands streets have plenty of cars and despite the complex land use rules the region adopted to limit sprawl there seemed to be no shortage of big box stores and shopping centers along highway west of town from the local press its clear theres tension between portlanders who fit the citys green image and those who want more freedom to do what they want with their property including developing parking lots or office complexes still portlanders who so choose can spend more of their time outside the confines of a car than i can as a resident of metro detroit the city has a light rail system that connects neighborhoods to downtown offices and to the airport at quitting time on a weekday the max light rail connecting downtown to the neighborhoods west of town was full the system has reported rising ridership that said the main highways are still jammed during rush hours portland has a long way to go to get the bulk of commuters to give up that "alone time" in the car portlands efforts to limit sprawl have helped to sustain the value of properties in the citys old neighborhoods which in turn has encouraged people to renovate older homes and apartments within walking or biking distance of downtown businesses to a tourist from detroit portland feels like a super sized college town not a city as i know it but guess what even detroit is trying to revive the "walk to work" lifestyle encouraging conversion of abandoned downtown buildings into loft apartments just last week general motors corp entered a partnership to develop residences along the citys riverfront within walking distance of gms headquarters in suburbia the nation where so many americans live homes and businesses are usually segregated that segregation is viewed as desirable even though it can turn a routine shopping trip into a minute drive the ecotopian urbanite by contrast accepts that within walking distance of home there could be a world class bookstore three coffee shops a liquor mart a grocery store an art gallery a service station a chummy neighborhood restaurant a concert hall a designer furniture outlet and a sex toy shop thats a sample of what i found walking around my downtown hotel the answer to your next question is because the shop had clever pg rated window displays facing the street in this ecotopian lifestyle the car becomes an occasional means of escape to adventure not a daily commuting appliance so are we ready as a nation to live like ecotopians how many of us could do so even if we wanted to try how long would it take for businesses and homes to move back together in central hubs otherwise known as cities how much money are we willing to spend on subsidizing urban mass transit and intercity bullet trains instead of subsidizing new highways how much are we willing to spend to make central city schools places that everyone wants to send their kids those questions are as important to the energy debate as whether gm can make a car that gets miles per gallon by the way the answer to that question they can theyre just afraid not enough americans will buy them
