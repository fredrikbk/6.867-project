politics &amp economics russias &# million airliner bet has high stakes superjet project tests kremlins broad effort to revive key industries moscow fighter jet maker sukhoi scored a victory at last weeks paris air show lining up the first foreign buyers for its superjet russias first new civilian airliner since the fall of the soviet union but the &# million superjet project isnt merely a commercial gamble it is also a high stakes test of the kremlins new industrial policy which combines state ownership with foreign technology and investors in an attempt to revive heavy industry the policys success is critical to kremlin efforts to diversify its economy away from oil and gas and breathe life into industries shattered in the anarchic transition from communism to a market economy besides aviation the shipbuilding nuclear military industrial and space technology sectors are all being reshaped according to broadly the same recipe "we do not want to lose these sectors we want to develop them and we want to do that with the help of private capital " president vladimir putin said earlier this month many of these industries were only partially privatized in the s but the firms struggled as stand alone companies now the government is consolidating these assets into large holding companies that officials say will improve efficiency and create global competitors in the case of aviation the industry has been consolidated into united aircraft corp which is owned by the state the government has pledged to plow at least &# billion of subsidies into the company over the next decade "we needed to unite all our resources in order to succeed on the world market " mikhail pogosyan sukhois director general and uacs first vice president said in an interview the superjet is a key test of whether this aerospace giant can deliver modern products that have appeal beyond russias borders viktor subbotin head of sukhois civil aircraft division hailed the air shows &# million plane deal with a small italian regional carrier itali airlines as a major breakthrough giuseppe spadaccini president of aeroservices group which owns itali airlines said that because of the planes low cost the firm had bought with an option for more itali also is discussing a deal whereby it would train superjet pilots and mechanics for other customers the only other orders for the plane so far are from russian airlines with close ties to the state the planes are due to go into production next year and uacs plan is to sell as many as superjets over years at about &# million each initially available in and seat models the plane is pitched at the competitive regional jet market squaring off against established rivals such as canadas bombardier inc and brazils empresa brasileira de aeronautica sa sukhoi has turned to a stable of foreign partners for technology and assistance on the project hoping their experience will help win over demanding foreign airlines and allay concerns about its inexperience in the civilian market sukhoi established its reputation during the cold war as the soviets top builder of fighter planes alongside mig the superjets interior is designed by b e aerospace inc of wellington fla its engines are produced by a joint venture that includes snecma moteurs a unit of frances safran sa and chicago based boeing co is serving as a consultant on technical training and after sales matters italys finmeccanica spa which is buying a stake in the superjet project will handle marketing in europe and service for any western buyers in time uac hopes the superjet will spawn a family of planes that will help russia rebuild its share of the world aviation market one idea is to stretch the superjets fuselage to create a plane that could compete with the smaller boeing and airbus a moscow based uac employs about people chairman sergei ivanov a first deputy prime minister is widely viewed as a leading contender to succeed mr putin as president next year mr ivanov last week said he wants russia to be no globally in civilian and transport aircraft by boosting its share to to of the market from about now that is an ambitious goal for a company that still isnt fully formed when uac is complete later this year the company will bring together famous soviet era manufacturers such as mig tupolev irkut ilyushin sukhoi and yakovlev under one roof so far though the kremlins enthusiasm for creating industrial giants isnt matched by a track record of building winners vladimir potanin a prominent russian industrialist last week surprised an investment conference by complaining that government interference in russian industry was undermining efficiency and last year the organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report that the russian state had a "poor" record as an owner of companies arguing that it tended to lead to corruption less efficiency and slower growth russian officials however point to successful european and asian industrial giants as models for their new holding companies in uacs case the kremlin has sought much closer cooperation with one of them european aeronautic defence &amp space co which owns airbus but when a russian state controlled bank bought a stake in eads last summer and showed interest in buying a larger shareholding european leaders reacted coolly to moscows advances airbus officials insist they are eager to cooperate with uac on projects like converting old airbus jets into freighters or developing new planes but russian officials say they would like to become full fledged partners and have threatened to dump their shares in eads if no deal pans out "its blackmail " said a russian aircraft industry official "russia is still trying to reach a deal but so far all discussions have been one way " daniel michaels in paris and gabriel kahn in rome contributed to this article
