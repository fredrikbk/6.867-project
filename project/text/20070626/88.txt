the daily fix bears waive tank johnson after an incident in arizona online edition compared with tank johnsons previous missteps driving in a zone while allegedly "being impaired to the slightest degree" to quote the gilbert ariz police isnt much but it was more than enough for the chicago bears who waived the defensive tackle yesterday three days after his arrest in arizona and with that mr johnsons confounding exasperating bears career is over in the chicago sun times jay mariotti writes that the bears "wasted two years trying to turn the problematic pinhead known as tank johnson into a law abiding citizen monday they admitted a defeat more lopsided than super bowl xli by cutting him and i hope they feel properly humiliated having spent too much time trying to help an unworthy con man when in retrospect they should have cut him before the playoffs and avoided a hellish six months " "noble as it is to try to save and redirect a life its pointless to continue when a troubled man child wont reciprocate " mr mariotti continues "before halas hall the nfl or anybody else can help johnson he must want to help himself he couldnt grasp the message even after days in cook county jail even after his name was dragged through the national media mud even after everyone from lovie smith to michael mccaskey to tanks teammates to the rev jesse jackson visited him in the slammer you just wonder where hes headed now with his professional name ruined and his reputation as a bungler of opportunities sure to chase away other teams will he find himself before a gutter finds him " chicago fans got better news on the field well sort of the cubs walked away with a come from behind win over the colorado rockies courtesy of a two out two run single from alfonso soriano but theyd led going to the ninth only to watch deep breath kaz matsui single matt holliday walk todd helton double garrett atkins single brad hawpe single and troy tulowitzki connect for a home run as al yellon sums it up on bleed cubbie blue "all is almost forgiven" "this is i think what makes baseball so great the game we all love the rockies down by five didnt quit a team in a sport with a clock down by a similar margin so late has no chance of winning but in baseball as long as you keep hitting or as long as the other team gives you a chance by making mistakes as long as you havent made that third out you can still win " he writes "both teams in last nights game lived by this and fortunately the cubs batted last " wimbledon began in soggy style yesterday though boston globes bud collins wouldnt be so gauche as to describe it that way he begins his column by reminding us that "as we know it never rains at wimbledon unless theres some moisture in the neighborhood in which case they call it unsettled conditions " from there he checks in with martina hingis and teimuraz gabashvili before settling on roger federer "currently he is in pursuit of bjorn borg the erstwhile angelic assassin of centre court " mr collins writes "by winning for a fifth successive time federer would equal the swedes parade as well as his major championships borg has wished federer well saying hell be here for the final if roger is pete sampras who goes into the hall of fame at newport r i july has admiringly conceded that the swiss big cheese will punch holes in his record majors and seven big w titles there are other multiple wimbledon winners to be considered willie renshaw won six straight and laurie doherty five in a row no word has been heard from willie or laurie but they may be operating in unsettled conditions " a change for all the partial roof of wimbledons center court is being replaced with a full retractable roof a process that will be complete in "the club has calculated that the roof will be the size of umbrellas and guarantee that at least some marquee matches can be played every day " john branch writes in the new york times "but with the old partial roof dismantled and the new one not built it has left the worlds most famous tennis arena al fresco for the first time in the year history of the building and if all goes to plan for the last time that has made center court the tournaments great curiosity which has as much to do with aesthetics and ambience than the effect that the old roof had on combating weather it was less a roof than an awning that covered most of the seats but left a large open sky hole over the court a sunroof of sorts but all too often a rain roof instead " the weekend saw the return of ken griffey jr to seattle where his year tenure made him a legend and quite possibly saved the mariners as a franchise the reaction from fans who hadnt seen junior since august a wild outpouring of love and griffey celebrated with two home runs sunday passing mark mcgwire for seventh on the all time list "this wasnt one last long farewell to ken griffey jr " writes steve kelley in the seattle times "hell be back there was too much leftover goodwill after the final out too many tears too much love for this to be the last time he plays baseball in seattle " in mr kelleys view "things have changed in seattle at after three kids and big league seasons griffey has matured and after a seven plus year absence the city fully understands what he has meant to the franchise griffey now knows he can return to seattle he can end his career with the mariners " if that sounds like idle talk griffey himself talked of finishing up as a mariner but some other columnists are offering caution flags "not that theres anything wrong with nostalgia romance and sloppy sentiment this weekend again proved there is crying in baseball but we interrupt this hallmark card moment to offer this suggestion whoa " writes art thiel in the seattle post intelligencer "good as he looked sunday he wasnt the ken griffey jr of or and certainly wont be in two years which is when he would likely be a free agent eligible to consider a return to seattle " in the tacoma news tribune dave boling goes beyond stats to sum up what griffey meant to the mariners "that smile is at the center of the singular image that serves as the foundation of this franchise " he writes "nothing conveys the history of baseball in seattle like the picture of griffey grinning as if hes about to dislocate his jaw flattened out under a dog pile of teammates after scoring the clinching run in the american league division series against the new york yankees the essence of it all is in that smile in that picture in the image of griffey grinning out from under the weight of his teammates all future mariners and every fan the team has had since that moment " in new york magazine chris smith dissects the relationship between new york yankees manager joe torre and his troubled on field child alex rodriguez to do so mr smith examines the yankee managers own youth beginning with a searing recollection joe torre stands at the top of a cellar stairway in marine park brooklyn
