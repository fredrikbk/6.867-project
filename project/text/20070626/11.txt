black amerindian and proud of building on tradition andy palacios story started sometime in the th century when a ship filled with africans bound for slavery was wrecked off the honduran coast and the survivors were taken in by the arawak indians or maybe it started even earlier than that when local legend has it that some african explorers arrived and decided not to go home either way the year old was born a garifuna a member of a unique afro amerindian people with a rich heritage of music and song who have long lived in guatemala honduras and belize and nicaragua too as mr palacio discovered in college when he went there from belize to train as a teacher and ran into an old man who couldnt restrain his excitement at hearing a youngster speak the garifuna language that man had long ago resigned himself to the fact that thanks to assimilation his generation would be the last in nicaragua to know and use it "this established a certain consciousness in me that there was the frightening prospect that we could wind up in belize like the garifuna in nicaragua " mr palacio says while waiting to go on stage with his band the garifuna collective in berlins quasimodo club "i did want to be a teacher but this seemed important and id already been composing songs for my own amusement " when in his mid s after a spell of teaching mr palacio became a star performing punta belizes home grown garifuna pop music "punta is similar to merengue or soca " he explains "in that theres a catch phrase with call and response its very up tempo not very sophisticated " it was at this point that he turned things around "i made a shift to establish to the nation that garifuna music wasnt limited to this form having been in the public eye gave me a great deal of credibility " traditional garifuna music is percussion based with beautifully harmonized vocals the language used in some song forms is particular to that kind of music furthermore there are separate vocabularies for men and women each of which contains long words denoting complex ideas its no wonder that in unesco declared garifuna culture and language a "masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity " mr palacio had set himself a serious challenge but not an impossible one in louisiana cajun and creole culture was dying out in the s and traditional irish music was similarly endangered in the s but in both cases a younger generation came to the rescue carefully balancing tradition and modernity nobody thinks of irish music as endangered any more and one has only to look at the many music festivals in louisiana to see how things are flourishing there gathering together a number of talented musicians from belize and honduras mr palacio formed the garifuna all stars in and made the rounds of world music festivals the response was good enough that he realized he was onto something and the group morphed into the garifuna collective which started recording five years ago with belizean producer ivan duran in hopkins village belize the group quickly discarded the electronic keyboards the all stars had used in favor of acoustic and electric guitars to support both the rhythmic elements and the melodies a task overseen by the talented rolando "chichi" sosa the results were released in february by the vermont based cumbancha label as watina and the collective has been on tour since then delighting audiences in america and europe a major u s tour kicks off in chicago on june in millennium park continuing to new york on the th for two shows one at the brooklyn academy of musics rhythm and blues fest and the other in manhattan at the club s o b s further tour dates are available at www cumbancha com if the show at the quasimodo is anything to go by americans are in for a serious treat the complex rhythms demand attention and quickly resolve themselves into a completely irresistible groove when the melodies kick in on top of them the lushness is overwhelming one of the most attractive rhythms the band uses is called paranda a rhythm both loping and up tempo thanks to the eccentric placement of its accents and when it makes its appearance so does the garifuna collectives secret weapon during the sound check at the quasimodo id noticed a little old man sitting quietly drinking a beer and at dinner afterward he sat across from me not saying a word back at the club after id talked to mr palacio i was waiting for the show to start when the man appeared from backstage and made his way to the mens room he stopped at my table and said very quietly "soon you will hear me sing " something of an understatement paul nabor is years old and a master of paranda song he stands hands spread wide opens his mouth and a reedy voice issues forth with such power youre afraid hes going to keel over he vibrates intensely and commands total attention and the more he sings the stronger he gets with all due respect to mr palacios stage presence mr nabor is a show stealer its no wonder they use him to close the performance as attractive as the garifuna collective is though the question of whether theyre being effective in their rescue mission remains "right after the record came out we played the bliss center for performing arts in belize city " mr palacio said "it brought tears to my eyes belizean people dont come out for belizean artists in those numbers and then theres dangriga the biggest garifuna community in belize some of my musicians are from there and one of them told me that when the cd came out he stopped by a rehearsal studio and heard a young band trying to work some of the songs out with keyboards " a second record with the collective backing a group of women singers is about to be released mr palacio who is also deputy administrator of the national institute of culture and history ruefully speculated that in five years hed probably be at his desk but then he corrected himself "this is what i want to be doing if we can keep this momentum for a couple of years " mr ward is a free lance writer in berlin and rock historian for nprs "fresh air with terry gross "
