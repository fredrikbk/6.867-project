drought wreaks devastation in west southeast economic losses mount as conditions worsen weather patter shifts the worst fire to hit the lake tahoe basin in a half century is the latest fallout from drought in the western and southeastern u s that is taking a growing toll on property and agriculture the prolonged dry spell is already costing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages in california alone the counties that were declared disaster areas last month reported an estimated &# million in crop losses due to a combination of drought and freezing temperatures while it is too early to tell how extensive the lake tahoe damages will be they are likely to be steep "obviously it will be in the millions" of dollars said jerry davies spokesman for the farmers insurance group of cos which like many carriers has dispatched claims agents to lake tahoe the timber industry has lost millions of dollars as well rayonier inc of jacksonville fla a forest products company with million acres of timberland nationwide has had about acres of timber damaged from fires in georgia and florida amounting to as much as &# million in damage so far in the lake tahoe area straddling the california nevada border a blaze believed caused by human activity sunday afternoon quickly spread through tinder dry pine forests a few miles south of the lake destroying more than homes and other structures winds that fanned the fire subsided yesterday but some homes are still threatened the fire threat in the heavily developed area is unusually severe because drought left the sierra nevada snow pack at of normal this spring meanwhile spring in four states alabama georgia mississippi and tennessee was the driest in years of record keeping in florida and georgia the situation has been deemed an emergency by state and federal officials the west is experiencing its sixth driest spring on record while recent government reports show the drought might be creeping into the midwest where farmers hoping to profit from the ethanol boom have planted more acres of corn than at any time since the end of world war ii already economic losses are mounting in georgia peach crops are smaller than normal peanuts were unable to germinate in the bone dry soil and wildfires have devoured valuable timber the water level in floridas lake okeechobee the second largest freshwater lake in the continental u s hit an all time low on june forcing lawn and garden enthusiasts golf courses and farmers to conserve water in alabama lack of hay is causing cattle farmers to liquidate entire herds drought has been a persistent problem for much of the u s in recent years this year some areas are parched while others are being hit by heavy rains and flooding some parts of texas have been declared states of emergency because of flash flooding indeed early in the spring many farmers in the corn belt worried that too much rain was going to prevent them from planting their corn on time the drastic weather can be explained partly by a summer weather pattern called the bermuda high that is sucking moisture from the gulf of mexico and dumping it on places like texas and the high plains the problem for drought affected areas in the southeast is that the bermuda high has pushed too far to the west so the typical widespread afternoon thunderstorms and rain havent fallen there meaning little drought relief many scientists worry global warming may be playing a role too the kind of severe droughts punctuated by torrential rain now hitting many parts of north america have long been predicted as consequences of rising world temperatures about of the southeast is in some form of drought compared with this time last year according to the u s drought monitor an agency affiliated with the u s department of agriculture and the national drought mitigation center at the university of nebraska lincoln during summer it becomes more difficult for areas to recover from the drought even if a front or a tropical storm comes through "if the drought continues as we go into summer the heat kicks in and then theres a vicious cycle of dry and hot weather that exacerbates the drought " said david levinson of the national climatic data center in the southeast drought has contributed to wildfires that have consumed more than acres of land the regions largest fire on record in georgias okefenokee national wildlife refuge water levels in swamps are near record lows exposing as much as four feet of peat which has caught fire in the west scientists say milder winters and earlier snowmelt in the spring have led to an explosion of fires from the arid southwest to the northern rockies a study published last year by anthony westerling a researcher at the university of california at merced and three others found that the frequency of large forest wildfires nearly quadrupled in the year period ending in from the previous years with the total area burned more than times larger in the more recent period among the hardest hit states is new mexico millions of pinon trees have died in the past few years following beetle attacks in the northern part of the state forcing homeowners in santa fe and other cities to spend thousands of dollars to remove them although new mexicos drought has been eased by unusually heavy snow and rain in recent months people in mountain resort towns in particular are worried about what may come next in cloudcroft n m residents are increasingly alarmed over the encroachment of a forestry bug outbreak on their resort village of about and the threat of a potentially catastrophic wildfire they say that has created "you have the enemy at the gates ready to come in here " cloudcroft mayor dave venable said experts say local forests are facing unprecedented waves of bugs first there was the fir looper followed by budworms and most recently a moth called nepytia janetae which alarmingly keeps eating all winter and which foresters say they have never seen before although many of the trees remain alive most could end up dying and thus leaving a huge tinderbox of fuel new mexico state forester arthur "butch" blazer said at vo lasalle farms inc in deleon springs fla about miles north of orlando owner steve crump has had to sell four of his cattle this year because he didnt have enough hay to feed them last year he got two cuts of hay compared with the normal four "theyre eating the palmetto bushes and the gallberries " mr crump said of his cattle "theres nothing else to eat "
