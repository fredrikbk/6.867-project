yesterday as shareholders digested a round of generally skeptical analyst calls the news sat even less well an early morning report from merrill lynch &amp co securities firm analyst guy moszkowski suggesting that bear should bail out the even more troubled sister fund got the stock off to a choppy start "in its two decades as a public company we do not believe bear has faced a situation of this magnitude " mr moszkowski wrote in his report then around p m edt as hundreds of investors dialed in for a conference call in which researchers at deutsche bank ag predicted a rough next couple of years for securities containing subprime loans or those made to the least creditworthy borrowers bear shares began dropping fast adding to the mix ubs ag analyst glenn schorr said that bear is already dealing with a number of issues including a weak overseas presence and "now this " because of its longstanding expertise in the mortgage world the missteps with its own subprime investments by bear

question of whether the more leveraged fund might also get such an infusion " wrote mr moszkowski in his note still mr moszkowski who maintains a "buy" rating on the company believes an investment in bear has a lot to offer and the firm could be a takeover target bolstering this theory is the firms price to book value of a level significantly lower than peers like lehman brothers holdings inc and merrill which trade at and respectively firms with low multiples often make attractive takeover targets bear he wrote "is small enough that it is a manageable takeover candidate even as its standing is strong enough to make it attractive for a bank attempting to materially improve its position in the u s capital markets " at the same time investors say that as the abx index drops pressure is building on hedge funds and others with exposure to the subprime market in this unforgiving climate it isnt clear if bear might take further hits from other exposure to mortgage securities
