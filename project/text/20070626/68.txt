increase its poultry prices that is the latest in a series of efforts over the last year by tyson to boost profitability and reduce its exposure to volatile prices for commodities such as corn which goes into food for the birds the financial upside of tysons plan isnt chicken feed americans will consume pounds of chicken per person in even though the price of a boneless chicken breast has risen at least in the last months mainly because of the higher cost of corn based food according to the national chicken council over the longer term tysons new initiatives ranging from increased advertising to the introduction of higher priced branded chicken could lead to stronger earnings and a higher valuation as investors stop viewing that company as a simple "protein" purveyor that supplies undifferentiated chicken beef and pork to restaurants and retailers "what theyre trying to do is become a packaged food company its really smart of them " says neil eigen who manages about &# billion in assets for seligman investments value investing portfolio seligman owns about of tysons shares tyson has come a long way since when don tyson son of the founder settled charges by the securities and exchange commission for aiding and abetting the firms failure to disclose more than &# million in personal perks under terms of the agreement tyson and the now year old mr tyson didnt

still maintains the equivalent of a "hold" rating on the stock the current share price reflects the better price environment for chicken and the near term earnings boost expected from the companys cost cutting initiatives but it could warrant a significant upgrade later if tyson succeeds in its longer term retail strategy "more consistent earnings should allow tyson to achieve a higher multiple over time " says farha aslam an analyst at stephens inc who has the equivalent of a "neutral" rating on the stock and doesnt own any shares in p m trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange tyson shares were unchanged at &# up for the year the shares spiked more than last thursday on speculation that the company could be a takeover target which tyson dismissed as groundless tyson which

lower than its median p e in the last months tyson says its "raised without antibiotics" campaign will mean higher prices for all of its branded fresh chicken which accounted for about &# million in sales last year according to david hogberg senior vice president of tysons fresh meals solutions business it will also mean higher prices on its deli rotisserie chicken cornish hens and marinated breaded and frozen chicken "eventually any chicken thats retail and raw with the tyson brand will be raised without antibiotics by the end of the summer " mr hogberg says adding that higher prices "will cover any cost increases" from the campaign mr zaslow the bmo analyst estimates that tysons price increases will cause retail chicken breast prices to rise to while pablo zuanic an analyst at j p morgan reckons the higher prices will affect up to of tysons total u s chicken production even if the prices pushed up tysons chicken margin by which mr zaslow says isnt unattainable "that wouldnt be immaterial" to earnings some analysts however doubt whether consumers will accept the higher prices even though tyson says of consumers want the new product trying to differentiate commodities
