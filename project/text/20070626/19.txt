business technology microsofts uphill battle virtualization leader vmware braces as giant stirs vmware inc recently woke up microsoft corp with a computer technology that is disrupting the status quo in the computer server business now vmware is hoping people like john halamka will keep the nine year old company from getting trampled by the stirring giant mr halamka is chief information officer of beth israel deaconess hospital at harvard universitys medical school several years ago he started using vmwares "virtualization" software to slash the number of computer servers that run the hospitals clinical research and finance software applications like many information technology managers mr halamka found that virtualization which essentially can make a single server behave more efficiently as if it were four or five or more computers led to lower costs and easier server management microsoft is scrambling to get into the market with its own virtualization software due later this year but even though microsoft software is prevalent in many corporate it areas the redmond wash companys virtualization technology will for now "still be a second choice for us " says mr halamka in part he says its unclear whether the early versions of the software will be reliable enough for his needs information technology systems like the one at beth israel deaconess are ground zero for a critical battle in the software industry one that will largely play out between vmware and microsoft how it ends could affect the freedom that it departments have in running alternatives to microsofts products and in turn microsofts grip on the business software market the battle will be highlighted in coming weeks when vmware now a unit of emc corp plans to sell its stock in a public offering vmware helped popularize virtualization in recent years beyond just making a single computer behave as if it were many more computers virtualization technology also allows software applications to be more easily shifted to other computers instead of tied to just one machine using the technology a company can cut costs by running fewer actual computers and have greater flexibility in how it manages the ones that remain as virtualization has taken off it has attracted large players such as intel corp dell inc hewlett packard co and sun microsystems inc which are all changing their products to better handle the technology meanwhile a mass of software start ups hoping to capitalize on the trend including xensource inc and swsoft are building their own virtualization software that has raised the stakes for microsoft for years its huge software business has been based on the simple model that one computer runs one version of its windows operating system but with virtualization technology a windows machine might have to share space with other "virtualized" versions of windows rival operating systems or other software that presents microsoft with short term challenges in how it charges for windows since multiple versions can now run on a single machine that could be a boon for microsoft to sell more licenses of windows as companies run more "virtual" versions of the software on single computers but the virtualization trend could marginalize windows as competitors such as the linux operating system or even apple inc s mac os find their way onto machines that once housed just windows kind of like multiple roommates competing for floor space in a single apartment linux distributor red hat inc for instance sees virtualization as a chance to get closer to equal status with windows within corporate computing systems in response microsoft is working on an array of virtualization technologies that it hopes can influence the trends direction it already has a few early attempts in the market but the one thats still under development is most akin to vmwares base line software microsoft will include a test version of the software code named viridian in an october release of its windows operating system for large servers known as windows server thats a tried and true microsoft strategy to exploit its established and widely used flagship windows products to get nascent products into the hands of customers microsoft has suffered some set backs with viridian in april it announced it would delay the test version from the first half of this year to october and had to drop some key features to make that date in an interview last week microsofts general manager in charge of virtualization mike neil said the company is on track to hit the october date and to ship a final version within six months of the test version "we are tracking very well " he said vmware isnt sitting still its racing to solidify its position with existing customers while signing up new ones before microsoft comes to market its also busy extending what its software can do beyond the basic task of allowing a server to run as if it were multiple computers one feature is known as "live migration " which vmware added in microsoft had to drop that feature from viridian a spokesman for palo alto calif based vmware declined to comment for this story citing securities rules dictating a "quiet period" before a public offering for now vmwares lead seems secure the company has a commanding share analysts estimate up to of the virtualization market "its very definitely an uphill battle " for microsoft says bob gill managing director at researcher theinfopro inc vmware has an entrenched position at large companies such as verizon communications inc in one business unit verizon has used vmware to allow servers to run the equivalent of versions of windows says kevin shine verizons vice president for open systems in another division the company is using both vmware and suns virtualization technology "well see what microsoft has to offer but i suspect vmware will have kind of a leg up at least initially " mr shine says "we have an embedded base" of vmware the u s marine corps meanwhile uses vmware on servers at data centers and expects over the next few years to gradually expand its use of virtualization from servers to personal computers says major carl p brodhun the team leader for virtualization at marine corps systems command in quantico va but since the corps uses "any number of flavors" of operating systems from windows to linux microsofts virtualization technology which will require use of windows for now doesnt fit into the marines plans maj brodhun says meanwhile others are also racing to gain a foothold before microsoft can "there are opportunities for existing players to take market share and also opportunities for new players to come in and replace existing names " says frank artale head of business development at xensource which makes virtualization software for linux and windows with such an industrywide rush the business customer is sure to benefit however the competition shakes out "the real winner in this is going to be the it department " mr artale says corrections &amp amplifications a test version of microsoft corp s virtualization software code named viridian and part of windows server will ship by the end of a business technology article tuesday incorrectly said the software would ship in october wsj june
