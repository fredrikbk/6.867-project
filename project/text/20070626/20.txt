can u s adopt europes fuel efficient cars whether by presidential order or congressional mandate car makers in the foreseeable future will likely have to build fleets that average about miles per gallon but what kinds of cars and trucks will gasoline guzzling americans drive to achieve that average the answer would seem to lie in europe where fuel prices are roughly double u s levels amid heavy taxation and more than half of the vehicles bought have diesel powered engines vehicles in europe meet the magic average of mpg but there are aspects of the european model that for now make it less likely to work easily in the u s for one thing cars in europe are more expensive pound for pound and typically far less powerful than the vehicles americans have come to expect in the u s today about of car and truck sales sport six or eight cylinder engines in europe of vehicles sold have a four cylinder or smaller engine according to the alliance for automobile manufacturers a trade group representing nine auto makers from three continents a main reason europeans buy smaller diesel powered vehicles is that fuel taxes are heavier on gasoline than diesel and diesel vehicles enjoy other tax breaks in the u s diesel fuel has at times cost more than gasoline add stern clean air regulations and diesels claim less than a market share in the u s according to wards automotive group a significantly higher gasoline tax is politically untenable in the u s so lawmakers are poised to regulate the auto industry instead the upshot for u s consumers american showrooms could increasingly feature more small cars gasoline electric hybrids and even without a tax incentive diesels but it could also mean smaller engines and decreased performance in big trucks industry observers say by annual increases mandated by the federal mileage regime known as corporate average fuel economy or cafe could increase market share for hybrids and diesels to and respectively according to global insight an automotive research firm today hybrids garner just about a share increased mileage regulations could add significant price premiums to vehicles as auto makers employ expensive technology to enhance fuel economy as much as &# according to global insight auto makers say that number could be higher exceeding &# jacked up prices could pressure not only auto companies but also dealers trying to move vehicles off their lots "if we have a big disconnect between what the consumer is asking for and what the manufacturers have been ordered to produce thats extremely difficult " says mike jackson chief executive of autonation inc the nations largest publicly traded dealership chain "thats sort of like if you want to do something about dresses in america mandating that we cant sell anything larger than a size eight if you dont put america on a diet at the same time you have a disconnect between the regulators and what the consumer is willing to do " indeed while auto advertisements increasingly tout fuel efficiency general motors corp flaunts the fuel economy of its chevrolet silverado pickup even though the truck doesnt get better than mpg consumers still appear to put a priority on size and power in a recent consumer reports survey said they plan to seek a more fuel efficient vehicle but only about half said they would sacrifice size or performance in that quest even as gasoline prices have jumped to record levels within the past month some analysts say sales of large sport utility vehicles have held up because auto makers have boosted discounts effectively rebating to customers the increased cost of the gasoline to fuel their machines against that backdrop auto makers worry they will have to invest considerable sums retooling plants to build more efficient but less desired models and possibly close some plants to reduce capacity of certain high selling gas guzzlers u s car makers could have to abandon some thirsty rear wheel drive cars global insight predicts and chrysler could have to close one of its dodge pickup truck plants "you ask could it be the end of the dodge ram as we know it i think thats a legitimate question " says john bozzella chryslers vice president for public policy in washington he added that chrysler might still have trouble meeting future stringent mileage rules despite adding new clean diesel engines to its light trucks auto makers also contend stricter mileage rules will force them to build less safe vehicles the crux of the argument being that lighter vehicles fare worse in crashes the national academy of sciences says technology exists to improve fuel economy without sacrificing safety but notes that high costs could motivate car makers to downsize vehicles to meet higher fuel mileage targets environmentalists say worries about performance and safety are misplaced "the auto makers arguments are scare tactics " says david friedman research director for the clean vehicles program at the union of concerned scientists an environmental group he says auto makers should heed national academy of sciences findings that better mileage can be achieved without skimping on safety or power but as congress and the white house talk up plans to increase fuel efficiency standards by as much as a year auto makers are countering with warnings about the cost a bush administration estimate says the industry could have to pay &# billion between and to achieve such increases detroits auto makers warn tougher mileage rules could be devastating at a time when they are bleeding red ink in their core north american operations even toyota motor corp and honda motor co models of fuel efficiency fear tougher rules depending on how they are written in one scenario cars and trucks would have to meet size based mileage standards instead of a fleetwide target chevrolet malibu sales for example would count toward a mileage average for the vehicles size class as opposed to all cars the system recently included in the energy bill passed by the senate would assign bigger vehicles lower mileage targets and tougher standards for smaller cars and could allow detroit to sell more profitable fuel thirsty cars and trucks without having to rev up sales of lower margin better mileage vehicles but the "attribute based" system favored by domestic auto makers could make it harder for foreign companies to meet annual increases because their predominantly smaller more efficient fleets would likely face higher standards "for us it would be more than and thats quite aggressive " says ed cohen hondas vice president for government and industry affairs in washington nearly all auto makers including asian and u s companies want the national highway traffic safety administration to have authority to lower standards if regulators in consultation with auto makers find targets unachievable but lawmakers on capitol hill have gotten tougher on fuel efficiency amid concerns over gasoline price gouging and global warming the senate in its bill mandated steadily improved fuel economy and left little room for regulators to lower them many in the house want to do the same and could try to insert tough fuel economy language into an energy bill when it comes to the floor the house energy and commerce committee headed up by john dingell a michigan democrat and auto industry ally had tabled auto fuel efficiency until the fall as political pressure mounted in washington over the past couple of weeks gm announced it would expand diesel offerings in its pickups and chrysler said it would add hybrid technology to certain vehicles and explore building a four cylinder diesel engine honda hopes to sell a clean diesel engine vehicle by
