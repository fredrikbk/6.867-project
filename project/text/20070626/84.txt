taking refuge in dangerous passions everyday jihad by bernard rougier harvard university press pages &# bernard rougier is the kind of scholar of political islam that should have created a frenchman who teaches political science at the universite dauvergne in clermont ferrand he is fluent in arabic and is willing to supplement his theoretical knowledge with analytical creativity and intrepid reporting his "everyday jihad the rise of militant islam among palestinians in lebanon" looks at a fascinating under investigated microcosm of the islamist landscape the world of the lebanese refugee camps is tremendously convoluted it has today become much like lebanon itself a battleground in a regional confrontation between iran syria and their allies on the one hand and the u s the sunni majority arab states and their allies on the other mr rougier is very good at examining the genesis of outside influences in ain al hilweh the largest palestinian refugee camp near sidon which is the focus of his study perhaps the most striking of those influences was that of iran which as long ago as created a grouping of sunni and shiite clerics to help advance its own interests in lebanon that a theocratic shiite regime should have had the foresight to make inroads into the sunni clergy and prompt them to collaborate with irans shiite lebanese allies showed not only that tehran could think strategically and contrapuntally but also that the camps were even in the s regarded as fertile ground for regional exploitation this process continues more intensely than ever with syria saudi arabia iran jordan and others manipulating key aspects of palestinian refugee politics in the lebanon camps mr rougiers valuable backgrounder makes this roiling activity more comprehensible "everyday jihad" is highly recommended even if it contains two flaws worth noting the first has to do with the inconsistency of its updating the book a version of mr rougiers doctoral dissertation arrives in u s stores three years after its publication in france this chronology is important because in syria withdrew its army and intelligence agents from lebanon ending decades of debilitating hegemony from damascus the syrian withdrawal by removing the final arbiter of politics in lebanon also substantially altered the political environment of the palestinian refugee camps groups that the syrians had stifled received a breath of fresh oxygen and the plo hitherto opposed by syria even appointed a representative in beirut that environment has been transformed yet again in recent months as syria in an effort to reimpose its authority in lebanon has provoked instability in some of the camps hoping to weaken the lebanese government while in several of the books passages the post situation is acknowledged in others the original text is left unchanged leaving us with jarring anachronism the second problem more profound goes to the heart of the books thesis this mr rougier sums up in his introduction "today it is no longer possible to speak of a palestinian society in lebanons camps so deep is the fracture between the palestine liberation organization and its hard core fatah on the one hand and the salafist militants on the other " salafist jihadists seek through moral or violent action a return to a purer also largely mythical islamic past mr rougiers argument is that the salafists with their transnational ties to distant militant centers such as peshawar pakistan and their loathing for nationalisms dividing the body of muslim believers have so gained in the camps that "a considerable part of the population has freed itself from the national palestinian framework and is no longer governed by a nationalist universe " this is quite a statement it is all the more so in that mr rougier correctly places palestinian islamist groups such as hamas and islamic jihad in the "nationalist" camp the ideological commitment of these groups to islam is subsumed in what they regard as the national struggle against israel but if the "nationalist universe" of the mainstream palestinian secular and islamist nationalist groups is crumbling as mr rougier claims then presumably the salafists represent quite a few refugees in fact all signs are that palestinian nationalism remains dominant in the camps and still enjoys support from most refugees its true that when mr rougier wrote his book in salafist groups had expanded their influence it is also true that during recent fighting in lebanon at ain al hilweh and most significantly in the northern camp of nahr al bared the deep degeneration of fatah was on full display a result of years of syrian coercion internal corruption cutbacks in income and much else but mr rougier never provides us with persuasive indicators proving the potency of the salafist phenomenon when compared with the nationalist one palestinians may be increasingly mistrustful of their mainstream parties particularly fatah and hamas but that does not mean they have swapped decades of nationalism for a global salafism in which palestine is only one among many struggles on the path toward a new islamic millennium despite these caveats "everyday jihad" is admirable for the density of its sociological detail and not least for the thoroughness of mr rougiers method he has immersed himself in a difficult topic pursuing it with scholarly rigor and near obsessive passion for example in the vaults of the center for the study of the modern arab world at st josephs university in beirut he unearthed an obscure newsletter published by islamists in the ain al hilweh camp few others would have done so though what better way to understand the salafists than to read what they write about themselves more important mr rougier visited the camp never easy particularly for a westerner asking about islamists perhaps most commendably he explored the curricula of the main sunni islamic institutes in lebanon read dissertations by students and perused lists on the gate of one such school to gather information on the students themselves their ages origins and places of residence "everyday jihad" is the work of a true sociologist not someone manacled to a desk satisfied with postmodernist circumlocutions on "orientalist discourse " one can challenge some of mr rougiers contentions but not the integrity of his research or the importance of his subject the title of the book though a literal translation is misleading in english idiom "everyday jihad" from the original "le jihad au quotidien" implies something banal routine mr rougiers merit is to have shown the contrary and to have braved forbidding subcultures to do so mr young is opinion editor at the daily star newspaper in beirut and a contributing
