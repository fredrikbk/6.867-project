easy money behind buyout surge a debt market booms clos spark worries of volatility and risk loan standards loosen the corporate buyout boom of the s was funded in large part by high yield "junk" bonds this time around another financial product is supplying much of the fuel collateralized loan obligations clos as theyre called are giant pools of bank loans bundled together by wall street and sold off to investors in slices they aim to spread default risk an inch deep and a mile wide last year more than half of the loans behind the record wave of buyouts were parceled out to investors as clos bankers say as corporate borrowing soars however concerns are growing that clos have made it too easy for shaky or debt laden companies to borrow money if economic conditions deteriorate those loans could sour and investors in the riskiest clo slices could face large losses that in turn could make it harder for buyout firms to borrow money "we are witnessing a loan market rife with liquidity and disproportionate power in the hands of borrowers arrangers and financial sponsors " said credit rating firm standard &amp poors corp in a june report s&amp p expressed concern that loans without strong covenants to protect lenders are showing up in clos the rating company urged investors to "drill down" while researching the investments and to "hold clo managers accountable" for questionable loans the past decade has seen headlong growth in markets for various complex financial products from derivatives to mortgage backed securities to clos these booming markets are mostly opaque investment offerings are private and largely unregulated trading is sometimes thin and the securities can be hard to value that makes it especially difficult to predict what will happen if market conditions rapidly turn unfavorable among clos for example modest moves in loan default rates can lead to big swings in value for investors in the riskiest slices at the moment default rates on corporate loans are very low and clos are producing juicy returns for investors nevertheless there are signs that nervousness is creeping into the market in april investors began demanding higher returns to hold the riskier clo pieces a sign that they were growing more worried an index tied to non investment grade corporate loans fell all last week according to markit group its administrator the index lcdx was launched one month ago and reached its lowest point yesterday the market for mortgage backed securities which are similar to clos but are backed by home mortgages rather than corporate loans is providing clo investors with a case study in how quickly values can tumble troubles in the housing market have driven down the value of securities backed by risky "subprime" mortgages last week two bear stearns cos hedge funds with substantial holdings of illiquid securities backed by subprime mortgage bonds had to scramble to stave off collapse after their assets lost much of their value bear pledged up to &# billion to bail out one of the funds in late april a bank of england report noted parallels between the markets for subprime mortgages and for poorly rated corporate credit heightening concern about the clo market clos are a form of collateralized debt obligation or cdo besides corporate loans cdos often hold mortgage bonds and junk bonds over the next few months the market for non investment grade corporate debt will be tested by the sale of roughly &# billion of new loans and billions more in bonds in several loan and bond sales in recent weeks including one to fund the buyout of thomson corp s thomson learning unit investors have demanded higher interest rates or more protections to compensate for the risk borrowing by corporations has soared in recent years and clos have played a big part since more than &# billion of loans have been packaged into clos up from &# billion over the prior four years according to data provider dealogic investors searching for higher yields have put so much money into clos that even weak companies can get loans at relatively low interest rates last winter for example ailing ford motor co was able to borrow &# billion in a matter of days &# billion more than it earlier planned the companies behind many of these loans arent the only ones loaded with debt many investors who put money into clos use borrowed money to magnify their returns and the financial professionals who create clos use borrowed money when getting them started "clos are the equivalent of the savings and loans in this cycle " says kenneth buckfire of miller buckfire &amp co a restructuring advisory firm savings and loan institutions gobbled up a mountain of junk bonds issued to fund the s buyout boom a spike in corporate defaults during the recession of the early s coupled with a sharp downturn in real estate markets caused many s&amp ls to fail wall street has been pooling debt and parceling it out in slices for years creating securities backed by mortgages student loans and credit card debt among other things clos adhere to a similar template banks assemble pools of corporate loans then slice them into pieces called tranches investment management firms sell these pieces to investors clo investors are betting that theres safety in numbers that most corporate borrowers will pay off their loans even if a few dont last year just of corporations with credit ratings below investment grade defaulted on their debts the lowest annual rate since according to standard &amp poors if loans in such pools go bad the losses are initially borne by investors holding so called first loss tranches which carry no credit ratings modest changes in loan defaults or even changes in market perceptions can lead to big swings in the value and yields of these securities in exchange for bearing that risk those investors stand to earn higher returns over the past two years those tranches have returned more than annually according to moodys investors service risk averse investors can buy the more secure pieces which carry investment grade ratings many of them comparable to the top ratings of u s treasurys consequently the yields on those slices are lower these days banks that arrange large buyout financings hold on to very little of the loans themselves bank underwriting standards have slipped as banks have become mere intermediaries some executives at buyout firms contend banks enable and encourage private equity firms to load up their companies with debt these executives say "the banks making the loans dont have a continuing interest in how the loans play out because they dont have much money at risk " says dan fuss vice chairman of loomis sayles a large money manager "theres been a progressive deterioration of underwriting standards " because clos are sold widely the risk of corporate loan default reaches far corners of the investment universe consider champlain clo ltd launched in by a unit of british money management giant invesco plc invesco raised about &# million from institutional investors it used the money to fill champlain with pieces of loans to about companies many of them involved in buyout deals most of the loan pieces ranged in size from &# to &# million the clo bought a portion of &# billion in loans to nasdaq stock market inc which the stock exchange had used to acquire a minority stake in london stock exchange group plc last year it also bought pieces of loans that financed the buyouts of neiman marcus group inc hca inc sungard data systems inc and petco animal supplies inc nearly all of the loans carry credit ratings that are below investment grade or "junk " gregory stoeckle head of invescos global bank loan business declines to comment on the champlain clo broadly speaking he says "while an individual loan is inherently risky a well managed and properly constructed clo should diversify this risk and be able to absorb small losses " in the state of new mexico bought a &# million piece of the champlain clo a small slice of the first loss tranche and a bigger one of the most secure portion the new mexico state investment council manages about &# billion for various state entities a few years ago it invested &# million in eight different clos about of its assets at the time interest rates were very low but seemed likely to rise the states money managers decided to invest some in assets that would take advantage of that the clos offered floating interest rates which meant they would yield more if interest rates rose since the london interbank offered rate which the loans and clos are pegged to has risen to from thus far the states clo investments have returned about a year on average according to a spokesman for the state investment council the school for the blind and visually impaired in alamogordo n m which educates around children in the state has some exposure to the states clo investments because its &# million in assets are managed by the state david baland president of the schools board of regents says he wasnt aware of the clo investment but says the schools holdings are diversified enough that he isnt concerned about corporate loans souring "some loans may go bad " he says "but when it boils down to us if there were one or two defaults among the pool of loans it would be like a fly hitting a windshield " many clo investors are sophisticated money managers over the past few years hedge funds french insurance giant axa the california public employees retirement system and the general retirement system of the city of detroit have all poured millions of dollars into the riskiest clo tranches clos have "also brought in many novice investors who may assume theres not much risk here " says laird landmann co founder of metropolitan west asset management a los angeles fixed income manager "they will be the first to head for the exits if conditions change " more than a thousand u s companies were acquired in leveraged buyouts in a record &# billion of deals according to data provider dealogic more than &# billion was borrowed to pay for those buyouts according to s&amp p leveraged commentary &amp data more than total borrowings for the previous two years of buyouts combined this year through mid june &# billion of debt was raised to fund buyouts over the next few months more than &# billion in loans will be sold to fund mammoth deals such as cerberus capital managements acquisition of chrysler group and the privatization of slm corp also known as sallie mae many companies are counting on a large investor appetite for the debt to push their deals through "clos are a big pillar of loan demand if they slow down borrowing will get a lot more difficult for companies " says steven miller a managing director at s&amp p clos have been lauded by former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and others for dispersing risk michael milken whose underwriting of junk bonds at drexel burnham lambert inc during the s ignited that decades buyout boom has said that clos are among the most important financial innovations of the past quarter century the &# billion acquisition of sungard data systems in by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co illustrates how quickly and efficiently wall street can parcel out debt kkrs banks arranged &# billion in loans to fund the buyout within two weeks they lined up buyers for the loans clo managers bought about &# billion of the loans according to someone familiar with the financing within days the sungard loan exposure was spread over thousands of different institutions around the globe this person says "the commitments poured in very quickly when the deal was launched " says andy obrien co head of leveraged finance at j p morgan chase &amp co the main lender on the deal contrast that with kkrs landmark &# billion purchase of nabisco in which required &# billion in loan financing in that case four u s banks each committed between &# million and &# million of their own funds "we had to scurry around the world ourselves to get other banks to commit to between &# million and &# million each " recalls james h greene jr a partner at kkr "that only got us to &# billion we then had to go looking for smaller commitments " over the past few years buyout deals have been getting larger and larger and companies have been piling on more debt in relation to the cash they generate that leaves them especially vulnerable to rising interest rates and a slowdown in economic growth the buyout of univision communications inc by a consortium of investors earlier this year for example left the broadcast company with a debt level of times its annual cash flow twice the norm in buyouts done over the past two years according to standard &amp poors its possible that even a small increase in defaults could have a big impact on clos especially on the first loss tranches if investor appetite for these risky pieces diminishes it could become harder for new clos to be issued potentially choking off the buyout boom
