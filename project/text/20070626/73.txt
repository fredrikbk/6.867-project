road blockhead in a testy letter to no fewer than all states house transportation chairman james oberstar recently warned officials against entering public private partnerships for local road projects and said he may even "undo" existing agreements sounds like the minnesota democrat feels threatened public private partnerships or ppps are collaborations between a public agency and a private entity to fund highways and other infrastructure projects they can cover the operation and maintenance of existing roads or the construction of entirely new ones two of the countrys most prominent ppps are the chicago skyway and indiana toll road these deals have proliferated in recent years and today more than states allow private enterprises to operate toll lanes and toll roads tired of waiting on federal funds states from texas to georgia to virginia have used ppps to modernize roadways and alleviate congestion in a follow up to his ungentle missive mr oberstar released a "position paper" this month that fleshes out his "serious concern" that these arrangements "do not adequately protect the public interest " in reality mr oberstars main concern is protecting the political interests of himself and fellow transportation committee members all of them about one sixth of the entire house his committee is by far congresss most bloated and its main order of business is shepherding through the lard ridden highway bill every six years road financing got federalized back in the s for the purposes of building the interstate highway system today that system is nearly complete and transportation has become little more than a public works committee with the highway bill serving as a vehicle for members to hand out checks to favored constituents the last highway bill cost &# billion a third larger than its predecessor and included "special projects" bike paths museums snowmobile trails parking lots that totaled &# billion these days when the money does go toward actual road construction it is often of the "bridge to nowhere" variety which is why states are finding public private funding more and more attractive the biggest problem with the interstate highway system today is not connecting one city to the next its accommodating suburbanites forced to commute to a downtown area in bumper to bumper traffic but that situation might not be a priority for the person whos got the pull to get money from the feds hence ppps have become an attractive alternative for financing new capacity projects and thats what worries mr oberstar if this continues he knows ppps will make his committee less relevant in the transportation debate notwithstanding the congressmans self interest however the more public private partnerships the merrier revenues from gas taxes which support the highway fund arent enough to maintain the system let alone finance expansions making all americans pay for local road projects is unfair in any case ppps offer taxpayers more efficiency and accountability and if local policy makers can involve the private sector in paying for highway projects theres less incentive to raise taxes to fund new roads no wonder mr oberstar is against them see related letter "letters to the editor a great traffic tsunami is headed our way" wsj july
