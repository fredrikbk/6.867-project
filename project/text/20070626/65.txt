politics &amp economics republicans add further pressure on white house washington president bush faced a double barrel of dissent from republicans who challenged the administration to change course on its two biggest initiatives at home and abroad immigration policy and the iraq war over the objections of the white house house republicans said they will vote this morning on a party resolution critical of the immigration bill the president has been struggling to have called back up in the senate the administration had hoped to forestall such action given the timing of the senate debate but faced with pressure from their members republican leaders informed the white house that they will go ahead with the conference vote just hours before a closely fought senate roll call on proceeding to the bill the administration believes it can still get the votes needed to cut off debate and move to the bill but conservatives in the senate were openly delighted with the prospect of house republicans effectively endorsing their stand against the president "the white house has climbed way out on a limb and were going to cut it off " said sen jim demint r s c news of the planned caucus vote began to leak out last evening even as former senate foreign relations committee chairman richard lugar r ind delivered a critique of the administrations iraq policy on the senate floor warning "the costs and risk of continuing down the current path outweigh the potential benefits that might be achieved " "our course in iraq has lost contact with our vital national security interests in the middle east and beyond " mr lugar said "unless we recalibrate our strategy in iraq we risk foreign policy failures that could greatly diminish our influence in the region and the world " while less of a power today than when his party controlled the senate mr lugar remains a respected voice on foreign policy the year old republican didnt spare congress saying both the administration and lawmakers "must suspend what has become almost knee jerk political combat over iraq " a new policy is needed "outside the binary choice of surge vs withdrawal" mr lugar said but the fact that he didnt wait until september to give his address is significant the administration and military commanders in iraq pledged a progress report on the presidents strategy then but mr lugar said the prospects that that strategy will achieve its long term goals "are very limited " a white house loyalist and long time conservative mr lugar is cut from different cloth than many of the more strident republican voices in the immigration debate but in both cases mr bush is being challenged more not just because he is weaker in the polls but because of the strains imposed by his policies the immigration bill has provoked a grassroots revolt on the right because of provisions that would begin to legalize millions of undocumented workers in the u s and party leaders faced strong pressure from rank and file members demanding a vote that would separate them from the senate bill before going home to see constituents during the july fourth recess
