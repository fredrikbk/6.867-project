roberts rules david souter leading the four justice minority in yesterdays campaign finance case lamented that the supreme court had overturned its earlier ruling in favor of the mccain feingold campaign finance reform if only that were true the supreme court punched a hole in mccain feingold yesterday but it missed a chance to revisit its misguided decision upholding mccain feingolds overall restrictions on political speech justice antonin scalia summed up the matter succinctly in calling chief justice john robertss opinion for the majority "judicial obfuscation" in the name of "faux judicial restraint " whether fake or not the high court also tread lightly in two other first amendment decisions yesterday in hein v freedom from religion foundation the court rejected by a vote a suit against the presidents office of faith based initiatives but it declined to overturn an earlier decision on taxpayer standing as urged by some of the justices and in morse v frederick the court upheld a school districts right to restrict speech that seemed to advocate the use of illegal drugs and so upheld by a vote earlier decisions that granted schools latitude in controlling student speech all three cases stayed true to the roberts courts inclination toward incrementalism by far the most important case was federal election commission v wisconsin right to life which goes back to the summer of wisconsin right to life had generated tv and radio ads about judicial filibusters but because the ads mentioned senator russ feingold by name it sought a legal ruling to protect itself from criminal liability under mccain feingold if it ran the ads yesterday nearly three years two trips to the supreme court and two elections later it got its wish chief justice roberts wrote the opinion for the majority but his desire to avoid overturning the decision in mcconnell v fec was not shared by justices scalia anthony kennedy and clarence thomas and perhaps not even by samuel alito in other words the chief justice came close to representing a majority of one the good news is that all five all agreed that wisconsin right to lifes ads were protected under the first amendment and would not have fallen afoul of mccain feingolds restrictions on "electioneering" within days of a primary or days of a general election but the chief justice attempted to save the mcconnell decision by creating a "test" by which similar ads could be judged in the future his test sounds strict enough "issue" ads will violate mccain feingold "only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate " even this test however requires someone judges federal bureaucrats to sit down watch an ad and decide whether there is some other reasonable interpretation of the ad it is either too onerous with nearly every issue ad requiring vetting for the range of reasonable interpretations they admit or toothless in which case its hard to see why mcconnell and the relevant portions of mccain feingold should be upheld at all the four liberal dissenters argued for the latter interpretation since they favor restricting political speech but the most likely outcome is a flurry of lawsuits during next years election cycle in which advocacy groups on the left or right test the new roberts rules the result is almost certain to be that some portion of ads that might have run will not while others will either way the legal challenges will run well past the elections wisconsin right to life has now "won" the right to run its ads but far too late for it to do any good on that particular issue and it must still be left wondering whether its next set of issue ads will enjoy the safe harbor belatedly granted to the last batch chief justice robertss opinion ends with the grace note that under the first amendment the supreme court "gives the benefit of the doubt to speech not censorship " he adds "the first amendments command that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech demands at least that " wed put the emphasis on "at least " it says something about the contortions into which our first amendment law has been twisted that the chief justice can cite without apparent irony the words "make no law" while in the same breath upholding a sweeping restriction on political speech the core area of speech that the first amendment was intended to protect perhaps the chief justice wants to demonstrate his respect for precedents even bad ones but the price of his difference splitting will be more years of legal and electoral confusion on what ought to be a matter of bright line constitutional right
