climate changes are making poison ivy more potent poison ivy the scourge of summer campers hikers and gardeners is getting worse new research shows the rash inducing plant appears to be growing faster and producing more potent oil compared with earlier decades the reason rising ambient carbon dioxide levels create ideal conditions for the plant producing bigger leaves faster growth hardier plants and oil thats even more irritating although the data on poison ivy come from controlled studies they suggest the vexing plant is more ubiquitous than ever and the more potent oil produced by the plants may result in itchier rashes "if its producing a more virulent form of the oil then even a small or more casual contact will result in a rash " says lewis ziska a plant physiologist for the u s department of agriculture in beltsville md the latest research led by dr ziska studied poison ivy plants in maryland under different levels of carbon dioxide exposure one group of plants was exposed to about parts per million of carbon dioxide about the same level found in the atmosphere in the s another group was exposed to parts per million of co about the same level in the atmosphere today after about eight months leaf size stem length and weight and oil content of the plants raised at current carbon dioxide levels were on average to higher than the plants under the s conditions according to the study expected to be published this year in the journal weed science not only did the higher co level double the growth rate but it made for hardier plants that recovered more quickly from the ravages of grazing animals the latest research follows a duke university report last year that higher carbon dioxide levels create a chemical change in poison ivy that results in a more potent form of urushiol the oil that triggers an itchy rash in about of people exposed to it "it is more abundant and allergenic " says jacqueline e mohan who led the duke study and is now assistant professor at the university of georgia in athens poison ivy is difficult to identify hikers have long known the adage "leaves of three let them be " but poison ivy usually found east of the rocky mountains can sometimes have more leaves and look like a shrub or vine the leaves can range from one to six inches and be notched or smooth depending on the season they can be red or green one web site www poison ivy org offers cards with life size images to help identify the plant in its various incarnations long pants long sleeve shirts and socks can help but clothes need to be removed and washed to avoid contact with urushiol that may have brushed on clothing the oil can penetrate rubber gloves and boots so vinyl gloves are recommended if youre trying to remove the plants one treatment sold as ivyblock is rubbed on exposed areas before contact to prevent a rash a study found the treatment prevented or significantly reduced poison ivy reactions despite protective clothes and washing yale nursing professor patricia jackson allen still contracted a rash on her forearms after gardening this weekend the precautions prevented a more severe rash but "i havent found anything that works for me "" she says if you think youve come into contact with poison ivy wash immediately but if more than minutes has passed soap and water removes only about half the oil a study found that tecnu an over the counter poison ivy wash is about effective in eliminating urushiol two to eight hours after exposure goop a grease remover and dial ultra dishwashing soap were about effective according to a article in pediatric nursing rubbing alcohol also helps if exposure does occur over the counter topical lotions may provide some relief severe cases can be treated with steroids by a doctor email healthjournal wsj com
