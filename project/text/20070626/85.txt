taking the common out of commodity custom whiteboards set tiny factory apart from generic rivals the doctors on nbcs "er" series used a magnatag on set to keep track of patients this year the new orleans saints mapped nfl draft picks on a magnatag a colorado sheriffs posse swears by their magnatag for plotting search and rescue mountain missions "you can get to people faster " says volunteer norvan huff for years a little known company called magnatag visible systems in macedon n y has thrived making highly specialized versions of an item that couldnt be less special the erasable whiteboard in the commoditized world of office products this is no small feat basic cheap whiteboards flood the shelves of office supply stores there are dozens of higher end brands aimed at the professional market and classrooms so universal is the whiteboard as a teaching tool that ups has made one the centerpiece of its current ad campaign "whiteboard" to educate consumers about its services so how does a tiny manufacturing shop tucked away on the shores of the erie canal compete amid the fray the answer by taking the common out of the commodity instead of mass producing generic boards magnatag goes the opposite route selling whiteboard systems tailored for hundreds of applications from athletic scheduling and church groups to hospitals and mortgage brokers instead of a plain white surface magnatag boards are printed with customized grids and graphics and come with equally specific supplies such as magnets lettering symbols and card holders a manufacturing plant seeking to reduce on the job injuries might post a "safetycross safety motivational system " which uses a variety of green yellow and red magnets in the shape of a cross to highlight "accident free" days a sales operation with a large fleet of cars could opt for the "vehicle service monitor" with specific columns dedicated to inspection needs there are boards for advertising agencies and music instructors the white house communications agency this month purchased a x magnastaffer organizational chart so specific are magnatags applications that the companys year old founder wally krapf chafes at being dubbed a whiteboard maker "our boards are problem solving devices they are aspirins for peoples headaches " he says that medication doesnt come cheap individual boards range from &# to about &# while systems of multiple boards go for &# and up due to volume of kits more than magnatag boards cant be found at retail mr krapf sells only via his own web site and catalog but turnaround time is quick boards typically ship within three business days a byproduct of mr krapfs meticulous inventory management to date hes sold more than half a million boards and says magnatags revenue is "in excess of &# million and quite a bit above " thats a small slice of the overall whiteboard market estimated at roughly &# billion in annual sales world wide with about half coming from the u s according to one of the largest players acco brands corp of lincolnshire ill acco which also owns well known office supply brands such as swingline and day timer markets its whiteboards under the quartet name and sells to consumers and businesses mainly through big box office products chains such as office depot "were more mass scale than specialized niche product " says acco spokesman richard nelson other u s manufacturers have notable chunks of the business though few if any produce the array of applications that magnatag does "we do some customization but people still prefer plain in the marketplace " says john rouse senior vice president of ghent manufacturing inc a large whiteboard manufacturer in lebanon ohio other producers such as marsh industries inc in new philadelphia ohio focus on niches such as the educational market still "to some extent one board does look like another " says bill singhaus marshs executive vice president of sales and marketing as such mr krapf has managed to carve out a respectable sweet spot with his buffet of systems "when you take a generic tool and turn it into something that is very specifically about the need for a customer then they will take the time to seek you out " says seth godin author of several best selling marketing books including "purple cow" and most recently "the dip " "what most people do when they go into business is they try to fit in and what he krapf did was try to stand out " mr krapf started his informational display business in hawking a myriad of products including traditional green chalkboards jury rigged into displays with magnets and printed lines he dabbled with whiteboards in the early s but it wasnt until the mid s that he landed upon his cash cow magnetized product made of a porcelain like coating he calls "magnalux" over steel while his company w a krapf inc doing business as magnatag still sells a range of items including fabric boards and photo posting panels whiteboard systems are now his best seller to date magnatag has spent little on marketing other than mailing catalogs most advertising comes through word of mouth for instance magnatag said its role on "er" came in the mid s after a doctor advising the show recommended adding a magnatag board to make the set feel real hed used one in his own er the medical boards are designed to track everything including patient room numbers and illnesses and doctors on call "doctors refer to this thing as their real time device " says magnatags marketing chief doug weeks "if its not on the board its not happening " the magnatag kept its starring role several seasons until it was replaced by a clear board as part of a set redesign magnatags ability to offer such a wide variety of boards and still deliver quick turnaround is a byproduct of careful inventory control blank steel sheets coated with magnalux are shipped from a production facility mr krapf wont say where for competitive reasons to magnatags square foot factory in macedon there the company preprints its most popular designs to have on hand to determine how many to make mr krapf has carefully honed a formula taking into account the square footage of the steel the time it takes for a print run and the projected sales for each design notably some boards are gentle variations on existing models but by giving them new task specific names he likes to dream up like the "longranger month strategy planner" or the "hot or not performance tracker" and tweaking the accessory offerings mr krapf has managed to make each board feel customized for a particular task the goal mr krapf says is to "raise the perceived value of a product so people think of it as a unique item that they cant compare anything else to " a popular seller is the "loan tracker " which customers like thomas macnamara a branch manager for first horizon home loans use to monitor the status of mortgage applications "ive had people on the board at one time and i can look at it and then walk into my assistants office and go bam bam bam heres whats missing on this application " says mr macnamara who paid about &# for his board other magnatags are more personalized such as one purchased by the not for profit montrose county sheriffs posse inc in colorado to help track lost hikers mountain bikers and plane crashes the organization aided by grant money ordered a &# magnatag board long by printed with a detailed map of the area and its roads magnets represent vehicles such as helicopters all terrain vehicles and snow machines as well as rescuers on foot before getting their magnatag the posse depended on pocket maps "now you can see the whole county and visualize the roads " says mr huff who volunteers with the group "sometimes we have two incidents going on at the same time and the board really helps to keep track of where everybody is " to date mr krapfs business hasnt been threatened by technology though that day may be coming there are digital whiteboards that interact with software and whiteboards whose musings can be stored on a computer hard drive thus far hes sold boards only in north america due to shipping costs but with the economy going global hes preparing for the day this will change and has hired a retiring army general robert w mixon jr to become president in october hes also grooming his year old son christian to take the reins eventually still for his part mr krapf believes whiteboards will weather the technological revolution "stuff on the wall is believable and carries authority if you get something in email you wonder if it has changed or when it was sent the wall cant be a lie "
