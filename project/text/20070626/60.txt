one patient many doctors how did this overload happen peter b bachs june editorial page commentary "how many doctors does it take to treat a patient " correctly identifies the inefficiency of the current fee for service system by which american physicians are reimbursed the issues raised lead to the broader ethical legal and socioeconomic factors that are a constant source of conflict within our medical system in the current practice the more unique encounters that a physician has with a patient the greater total reimbursement is received this applies to office visits procedures and tests that reward the separation of each encounter second the medical institutions favor those physicians who maximally use their resources through admissions outpatient studies operations and consultations with other physicians on the hospital staff once in this "system" environment the providers are benefited by multiple individually reimbursible contacts for a single problem third the legal pitfalls of not having the "appropriately trained specialist" evaluate each individual complaint places the practitioner who is probably sufficiently capable of addressing the problem at medical legal risk if an unfavorable or less than optimal outcome is achieved finally the conference communication of the specialists with the primary physician as in european centers to outline the care plan as suggested by dr bach is time consuming and not reimbursable by any provider until the system reorients the compensation of the health care providers to reward the quality of the interactions to total patient health and removes the conflicts of interest we will continue to experience rising costs and fractionated care mark aeder m d f a c s assistant professor of surgery university hospitals case medical center cleveland dr bach has it all wrong the &# billion going to "physician services" includes payments to laboratories and outpatient centers with added facility fees the implication that average physician compensation is around &# million is absurd it is closer to &# he also fails to mention that payments for "physician services" are only of total health spending there is data to suggest that reduced spending on physicians actually drives total spending higher due to effects on volume and quality he blames the fee for service system for high md patient ratios and fragmentation of care this is also ridiculous fee for service guarantees a highly motivated physician third party payment and price controls are responsible for overuse of physician services richard amerling m d director outpatient dialysis and crrt beth israel medical center new york the elephant in the room that dr bach does not mention is the liability physicians face when they do not refer a patient to a "specialist" and something untoward happens certainly it is more cost effective for society when care is coordinated more closely by salaried doctors but when the diabetics renal functions slowly decline for example their physicians better have consulted a nephrologist or there will be trouble this scenario is played out in triplicate when the patients are more critically ill to ignore this dynamic is to ensure that your prescription for savings will be ineffective bruce bodner m d f a c s taunton mass patients want the care of specialists for example a diabetic patient with heart disease neuropathy and insulin dependence will be cared for by a cardiologist neurologist and endocrinologist clearly cancer patients at sloan kettering will be cared for by an oncologist and a host of other specialists with little contribution from a primary care physician the patient with asthma or chronic lung disease will want the care of a pulmonologist there is also evidence to show that specialty care in many instances makes for better outcomes it is not fee for service driving this trend but rather the desire of patients for what they see as the best care primary care physicians no longer have the kind of training to equip them to handle multiple disease problems they are also the lowest paid they risk being sued if a bad outcome occurs and there was no specialty consultation all these factors and more have diminished the role of the primary doctor there is no doubt that medical care is often fragmented as a result of this process but unless there are major changes in medical training and reimbursements this is the system we will have nicholas rummo m d director cardiopulmonary services northern westchester hospital mount kisco n y dr bach is correct in asserting that there is too much fragmentation of medical care in the u s as a recently retired general pathologist i can attest that communication among physicians today is as bad and perhaps worse than it has ever been thoughout my years of medical practice despite cellphones fax machines and the internet a significant contributor has been the ascendancy of so called "family practice" at the expense of what was once "general internal medicine" as the general coordinator of adult medical health care internal medicine was once a four year rigorous training program with board examinations that many found difficult to pass because of the depth as well as the breadth of medical knowledge required to become a diplomate of that board general practitioners wanting an elevation in their status went on a pr campaign and reinvented themselves as "family doctors " they are undertrained in almost everything they do serving primarily as triage officers for specialists and subspecialists who very often show them little respect in my community hardly any family doctors follow their patients in the hospital much less participate in actual care when patients are seriously ill the re establishment of general internal medicine general pediatrics and obstetrics gynecology to their rightful places in medicine will assist greatly in coordinating medical care once again s m bunn jr m d waco texas see
