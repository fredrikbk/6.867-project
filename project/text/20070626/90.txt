the evening wrap border reform redux online edition its back the much criticized immigration reform measure that some senators thought they had driven a spike through returned to the floor today but its odds of becoming law dont appear to have improved much the senate voted to revive debate on the stalled out piece of legislation but even if the measure drew enough votes to move forward its final passage is far from a done deal earlier this month a similar test vote had fallen far short of the votes needed to advance the bill attracting support from just senators most of them democrats but this time around republicans put their shoulders to the wheel and helped push the legislation over the procedural hump joining with democrats the president wants badly to sign into law a package of comprehensive immigration reforms before the vote which took place at midday he said that congress had been given a "historic opportunity to act" and signaled that he was confident that the proposal would ultimately land on his desk but for all the elbow grease the administration applied in the lobbying of its fellow republicans less than half ultimately wound up backing the resuscitation of the bill voted to leave it for dead many conservatives believe that the package doesnt do enough to beef up security and enforcement and complain that it provides amnesty for illegal immigrants democratic foes of the bill have expressed concern that a proposed guest worker program could create a permanent underclass of temporary workers among other worries to build support some &# billion has been added to the original measure for improving border security and a flurry of proposed amendments includes plans to set up a new entry exit tracking system for future guest workers and to block permanently any individuals who are caught overstaying their visa in an effort to get the high tech industry to throw its weight beyond the proposal yet another amendment would expand annual visas available to skilled workers to try and speed up consideration of each of the amendments majority leader harry reid has packaged them into a single amendment known as a "clay pigeon " but the thicket of amendments seems destined to complicate the debate no matter how they are packed and the stark split in the republican camp on todays vote is a sign that the senate leadership may face a much more difficult time in winning the votes that they need to bring the debate to a close later this week and even if the measure does make it over that hump there has been no concrete sign that it will garner the simple majority that it needs to pass that could especially be the case if senate republicans develop the feeling that their party colleagues in the house wont sign on to the overhaul as the senate was getting ready to vote this morning house republicans concluded a closed door session before a vote could be held on a simple resolution disapproving of the senate measure but in an indication of how angry some republicans have become with the immigration push a white house backed attempt to shelf the resolution was soundly defeated going down by "its clear theres a large number of the house republicans who have serious concerns with the senate bill " said rep john boehner the minority leader from ohio he acknowledged that the white house was rather displeased that he had allowed the measure to be considered at all but said it wasnt realistic to think that the emotions stirred up by issue could be tamed "the members are elected by their constituents to come here and use their voice this is where free and open debate occurs and if we cant do it in our weekly conference where can we do it " he said more ill winds from housing following on a report yesterday showing flagging demand for existing homes the commerce department said sales of new single family homes dropped last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of down from april when sales showed a surprisingly robust increase the decline was not as steep as economists expected forecasters polled by dow jones newswires predicted a plunge on average but much like yesterdays small slide in existing sales a benign headline masked more troublesome news deeper in the report builders have been scrambling to bring inventories in line with demand but the stock of homes for sale grew to a bit more than seven months supply at the current pace of sales that was only slightly fatter than the seven months inventory seen in may but was no source of comfort to economists tracking the data "the supply problem may now be stabilizing but it remains huge " ian shepherdson of high frequency economics said "the inventory overhang will keep downward pressure on prices " the prices picture looked mixed median prices edged down in annual terms while average prices rose the market strain is weighing mightily on builders bellwether lennar swung to a loss during its second quarter and the company
