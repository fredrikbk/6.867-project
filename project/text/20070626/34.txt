fixing health care its been years since the senate has taken up bipartisan health care reform and some believe it will be at least that long before a reform worthy of the label is passed by congress but even in washington change is possible today we hope to demonstrate this as the senate budget committee takes up our proposal to create a universal market driven health care system that all americans can afford what we want is not for washington to meddle in health care decisions but for every american to receive the same level of care available to members of congress now too often in our nations capital necessary reforms are put on a shelf and left there thats happening with health care as many inside washington would rather wait for a new president and a new congress before enacting anything but polls consistently show that waiting isnt what americans want and were with those who say they dont want us to sit around for two years now is the perfect time to act and we offer our proposal as a good faith effort to pass serious health care reform before election day heres how our legislation the healthy americans act would work all americans other than those in medicare or the military would be given incentives to buy basic private health plans individuals at or below the poverty level would receive a subsidy to buy insurance and states would be given more flexibility within a federal framework to give consumers more choices in insurance available on the private market these reforms would make health insurance portable americans could take it to wherever they work and make access to health care universal and affordable they would also give individuals more control over where their health care dollars go and they would break the link between health insurance and employment freeing employers of a burden theyve carried since world war ii wage and price controls forced them to offer health benefits instead of pay raises how would this be possible currently the tax code gives the affluent the biggest health care breaks our bill would rewrite the code to give every individual a tax benefit for buying health insurance that would create an incentive to buy insurance that in turn would push the health insurance industry to offer more competitive plans and create a more dynamic insurance market our bill also includes an unprecedented array of new incentives to promote personal responsibility and preventative medicine these include lowering medicare part b premiums for seniors who change their behavior to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol as well as reducing family premiums for parents who enroll their children in preventative health programs and there are no government mandates we provide carrots instead of sticks our bill also reforms the insurance market so insurers compete on price benefits and quality rather than simply signing up the healthiest americans and side stepping the sickest amazingly creating a more rational health care market may also save money the lewin group the gold standard of independent health care analysis has estimated that our plan will reduce total national health care spending by nearly &# trillion over the next years even during the early years it will reduce spending by more than &# billion per year while expanding coverage these savings will free up money to help pay for private health care coverage for those who otherwise could not afford a basic plan we know there are skeptics we understand that the reaction may be "yeah right the senate isnt going to pass universal health care legislation within the next year " and its true that it will be tough to convince some in washington to put aside partisan politics and do something this big but we came to congress to tackle big problems with big solutions the healthy americans act is a big solution the fact is that both democrats and republicans have been right in this debate in the past democrats are correct in saying that to fix health care you must cover everyone otherwise those without health insurance will continue to shift costs to those who have it by showing up in hospital emergency rooms for basic care republicans are correct in saying that the federal government shouldnt run everything in health care market forces play an important role by promoting competition and innovation only if we adjust the federal tax code can the broken health care system be changed to produce the portability flexibility and creativity we need to solve the problem in february senators five democrats and five republicans including the two of us sent a letter to the president offering to work with him on a bipartisan basis to fix health care we outlined for the president several principles the of us could agree on those principles serve as the foundation of the healthy americans act if enough americans start clamoring for action this congress and this president could defy the odds and go where every president and every congress has tried to go since a rational system that guarantees good quality and affordable health care to all americans mr wyden is a democratic senator from oregon mr bennett is a republican senator from utah see related letters "letters to the editor the healthy americans act sounds good perhaps too good" wsj july
