top court hands conservatives victories washington the supreme court handed conservatives victories in a raft of to rulings demonstrating the far ranging influence of president bushs two appointees but the opinions including closely watched cases involving campaign finance regulation and student free speech revealed fissures among the five conservative justices even as the courts rightward tilt drove the four liberals together in unified dissents coming near the close of the first full term since the retirement of justice sandra day oconnor the decisions showed how the court is pulling back on liberal precedents long disliked by conservatives but hasnt yet formed a consensus among the majority bloc on how and how far to proceed chief justice john roberts who took office in with the aim of producing fewer splintered opinions failed to unite the conservatives behind his reasoning in any of the three major cases decided yesterday the chief justice and justice samuel alito paid some deference to the precedents they were limiting while justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas called for their outright reversals at the same time the developing roberts court has fostered unity among its frustrated liberal bloc the liberal justices have taken to joining single dissents rather than writing separately four times in the past term a liberal justice has read a dissent from the bench a gesture in the courts refined choreography displaying great distress with a majority opinion in yesterdays most wide reaching ruling the court all but eliminated a key provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act better known as mccain feingold after the senators who sponsored it opening up an additional source of funds for the blizzard of political advertisements sure to precede next years election mccain feingold was designed to stop corporations and labor unions using a loophole in election rules to fund political campaigns or advertisements to get around the restrictions corporations and unions ran advertisements ostensibly focusing on an "issue " critics said while implicitly urging a vote for a particular candidate under the act corporate funded television ads couldnt mention a specific candidate days prior to a primary and days before a general election the court found that prohibition swept too far abridging corporations first amendment rights to voice political views but the five justices in the majority splintered over their reasoning chief justice roberts and justice alito stopped short of invalidating the entire provision leaving in place a restriction on ads that could have no other interpretation than "an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate " neither the chief justice nor justice alito was on the court in when it upheld most of the mccain feingold law the three justices who dissented from that ruling justice scalia joined by justices anthony kennedy and thomas reiterated their view that the restriction itself should be struck down federal election commission v wisconsin right to life inc the differences among the conservatives were sharper in the free speech case in which a high school principal ripped down a banner hoisted by a student outside the school that proclaimed "bong hits jesus " the student asserted it was an absurdist statement intended to draw television cameras there to cover the olympic torch relay as it passed through the principal said the message promoted illegal drug use in a case known as tinker v des moines the court barred a school from punishing students who wore black armbands in protest of the vietnam war writing for the court chief justice roberts repeated tinkers finding that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech at the schoolhouse gate " but the chief justice said the first amendment must give way when that speech "is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use " justice alito joined that opinion but appeared troubled by the suppression of speech in a separate opinion joined by justice kennedy he explicitly rejected the governments broad argument that schools could silence speech authorities deemed as interfering with the "educational mission " he wrote that the ruling went to "the far reaches of what the first amendment permits " and stressed that it shouldnt be read to allow suppression of any speech "commenting on any political or social issue " including the "wisdom of the war on drugs" or "legalizing marijuana for medical use " justice thomas also joined the majority but wrote separately to urge that tinker be overruled "as originally understood the constitution does not afford students a right to free speech in public schools " he wrote justice stephen breyer wrote separately to say that the principal should be permitted to tear down foot banners regardless of the content and thus avoid a first amendment problem justice john paul stevens joined by justices david souter and ruth bader ginsburg dissented the students "nonsense" message could hardly be considered likely to turn the student body into drug users "most students do not shed their brains at the schoolhouse gate " he wrote morse v frederick the courts third decision also implicated the first amendment denying taxpayers standing to sue the executive branch for violating the prohibition on "an establishment of religion " in general taxpayers have no right to sue against government actions unless they can show they are directly harmed by them in the case flast v cohen the court made an exception in a case involving the establishment clause which defines the separation of church and state yesterday the court ruled that exception didnt cover actions of the executive branch specifically president bushs "faith based" campaign to encourage religious groups to seek federal funding for social programs while the five conservatives agreed in the result no single opinion could muster enough votes to speak for the court as a whole "we do not extend flast but we also do not overrule it " wrote justice alito joined by the chief justice and justice kennedy justice kennedy wrote separately to explain his concern that such lawsuits could lead to "constant intrusion" by the courts into executive branch actions in dissent justice souter wrote that it made no sense to allow taxpayer suits against congressional spending but not that of the president although they agreed in the pluralitys result justice scalia joined by justice thomas agreed with the dissenters that the issue was indistinguishable from that in flast his conclusion however was rather different "we had an opportunity today to erase this blot on our jurisprudence but instead have simply smudged it " he wrote "flast should be overruled " hein v freedom from religion foundation inc the splits could lead to difficulty interpreting the decisions christopher cooper contributed to this article
