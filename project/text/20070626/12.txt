blairs exit london for years tony blair has been the stadium rock star of british prime ministers like other famed performers before him he has taken many final curtain calls before the very last curtain falls tomorrow when gordon brown will take his place some of the reception for mr blair has praised a courageous friend of the united states and an agent of political change for a labour party that was unelectable before he led it other judgments from one time fans and friends have been their last raging shrieks of betrayal the politician who so eloquently advanced the case for confronting terror after has received more broken bottles than bouquets the orator whose press conference duets with george w bush set so much of the storyline for the wars ahead will have a wide range of reviews to study when he is finally finally gone at the start of the "tony farewell tour" there was much weary why is he doing this among british commentators we were not used to it we dont normally do transitions unlike american presidents british prime ministers are usually gone in a flash once they lose their grip on power they get no time for a yard sale this time there was not even going to be a contest for his successor merely a coronation day for chancellor of the exchequer brown the man credited with the economic successes of the blair years what was the point of it all beyond the provision of one last adrenaline course for the attention addict these were not kind thoughts nor were they meant to be long gone are the days of thinking kindly toward the modernizing idealist with the eyes of steel the first prime minister with a young family the first with an electric guitar and a whiff of the s this retirement tour began after the prime minister had been twice questioned by the police about corruption in the sale of seats in parliament and after he had barely escaped a botched brownite plot to topple him last year why didnt he just get on and go straight away many noted the predictability in what people said about tony blair the sierra leoneans still grateful for a special forces rescue spectacular in offered him such star struck devotion on his tour date there that a life presidency seemed inevitable the queen the british head of state not the rock band showed herself subtly less impressed by a man who had put town before countryside banned fox hunting overstretched and underprovided her armed forces and broken the unitary government of her realm through his "devolution" of political power to scotland and wales president bush applauded his friend and supporter using the same language of gratitude confidence and trust that he had used so often during the iraq war the scottish people always more opposed to that war than even the rest of the country was elected their first "first minister" committed to full separation from britain the irish prime minister rightly but somewhat ritually praised mr blairs tireless commitment to peace and power sharing in belfast english doctors and nurses did not react so well despite the billions of extra pounds spent on their work under the rubric of "reform in public services " then suddenly there was a fresh and unexpected focus we realized that mr blair was not just passively receiving other peoples verdicts he was giving his own on his favorite stages at home and abroad he was not just hearing what was deemed to be his due he was handing out scorecards on himself and on us so what now is that final day scorecard he gets high marks for keeping himself and therefore us too in the international spotlight business has benefited from that few foreigners cared as much when john major and james callaghan his tory and labour predecessors left office or entered it in mr blairs view this visibility abroad is an unalloyed virtue his "what ive learnt" verdict on his premiership for economist readers began with an expression of surprise that foreign affairs had been so important a part of his diary and the proud boast that everywhere "over the past years britain has been in the thick of it " critics pointed out that no british prime minister should really have been "shocked " let alone "somewhat alarmed " at the potential demands of foreign policy even the two harolds macmillan and wilson hardly our biggest hitters spent much of their time with eyes overseas their age however was one of nuanced positions based on the longstanding british principle that sometimes it was not in our interests in mr blairs words "to be as fully engaged as we can be " tony blairs impetus has been to make every possible intervention toward what he sees as "the right thing " he has also scored high marks for confidence and for making others feel confident in the last days before the iraq war and the first days of the war itself i was with him and his aides all the time no one saw him waver for a moment that his initial instinct to back president bush was the right one thus none of his staff wavered despite the pressures from party friends and family history he said would have the verdict on his policies god he said would judge his responsibility for those who died because of them mr blair did not often talk publicly about god but he spoke often about a godlike kind of history its hand on his shoulder its right to judge his record before winning the election mr blair had never let his christian beliefs affect his policies on church matters whether changes to sunday trading laws or even abortion in office as it seemed to me in religion came to matter more to him not in making policy but in intensifying his confidence in it he has always been an idealist his trust in the guiding power of an idea a trust shared with mr bush made his the clearest of all responses to some politicians instinctively want an enemy they can see mr blair was comfortable with the hidden initial successes in office in kosovo against the wig and drug loving "west side boys" of west africa against the royal family after the death of princess diana gradually dissuaded caution if he could later have removed robert mugabe or the "dear leader" of north korea he would have done so he couldnt so he didnt a view he expressed with some force and much frustration inside downing street during the iraq war debates if he could have swapped sterling for the euro and ratified the new constitution thereby allowing a nonelected president and foreign minister for the eu he would have done it but he couldnt so he didnt help to remove saddam hussein he could so he did he also thought he could help the removal go better if the americans were to enter iraq alone they would simply get saddam and get out which at the time of thinking in seemed the worst possible idea he hasnt changed his mind so mr brown must now take over to the sound of his predecessor still singing the ubiquitous engagement song with its three distinct verses "a clear self interest as a nation in what happens the world over" "an acceptance that international politics should not simply be a game of interests but also of beliefs" and the necessity of constructing "the broadest possible agenda that is capable of unifying the international community " it will be fascinating to see how long this stays in the new new labour repertoire gordon brown is less of an idealist than the man he succeeds and more guided by the past britains next prime minister believes in control by wire with every piece of domestic or diplomatic machinery dancing puppet like to his tune tony blair went wireless long ago smart political musicianship always meant that mr blair could slide over inconsistencies take greater risks "triangulate " take the argument on to the next stage before the audience had absorbed what had gone before this was sometimes as wondrous an act to watch as that of his teenage hero mick jagger or that of bono his middle age co campaigner in africa as the young labour leader mr blair persuaded party members to accept compromises they never saw constitutional changes they never wanted the comfort of a third way between socialism and capitalism which few understood but all felt was somehow preserving what each one wanted most the lowest form of this art was what became known as "spin" government information as a centrally planned and carefully stitched work of art a cloak which would both contain news and control it create patterns and disguise them this began as a practical protection against past conservative press attacks it ended not just in the "dodgy dossiers" about saddams wmd but in deep popular distrust of all official statements and statistics on crime guns and violence up overall levels down education exam standards down exam performance up and health waiting lists for treatment both cut and concealed a defensive weapon became an offensive weapon and then a suicide weapon in one of his final tour dates at the reuters news agency mr blair conceded that his administration had considered the media too much in its early years he then unleashed a savage attack against the "feral beasts " those news organizations which put views their own views first the news his news far behind and which as broadcasters and newspapers converged ever closer on the web would soon have to be equally controlled press reaction was not surprisingly hostile here was a man who used global news deadlines and celebrity culture like a master both as justification for spin and as its tool the "cool britannia" party after his first election had brought the rock band oasis to downing street one of his farewell tour jokes was that when he left office he himself would be "a former celebrity " this particular farewell concert was by far his worst like that of any s punk band complete with snarling at the last dom perignon in the last dressing room fridge if spin is at the low end of information management the highest form of rhetorical deception ought to be statesmanship the careful calibration of international negotiations in which "doing good" trumps "telling the truth" and always has and will a man with more metternich or talleyrand in him would have clearly seen the blairite route in the potential of backing washington with secret assurances curbing the worst u s impatience seeking the best political and commercial rewards and if the whole event needed a few misstatements of reality then when had that ever been different but mr blair while often wily in his way became too committed to the iraq policy too soon as the months moved on his public rhetoric kept him stuck to the unraveling plans even more than his private promises did he gained george bushs gratitude for early support he had done the "right thing" at the time but when the time came for that gratitude to become a gift and for britain to influence the rules of postwar iraq the washington audience stopped listening that is the betrayal which british foreign policy makers feel most keenly now mr blair told me before the war in that he would rather go out in flames for an idea that he believed in than trickle out of office like his friend bill clinton this prayer at least was most certainly answered the prime minister could never be faulted for the enthusiasm of his foreign policy hopes that once yasser arafat was gone the palestinians would seize the possibilities of peace that once he had proven himself the perfect atlanticist he would have the leeway to join the euro and the new eu constitution too but confidence and hope fill only a part of the scorecard his marks for statesmanship at least as set by those judges writing today are only in the low to middle of the range a better belfast a calmer kosovo a safer sierra leone his final marks at home anyone with a liberal social agenda the money to keep their children out of state schools a modest preparedness for home rule in scotland and wales the need for cheap immigrant labor and the liking to live in a famous country under a famous leader has felt five ways blessed anyone who hoped for a transformation in schools a sensibility to the countryside civil liberty tradition and a better sense of urban safety feels five ways robbed between those extremes sit most britons mostly wise enough to know that the essence of a decade is more than its prime minister and mostly giving a polite wave to tony blair as he leaves them behind mr stothard is editor of the times literary supplement and author of "thirty days tony blair and the test of history" harpercollins he was editor of the times of london from to
