sun to provide new details about massive computer sun microsystems inc which has lagged behind rivals in sales of supercomputers says it now has technology to build the worlds biggest scientific systems the silicon valley computer maker today is providing new details about a massive machine called constellation which includes an unusual high capacity switching system for passing data among thousands of chips that act as electronic brains in the system sun developed the machine in collaboration with the texas advanced computing center at the university of texas which is installing the hardware in its facility in austin john fowler executive vice president of suns systems group predicted the system will be the worlds most powerful when it is up and running later this year eclipsing an international business machines corp system at lawrence livermore national laboratory that has held the speed record lately such bragging rights dont last long these days companies need ultrapowerful systems for chores such as designing drugs modeling the flow of air over aircraft wings and estimating the size of underground oil deposits though supercomputers account for a small portion of the computing market big hardware manufacturers compete fiercely for contracts to deliver ever larger systems that could help shape designs for broadly used products ibm which like sun is making announcements at a supercomputer conference in dresden germany says it is nearly tripling the performance of a design called blue gene that is used at livermore sometime next year ibm hopes to install one of its new blue gene p systems that can reach a quadrillion operations per second a milestone called a "petaflop " said herb schultz director of ibms deep computing effort most supercomputers hook together hundreds or thousands of server systems each with two to four microprocessors one challenge is devising a scheme to keep delivering data as fast as those chips can process it andreas bechtolsheim a sun co founder who is its chief architect attacked the problem with a massive switching system with the code name magnum that by itself can manage high speed data traffic for calculating engines in a supercomputer mr fowler said other approaches would take smaller switching components the company says mr bechtolsheim even designed special cables so that just one sixth the number of wires is necessary to assemble a system though sun accounts for relatively few of the largest machines installed mr fowler predicted "there will be other significant wins that will be announced in the coming months "
