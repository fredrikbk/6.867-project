business technology helpless hopeless wireless companies cool on hot spots as wi fi connection problems lead to help desk headaches when william friemann joined real estate firm prudential fox &amp roach last year as its vice president of technology operations he was alarmed at how much it was costing his information technology department to continuously troubleshoot the companys patchwork wireless network the network which uses a wireless technology known as wi fi kicked people off if they moved away from the immediate area around a wireless access point the antenna that receives signals from a wireless device when employees tried to connect to the office network through a wi fi connection at home some users got bounced off the system without warning while others were unable to make a remote connection as a member of the help desk mr friemann often spent hours trying to solve employees problems with the system things got so bad that mr friemann sometimes had employees piggyback on a neighboring businesss wireless connection that was more stable without the other businesss consent or knowledge "it was almost like if you wanted to have remote access youd better expect to not have a good experience " says mr friemann years old who is based in cherry hill n j wi fi was supposed to reduce complications not create new ones the wireless technology was designed to eliminate the cords and cables used to connect computers to the internet enabling users to be more mobile and to stay connected to the office even while on the go since debuting in the s the technology has been widely embraced by consumers wireless hot spots can now be found at many airports hotels and starbucks corp coffee shops but in many offices wi fi has been a headache like all radio signals wi fi is subject to interference its relatively low power less than even a typical cellphone means walls and cabinets can significantly reduce signal strength wi fi also creates a more open network than wired networks raising security issues and wi fi has caused problems for virtual private networks or vpns which are lines of private communication through the public internet created with encryption software some vpns which give users access to corporate networks from home or on the road require a lot of processing power if a wireless access point at home at the office or on the road isnt robust enough a user often gets bumped off the connection wi fi issues have placed a great deal of stress on many corporate it departments in part because such problems extend beyond the walls of the workplace many it workers are finding that in addition to troubleshooting wi fi problems at the office theyre also called upon to help when colleagues have trouble connecting to their corporate network using wi fi at home at a hotel or at a remote conference room all of this has stunted the growth of wi fi in offices according to research firm delloro group some business users have turned away from wi fi entirely total corporate spending on wi fi equipment is still relatively small though its growing last year companies spent &# billion on wi fi equipment up from &# million in according to delloro in contrast companies last year spent &# billion on equipment that would allow them to access wired corporate networks "clearly theres room for growth but there are still problems with wi fi that make companies uncomfortable " says elmer choy a senior analyst at delloro the difficulties employees have with wi fi at home are often different from the troubles they face at the office with home users problems often occur between the configuration of their home connection and the software they have installed to access the corporate network sometimes the vpn software isnt compatible with the home network at work the main issue is often security and how to prevent hackers and others from gaining access to the system some wireless networking companies are taking steps to try to deal with customers problems one major issue is the stability of the wireless signal ruckus wireless inc a wireless networking company based in sunnyvale calif tries to address that problem by providing wireless access points that have multiple antennas that allows a wi fi signal to have more than one pathway to an access point which can come in handy if something is in the way "people want wi fi to do so much more " said selina lo chief executive of ruckus wireless "small businesses and people at home want it to support things it hadnt in the past " alan cohen vice president of mobility solutions for cisco systems inc says wi fi has been hurt in the office environment because the open wireless system creates problems for network administrators who are accustomed to having strict control over a network with a wi fi network however there is less transparency and control he says still he adds "this is clearly a growing space " some advances in software and hardware have recently eased corporate users wi fi problems companies such as aruba networks inc airtight networks inc and air defense inc have new products that close security holes and alleviate problems with signal strength airtight mountain view calif for instance now makes a wireless switch that allows a wireless network to operate like a wired network that lets it staffers note attempted attacks on the network and see whether unauthorized devices are attempting to connect in last month cisco introduced new software and services that secure and extend the office wi fi network to handheld devices some of the new services inspect incoming communications traffic for viruses and block unauthorized users from accessing the wireless network adesa inc an auction house in carmel ind began using wi fi in late but employees often brought in their own wireless equipment creating rogue connections to the network and allowing unauthorized users to access confidential information so last year chris roberts an adesa network manager purchased new wireless access points with security software from airtight he declined to say how much he paid after installing the equipment he found about unauthorized people using the companys wireless network those people could have been hackers or people downloading music or movies which could slow down the network the new equipment allowed mr roberts to block the unapproved users still such solutions which can cost tens of thousands of dollars arent a panacea since wi fi operates on a similar radio frequency as other office or household devices there tends to be more room for disruption especially from devices that it staffers may not originally have thought would be a problem thats what happened when doctors with carilion health systems a roanoke va based health company with doctor offices and eight hospitals began using a new wireless endoscopy capsule last year when swallowed by a patient the capsule a small device about the size of a vitamin tablet wirelessly transmits images to a receiver as it passes through a patients system carilions doctors were given a demo capsule early last year but they hadnt met with the hospitals network administrators to inspect the device before they began testing it days later the capsules high powered transmitter ended up disrupting the wireless network for the entire clinic and bumped wireless pcs and handheld scanners used by doctors and nurses off the network some of the devices that got knocked off the network held vital records about patients medication dosages "it destroyed communication for some of our devices " says brian brindle senior network engineer at carilion the capsule was eventually shut off after network administrators stalked the clinic halls with a wi fi meter capable of detecting unauthorized wireless devices wi fi in offices may face further bumps especially with the growth of new technology like online video since video traffic is bulkier than traditional text traffic watching video over a wireless network can slow access speeds to a crawl and bump users off the network last year a new wi fi standard there are four others dubbed n debuted and was supposed to solve the problem by improving signal range and download speeds but upgrading to the new standard which requires buying and installing new hardware and software could prove costly for some for mr friemann prudential fox &amp roachs problems continued with the firms wireless network until he approached managers in october and convinced them that a wi fi overhaul was necessary in january the company began upgrading its wireless systems spending &# and tapping aruba wireless to help aruba put in a secure wireless system with high bandwidth access points that allowed the operators to better monitor who was using the network today prudentials wi fi network is more stable and mr friemanns time is no longer consumed by troubleshooting "it used to be when you walked into one of our offices and wanted wireless you had to find someone that knew what they were doing and if not good luck youre on your own " he says "theres still room for improvement but what we have now is definitely better "
