news corp nears dow jones pact agreement on protection of editorial independence would pave way for sale dow jones &amp co and news corp were on the brink of agreeing late yesterday on editorial protections for dow jones an accord that would pave the way for the sale of the publisher of the wall street journal to rupert murdochs media conglomerate for about &# billion according to people familiar with the matter while a deal appeared possible as early as today the biggest concern on both sides was whether the bancroft family which has controlled dow jones since early in the th century would support the compromise though the family has overcome some of its previous doubts about selling the company the situation remains fluid and some members continue to privately express resistance to a deal word of the news corp bid first surfaced two months ago and was initially met with silence from the family but mr murdoch was patient and family members began to worry about the future of dow jones if it remained independent in a troubled newspaper industry after about four weeks of discussions the family decided to open the company to offers including news corp s soon several members were meeting face to face with mr murdoch and talks began among family members about a structure for editorial independence no serious competing bids emerged but these talks dragged on last week the bancrofts ceded the negotiations over editorial protections to the companys board which largely supports the sale but the familys control of most of the super voting shares in the company gives it ultimate veto power and the family has been ambivalent from the start michael b elefante the bancrofts lead trustee and a dow jones director will be responsible for taking the temperature of the family on an agreement said people familiar with the matter as of early yesterday evening mr elefante had yet to canvass the family on the editorial independence provisions and it wasnt clear when he would begin doing so a number of family members have expressed reservations about whether mr murdoch can be trusted to preserve dow joness editorial integrity and some on its board have favored using that concern as leverage to win a higher price say people close to the negotiations while the two sides appeared near a deal the wild card of the bancroft familys reaction left the possibility open that any agreement could take an unexpected turn the proposals on editorial independence have changed significantly since the familys original proposal which preserved a large role for the family another remaining issue was whether news corp would increase the value of its &# a share offer while no third party bids for dow jones have emerged to put price pressure on news corp the board hopes to extract a few more dollars to reassure family members who have been reluctant to approve a sale to news corp and its chairman mr murdoch the press baron and media mogul who long has coveted the wall street journal but both sides indicated that they didnt see last minute jockeying on price as a major impediment to completing a deal the negotiations of recent days had become chaotic and occasionally testy with the family news corp and dow jones directors and executives all jockeying for positions of leverage but yesterday afternoon joseph a stern dow joness general counsel brought to news corp s headquarters a marked up copy of the editorial principles that news corp had delivered to dow jones on sunday the decision to send the document to news corp came after a roughly two hour meeting monday afternoon of the special dow jones board committee charged with negotiating a possible deal in that session the group composed of m peter mcpherson the board chairman dow jones chief executive richard zannino harvey golub chairman of campbell soup co lewis campbell ceo of textron inc and mr elefante went over the proposal in detail and agreed to choose a few issues it would take back to news corp the group met again by phone last night neither side appeared to see the issues as big stumbling blocks according to people on both sides of the negotiations yesterday afternoon the two sides agreed on the outlines of a board to oversee issues of editorial independence according to a person familiar with the matter news corp had suggested a member board to oversee editorial independence and other issues which would have five independent members and appointed by news corp dow jones had countered by requesting an entity solely focused on the editorial independence of dow jones the two sides settled on a single board but it wasnt clear how many of its members would be independent or how large the board would be mr murdoch asked that none of the members have any connection to either news corp or to the bancrofts or dow jones dow jones appeared willing to accept that but wanted the members to choose their successors another issue dow jones hoped to address was funding for the special committee the dow jones proposal indicated that an outside foundation and certain family trusts would provide funding for any eventual legal challenges on behalf of the special committee news corp countered in its proposal that the special committee would have adequate funding for "travel and accommodations" but didnt address how the entity would be funded the two sides appeared near an agreement on the issue yesterday evening the two sides also were negotiating over dow joness code of conduct which provides employees with guidelines for such issues as investments political donations and conflicts of interest news corp initially had deleted any mention of the code from its proposal arguing that news corp had its own principles that preserved the integrity and editorial independence of its publications but dow joness board pushed to preserve its code and appeared to have been successful said a person familiar with the matter dow jones stock was down or &#
