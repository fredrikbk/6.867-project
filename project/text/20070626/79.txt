refineries summer break idle plants likely will keep gasoline prices profits high an unusually big chunk of u s refining capacity remains idled as motorists hit the road for the summer driving season the outages combined with rising oil prices are likely to keep fuel prices and industry profits high refineries which turn crude oil into fuels like gasoline and diesel usually shut down for maintenance in the spring this year the spring cleaning is extending into the summer that has contributed to higher prices a gallon of regular gasoline averaged &# a gallon this week down cents from a week ago but up about cents from the same period last year according to the energy information administration refiners say there are a variety of reasons behind the lingering outages including tougher federal clean fuel standards but industry observers also cite wear and tear on aging equipment in a nation where no new refinery has been built since the s because capacity hasnt grown as much as demand in the past few years refiners have been running their equipment harder and for longer periods without maintenance making for extended shutdowns when they do stop to fix things a shortage of skilled labor is also pushing maintenance projects normally scheduled in the winter or the spring into the summer months the strains point to a lingering trouble spot in the nations energy stream at a time when americans show little sign they will curb gasoline use anytime soon chevron corp shut down a barrel a day primary crude unit at its el segundo calif refinery june for maintenance expected to last for several weeks "although we had hoped to conduct the turnaround earlier in the year delays in the delivery of ordered equipment and the availability of construction contractors led to the june timing " said spokeswoman stephanie price chevron began planning for the work more than two years ago and has been stocking up with products to meet its customers demand while the refining unit is down she said units at valero energy corp s refineries in houston and krotz springs la were down for two weeks this month resulting in a loss of gasoline output of barrels a day exxon mobil corp is working on scheduled maintenance at two of its refineries that have the capacity to process more than barrels a day though exxon wont specify how much production is being lost a number of other refineries across the country have reduced output the shutdowns have put a growing portion of the nations oil refining capacity currently million barrels a day out of circulation at a time when demand is at its highest the energy information administration recently said the refinery utilization rate had sunk to on average refineries used about of their capacity this time of year from to even last year when refineries were still recovering from damage suffered during hurricanes katrina and rita in the utilization rate ran at while the public is groaning about high gasoline prices refiners have seen their profit margins soar in the first quarter the major gasoline producers in the u s made about &# billion in refining profits domestically and abroad up from a year earlier daniel barcelo an analyst with banc of america securities expects refining margins or the difference between the price refiners pay for oil and the prices their fuels fetch to be even higher in the second quarter the oil industry is likely to face growing pressure from congress if gasoline prices remain high on thursday the senate passed a bill that would prosecute and fine price gouging current capacity use levels dont bode well for gasoline prices which are just coming down from their record highs of a few weeks ago despite growing a bit in recent weeks gasoline inventories remain very lean for this time of year the situation would be even more dire if the refining industry hadnt added barrels a day of capacity in the past year through expansions at current facilities the result is that output is still rising though not as fast as demand in the past four weeks the industry has produced an average of million barrels of gasoline a day up from an average of million barrels a year earlier some industry experts say exceptional factors are behind the current slump in capacity use after hurricanes katrina and rita idled more than a quarter of the refining capacity in the country many of the refiners that werent affected postponed maintenance to make up for the lost fuel supply there were also labor shortages as skilled workers flocked to the gulf coast to work on repairs on facilities there this created a backlog that continues to be felt "its like being bumped off an airplane " says doug macintyre senior market analyst with the energy information administration "you dont necessarily get the next plane " but others think capacity utilization rates will be lower than in the past as refiners produce more specialized fuels "the increasing product specs are definitely denting the utilization rate and thats here to stay " says richard voliva associate analyst with deutsche bank last year refiners had to start producing ultralow sulfur diesel under government regulations for cleaner fuels the new mandated standard calls for parts per million of sulfur for of the highway diesel production compared with parts per million in the past refiners say the tighter specs have made a complicated process even more complex and have resulted in lower capacity utilization "when youre making a product akin to a high purity chemical you arent going to run at " says charles drevna executive vice president of the national petrochemical and refiners association a trade group for the refining industry
