politics &amp economics seeking to soften blows of globalization ceo group suggests aid tax cuts to defuse protectionist sentiment washington chief executives of the nations largest financial services companies concerned about the growing public backlash against international trade are wading into the policy debate over how to help those on the losing end of globalization a paper commissioned by the financial services forum sets out several policy options aimed at cushioning the blow from job losses and other dislocations caused by global trade in a bid to defuse protectionist sentiment in the u s and promote free trade agreements the banking investment and other ceos who belong to the group have consistently cited protectionism as the leading threat to continued u s and global economic growth the effort marks one of the first times top business leaders have sought to weigh in collectively in the globalization debate the paper acknowledges that trade can have ill effects on some groups of workers such as stagnant personal earnings and job losses and recommends ways to reduce or at least redistribute the pain its ideas range from the familiar such as raising taxes on the wealthy to address income disparities to the novel such as insuring communities against "sudden economic dislocation" caused by a plant shutdown or other factors fending off protectionism is crucial for american companies which benefit from the flow of goods and services across borders in the u s exported &# trillion in goods and services and imported &# trillion the growing backlash against globalization has endangered president bushs global trade agenda bilateral trade agreements negotiated by the u s are running into stiff opposition in congress and the doha round of global trade talks are near collapse mr bushs authority to negotiate trade deals and put them to an up or down vote before congress expires at the end of this month that authority is considered vital for the administration to win approval of trade deals politicians from both major political parties are struggling to figure out how to keep trade barriers low which helps the u s economy as a whole while protecting american workers whose jobs may be scaled back or eliminated as low cost competition causes u s companies to retrench or shift production overseas yet there is little agreement about how to respond to the problem the only consensus seems to be that the current programs aimed at compensating those hurt by trade arent working well democrats many of whom campaigned against unfettered trade in the midterm elections have said they plan to introduce legislation later this year to expand trade assistance to displaced american workers while republicans led by the bush administration are weighing their own ideas including vouchers to help workers pay for retraining meanwhile anxiety over trade and globalization continues to increase "this debate at some level got a little bit off the mark and theres been way too much talk about protectionism and isolationism when we ought to be talking about good solid policies that respond to this changing economy " said financial services forum ceo donald evans a former commerce secretary under president bush he added that while his group commissioned and paid for the paper not all of its members will agree with every policy prescription "this doesnt say that we the forum agree with every last proposal or policy idea thats in this report but we do think this is a constructive report to add to the discussion and the national debate over how important globalization is to the american economy " he said ken thompson chairman and ceo of wachovia corp and the forums vice chairman said in a statement "our open trade and investment policies have significantly enhanced the economic well being of american citizens although not everyone has shared equally in the benefits of globalization this report presents innovative ideas to broaden the reach of globalizations dividends and to keep the free trade agenda moving forward " the paper was written by economists matthew slaughter a former bush administration economist now a professor at dartmouth college grant aldonas a former bush administration official now at the center for strategic and international studies and robert lawrence a former clinton administration official who teaches at harvard university the paper cites limitations of one of the most frequently talked about prescriptions for success in a global economy improving workers skills through continued education while gains from education may benefit workers down the road the report concludes they will do little to help workers struggling today or to appease current critics of globalization "education is a great way of equipping more americans with the tools to gain from globalization but the timing of its impact ticks generation by generation " mr slaughter said for example he said it has taken years for the percentage of americans with college degrees to grow to from the forum has started lobbying capitol hill on its ideas and representatives including the papers authors spent friday meeting with congressional staff still many of the papers recommendations are likely to be politically difficult to achieve one is to merge all worker assistance programs such as unemployment insurance wage insurance and trade adjustment assistance into a single program that idea is likely to meet stiff resistance from organized labor which has lobbied against wage insurance or helping displaced workers make up lost wages for fear it would cannibalize unemployment insurance which provides a temporary cash benefit paid to anyone who loses a job the paper also calls for addressing income inequality by eliminating the payroll tax for those who earn less than the national median income of &# and possibly increasing it on higher income earners to make up the lost revenue right now the tax is capped at on the first &# of gross income for every worker mr lawrence said addressing income disparities will be critical in winning support for further liberalization of free trade "people who are in favor of free trade policies have become increasingly concerned that public support is eroding and i think the crucial group who have become more disenchanted are college educated americans who havent seen significant income growth " at the same time the paper suggests new ways to hammer out free trade deals if doha round fails including having the u s negotiate a broad free trade agreement that would be open to any world trade organization member that wants to participate it also calls for giving the president permanent authority to negotiate free trade deals on an up or down vote while the three economists hail from different points on the political spectrum they said they were able to reach consensus in part because there was no choice but to compromise and take steps to address the backlash "we all recognize the power of what the global economy has brought us " mr aldonas said "its time to start thinking radically about how we use the tools of economic policy to address the challenges "
