who killed palestine bill clinton did it yasser arafat did it so did george w bush yitzhak rabin hosni mubarak ariel sharon al jazeera and the bbc the list of culprits in the whodunit called "who killed palestine " is neither short nor mutually exclusive but since future historians are bound to ask the question lets get a head start by suggesting some answers and make no mistake no matter how much diplomatic military and financial oxygen is pumped into mahmoud abbass palestinian authority its oxygen flowing to a corpse palestine has always been a notional place a field of dreams belonging only to those who know how to keep it israelis have held on to their state because they were able to develop the political military and economic institutions that a state requires to survive beginning with its monopoly on the use of legitimate force in its nearly years as an autonomous entity the pa has succeeded in none of that despite being on the receiving end of unprecedented international good will and largesse hamass seizure of the gaza strip this month and the consequent division of the pa into two hostile geographically distinct camps is only the latest in a chain of events set in motion when israel agreed in september to accept arafat and the plo as the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people an early indicator of what lay ahead took place on july when arafat made his triumphal entry into gaza while carrying in the trunk of his mercedes four of the palestinian causes most violent partisans among them were the organizers of the munich olympics massacre and the maalot school massacre if ever there was an apt metaphor for what arafats rule would bring this was it arafat was determined to use gaza and the west bank as a staging ground for attacks against israel and he said so publicly and repeatedly "o haifa o jerusalem you are returning you are returning" "we will make life unbearable for jews by psychological warfare and population explosion" "with blood and spirit we will redeem you palestine" with equal determination the clinton administration and the israeli governments of rabin shimon peres and ehud barak treated arafats remarks as only so much rhetorical bluster mr clinton desperately wanted a nobel peace prize israelis wanted out of the occupation business at almost any cost these were respectable goals but neither had as its primary aim the creation of a respectable palestinian state later after the second intifada had erupted in all its suicidal frenzy former u s negotiator dennis ross would admit the clinton administration became too obsessed with process at the expense of substance he should give himself more credit the decision to legitimize arafat was israels not americas once he was brought inside the proverbial tent he was bound to put a match to it still the clinton administration elevated arafat like no other leader of the s if the rais came to flatter himself as a second saladin the flattery of white house banquets surely played a role the global media also did their bit in arafats elevation successive generations of jerusalem bureau chiefs developed a conveniently even handed narrative pitting moderates on both sides against extremists on both sides a narrative in which arafat was a "moderate" and ariel sharon was an "extremist " when mr sharon took his famous walk on the temple mount in september it was easy to cast him as the villain and palestinian rioters and later suicide bombers as the justifiably aggrieved cheering palestinians on from the sidelines were the arab media and the governments that own them happy to channel domestic discontent toward a foreign drama as with individuals nations generally benefit from self criticism and sometimes from the criticism of others no people in modern history have been so immune from both as the palestinians in abdel sattar kassem a professor of political science in the palestinian city of nablus put his name to the "petition of the " written to "stand against arafats tyranny and corruption " arafat imprisoned him the rest of the world barely took notice arafats global popularity reached its apogee in the spring of exactly at the same time the civilian israeli death toll from terrorism reached its height yet what served arafats interests well served palestinian interests poorly arafat learned from his experience with mr clinton that one could bamboozle an american president and not pay a price george w bush took a different view and effectively shut the palestinians out of his agenda arafat learned from the "international community" that no one would look too closely at where its foreign aid was spent but a reputation for theft has been the undoing of fatah arafat thought he could harness the religious power of "martyrdom" to his political ends but at the core of every suicide bombing is an act of self destruction and a nation that celebrates the former inevitably courts the latter above all arafat equated territory with power but what the experience of an unoccupied gaza strip has shown is the palestinians unfitness for political sovereignty there are no jewish settlers to blame for gazas plight anymore no israeli soldiers to be filmed demolishing palestinian homes the israeli right which came to detest mr sharon for pulling out of the strip might reconsider its view of the man and the deed nothing has so completely soured the world on the idea of a palestinian state as the experience of it what does this mean for the future at yesterdays summit in egypt israeli prime minister ehud olmert egyptian president hosni mubarak and jordanian king abdullah threw rose petals at mr abbass feet but the potentates of the middle east will not midwife into existence a state the chief political movement of which has claims to both democratic and islamist legitimacy the u s and israel will never bless hamastan even if the eu and the u n come around to it and they can only do so much for the feckless mr abbas "palestine " as we know it today will revert to what it was shadowland between israel and its neighbors and palestinians as we know them today will revert to who they were arabs whether there might have been a better outcome is anyones guess but the dream that was palestine is finally dead
