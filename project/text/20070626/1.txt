entire sec makes house call rough week on street prompts congress panel to study market issues washington in the latest sign congress is turning a skeptical eye toward wall street an influential house committee is set to hear testimony from all five commissioners of the securities and exchange commission today the first time that has happened in at least years in the past week a series of events has put a spotlight on the street bear stearns cos bailed out one of its hedge funds that had losses tied to the subprime loan market and a senate report contended that a lack of regulatory oversight allowed one collapsed hedge fund amaranth advisors llc to dominate and influence natural gas trading last year at the same time congress has started considering whether to change the way some private equity firms are taxed with the democrats in control of both houses of congress it is an opportunity for democratic lawmakers to frame such issues as the rise of hedge funds chief executive pay and shareholder rights through their own prism and to sharpen the debate heading into the election "its signaling power " said james angel associate professor of finance at georgetown universitys mcdonough school of business in washington of the invitation to all five commissioners among the topics to be discussed at todays hearing of the house financial services committee corporate governance the secs enforcement policy shareholder lawsuits hedge funds and a provision of the sarbanes oxley act dealing with reporting corporate earnings according to an internal committee memo congress is focusing on areas that have "populist appeal as we go into the election cycle " mr angel said he added that when populist lawmakers are looking to win votes "when all else fails blame the rich " one house democratic aide said the committee will likely conduct many more examinations of the financial sector that all five commissioners will testify signifies an interest by massachusetts democrat barney frank chairman of the committee to get a full reading of a diverse set of issues from the agencys leaders under republican sec chairman christopher cox the sec for the most part has had unanimous votes on rule making and major decisions "chris cox is an able guy and in charge but if you look at the history of the sec over the past years the fact that its a five person body versus a one person body is relevant " mr frank said under the previous sec chairman the commission split on several important proposals john nester an sec spokesman said "we are eager to discuss our investor protection initiatives past present and future " to date mr frank has been complimentary of the sec under mr cox a former republican congressman from california while mr frank is a moderate on many financial areas and is against regulation for its own sake he has focused on the widening income gap between the rich and the poor mr frank says he plans at the hearing to give the sec "credit" on a recent change it made to better implement sarbanes oxley without "compromising its core " he also says he hopes to move the agency "in the direction of more proxy access " or making it easier for shareholders to put proposals up for vote on corporate ballots an area that has divided the commission in the past mr cox has promised to propose a rule this summer mr frank plans to ask the commissioners about an abusive kind of short selling known as naked short selling in a regular short sale an investor borrows stock in hopes that the share price will drop so the investor can use lower price shares to replace the borrowed ones locking in a profit in a naked short sale which is almost always illegal the investor never borrows the stock mr frank also hopes the commissioners "will explain the enforcement policy in a way that will put peoples mind at rest " the sec this year initiated a pilot program that switches how the agencys staff would negotiate penalties against corporations the staff previously reached a settlement and took it to the commission for a vote under this program the staff needs to get approval from the commission to negotiate and is given a settlement range some critics fear it will discourage the staff from seeking penalties against corporations mr cox says it will lead to stiffer penalties already mr frank has focused attention on big industries and has held two hearings this year on hedge funds and private equity he has expressed concerns that pension plans may have too much exposure to hedge funds largely unregulated pools of capital that invest in a wide array of strategies and are riskier than investing in the stock market he also is watchful of any potential ramifications buyouts might have on a companys labor force such as layoffs mr frank says is he concerned about a systemic risk hedge funds may pose to the financial markets but he expects to hold off his questions until next month when he plans to hold a hearing with the members of the presidents working group on financial markets earlier this year the presidents working group which includes the sec said regulation should be left to counterparties such as banks or brokerage firms in any deals
