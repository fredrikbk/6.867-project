hospitals crack down on deadly infections new testing allows facilities to quickly identify carriers the hand washing problem as concern over antibiotic resistant infections grows some hospitals are aggressively screening patients with new tests that can rapidly detect one of the most problematic bugs several hospitals say the effort though expensive is paying off in part because they can quickly isolate patients carrying the strain to help prevent its spread after six months of testing every patient entering newark beth israel medical centers intensive care unit officials say the new tracking regime has helped it slash new infections by methicillin resistant staphylococcus bacteria to nearly zero and cut the proportion of intensive care patients carrying the bug to from similarly the university of maryland medical center says early results from its own surveillance efforts suggest it is preventing enough costly infections to pay for itself staph infections are common in health care settings but the spread of drug resistant strains is particularly worrisome because they are hard to treat and can quickly become deadly in patients whose immune systems are already under strain methicillin resistant staph aureus or mrsa has become increasingly common making up more than of hospital staph infections in recent years up from in the mid s the federal centers for disease control and prevention estimates that people are hospitalized with mrsa infections each year and about die with an annual price tag totaling &# billion a year "its clear that mrsa infections are on the rise " says john jernigan a medical epidemiologist with the cdc in atlanta indeed new data released this week suggest that the drug resistant bacteria strain could be considerably more common that previously thought a study surveying infection rates at more than health care facilities including about one in five u s hospitals found that of every patients were infected with mrsa at least another patients per carried the organism without having an active infection likely helping spread it within the hospital and outside according to the study which was carried out by the association for professionals in infection control and epidemiology those figures are well above previous cdc estimates which suggested that of every hospital patients discharged had been diagnosed with mrsa earlier estimates have used a different methodology analyzing largely intensive care unit patients and relying on a few hundred hospitals for data with more large teaching facilities and fewer of the small community hospitals that predominate in the u s the new study also suggests that mrsa may be as big a problem in many areas of the hospital not just in the intensive care units and surgical wards that are most closely watched for the bug apic found that two thirds of the mrsa infections hospitals reported last fall were in general medical wards "mrsas not confined to the icu any more its across the medical service " says william jarvis the former cdc epidemiologist who oversaw the study preventing mrsa infections in hospitals can be as simple as conscientious hand washing isolating infected patients and using disposable gowns and gloves in their rooms but outside of emergency rooms hand washing rates are "abysmal" fewer than half of doctors nationally do so consistently says jonathan perlin chief medical officer for hca inc the nashville tenn based hospital chain cindy gaston of elverta calif was hospitalized last year after a mrsa infection burst the incision from a recent caesarean section she says hospital personnel rarely put on disposable gowns and gloves when they entered her hospital room "that happened i would say next to never " she says even today many hospitals uncover mrsa problems chiefly when they notice a rash of hard to treat infections often urinary tract infections among patients using catheters or blood infections among those recovering from surgeries new computer systems allow hospitals to pull together data from bedside monitors lab test results and more to identify problem areas more quickly anne dikon infection control coordinator at robert wood johnson university hospital in hamilton township n j says such a system at her hospital lets her zero in on troubling patterns sometimes within hours before she said "by the time i would manually count all that data and go through it its two weeks down the road " other hospitals including newark beth israel and the university of maryland medical center are going further by trying to identify patients carrying mrsa before they show signs of infection some hospitals are testing most patients who come in for any reason not just those showing signs of infection ummc for example swabs the nose of every icu patient as well as "high risk" patients elsewhere in its system for example anyone who has spent the night in a health care facility during the previous year and those with problematic skin infections many patients are swabbed again before leaving the hospital called "active surveillance " the effort has traditionally meant laboriously collecting swabs growing laboratory cultures and then testing them for resistance against key antibiotics a process that can take days but new equipment allows hospitals to rapidly scan samples for telltale stretches of the bugs dna letting hospitals identify drug resistant strains in a few hours instead they can then isolate those patients making it less likely the bug will spread to others some hospitals also treat the patient with topical medication to kill the bacteria the technique has been controversial in the u s because of its expense the rapid test alone can cost &# to &# per test or several times more than a traditional culture after labor and equipment costs are factored in isolating additional patients those carrying mrsa but who arent showing signs of active infection adds to the cost nonetheless proponents say the rapid testing systems pay for themselves although some patients continue to arrive at newark beth israel already infected with the antibiotic resistant bug the hospital expects its rapid testing regimen to cut its spending on vancomycin the antibiotic of last resort for virulent infections to drop by &# this year even given the additional cost of the rapid tests the hospital figures it will save about &# a year enough to pay off the testing equipment within three or four years "at the same time there are a lot of benefits that are not monetary in nature " says patricia tsang who runs the hospitals laboratory including "decreased infection in already sick patients increasing patient safety and possibly decreasing length of stay for the patients in the hospital " the university of maryland medical center expects its rapid testing regimen to break even financially with total costs approaching &# a year for equipment labor and materials officials said they believe they have prevented about mrsa infections over six months saving the hospital about &# in direct treatment costs and insurers and patients still more "in reality its a tremendous savings " says harold standiford professor of medicine and medical director for infection control at ummc "were avoiding morbidity and mortality for the patients in the hospital theyre not as sick when theyre in here theyre not having complications theyre getting well faster " so far only about of hospitals are using active surveillance to identify patients carrying mrsa without active symptoms according to the apic study and just a fraction of those are using the rapid testing devices although a quarter to a third of the u s population is believed to carry mrsa often without symptoms health care facilities typically test only those who show signs of infection or in some cases those believed to be at high risk the federal food and drug administration has approved devices for rapidly identifying mrsa from two manufacturers becton dickinson &amp co of franklin lakes n j and sunnyvale calif based cepheid and industry insiders say others are working to bring similar devices to market infection control some tips on preventing infection with mrsa a virulent and antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria keep cuts and abrasions clean dry and covered dont share towels razors or other toiletries ask doctors and nurses to wash their hands or use alcohol hand sanitizer see a doctor about red swollen bumps like spider bites sometimes with pus that dont heal easily source centers for disease control and prevention corrections &amp amplifications research suggests that nearly of americans carry methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria or mrsa a difficult to treat antibiotic resistant strain a personal journal article tuesday on hospital efforts to fight mrsa incorrectly said as much as a third of americans carry the drug resistant strain wsj june
