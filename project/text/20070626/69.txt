politics &amp economics near gaza unrest in the sinai political tensions in egyptian desert are fueling extremism al goura egypt the militant group hamass takeover of the gaza strip has focused the worlds attention on the turmoil inside the palestinian enclave but there may be new troubles brewing right next door in the egyptian sinai desert in this desolate but strategically crucial region connecting egypt israel and the gaza strip the borders divide tribes and families that spill across them now deteriorating social and political conditions are fueling extremism that can be easily spread through these connections both locals and israeli security officials say hamass military ouster of rival faction fatah in gaza days ago has further heightened tensions sheik arafat khedr saalman a year old clan chief and former schoolteacher who runs a community development program in al goura is a member of the northern sinais largest bedouin tribe the sawarka its peoples extend from here into gaza israel and even jordan but in northern sinai where the tribes roots are deepest so are its woes local leaders say while there are no solid statistics mr saalman estimates unemployment is about around al goura the town is the hub for a local population of about people who lived without telephone lines to their homes until infrastructure problems abound the water system has failed delivering saltwater unfit for drinking or agriculture to most towns and villages "our young people are boiling over inside because they have nothing here " says mr saalman now following egyptian elections last week the sawarka tribe has lost representation in egypts upper house of parliament for the first time tribal leaders say the winner was the candidate backed by the local egyptian military governor appointed by cairo one day before the polling some sawarka leaders were so upset by the tactics that they called on their year old chieftain sheikh khalef hassan ali khalef to let them burn ballots in protest officials working for the governor repeatedly said he was unavailable for interviews but his deputy denied any irregularities the turmoil is widening the gap that has long existed between the northern sinais bedouin residents and the ethnically distinct politicians and bureaucrats who make policy and allocate resources from cairo says mr khalef "they dont absorb or understand the bedouins and the bedouins themselves dont like cairo " the tribes leader says sporting a white turban and a brown cloak he receives guests from a stuffed chair pushed against a concrete wall with peeling white paint inside a single story building he sometimes faintly waves a husk like whisk to shoo the ubiquitous sand flies the gap between cairo and the bedouins of northern sinai was a fairly local concern until when extremists launched coordinated bombings at three resorts near the israeli border the first acts of terror in egypt since four more attacks and more than deaths later israeli officials say the sinai remains restive and rife with extremism with the tribal connections serving as a conduit into gaza for militant islamic groups the egyptian terror groups behind the attacks are rooted in the area where the sawarka are strongest and some tribe members were involved according to egyptian officials and sawarka leaders egyptian officials deny there are major problems here either with terrorists or bedouins abdul hamid abu nada the brigadier general who serves as deputy to the north sinai governor portrayed his region as a paradise for locals and tourists alike he suggested in an interview last week that there isnt a divide between the government and the bedouins because "here there is only egyptian nationalism " he said terrorism concerns are largely the creation of foreign media but at a rare briefing this spring in tel aviv yuval diskin the chief of israels shin bet security agency told foreign journalists that israeli intelligence officials see the sinai as crucial new ground for what his agency calls the "global jihad" movement of sunni muslim extremists who espouse ideology similar to osama bin ladens and employ nearly identical terrorist tactics "i think the egyptians have big big problems here " mr diskin said of the sinai calling it a dangerous frontier he also said israeli officials are seeing growing connections between sinai militants and those in gaza mr diskin also linked terrorists to traffickers who have long thrived in the desert with gaza a primary destination for goods including military grade explosives and rockets "the smuggling networks and the terror networks are all connected " mr diskin said late last week senior israeli security officials said their concerns about ties between gaza militants and sinai extremist groups are magnified now that the square mile gaza strip and its nearly million palestinians are under the control of hamas some analysts however contend hamas will see such groups as competitors and clamp down israeli officials have said getting the egyptians to do more to stop the flow of weapons and explosives into gaza will be crucial but if extremists move deadly cargo in service to ideology rather than just for cash such efforts could prove more challenging in recent months gaza has witnessed a string of violent acts by shadowy islamist organizations including fire bombings of internet cafes video or music rental stores libraries and businesses denounced by extremists as impure or potentially corrupting the groups and their agenda bear a chilling resemblance to those who claimed responsibility for the attacks across the border that began in which have focused on tourist resorts since then the egyptian government has promised to do more to develop the northern sinai but mr saalman the head of the al goura development agency says only a handful of jobs were created around his community ahmed salama hussein landed one teaching school but he says commuting costs eat up almost a third of his monthly salary which is less than &# "im a volunteer " he says with a broad smile mr khalef the sawarka tribal leader says the government is defeating itself "unfortunately the government doesnt appreciate or trust the bedouins it sees the bedouins only as smugglers and criminals "
