making retirement fit your personality many people spend years looking ahead to the day they retire after decades of a to grind they daydream about finally having the freedom to do what they want and for some that first day they dont have to show up at their old job is an exhilarating experience but for others leaving a career is an unsettling event for more than years dania smith worked as a rehabilitation counselor for disabled adults focusing on helping them in the workplace she worked with companies that hired the disabled and she developed workshops and training conferences in she began thinking about retirement but it wasnt a step the long island n y resident was entirely comfortable with "i was very frightened about the idea of retiring " says mrs smith now years old "what would i do next " for people like mrs smith work has defined much of their lives it has provided a creative spark an outlet for energy and a source of personal satisfaction often work has been the center of a social network of friends that can mean coping with some big changes at retirement and it requires some careful thinking about how to spend your time especially in the early years of retirement in particular its critical to plan your retirement based on a realistic assessment of your own personality and interests not just an idealized vision "one of the biggest mistakes some people make is to change their life drastically " says toni antonucci a psychology professor at the university of michigan "people think that the idyllic retirement is to go fishing or play golf while that works for a while if you love golf or fishing if youre the type of person who likes to have a lot of irons in the fire you arent going to be happy with this for long " and dont be surprised if there are emotional ups and downs as you make the transition says donald reitzes a sociology professor at georgia state university however he says "after an adjustment period most people end up feeling better about themselves " one of the more difficult struggles can be holding onto your sense of your "identity" if it was wrapped up in your previous job or figuring out how to create a new one says kathleen sherrell who was a professor at northwestern university for years first teaching nursing then psychology this is something she knows about firsthand even though she spends her time counseling others on how to deal with change in their lives when circumstances on the job had her thinking about retiring she found it a challenge mrs sherrell now retired from her full time teaching post in but found it difficult to make a clean break she didnt want a going away party and she held onto a northwestern email address she noticed how different it was suddenly not to make a daily trip to the same two or three blocks of chicago where she had spent the better part of three decades "i had identified myself as a member of the faculty at a pretty major university for many years " she says "it was certainly connected to my soul " but mrs sherrell whose husband had retired before her was able to turn to a sideline she had while a professor a private practice as a psychologist in addition after leaving northwestern she took a part time job as an adjunct professor at another school while she enjoyed it she didnt like being back on somebody elses schedule she dropped it after one semester and is happier focusing on her private practice "i can make my schedule according to my own rules " she says carol berman too has discovered that its all right to let herself relax after many years working for nonprofit organizations she keeps busy with a home pottery studio and pottery classes shes also on the board of the last nonprofit she had worked for but she says shes sure to schedule time to go to a movie or lunch with friends "sometimes there are days where i have nothing on my schedule and i consider that just fine " she says mary baim of chicago who retired late last year after a long career working with nonprofits knew that her personality would make the switch to retirement a challenge "i am constantly in motion " she says "even sitting down to read a book makes me feel guilty " instead of leaving the work world all at once she eased out by switching her job from full time to part time even that was difficult she says "i dont like to do things halfway" she says but just stopping work cold would have been too disruptive "it would have been almost impossible to just walk out " says the year old bob schultheis for years was a computer technology consultant in minnesota as he and his wife marion got closer to retirement they decided to make a change in their lives and return to new york city when mr schultheis retired he took a hobby he had pursued painting and turned it into a full time project he signed up at the art students league of new york where he could get studio space "its great " he says after five years of retirement "its like going to the office i have a place to go and a group of friends there that ive met over the years " mrs schultheis joked with him that when people ask what he does for a living he shouldnt say hes retired and taking painting classes he should just say hes an artist "now it just rolls off his tongue " she says now mrs schultheis is struggling with the same issue of how to redefine herself in retirement a former money manager this year she found herself retired sooner than she had expected "my whole identity was really tied up in wall street its been my business since the s thats where my friends are and we live and breathe stocks " she says for mrs smith who was afraid of what retirement would bring the solution was to get involved with a support group called the transition network go to thetransitionnetwork org online the group among other endeavors helps women make the switch from the workplace to retirement mrs smith helped launch a long island chapter it has provided her with a
