the readers turn on travel and divorce readers are in control this week expressing their thoughts on traveling with kids and the more somber topic of divorce a few weeks ago i wrote of our plans to visit london later this year with our son and daughter who at the time of the trip will be and almost respectively my wife amy is concerned that an overseas adventure is inappropriate for our little girl because of the lengthy flights and the "joys" of lugging a toddler on vacation i disagree and think we shouldnt penalize our son just because his sister might be too young readers offered an abundance of thoughts on this one but almost all boiled down to the same message go colleen troy in charleston s c says she read the column the day after her jet lagged family of four had returned from nine days in paris "its possible to enjoy a trip like that with kids of disparate ages " says ms troy whose children are and years old "but importantly you have to approach it as two different trips one for the youngest and one for the oldest " to that end mom and dad employed a divide and conquer strategy each day one parent partnered with one child and spent time doing things appropriate to that childs age their year old daughter enjoyed small trips to such places as parks certain museums carousels and zoos their son "loved window shopping on the champs elysees craning to see the mona lisa riding the bato bus along the seine and just hanging out on the streets " ms troy says the family spent afternoons apart and then reconnected late in the day to relax and eat dinner "there was plenty to talk about plenty of togetherness and plenty of age appropriate fun the entire trip " ms troy says several parents noted that a cheap portable dvd player for each kid works wonders on the long plane rides but renee platz in sacramento calif has her own approach to quelling a childs fidgeting she took her daughter to germany a couple of years ago when the girl was just years old her biggest fear on the hour plane rides "being one of these parents with a child that cried or was running in circles on the plane " so ms platz purchased numerous small gifts at a dollar store puzzles cards and such and then wrapped each one individually "once we got on the plane i showed my daughter the bag with the gifts " ms platz says "and told her if she was a good girl she could pick one gift every hour the anticipation kept her excited and very well behaved we had a fantastic flight " while most readers said "go " a handful said "no " carrie gillespie in london is in that skeptical camp ms gillespie and her husband came to that conclusion the hard way after vacationing with her sister in laws family which includes a girl age and a son who is "the boy loved everything and my husband and i had a great time entertaining him " she says "however the year old was miserable she wouldnt stay in her buggy she cried until she was held and her parents did hold her for three days "so two of us took care of the boy having a great time and two took care of the girl and had a completely miserable time why deny your boy a great trip and make your daughter miserable " earlier this year i wrote about the near divorce that amy and i worked through several years ago and how sometimes it takes nearly losing everything to realize what you have tony lentz in phoenix says the honesty of that column resonated with him he says his wife after years of marriage "proclaimed that she had not been happy for a while and was not sure if we could work things out on a long term basis the main problem my fault was although i still and have always loved my wife the business pressure kids mortgage etc had blinded me to the fact that i no longer showed my wife how much i loved and cherished her it was quite a wake up call for me "looking back i am so ashamed of how little i respected her and how little i showed love to her all the while loving her in my eyes its amazing how much better i feel about myself now with the simple ways i make her feel better about herself i know she was ready for a divorce as she did not think i could change or want to change my evil ways i am proud of how truthful and intimate i have become how much better our relationship is and just how much better i feel about life in general i know my wife feels much better about how she is treated and looked upon by me " a reader in lopatcong n j said the column hit closer to home than imaginable "my husband is moving out of our house tomorrow and i hope the space he gets is enough for him to realize that all he needs is right here " she said divorce was possible "ive discovered that i cant make him enjoy being around us i cant make him realize that life is not cheating him because he drives a four door sedan instead of alternating between a corvette and a harley that vacations are to disney not vegas or hedonism we have so much yet he wants so much more his dreams and desires are now his own and not the shared ones we came up with eight years ago when we married " that email arrived in early january last week the reader sent an update after living separately for a few months the two have reunited "through some intense individual and couples therapy " she writes her husband discovered "he didnt have realistic expectations of life as a father and husband even after eight years of marriage and six years of parenthood "as i tried to gently remind him that he was no longer a single guy with his own agenda his mind would not allow him to process what i said so he shut down i became his enemy "but like you he said it took losing us to realize that changes needed to be made and those changes needed to be made by him ive seen a degree change from when i wrote my previous letter and i find myself falling deeper and deeper in love with him i have no doubt this made our marriage so much stronger we still have our moments as every couple does but i no longer feel abandoned and insignificant "
