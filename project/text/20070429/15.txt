real time the future of wireless isps businesses and even cities seek to offer cheap or free connections which will win online edition not so long ago wi fi was a home project for tech geeks with a high tolerance for fiddling with router settings and wep encryption today wireless internet access is regarded as practically a digerati birthright finding yourself in an airport or hotel without free wireless access is as odd and unwelcome as finding out your rental car doesnt have a cd player wait a year or two and youll be able to substitute "satellite radio" or "ipod jack" for "cd player " wireless access is available in more and more places but theres no rhyme or reason to how you get it airports and hotels offer wi fi for free so do cafes fast food places bookstores and other businesses hoping to make some money off people camping on the premises while they access the net starbucks and mcdonalds are wireless front ends for t mobile and wayport which offer a range of plans for hourly daily or monthly wireless access anywhere a network hot spot can be found a strategy also followed by boingo wireless and then some cities and towns are at various stages in offering cheap or free wireless access and of course theres just letting your wireless card hunt for a signal leaking out of your neighbors home this weekend my wireless utility found five such networks three were unsecured two were obviously the default network name that came with the router i imagine thats fairly typical for a block of apartment buildings in brownstone brooklyn hopping on your neighbors signal is variously described as "leeching " "piggybacking " "borrowing a signal " or "daily life " and opinions about it cover a range that you can guess at from those terms my own network is open but the ssid isnt broadcast a combination that reflects early tech woes and the fact that ive never made my mind up about what i ought to do it all adds up to a patchwork of approaches and one should be cautious about making definitive predictions about how all this tumult will shake out but the general direction is clear take last weeks deal between spains fon pronounced "fonn" and time warner cable pronounced "time warner cable" fon sells wireless routers called la foneras that let its members foneros split their wi fi connection into an encrypted channel for their own personal use and a public channel for the use of passers by creating a network of public wireless hotspots fon divides foneros into three types a linus shares his or her access and in return can log onto any fon hotspot free of charge an alien doesnt share access and can get hours of access to the fon network for &# or &# and a bill shares his or her access and skips free log on rights in exchange for half the money fon collects from aliens using that bills wi fi connection fons clever it offers options for regular on the go internet users and businesses looking to make a little money from wi fi then throws some social networking whimsy into the mix with a dash of marketing note that fons definition of "alien" makes the entire world foneros that said the idea isnt one that makes you automatically think the worlds rearranging itself for one thing u s isps position on sharing an internet connection wirelessly has been clear its stealing from those isps perspective fon must seem a hair too close to the dark side of social networking an interesting business model predicated on your customers stealing your product and handing it out to others except time warner cable has now given its million home broadband customers its blessing to become foneros and thus share their bandwidth while a time warner spokeswoman declined to offer much in the way of specifics about the deal fon usa ceo joanna rees says one benefit to time warner is that "with fon you cant leech nobody talks about what the leeching numbers are but theyre significant " dana spiegel executive director of nycwireless is skeptical of the deals impact seeing it as little more than a public relations move for both companies fons network he says is "to be perfectly blunt tiny" and predominantly residential making it not particularly valuable in public places ms rees says fon has foneros in the u s though she acknowledges that fon may not have the visibility of say t mobile with its starbucks locations while she maintains fons footprint will be more effective over the long term "over the short term we have to be strategic " an example of that strategy a "fonbucks" campaign in which fon has given away free la foneras to people living near coffee shops mr spiegel calls time warner cables deal with fon "a parasitic billing system im paying the same amount of money for less service and time warner cable is getting more money from what ive already paid for " his volunteer groups members create free hot spots in new york city parks and public spaces and help bring free wireless net access to underserved communities in his view nycwirelesss approach is better "instead of taking a reduction in my value and handing it back to time warner im taking that value and spreading it out among my local community " then there are efforts by cities and towns to offer cheap or free wi fi the most celebrated such efforts are taking shape in philadelphia and san francisco but many other cities and towns are pursuing that goal motivated by a desire to bridge the "digital divide" between rich and poor and eagerness to bill themselves as tech friendly one thing mr spiegel and ms rees seem to agree on its too simplistic to see muni wi fi as a threat to the aspirations of big isps and other wireless providers rather muni wi fi is likely to be complementary to such efforts "what municipal offerings do is raise the baseline " mr spiegel says contending that such services will primarily convert those left behind today "todays baseline is dial up when municipal networks roll out youll see a move from dial up" up to a new baseline established isps arent sitting still either they know perfectly well that the key problem with wireless today is you cant take your access with you leaving on the go surfers to place their bets on which approach will yield the best coverage an established network such as t mobiles the spread of free hot spots efforts by cities and towns reciprocal networks such as fons or the deployment of new technologies such as the much hyped wimax that could supplant wi fi with much longer ranges and greater speeds which will win my guess is all of the above and theyll be such overlap between the various flavors of wireless access that well largely stop thinking about it wireless will become something akin to cellular service taken largely for granted with a bit of behind the scenes technological help well spend most of our time hooked into our home network or other networks our isps struck interoperability deals with should such a network not be available our devices will seek out free signals or tell us additional access fees will apply what will we pay that depends most of us i bet will pay about what we pay today but well get much higher download and upload speeds but those of us who either dont want or dont need such bells and whistles will do just fine with free access provided by cities or ad supported access from businesses "when first introduced air conditioning was a luxury item " mr spiegel notes "stores that installed it saw a benefit as it became more available more and more stores added it and it became more of a cost of doing business " so it will be with wireless and as with air conditioning well be startled to find ourselves going without now and again well even feel nostalgic about it what do you think the future holds for wireless access write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
