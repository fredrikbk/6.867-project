marketwatch buyers saving sooner on hybrid cars if youve been toying with the idea of buying a hybrid car the cost equation is tilting in your favor until recently buying a hybrid meant you were willing to shell out for a pricier car because you believed in helping the environment or because you liked to own the latest high tech gadget auto research firms found it could take up to years depending on the model of gasoline pump savings to offset hybrids higher sticker price but now its taking less time to break even thanks to car makers new deals on hybrids right now the average incentive for hybrid models is about &# according to edmunds com "up until maybe a year or so ago we were paying over sticker prices for hybrids " says philip reed consumer advice editor with edmunds com but now "there are hybrids on car lots and theyre being discounted thats unusual and its also at a time when gas prices are high so people are going to want these cars " mr reed says those incentives are helping to shorten the length of time it takes to recoup a hybrids higher sticker price last year edmunds com found that it would take a bit more than two years to break even on buying a toyota prius when compared with buying a gas powered toyota camry le today that break even period is less than a year assuming you drive miles a year gasoline prices play a big part in those comparisons "obviously hybrids are much more fuel efficient with gasoline prices back up again and likely to stay higher through the summer months it tends to make it a little more attractive proposition " says rob gentile director of consumer reports auto price service but incentives on hybrids may not be your typical deals mr reed says with the prius toyota "wanted to reduce the price so they could sell more of them but they didnt want to put an incentive on it because they didnt want to devalue the brand so they began to discount the options its a car that has a lot of options on it if you cut the price on the options effectively youre dropping the price of the car rather significantly " meanwhile the ford escape and mercury mariner hybrids now come with a &# cash back deal plus an additional &# for the dealer that can be used to lower the sale price you wont find incentives on all hybrids for instance theres no special offer on the honda civic hybrid or the lexus rxh hybrid now mr reed says there are plenty of variables in figuring out how much a hybrid will cost you versus a gas powered car after the sticker price including incentives theres how much you drive each year the more miles you average the quicker a hybrid will pay off for example if you drive miles a year on average it will take you just a little over one year to offset the higher sticker price of the four door sedan camry hybrid versus a similar model gas powered camry according to edmunds com data then youre in money saving territory but if you drive miles a year itll take you a full two years based on the current national average of gasoline at about &# a gallon and current sticker prices incentives and tax credits when you compare hybrids with the most fuel efficient gas powered cars however the break even point remains fairly distant for instance it takes more than nine years to break even with the honda accord hybrid a four door sedan compared with a similar gas powered honda accord according to the edmunds com data assuming miles driven per year and gas at &# gallon still the higher gas prices go the better hybrids look the break even point between those two hondas would drop to years if gasoline rose to &# a gallon theres another consideration the tax credits worth as much as &# to consumers who buy new hybrids theyre usually not available to taxpayers who pay the alternative minimum tax with current sticker prices and a federal tax credit the lexus gsh four door sedan hybrid would cost slightly less than the similar gas powered lexus gs sedan the credits phase out once a car maker sells hybrid vehicles so far only toyota has surpassed that mark so the credit on all toyota hybrid cars is now worth less for instance last year a prius buyer could enjoy the &# tax credit but this year the credit on that car is only &# and there will be no credit if the car is purchased after september more information can be found at irs gov with a search for "tax credit for hybrid vehicles " another cost consideration is maintenance and repair theres good news for hybrids on that front mr reed says "people are really worried about the batteries and its proven to be much less of a problem than anybody ever thought " he says "plus nearly all the manufacturers have very long and strong warranties to protect you " he adds as long as eight years and miles or even years and miles for the hybrid components dont forget to look into insurance costs mr gentile of consumer reports says he notes that some insurers may charge more to insure a hybrid while others offer discounts still hybrids proved popular among plenty of car buyers even before incentives started appearing thats because cost is not the only driver when it comes to choosing a car "its an emotional decision in several ways " mr reed says for one concern with global warming is becoming widespread among consumers he adds andrea coombes is a personal finance writer for marketwatch www marketwatch
