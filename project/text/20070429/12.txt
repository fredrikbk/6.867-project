midcap stocks may be just the right size debating the virtues of small versus large stocks dont forget those in between with economic growth slowing and inflation still running high finding the best spots in the equity market can be tough small stocks can be volatile and more vulnerable to sharp declines if the economy slows too much although the shares of the largest companies can be safe havens in a nervous market they have recently offered lower returns than smaller fare perhaps the most enticing option shares of midsize companies so far this year they have performed better than both their smaller and larger counterparts and there are reasons to believe the group will continue to do well neither too large nor too small they can offer the best of both worlds "investors are more risk averse to small caps than they were last year but they still want returns that will outpace the large cap sector " says chris johnson chief investment strategist at johnson research group in cincinnati "so you should see a migration to midcaps " investment professionals define midcap stocks in varying ways but the definition used by standard &amp poors stocks with market capitalization or total stock market value of &# billion to &# billion is one measure that is fairly widely used so far this year the firms s&amp p midcap index is up surpassing the climb of the s&amp p smallcap and the rise of the large cap s&amp p stock index among household name companies in the s&amp p midcap securities firm a g edwards restaurant operator applebees international book retailer barnes &amp noble airline jetblue airways and home builder toll brothers one factor that bodes well for midcaps this year is strong earnings growth earnings for companies in the s&amp p midcap are expected to grow about this year according to standard &amp poors that compares with about for the small cap group and about for the large caps "these midcap companies are earlier in the growth trajectory their profit cycle can last longer " says standard &amp poors equity strategist alec young in other words many midsize companies are less mature than the nations largest companies and are expanding their businesses and profit at a faster pace "their size gives them more room to grow " this higher earnings growth of midcaps makes the stocks more valuable and offers greater incentive for investors to stay focused on this asset class says mr young the booming merger and acquisition activity that has been helping the overall stock market could provide an added boost to the midcap group midsize companies tend to be relatively established businesses but arent as expensive to buy as the largest blue chips for instance cisco sytems last month agreed to buy midsize online technology company webex communications webx for about &# billion also in march unitedhealth group agreed to buy midcap health insurer sierra health services sie for &# billion "you are going to see a lot more m&amp a in the midcap area " says mr johnson of johnson research midcaps have been getting more expensive than large caps by some measures the s&amp p midcap is trading at about times expected earnings while the corresponding price earnings ratio or p e for the s&amp p is and that of the small cap index is however standard &amp poors mr young says that when earnings growth rates are taken into consideration midcaps look far more attractive than both large and small caps he looks at so called peg ratios or price to earnings to growth ratios that can be derived by dividing the p e by the earnings growth rate the midcap indexs peg ratio of is cheaper than the figure for the s&amp p and the number for the s&amp p one way for investors to get easy access to midcap stocks is through the midcap spdr mdy an exchange traded fund that tracks the s&amp p midcap since this exchange traded fund is based on the index investors can be certain that they will not significantly underperform the

chicago so far this year midcap mutual funds are on average the best performing of morningstars style based categories of u s stock funds of course if the economy does stumble badly then there could be a rush out of midcaps and into the blue chips "if people are really selling stocks looking for liquidity and safety midcaps wouldnt do as well as large companies " says timothy evnin portfolio manager of excelsior mid cap value &amp restructuring fund at the moment however mr evnin is upbeat about the midcap sector and says his team has been able to find plenty of good picks within this segment "midcap stocks have been on a tear for the last five years and judging by how we feel about our portfolio we see no reason why they shouldnt do well again " says mr evnin he often looks for companies that are likely to benefit from changes within the business or overall industry for instance one stock he likes is kennametal kmt a pennsylvania maker of metal cutting tools with a market capitalization of about &# billion which has climbed over the past twelve months he notes that the company has been investing in higher margin businesses that could boost its bottom line another of
