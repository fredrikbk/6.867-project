dealing with irans nuclear bomb ambitions the thoughtful commentary by ex cia chief and secretary of defense james schlesinger regarding the national intelligence estimates stunning reversal on iranian nuclear proliferation is right on the mark "stupid intelligence on iran " op ed dec this report has dashed most remaining hope that china and russia and perhaps much of europe as well will support stiffer sanctions against irans uranium enrichment program as mr schlesinger points out its well known that its a short easy path from uranium enrichment the hard part to an operable nuclear weapon the easy part its just a simple pipe bomb thus iran continues full bore developing the hard part right under our noses if president bush cant overcome the nies intelligence "estimates " his hands will effectively be tied leaving it solely up to israel to challenge irans nuclear weapons capability this may now be an impossible task since israel may have waited too long hoping the u s would do it instead thus in coming months we may witness the birth of the new caliphate headquartered in tehran when iran resumes building nuclear weapons if they havent already they will likely widely disperse them so all cant be located and destroyed then they can start handing them off with plausible deniability to their terrorist proxies like hezbollah and hamas for delivery to any country in the world including ours as they have with conventional high explosives many times past and they dont need icbms to do this small cargo ships can do the job by simply sailing into any port in the world and pushing the button mr bush has the next months to find a way to stop this because its abundantly clear that opposition presidential candidates were they to reach office are unlikely to take effective measures against this kind of risk for example sen joe biden d del recently said that hell immediately file impeachment papers should mr bush take military action against irans nuclear program the question is after his remarkable successes against the taliban saddam libya and his discovery of the a q khan network now that mr bush knows precisely where the wmds really are does he still have the desire and the will to deal with it fortunately or unfortunately well soon know the answer armageddon anyone f b smith santa rosa calif i agree with much of the thrust of what james schlesinger wrote in his commentary the recent national intelligence estimate on irans nuclear programs and even more so the press coverage of that assessment did not give sufficient weight to the danger posed by irans uranium enrichment program nor its missile programs i would add in its narrow emphasis on an apparent halt in irans weaponization activities however secretary schlesinger is inaccurate and misleading in his analysis of the factors that may have led to irans decision first of all it is highly unlikely that col moammar gadhafis decision to abandon libyas nuclear program would have affected a iranian decision to halt weaponization activities the libyan decision was not announced until late dec even less credible is the possibility that irans decision could have been affected by the exposure of a q khans nuclear technology network and his subsequent confession after all mr khans confession occurred in feb at the same time mr schlesinger ignores a crucial factor that likely proved more important to the iranian decision international inspections of irans previously secret enrichment facilities the international atomic energy agency iaea had been informed of irans fuel cycle intentions in sept and their existence was first publicly disclosed by a u s non governmental organization in dec iaea director general mohamed elbaredei first toured those facilities in february and the subsequent agency inspections led to a torrent of damaging disclosures about irans program and to irans reluctant agreement to grant the agency the power to conduct broader inspections beyond declared nuclear facilities under these circumstances it would have been surprising if iran had not taken steps to hide its nuclear weapons activities most uniquely suited to weapons production after all discovering such activities unlike the continuation of the dual use enrichment program would have represented a clear and unambiguous violation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and required a swift referral to the u n security council therefore rather than attributing the iranian decision solely to "the successes of american policy and arms" during that period mr schlesinger might have considered giving at least some credit to the international agency that may in fact have been more influential miles pomper editor arms control today washington
