business slm chiefs comments betray weak position more than imperiousness in the tightly scripted world of wall street conference calls slm chief executive albert lord cut loose last week with an impromptu display of belligerence some critics have portrayed his sarcasm and profanity as an autocrats power trip but that amounts to a misreading of events mr lords problem is more embarrassing its how little he can accomplish he isnt elaborating this week about what its like to run the student loan powerhouse known as sallie mae but analysts aides and investors say circumstances have become so turbulent that he may have little power to control what happens next strong willed bosses hate that when a crisis hits they dream of heroic turnarounds like lee iacoccas revitalization of chrysler a generation ago at the very least they want to work furiously to make something happen theres no glory in parrying outsiders urgent queries with "i dont know" and "i cant tell yet " so when the year old mr lord found himself stuck giving nonanswers on last weeks conference call he may have snapped he brushed aside two analysts requests for basic information he interrupted himself at least nine times then he meandered into gallows humor with a suggestion that his questioners would have to go through metal detector screenings if they wanted to attend another briefing next month finally mr lord startled everyone at the end of the call by telling his investor relations chief while microphones were still open "there are no more questions lets get the expletive out of here " investors shuddered sallie mae stock skidded in the first two sessions after the conference call it rebounded some monday but remains at less than half its highs earlier this year "the call didnt go as well as people hoped " keefe bruyette woods analyst sameer gokhale said diplomatically at the time sallie mae spokesman tom joyce called the metal detector remark "an attempt at humor" and the expletive "an unfortunate slip of the tongue " but with sallie maes recovery strategy dependent on raising billions of dollars from outside investors it made no sense for mr lord to taunt wall street until lately mr lords headstrong personality has served him well an accountant by training he joined sallie mae in and rose to be chief financial officer before being squeezed out in he battled back with a proxy contest calling for sallie mae to take a more aggressive approach to student lending after he won he became ceo in mr lord ran sallie mae with a cocky style that wasnt meant to win popularity contests but slms stock quadrupled during his first stint as chief of the company surpassing market averages during his eight year tenure which ended in sallie mae shook free of the last vestiges of government control becoming a purely private sector lender with assets topping &# billion when mr lord stepped aside as ceo two years ago he remained chairman but focused much of his energy on personal projects he committed to build a &# million golf course for his own use in marylands anne arundel county he also tried unsuccessfully to help buy a major league baseball team as sallie maes chairman he approved plans in april to sell the company for &# billion or &# a share to a buyout group led by j c flowers &amp co after the buyout plan collapsed this autumn he returned to the ceo spot in mid december becoming sallie maes third boss in a year mr lord stepped into a company that had lost its single a credit rating during the buyout maneuvering its new triple b status left it facing uncomfortably high funding costs he has said he wants to rebuild sallie maes credit worthiness but it isnt clear what it would take to win rating companies approval sallie maes profit margins on its basic lending business have been squeezed as a result of changes in federal subsidy rates its ability to sell off big bundles of loans and replenish its balance sheet has been impaired by the current credit crunch remedies for both those problems are nowhere in sight mr lord wants to recover a &# million breakup fee from j c flowers no way says sallie maes former suitor contending that "material adverse change" in sallie maes business gave the buyout firm the opportunity to abandon the deal at no cost the dispute could be litigated for years another setback is personal mr lord had pledged the bulk of his sallie mae holdings more than million shares as collateral for his own borrowings his bankers this month ordered that those shares be sold to keep that collateral from losing even more of its value mr lord has called the situation embarrassing now his immediate goal is to line up an equity infusion for sallie mae of &# billion to &# billion talks with several strategic investors are believed to be well advanced if those deals bear fruit they will further constrain mr lords freedom to maneuver much of his job will involve carrying out the wishes of powerful new shareholders even in apologizing for his ill timed remarks on last weeks conference call mr lord isnt his own boss anymore over the weekend he signaled through intermediaries that he felt "contrite" and wanted to say so publicly but that prospect evaporated christmas eve because sallie mae directors and attorneys didnt think the timing was right
