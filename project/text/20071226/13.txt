business world living with sovereign wealth citigroup and morgan stanley were feeling lonely around the holidays and found love in the arms of an swf and so can you we refer of course to sovereign wealth funds those large accumulations of dollars in the hands of oil producing nations and asian export powerhouses partly as a result of the way the latter run their currency systems it was a poke in the eye to some americans recently when abu dhabi came to the rescue of citigroup with a &# billion investment chinas government soon thereafter coughed up &# billion for a piece of morgan stanley followed by singapores tentative &# billion investment in merrill lynch more than &# trillion is said to be burning a hole in chinas pockets abu dhabi the mideast oil sheikdom has an estimated &# billion even russia has &# billion many say these government dollars necessarily come with a political agenda should we worry maybe but the problem is not as new as it sounds and swfs are not an especially worrisome form of it having assayed the risk of nationalist blowback sovereign investors already have been restricting themselves to passive non controlling stakes in companies behaving more like mutual funds than private equity funds more troubling in principle are foreign governments taking direct controlling stakes in individual businesses weve seen our share of that too dubai was forced last year to divest a company it bought that operates some u s ports a chinese government controlled company was thwarted in its effort to buy unocal whether these investments should have been blocked is a harder question hugo chavezs venezuelan regime owns citgo so far the consequences have been innocuous and the reason is not just luck such investments typically require more trust on the part of the investing government than the receiving one citgos assets are in the u s after all within easy reach of u s law enforcement some deals are rightly worrisome however bp was recently reported to have offered russias gazprom a stake in its trinidad lng facility the source of of americas lng imports vladimir putin has not been averse to using energy as a weapon gazprom deputy chief alexander medvedev spoke openly last year of creating "an alliance of gas suppliers that will be more influential than opec " we might want to think twice before letting such a transaction go through as a rule though governments do a poor job of owning and running businesses directly and their efforts tend to be self liquidating in the long run political goals such as maintaining employment and avoiding acknowledgment of errors seldom are compatible with business efficiency and profits thats why privatization has been a recourse of flailing governments in the past and likely will be again but any non panicky policy response to the sovereign wealth phenomenon must distinguish between this and portfolio type investing the latter is likely here to stay such investing is a nearly inevitable byproduct of the growing size and scope of government financial operations recall it was just a few years ago that alan greenspan worried that the u s was about to become the worlds biggest sovereign wealth fund as its budget deficits were turning to surpluses with nowhere to go after the national debt was paid off but into the stock market only a few percentage points swing in federal revenue could quickly return this problem to the agenda recall too that "pension fund socialism" already prevails in america thanks to the large share of u s business owned by state and local government retirement programs beyond that the great hope of entitlement reformers consists of replacing pay as you go government pension systems with personal accounts that invest in the stock market then in a sense citizens and their governments would be partners in private sector investment had president george w bush succeeded in establishing social security personal accounts three years ago these accounts might already hold &# trillion in stocks the sovereign wealth megatrend has a brighter side when governments are investors across national borders theyd have every reason to become more sensitive to antigrowth and predatory policies that harm business generally in effect youd have a form of massive passive international hostage exchange to help cement a common interest in sound economic policies ditto the conversion of pay as you go pensions into personal accounts invested in global stocks which would help to cure the voting publics appetite for free lunchism protectionism and class warfare politics alignment of interests and incentives after all is one of the hoped for benefits of global interdependence nobody said the adventure would be entirely comfortable however swfs are likely to remain controversial until experience has shown that most of our current fears are overblown or misplaced
