mississippi tort inc the bribery case against tort baron dickie scruggs promises to be the trial of in legal and business circles but whatever the verdict the prosecution is already doing a public service by exposing the incestuous relationship among prosecutors and trial lawyers in mississippi its a pattern that deserves similar scrutiny across the country mr scruggs his son and three other attorneys were indicted last month for conspiring to bribe a state judge in a dispute with another law firm over katrina legal fees one of the men timothy balducci has since pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the feds one intriguing revelation is that as recently as mr balducci was on the payroll of state attorney general jim hood the ag had outsourced one of his famous corporate takedowns of eli lilly to a law firm at which mr balducci was a partner mr balducci now an admitted felon led that litigation this comes on the back of a state farm lawsuit alleging in detail how mr hood colluded with mr scruggs to pressure that insurer into a settlement mr hood is now backpedaling from the tainted attorneys but the magnolia state is a case study in the collusion between the tort bar and state law enforcement officials to shake down corporate targets the tort barons rake in millions of dollars in fees as agents of the state while the ag gets headlines and campaign cash this mississippi tort inc enterprise began in the s when former attorney general mike moore sued tobacco companies and contracted out the lawsuit to his old law school buddy mr scruggs their nicknames were scro and mo mr scruggss firm is estimated to have earned nearly &# billion in fees mr moore became a movie hero "the insider" it is a seductive business model and these days a crew of tort kingpins known as the pascagoula mafia show up in nearly every state lawsuit mr hood made trial lawyer joey langston rich by throwing him the states case against mci worldcom mr hood also hired mr langstons firm where mr balducci was a partner to pursue eli lilly it also happens that mr langston is one of mr hoods major campaign contributors when mr hood sued state farm mr scruggs supplied him with key documents former ag moore now a trial lawyer himself worked both with mr hood on his state insurance litigation and with mr scruggs in private katrina suits mr balducci who left the langston firm to set up his own practice was also working with mr scruggs on katrina litigation and did we mention who is mr scruggss personal criminal attorney mr langston these relationships are now starting to haunt the participants mr hood faced a tough re election this fall after his republican opponent highlighted mr hoods backroom relations with the trial bar state auditor phil bryant this summer sent mr hood a letter demanding his office commence proceedings to recover the &# million paid to mr langston and colleagues in the mci worldcom case saying that under mississippi law the money paid in fees to mr langston rightfully belonged to the state mr hood has also been countersued by state farm in a detailed complaint alleging that he had an ethically conflicted relationship with mr scruggs throughout the katrina litigation mr scruggs gave mr hood documents that had been purloined by two former state farm contractors and mr hood helped mr scruggs keep those documents away from a federal court mr scruggs is also you had already guessed this one of mr hoods major campaign contributors the issue for the public is whether what ought to be the pursuit of justice has become merely one giant political business enterprise public officials are supposed to act on behalf of the public interest but mr hood and his trial lawyer friends are essentially business partners their cases are money making ventures that may or may not also serve the public needless to say mr scruggs was indicted by a federal prosecutor not by mr hoods office though mr hood is the states chief law enforcement officer as for mr scruggss bribery case this isnt the first such case in the state this spring another gulf coast tort king paul minor was sentenced to years in prison for bribing state judges mr minor had paid off loans for the judges one of them by using mr scruggs as an intermediary mr scruggs testified in the minor case claiming he did nothing wrong and he ultimately wasnt prosecuted our larger point is that the bribery case against mr scruggs isnt some shocking bolt from the legal blue it is all too understandable given the habits of the mississippi trial bar and its political patrons
