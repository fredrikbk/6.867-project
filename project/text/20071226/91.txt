vale seeks to expand name recognition strong brand new logo could strengthen hand in global merger mania rio de janeiro do people really care which company dug up the iron ore that was used to make their dental braces trumpets or the ferris wheels they love to ride brazils companhia vale do rio doce thinks so this month the worlds second largest mining company launched a &# million corporate branding campaign that includes the message that its minerals go into lots of everyday items the company also wants to be known by a single name vale whats more vale wants to spread the message that its proud to be brazilian is a global player and a good citizen environmentally the messages are delivered variously through television ads in brazil print ads in major newspapers in europe and the u s and a new corporate logo corporate brands can help motivate employees and sway governments in vales case a strong brand could also help determine who dominates a global business recently seized by merger mania over the past few years the iron mining industrys profile has surged in importance as a ravenous appetite for metals to feed asias building boom has sent prices of commodities soaring thats turned companies like vale into huge profit makers on whose products nations economies rely the high stakes have set off a merger wave vale acquired canadas inco a major nickel supplier this year vales top rival australias bhp billiton ltd recently made an unsolicited offer for the industrys no player united kingdom based rio tinto plc which the smaller company rejected as not rich enough now vale is betting that something as ephemeral as a brand could help it weather the consolidation battles "we are no and dreaming about being no " said roger agnelli vales chief executive when it comes to creating well defined corporate personalities mining has traditionally trailed other industries chemical makers dupont co dow chemical co and basf ag for example all have recognizable brands backed by popular campaigns james bell a partner with lippincott a brand strategy agency in new york hired by vale says one explanation for minings lag may be geographic "because most of the leading chemical and petrochemical companies are either american or european who have operated in more populated and interconnected places they have had to be more sensitive to reputation and broader public opinion " mr bell said "the mining industry on the other hand has tended to be headquartered in australia canada and brazil and operated in the remotest areas of the planet this has meant they have not faced the same level of public interest and scrutiny " vale isnt the only mining company focusing on brand a spokesman for rio tinto said the company plans an announcement about a branding effort vales brand including an abstract black and white logo of s vintage was overdue for a sprucing up the companys market capitalization has jumped to &# billion from &# billion since as it has acquired numerous rivals that left vale operating under a number of names including cvrd and rio doce manganese and hungry for a clear identity that could convey its new size and ambitions mr bell says his companys main task he says was to reposition vale from a "brazilian iron ore company" to a "global brand on the move " that meant shortening the companys name to something pronounceable in any part of the world mr bell developed a green and gold heart shaped logo which fits with vales core theme of extracting value from the ground in an environmentally responsible manner the company also will redo everything from its business cards and uniforms to company canteens in locations from rio to remote outposts in new caledonia some branding specialists give vales new campaign high marks although one questioned whether vales branding effort had a sharp enough focus great company brands "boil it down to a clear idea fedex is about absolute certainty ge is imagination " said allen adamson a managing director of landor associates in new york in vales case "it seems they are trying to stand for everything that is right " cesar hirata a managing partner at interpublic groups futurebrand in sao paulo says it is interesting that vale "had the courage" to adopt brazils national colors in its new campaign other brazilian companies with global businesses such as airplane maker embraer empresa brasileiras de aeronautica typically have chosen not to emphasize their developing nation roots he says for vale which operates in more than countries tying itself more closely to brazil could have its advantages the country is in the midst of an economic boom and has become a favorite of foreign investors its also known for its harmonious race and political relations that could help vale in its negotiations with foreign takeover targets and in smoothing relations with sometimes hostile indigenous groups on whose land its mines are frequently located "being loved is the difference between the competitors " said olinta cardoso the vale executive in charge of the branding effort "in addition to being the biggest we want to be desired "
