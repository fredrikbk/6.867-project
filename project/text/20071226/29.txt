despite woes mcclatchy banks on newspapers family controlled chain faces internet challenge mr pruitt keeps faith sacramento in the beleaguered newspaper industry one chief executive has long stood out as the golden boy gary pruitt he skillfully managed the mcclatchy co chain and last year engineered the &# billion takeover of knight ridder inc one of the largest in the history of the business but since the beginning of mr pruitts company has lost &# billion and seen its stock price plunge exceeding the carnage at most newspaper companies still when members of the board and the controlling family privately discussed mr pruitts future last month they unanimously supported the man who brought mcclatchy to this juncture "we have the best person in place to get us through some of these turbulent times " says kevin mcclatchy a descendant of the companys founder board member larry jinks says the entire board expects mr pruitt "to be the ceo into the future " "i plan on sticking around " says the year old mr pruitt a one time first amendment lawyer who has led mcclatchy for nearly a dozen years "i hope to and expect to " mr pruitt is one of the last true believers in the financial power of the press he says he expects mcclatchy to recover from its slump with the help of a new deal with yahoo inc aimed at driving visitors and ads to his newspapers web sites he plans to sell off some nonnewspaper operations and to continue a cost control strategy that has so far spared reporters jobs a mcclatchy hallmark with mcclatchy now the nations third largest newspaper publisher and one of the last of the large family controlled chains his success or failure at making the transition into the internet age will be a crucial indicator of the future of local print journalism in the u s investors have hammered newspaper stocks all year as readers and advertisers continue migrating to the internet where ads generate far less revenue at mcclatchy which owns daily papers each with its own web site online ad revenue currently represents only of the companys total overall ad revenue is down this year through november sacramento based mcclatchy has been hit especially hard because of its heavy exposure in california and florida two of the nations weakest housing markets the housing slump has depressed consumer spending and hurt advertisers such as home improvement and furniture retailers "these markets may well be in recession already " mr pruitt says all three of mcclatchys florida papers the miami herald el nuevo herald and the bradenton herald were acquired in the knight ridder deal mcclatchy took on &# billion in debt in the deal to afford the purchase it quickly sold a dozen of the papers it acquired as a mark of how far investors have soured on the company mcclatchy which in addition to its dailies has about weeklies has a stock market value just above &# billion about what the new york times paid for a single paper the boston globe years ago until last year mr pruitt who has been known to quote obscure rock music lyrics to wall street analysts was viewed by many as a star in his first decade as ceo mcclatchys share price performance led the industry the year marked the sixth in a row that mcclatchy outpaced industry ad growth when the company announced it was buying knight ridder then the nations second largest newspaper company a businessweek columnist said mr pruitt was "widely considered the best in the business " newspaper analyst john c morton predicted "five years from now this will look like a great deal for mcclatchy " mr pruitts diminished standing and self deprecating demeanor were on display this month when he gave a presentation at a media conference in new york he noted that earlier this year mr morton who still thinks the acquisition will eventually pay off likened mr pruitt to a "green bean cannery" operator for selling the minneapolis star tribune as if it were just another business mr pruitt quipped that the comment had drawn complaints from canners "i could understand why those canners were upset " he said "after all they had a better year than i did " but the board key investors and most importantly the mcclatchy family which controls more than of the voting stock say they are sticking by him "hes extremely organized hes principled hes steady " says mr jinks a former newspaper executive who has served on the mcclatchy board since "if weve got problems he explains the problems we were all part of the decision to make the knight ridder deal so to the extent that there is any second guessing were second guessing ourselves " the mcclatchy family which this year is celebrating the th anniversary of its first newspaper the sacramento bee isnt interested in selling the company kevin mcclatchy says "weve been doing this for years weve withstood challenges and we think were going to get through this " he says mr mcclatchy says his family isnt comparable to the larger bancroft family which divided into factions this year after rupert murdochs news corp offered to buy dow jones &amp co the parent of the wall street journal for over &# billion the bancrofts eventually agreed to sell their controlling interest leaving some family members bitter "i dont believe that if somebody came with an offer that we would be interested in doing what the bancrofts did " says the year old mr mcclatchy who recently sold a controlling stake in the pittsburgh pirates baseball team noting that his family is smaller there are only eight adults with voting shares he says "that probably can make things easier" for unity the bancrofts have about three dozen adult members until the s mcclatchy family members ran the company and were deeply involved in some papers kevin mcclatchys father c k was president from until he died suddenly in today no family members work at the company but the mcclatchys remain committed to "good journalism " says william k coblentz the familys longtime attorney "theyre not interested in the dividends or the sales or anything else " says mr coblentz who has served on the board since and is trustee for numerous family trusts "various overtures have been made over the years" to the mcclatchys from prospective buyers he says "they werent tempted " kevin mcclatchy says the family hasnt ruled out taking the company private "but i dont think its a priority today " the company went public in mr coblentz a san francisco attorney who says he has also represented the hearst and getty families says that after meeting mr pruitt years ago he urged the mcclatchys to hire him as a lawyer mr pruitt who grew up in florida his father managed motels his mother was a librarian had spent two years as a lawyer in miami representing media companies mr coblentz says he believed mr pruitt fit into the mcclatchy family culture "self effacing thoughtful hard working " mr pruitt held various posts including publisher of the fresno bee before being tapped in to run mcclatchy his strategy successful until recently has been to concentrate on fast growing markets in small to midsize metropolitan areas with only one newspaper that is the leading local media property publishers in the chain get wide latitude anders gyllenhaal was managing editor at the news &amp observer in raleigh n c when mcclatchy purchased it from a local family in and he became the top editor "the paper expanded we opened new bureaus we launched suburban operations " he says mr gyllenhaal is now executive editor of the miami herald which mcclatchy acquired in the knight ridder deal although circulation dropped in the latest six month period from a year ago he says there have been no newsroom layoffs or buyouts "mcclatchy is the company that you want to be with in times like these " he says "from the early days theyve looked at newspapers in the right way that of the public service role " the miami herald won a pulitzer prize for local reporting this year for stories about waste and favoritism at miamis housing agency mr pruitt says hes focused on turning the company around by reducing debt expenses and full time employees although not journalists and compensating for print circulation losses by expanding online while its newspapers overall circulation has been declining this year down daily to and down sunday to he expects that to level off to a drop of about a year by the second half of the current decline is more than offset he says by a jump this year in online visitors he says mcclatchys overall audience is growing encompassing of adults in its local markets the company has been increasing its online ad sales force and adding video and more frequent news updates to its newspaper web sites it also holds minority stakes in popular sites including careerbuilder com cars com and apartments com this year mcclatchy joined a consortium of newspaper companies in a deal with yahoo that some analysts believe could bring significantly more traffic and ad revenue to members web sites under the pact newspapers gain access to yahoos targeted advertising technology which serves up specific ads based on a users interests if a reader has been looking at restaurant reviews for example it may show an ad for a restaurant chain this can allow newspapers to raise ad prices they also become part of local and national ad sales networks local users of yahoos web site are shown news headlines with links to participating newspaper sites analysts at deutsche bank recently estimated that the yahoo deal could increase partner newspapers annual online revenue growth by about percentage points and could allow some papers to fully offset print ad declines by a year earlier than expected once that happens "then youve successfully managed the transition" of readers to the internet says paul ginocchio a deutsche bank analyst he said he likes the yahoo deal because the newspaper industry currently is "too wedded" to relying on so called upsells in which classified advertisers in the print edition are offered online ads as well the problem he says is that as print ad revenue declines there are fewer opportunities to make such sales mcclatchy will be phasing in yahoos services in the company says early tests in fort worth texas saw a increase in traffic the first month mr pruitt is also focused on paying off debt now at about &# billion that will be reduced to &# billion by the end of he says thanks in part to an expected &# million tax refund from the sale of the minneapolis star tribune in late thomas russo a partner at gardner russo &amp gardner an investment management company that is a large holder of mcclatchy stock says its now clear mcclatchy overpaid for knight ridder but he says he gives mr pruitt "a good grade" since the deal for reducing head count paying down debt and selling the minneapolis paper "theres still no reason why this investment still cant work " he says the sale of the minneapolis paper took analysts and the star tribunes journalists by surprise mcclatchy purchased the paper in for &# billion its financial performance in the years after the deal burnished mr pruitts reputation as a smart deal maker mcclatchy sold the paper for &# million to avista capital partners a private equity firm "i wouldnt regard it as an indication of panic " says mr pruitt he says the knight ridder deal prompted the company to evaluate all its properties with ad revenue declining the star tribune didnt make the cut knight ridder was put in play after its largest shareholder money manager bruce sherman demanded the company put itself up for sale because of poor share performance mr pruitt took an immediate interest "our feeling was that it wasnt essential for the company to acquire knight ridder but it was a good opportunity for the company to grow " he says he fondly recalls how mcclatchy executives held a "wild celebration" the night they learned they had won the deal singing bruce springsteens raucous song "rosalita " over and over tony ridder knight ridders former chief executive says he welcomed mcclatchys bid but when mcclatchy decided to sell the san jose mercury news in san jose calif where knight ridder had its headquarters mr ridder who joined mcclatchys board tried to talk mr pruitt out of it both men say the paper was purchased by medianews group inc in a &# billion package deal mr pruitt says its still too early to judge the knight ridder acquisition and doesnt regret doing it he concedes that he now wishes he had paid less but adds that had mcclatchy offered a lower price "we wouldnt have gotten the company " the problem he says was timing "we closed the deal just as the downturn ensued so timing in that sense couldnt have been worse " he says still his faith in newspapers remains unshaken "i think the future is bright for newspapers " he says "the newspaper alone is not sufficient but it can be used as a part of a portfolio of print and electronic products that can reach targeted audiences and mass audiences "
