politics &amp economics same party different style romney huckabee present a stark choice for iowa republicans des moines in iowa the republican presidential race has come down to two former governors who offer caucus goers a stark choice its the pulpit vs the boardroom poverty vs privilege passion vs preparedness mike huckabee loves homespun tales and self deprecating jokes mitt romney basks in powerpoint slides and statistics mr huckabee a firefighters son is a southerner born and bred mr romney son of a ceo turned governor roamed from michigan to massachusetts to utah they embody two wings of the republican party social conservatives and economic conservatives that sometimes sit uneasily while john mccain rudy giuliani and fred thompson are competitive in national polls all three are focusing on states after iowa the kickoff jan caucus here is largely between messrs romney and huckabee mr huckabee displays his southern baptist religion proudly dropping biblical references and telling reporters he wouldnt hesitate to put the ten commandments up in the oval office mr romney is uncomfortable discussing his mormon faith he gave a speech devoted to "faith in america" only after his campaign was put on defense in iowa by mr huckabees rise in the speech mr romney mentioned mormonism by name just once the differences are a matter of style too last week in waterloo iowa mr huckabee a former arkansas governor talked about the challenge of overhauling the tax system this way "in the south we say if you cant fix it with duct tape and wd it cant be fixed " a week earlier mr romney showed a powerpoint presentation charting the budget deficit "see how big it gets " he said pointing to a line tracking entitlement spending "this line is the historical average of how much money the federal government takes away from taxpayers " "the warm fuzzies are surrounding huckabee and romney gives the impression of competence " said ted sporer chairman of the polk county iowa republican party "both are very effective " the two men have some things in common both are former governors in states with democratic legislatures both were champions of expanding health care in their states both are running as social conservatives and neither has much foreign policy experience but the differences go deeper mr huckabee a former preacher who graduated from ouachita baptist university in arkadelphia ark uses his life story in reaching out to americans who feel left behind he says his last name never opened doors for him "im a generation away from dirt floors and outdoor toilets " mr huckabee says "i represent a lot of folks like you who understand that the american dream is about knowing that you can start at the bottom but you dont have to stay there " mr romney rarely talks about his roots or wealth his father was chairman of american motors and then governor of michigan the son went on to earn two advanced degrees from harvard make millions as a venture capitalist and become governor of massachusetts instead mr romney focuses on his own family a picture perfect wife and five sons who often campaign for him he regularly touts them as "a family that would make america proud" a tall order even his sons have asked him to soften if mr huckabee is passion mr romney is polish his campaign events attempt to telegraph that he is a man who could be president the rooms awash in a sea of red white and blue the candidate wears some shade of navy blue every day a complement to his tanned skin he is tall and thin his salt and pepper hair gelled perfectly into place after greeting him in davenport iowa last week a woman turned and mused to her friend "hes not bad to look at " mr huckabee best known looks wise for losing pounds has a bald spot and doesnt appear to favor any hair products to detractors mr romney can appear scripted mary alice blake gilson a retired library director said when she saw mr romney speak he never looked directly at the questioners "it seems like he spoke in sound bites " off the cuff humor and light hearted moments are a regular part of mr huckabees routine "my wife is a lifelong democrat " began a questioner at one of his events "well pray for her " mr huckabee replied to laughter mr romney rarely attempts humor and when he does it often falls flat mr huckabee at times can be caught unprepared on big issues when asked about a national intelligence estimate saying iran might have given up its nuclear weapons ambitions mr huckabee hadnt heard about it his staff took the blame for not briefing him mr romney receives extensive briefings every morning at the ames straw poll in august mr romney won handily by busing voters in and paying for their tickets each bus had a captain in charge of filling seats mr huckabee who finished second in ames spent less than &# to mr romneys &# million plus most romney events open and end with music a night after an ice storm shut down most of iowa mr romneys "holiday extravaganza" at the linn mar high school cafeteria in marion drew more than people caterers served from behind an elaborate buffet table with a basket of cookies garnished with american flags every seat had a red supporter card paired with a golf pencil so attendees could state their commitment to mr romney at huckabee events there is no music unless a high school rock band is available in which case the candidate can sit in and play bass guitar volunteers set up the rooms and attendees have to go to a table to get a supporter card in manchester iowa last week the heat at the community center was off until just before the event and the room was still cold as the candidate began speaking as of the end of september mr romney had raised &# million plus &# million he pitched in from his own fortune and had &# million on hand mr huckabee had raised just over &# million with &# left in the bank even as mr huckabees fund raising has picked up he is still being outspent to in television ads in iowa according to independent estimates mr romney is spending &# a day mr huckabee &# mr romney never mentions the mismatch on the stump mr huckabee does so at every stop "my opponent has outspent me to i want you to stop and think about that " he said last week in marshalltown rachel serianz years old of davenport heard mr huckabee speak and says he "is more in touch with people from the middle class and lower class " she added "i like romney though because of his powerful organizational abilities they both appeal "
