prospects fade for pentagon satellite plan when the u s space agency picked boeing co recently to build as much as &# billion of satellites analysts and company officials predicted it would improve boeings chances of winning larger higher profile military satellite contracts in coming months but the survival of the pentagons largest satellite communications program now appears increasingly in doubt that could undermine ambitious growth plans not only for boeings space unit and its subcontractors but also for many of its rivals after years of nagging quality control lapses and satellite manufacturing missteps at boeing its surprise victory over northrop grumman corp for the business of the national aeronautics and space administration belies growing signs of budget pressures confronting the aerospace industry the expected cuts threaten even the militarys premier next generation satellite communications project known as the transformational satellite communications system or tsat the bush administration in february is expected to propose reducing spending on the program to about &# billion through &# billion less than the total boeing and other contractors had anticipated a few weeks ago according to industry officials familiar with the details spending plans had been slowed and stretched out in previous budget cycles and the programs champions are fretting that it may not survive further scale backs the tsat system was designed to use lasers to send data video and other signals among satellites and to the ground at unprecedented speeds including real time signals from unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and ground forces on the move the goal was to increase the militarys satellite capacity thousands of times above current limits by creating a user friendly internet like transmission network available around the world regardless of weather terrain or ground facilities an initial satellite launch was once envisioned in less than a decade with the program carrying an overall price tag of more than &# billion spending was expected to climb to between &# billion and &# billion annually but now even supporters acknowledge that the first launch probably wont occur before and yearly outlays at most will run less than half the levels expected earlier a decision on whether to proceed has been postponed by at least a year most likely until late people familiar with the matter say a thomas young the pentagons top outside space policy adviser said in an interview earlier this month that budget reductions and delays of that magnitude could pave the way for failure and the eventual disintegration of the program without commenting specifically on the bush administrations coming budget proposal mr young said "if we are not careful we may be putting together another troubled satellite program " mr young who led two earlier panels studying space programs for the air force is heading a congressionally mandated review of military and spy satellites for the pentagon in the past he criticized military brass and lawmakers for failing to include adequate budget margins to cope with unexpected technical hurdles if tsat "is deemed not to be affordable " mr young said "the right time to find that out is now " mr youngs comments are the strongest sign yet that the program is losing momentum inside the pentagon and considering its lukewarm support on capitol hill could end up being scrapped the original plan called for a six satellite fleet however many proponents advocate scaling back the effort and building only two satellites to kick off the program boeing which is heading one team competing for the tsat contract declined to comment on the specific budget outlook northrop a major subcontractor to the rival team headed by lockheed martin corp also declined to comment as did lockheed and the air force in a teleconference with reporters earlier this month john peterson the head of boeings tsat team said "were obviously disappointed in what weve heard" about budget prospects nevertheless he said the company is working on contingency plans "to provide our customer a range" of options consistent "with the recent funding decisions " budget pressures caused by the escalating cost of the fighting in afghanistan and iraq are only part of the reason for tsats woes factions inside the pentagon want additional funding for existing less costly satellite designs commercial satellite operators meanwhile argue they can satisfy much of the militarys projected need for satellite capacity still another group of pentagon and industry experts led by marine gen james cartwright vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is championing smaller faster to launch satellites as well as greater use of unmanned aircraft able to supplement satellite communication networks if the first tsat launch is pushed back to or the projects opponents will have extra time to fight for alternatives officials at boeing northrop and lockheed worry that budget and policy turmoil could prompt the air force to request new bids for the contract for the projects first phase the pentagon already has spent &# billion to develop program technologies and mr young said air force managers have spent "a lot of time doing the front end technology work" and establishing "strong and independent assessment and cost estimating" systems given the pentagons earlier litany of satellite manufacturing woes such efforts may not be enough to fully regain the confidence of lawmakers air force brig general ellen pawlikowski said at an industry conference last month that "were still going to continue to stumble" as a result of past mistakes but steps to improve program discipline are under way "so we can be more responsible buyers and partners "
