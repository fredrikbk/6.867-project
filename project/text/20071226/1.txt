a cultural conversation with brian cox youve only arrived when youre dead new york the young woman who delivered brian coxs tea tray to the library of the venerable players club had perhaps never seen the scottish actor channel the unpleasant undesirable or unhinged characters who are his stock in trade likely she missed his titus andronicus at the royal shakespeare company his chilling pre anthony hopkins hannibal lecter in the feature film "manhunter " his duplicitous cia official in the first two "bourne" movies his rogue colonel in "x " his pederast in "l i e " his emmy winning portrayal of hermann goering in the miniseries "nuremberg " and his highly unorthodox shrink in "running with scissors " otherwise she surely would have thought twice before setting down that very large silver pot of stone cold water but mr cox who in person seems to have the disposition of a lamb or perhaps hes just saving up his roars for the broadway stage where hes starring in the role that playwright tom stoppard wrote expressly for him the unregenerate marxist and fulminating cambridge don in "rock n roll" gently pointed out the problem before resuming his tea tutorial for the benefit of a reporter the bag goes in before the water unlike that water mr coxs career is at a rolling boil in addition to the theater gig which features his second wife nicole ansari the actor has top billing in "the water horse " a family movie that opened yesterday hes the star and producer of two official selections "red " a tale of redemption and "the escapist " a thriller at the sundance film festival which begins in mid january and has a slate of movies due out in the next few months his lengthy resume includes guest appearances on the sitcom "frasier" and the hbo series "deadwood " as well as roles in "the rookie " "adaptation " woody allens "match point" and ah yes "super troopers " but in no way does he take any of this as evidence that he has arrived "youve only arrived when youre dead " he says "until then the options are open theres a kind of hunger in me a need to reinvent and take risks " hunger in one form or another is a running theme here to know about mr coxs childhood is to know the depth of his appetite the youngest of five he grew up in dundee scotland his father died when he was nine his mother subsequently had a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized "we really literally had no money and i would go over to the chip shop where i would get a little bit of fish and the scrapings from the batter pan we did live like that for quite a while its meant that i dont take things for granted " the one constant in mr coxs precarious existence was the cinema there were movie palaces in town and he went to them all generally he hit the greens playhouse the broadway and the royal what with double features and the rosters changing every three days "there would be films a week you could go to " he said "i learnt so much from them i learnt about conditions in america on the lower east side the movies were my school " continued mr cox who on two occasions after several repeat viewings of "giant" and "hell on frisco bay" stayed after class "i fell asleep and was locked in until a m my year old sister was going mental trying to find me " and the movies provided direction as much as education "as a boy i was never interested in theater because i came from a working class scottish home " said mr cox "i thought i want to do movies then it was finding the means to do it " but his hunger being large and the film industry in britain being small mr cox knew he had to take his cakes as they were being passed that meant the theater his first job was mopping the stage at the dundee rep "when i walked in the first day there was a drunken fight going on between an actor and the stage manager but there were also people calling each other darling and love there was no class system i just knew this was where i was supposed to be " then as now he bristled with ambition while struggling to resolve an internal conflict he talked standards but wanted success he went on and on about art but craved fame "my favorite line in rock n roll is when my character says work does all the work " said mr cox "i think its a great line and a true line i had this friend who said brian why dont you just be a good actor it was the best advice that anyone ever gave me and as my mother used to tell me when i was a little boy whats fer ya will na go by ya " while mr cox foraged in hollywood in the s it was only in the early s after he played king lear in a royal shakespeare company production that he decided to go full bore for a movie career "lear is the part that really separates the men from the boys but being endlessly rejected eight times a week in the way that lear is rejected is actually wearing on the psyche after a while and after a while i thought why the hell am i doing this to myself id seen the great performances on the stage like oliviers othello and paul scofields uncle vanya i had worked with john gielguld and ralph richardson it was a tradition that i loved and admired and i did my bit i served my time but i was determined to disprove the theory that youre a real actor only if you work on the stage " he seems to have done it "i think hes extraordinary " says joan allen who appeared with mr cox in "the bourne supremacy" and "manhunter " "theres an unpredictability and mystery about him that sets him apart from other performers " recently curious to discover his roots mr cox submitted his dna for examination "its unbroken for years " he claimed "im celt in fact im directly related to the progenitor of the high kings of ireland niall of the nine hostages " dna notwithstanding for years nialls clansman was a take no prisoners kind of guy the classic angry young man who decried the english institutional theater as a feudal system and declared that his egalitarian principles would never permit him to accept a knighthood in fact three years ago he took his first step on that road accepting the designation of commander of the british empire "it was part of growing up " said mr cox while reprising his role as a father he has a five year old and a three year old by ms ansari and two grown children from his first marriage the newly adult mr cox is working to find his niche in hollywood he fretted for a time about his penchant for playing horrific characters then accepted it as part of the job description "as an actor you hold up the mirror to reflect who people are and the fringes of humanity have to be reflected as much as anyone else " he said "equal time " now hes become a pragmatist "im an actor who does really interesting work in independent movies i want to keep doing that " he said "because i dont want the burden of an opening weekend sitting on my shoulders " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
