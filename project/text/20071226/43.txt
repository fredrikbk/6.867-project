iraqi front lines for hollywood morocco will do hard up marrakech streets can pass for war torn royal army as extras marrakech morocco youssef salim had been hearing rumors for weeks that an american movie was about to start filming in his trash strewn neighborhood on the outskirts of this bustling moroccan city but it wasnt until he was walking to work one morning this spring when he saw a wrecked tank burning in the middle of the road surrounded by men in u s military uniforms that mr salim realized his neighborhood was supposed to be war torn baghdad the americans were making yet another movie about iraq and morocco had again been cast as iraq "it was depressing to be honest " says mr salim a mechanic "it meant that my neighborhood was so poor and beaten up that it could pass for the worst city in the world " foreign filmmakers have long flocked to morocco for its stunning natural scenery and ancient walled cities which give it a chameleonlike ability to pass for other countries director martin scorsese shot films set in tibet and ancient jerusalem here director ridley scott is a morocco veteran using various regions of the country as substitutes for modern day somalia "black hawk down" imperial rome "gladiator" and crusades era jerusalem "kingdom of heaven" "casablanca " the most famous film that actually unfolds in morocco was filmed at a burbank calif studio but the war in iraq has given the moroccan film industry a new shot of adrenaline the north african country is rapidly becoming the destination of choice for hollywood production crews looking for cities and deserts that can pass for those of iraq but arent remotely as dangerous mr scott spent months in rabat shooting "body of lies " a big budget thriller starring russell crowe and leonardo dicaprio thats slated for release next year the film shot in mr salims neighborhood "in the valley of elah " paul haggiss follow up to his academy award winning "crash" is now in theaters in the u s and europe while the overall number of hollywood movies filmed in morocco can vary from two to six a year five iraq themed movies have already been filmed here in the past two years and that doesnt include an array of other films set elsewhere in the mideast or afghanistan according to the government the hollywood productions bring in &# million to &# million a year but the wave of iraq movies is forcing ordinary moroccans such as mr salim to navigate a welter of conflicting emotions with the excitement of seeing a list stars like messrs crowe and dicaprio intertwining with deep unease as in other arab countries most moroccans distrust the bush administration and oppose the war in iraq hassan dharaji who lives near mr salim says his young children and their friends ditched school for days to watch the filming of "in the valley of elah " when they returned home bearing autographs lighters and pens mr dharaji says he made the children throw it all away "those movies are making money off of the suffering in iraq and i dont want my family to have anything to do with that " he says unlike most of its neighbors morocco works hard to lure foreign film productions nour eddine sail head of the center for cinematography in morocco an arm of the government that in essence functions as moroccos national film board uses his fingers to tick off the incentives he offers foreign movie crews working on iraq films there are generous tax exemptions carte blanche to close city streets during shoots government help importing explosives for special effects scenes and the ability to use vehicles and soldiers from the royal moroccan army as props or extras a former philosophy professor and film buff who watches an estimated movies a year mr sail defends moroccos frequent starring role in iraq films saying foreign film productions create hundreds of film related jobs "its not a political decision to have films about the iraq war shoot in morocco " he says "its business " the company profiting most directly from the iraq movies is dune films a rapidly growing production firm run by moroccan film industry veteran karim abouobayd dune has worked on several of the recent iraq movies including "stop loss " an upcoming film starring ryan phillippe about an american veteran of the iraq war and mr haggiss "in the valley of elah " most of mr haggiss film which stars tommy lee jones as a father searching for a son who goes missing after returning from iraq takes place in the u s but several pivotal scenes are set in baghdad "we were striving for complete authenticity " says mr haggis noting many iraq war veterans who have seen the movie assumed it had been shot in baghdad earlier this year mr haggis hired dune to find locations in and around marrakech that could pass for baghdad dune quickly identified mr salims neighborhood a poor area of the city littered with crumbling houses and unfinished apartment buildings "thats what baghdad looks like on tv " says dune production manager jimmy abounouom for props dune built full scale models of tanks and other vehicles and brought in damaged military equipment purchased at junkyards around the country another firm supplied humvees equipment that didnt look war ravaged enough was torched or otherwise roughed up to look more authentic several of the american actors with parts in the movie were military veterans who had served in iraq during breaks in the filming the soldiers turned actors said they spent time signing autographs and playing soccer with the neighborhood children who had gathered to watch each days shooting interactions that brought up both positive and negative memories of their time in iraq "it was nostalgic for me because when we were in iraq the kids were always coming up to us and asking us for stuff " says jake mclaughlin who left the military after being hurt in iraq and now works full time as an actor "but that quickly turned to them throwing rocks at us on patrol and i couldnt help but remember that too " mr mclaughlin said that marrakech so closely resembled baghdad that combat scenes left him with strong feelings of deja vu "it was all so close the terrain the architecture the way people dressed that i had some real flashbacks to iraq " he says the made in morocco iraq movie boom may not last much longer as a number of the films have been financial flops "in the valley of elah" has raked in a disappointing &# million to date "home of the brave " starring samuel l jackson took just under &# when it was released in may but mr sail the government official believes moroccos ability to pass for iraq will pay dividends well into the future an amateur film historian he says the best movies about vietnam came out long after the war ended the best books and movies about iraq he believes are probably years away "the deer hunter of iraq is yet to come " he says referring to the academy award winning film "but when it does we hope they shoot it in morocco "
