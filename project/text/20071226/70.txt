putins cold war last saturday gen yury baluyevsky chief of russias general staff issued an ominous warning were the u s to launch a rocket from the missile defense system it plans to deploy in poland to intercept iranian rockets it might accidentally trigger a retaliatory attack by russian nuclear ballistic missiles this was only the most recent of a series of provocative and disturbing messages from moscow in fact at no time since the end of the soviet union in has the direction of russian policy been as troubling as it is today what accounts for this change and where will it lead lets first discard simplistic cliches the most common of them postulates that when the post soviet proto democratic anti communist revolutionary russia of the s was poor it was also meek and peaceable and willing to be a friend of the west now that the accursed "period of weakness" and "chaos" of the s is behind it the same explanation goes russia has "recovered " is "off its knees " and is "back " back that is to spar and bicker with the west because well because this is what a prosperous and strong russia does nonsense a countrys behavior in the world its choice of truculence or accommodation is not decided by accountants who calculate what the country can or cannot afford rather it is determined by the regimes fears and hopes and by the leaders notions of what their countries should strive for as germany and japan recovered from the devastation of world war ii and became many times richer than they were in they grew more not less peaceful they also devoted puny shares of their national income to the military and only after intense debate western europes equally spectacular economic resurgence has not brought back squabbling jingoism and militarism and neither did south koreas after communist aggression and decades of authoritarianism in the past seven years the trajectory of russian foreign policy under vladimir putin mirrored and changed with the domestic ideological and political order it has morphed from the gorbachev yeltsin search for the "path to the common european home" and integration into the world economy to declaring that the end of the soviet union was "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the th century " soon the kremlins paid and unpaid propagandists were extolling "sovereign democracy" a still rather "soft" authoritarianism increasingly with nationalistic and isolationist overtones such exegeses an independent russian analyst noted "would have been labeled as fascist chauvinistic anti democratic or anti western during yeltsins term now such texts have become mainstream " as the kremlins pronouncements grew darker and more fanciful including warnings that foreign evildoers are plotting to break up russia moscows foreign policy too evolved first to a cynical and omnivorous pragmatism and then an assertive and pointedly anti western especially anti american posture the formerly diverse bilateral u s russian agenda energy security nuclear nonproliferation the global war on terrorism the containment of a resurgent authoritarian china russias integration in the global economy has been systematically whittled down by moscow to where it was in the soviet days and where the kremlin now wants it arms control suddenly pulled out of mothballs and imbued with the gravest concern for russias safety are all manner of the cold war detritus some of moscows concerns for instance nato deployments increasingly close to russias borders are legitimate but the alarmist and uncompromising rhetoric and the mode of its delivery shrill public and from the very top of the russian power structure have been utterly disproportionate to the rather trivial and easily resolved military essence of the issues the evolution of moscows iran policy is particularly troubling until about a year ago the moscow tehran quid pro quo was straightforward russia defended iran in the u n s security council while iran refrained from fomenting fundamentalism and terrorism in central asia and the russian north caucasus and spent billions of dollars on russian nuclear energy technology and military hardware including mobile air defense missiles fighter jets and tanks at the request of the u s boris yeltsin suspended arms sales to tehran in then russias strategy changed from money making influence peddling and diplomatic arbitrage to a far riskier brinksmanship in pursuit of a potentially enormous prize the longer moscow resists effective sanctions against an iran that continues to enrich uranium and thus to keep the bomb option open and available at the time of its choosing the greater the likelihood of the situations deteriorating through a series of very probable miscalculations by both the u s and iran toward a full blown crisis with a likely military solution as irans patron moscow would be indispensable to any settlement of such a conflict as was the soviet union when it sponsored egypt in the yom kippur war and through that settlement it would get its prize in one fell swoop russia could fulfill major strategic goals to reoccupy the soviet unions position as a key player in the middle east and the only viable counterbalance to the u s in the region to keep oil prices at todays astronomic levels for as long as possible by feeding the fears of a military strike against iran and see them go as far as &# &# a barrel and likely higher if iran blocks the strait of hormuz and disrupts the flow of oil from the persian gulf and to use the west to prevent the emergence of a nuclear armed iran a few hundred miles from russias borders especially frustrating for the white house is russian foreign policys intimate connection to the kremlins all out effort to ensure a smooth transition of power which dimitry medvedevs appointment to the presidency notwithstanding looks more and more like it will be from a presidency to a kind of putin regency creating a sense of a besieged fortress at a time of domestic political uncertainty or economic downturn to rally the people around the kremlin and more importantly its current occupant is part and parcel of the soviet ideological tradition which this regime seems increasingly to admire so between now and at least next spring russian foreign policy is likely to be almost entirely subservient to the putins regimes authoritarian ambitious and dicey agenda this will likely result in more nasty rhetoric from the kremlin and further damage relations with the west and the u s in particular until the succession crisis is resolved meaning until mr putins effective leadership of the country is renewed and secured no amount of importuning begging or kowtowing or emergency trips by condoleezza rice to moscow and heart to heart chats in kennebunkport are likely to produce an ounce of good let us therefore refrain from the ritual silly hand wringing and accusations on the subject of "losing" russia russia is not and never has been ours to lose back on "the never altered circuit of its fate " to borrow from one of robert gravess finest poems russia under mr putin has been doing a fine job of losing itself on its own resuming the gorbachev yeltsin heroic labor of dismantling this circuit and thus altering russias relations with the west could be mr medvedevs job if he wants it and is allowed to proceed
