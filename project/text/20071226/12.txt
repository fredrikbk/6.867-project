business bookshelf the down to earth architect everything by design by alan lapidus st martins pages &# the popular image of the architect formed by books like ayn rands "the fountainhead" is that of a master builder an artist or even genius battling the philistines to erect structures for the ages like all caricatures this one contains a grain of truth great buildings can leave us awestruck and inclined to view their creators as beings apart but day to day reality is something quite different the architect is usually embedded in a business matrix of one sort or another and his professional life is driven by clients cash flow and practical concerns as much as by lofty aesthetic principles alan lapiduss memoir "everything by design " brings us down to earth mr lapidus a retired architect of hotels and casinos donald trump was one of his clients has never seen himself as a latter day howard roark the hero of rands novel on the contrary he is becomingly modest he freely acknowledges that some of his work has been "bland if not downright ugly " he notes that the most memorable moment of one nightmare project was the day the entire structure nearly collapsed and he confesses that at one point he was forced into bankruptcy when a developer who commissioned a building in flush times abandoned it during the ensuing downturn and reneged on his architects fee mr lapidus takes an unpretentious even mordant view of the field as a whole architecture has been called "the second oldest profession " he writes "but sometimes it bears a close resemblance to its older sister " even so "everything by design" offers a fascinating insiders view of the nuts and bolts of architecture the complicated and often unforgiving process of designing something and getting it built if the authors name sounds vaguely familiar the reason may be the fame of his father morris lapidus best known as the architect of miamis fontainebleau hotel the gaudy flamboyance of that structure and others that morris lapidus designed defied the stripped down glass box modernist orthodoxy of the time he was later hailed or vilified as the godfather of architectural postmodernism but dont think that family connections smoothed the way for his son on the contrary morris lapidus was "an egotistical tyrant" who gave no encouragement to alan and who despite his own considerable success seemed to be jealous of alans career nor was life outside the family especially easy studying architecture at columbia university in the early s mr lapidus writes "my marks fluctuated between a and d depending on how much the professor hated my father " still the father gave his son one invaluable piece of advice "always design for your clients clients " in other words remember that the first job of a building is in a sense to attract a paying public the people your check writing client is actually trying to serve for alan lapidus this dictum meant putting on the glitz to create "participatory theater" that would allow the public to "indulge and fulfill their fantasies" at his hotels and casinos a case in point is his crowne plaza hotel in manhattan its exterior is pink clad with neon its restaurant has a commanding view of times square within hours of opening on dec according to a new york times story that mr lapidus quotes the hotel "had reservations for new years eve without even advertising " mr lapiduss first big commission came when mayor john v lindsay asked him to design a pool and recreation center in the bedford stuyvesant section of brooklyn it would give him a singularly unsentimental education in the byzantine ways of municipal construction the bidding system allowed contractors to line their pockets bizarre building codes "two degree angle bends cannot be used within two feet of each other" complicated the design process and dumbed down the finished product worst of all a law applying to city financed buildings prohibited the use of a general contractor to see that each phase of construction was carried out properly and in the right order to keep the project on time and within the budget the law is still on the books by the way "i observed an interesting little dance " mr lapidus writes "the plumber laid out all his underground pipes the next day the concrete subcontractor poured concrete over it and in the process broke all the pipes when water didnt flow the concrete guy got paid extra to dig up all his concrete the plumber got paid extra to replace the broken pipe and then the concrete guy got paid extra to repour the concrete repeat " mr lapidus soon found his metier in the private sector designing hotels and casinos in florida atlantic city puerto rico and manhattan ever mindful of his clients client he took pains to make his hotels appealing eliminating long corridors depressing and disorienting and placing the windows just below normal height to make guests feel taller and happier one of the books most interesting passages describes the economics of hotel design there is a complex calculus required to ensure that hotels pay for themselves and turn a profit it involves dividing the hotels annual income by the number of days in the year and matching the quotient against the total cost of construction divided by the number of rooms a ratio &# of room income for every &# spent to build the hotel allows the developer to cover his costs with only occupancy the costlier the hotel the wider the ratio the higher the minimum occupancy rate and the harder it is to break even manhattans four seasons hotel designed by i m pei in the s averaged more than &# million per room to construct not surprisingly the owner went bankrupt soon after it opened mr lapiduss wry conclusion "the way for a neophyte to make a small fortune in the hotel business is to start out with a large fortune " mr lapidus is just as illuminating on the subject of casino design he quotes a las vegas insider likening the layout of a casino to a supermarket the slot machines are the "impulse items " ringing the floor to tempt you on your way in and out at the center are the "staples " or table games the casinos raison detre the baccarat pit is the "fancy food section " a dressed up sunken area behind a velvet rope it allows you to "lose major bucks in a very elegant setting " soon his design work on site expanded to include "ever more luxurious spas as well as more and better shopping areas" for the ladies the reason it kept the menfolk at the tables longer "the main concern of the management of every casino ive designed " mr lapidus observes "has been how to occupy the wife or girlfriend and keep her away from her man while hes losing the mortgage money " in the course of his busy building life mr lapidus has met some unusual characters meyer lansky makes an appearance in "everything by design " as does art garfunkel some unnamed cia agents and a curator from the metropolitan museum of art who moonlighted as a call girl donald trump shows up too predictably flamboyant as he bluffs his way from one deal to the next yet mr lapidus has nothing but praise for the donald describing him as "the most honorable developer ive ever worked with " yes mr trump always tries to get the best of a bargain but "he always lives up to his end of any deal he strikes i wish i could say that about every builder ive worked with " sometimes you can beat the house mr gibson is the journals leisure &amp arts features editor
