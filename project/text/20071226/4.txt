at cbs some look beyond the strike and ad woes with television writers on the picket lines cbs corp s stock price has also been on strike the media companys shares have shed a quarter of their market value in a few months and many dont expect much next year thanks to the writers strike that exposes cbss reliance on its tv network and a slowdown in advertising spending some observers say fears are overblown and that warming up to cbs simply requires adjusting expectations the company has returned more than &# billion to shareholders this year and its stock is cheaper than most of its media peers cbs is poised backers say to deliver what it promised when it split from viacom inc dependable financials with healthy cash returns to shareholders both controlled by sumner redstone they split at the start of last year with viacom keeping film businesses and cable networks like mtv while cbs was expected to be the slow growth steady return sibling its shares rose nearly in the first months out of the gate while viacoms performance was less spectacular the stock price was a source of pride at cbs then cbs shares began to drop many say it was inevitable the company would come down to earth "it throws off a nice amount of cash but i just never really saw the growth potential " said alan gould an analyst with natexis bleichroeder next came the fall season ratings for the major broadcast networks largely have declined this fall and viewership for cbs while improved in recent weeks is down about in the age segment coveted by advertisers and that doesnt take into account the effects of the writers strike unlike abc parent walt disney co and other network owners cbs doesnt have basic cable tv channels or a film business to cushion the blow from lost broadcast viewers that means cbs perhaps has the most to lose if an extended writers strike leads to viewers channel surfing to find something new to watch cbs concedes ratings are likely to weaken as popular series like "csi" go into reruns for the foreseeable future though its series tend to hold up well in reruns cbs also plans to air reality series that have proven popular "relative to the competition we think were in good shape " said david poltrack cbss research chief also there are pieces of cbss television business likely to hold up if a strike drags into next year cbs owns the showtime premium tv channel which makes most of its revenue from fees paid by cable operators cbs has said showtime recently capped its best annual financial performance and the network may use showtime series to fill in programming gaps during the writers strike the true star may be the cbs tv syndication business which produces many popular shows outside prime time including "entertainment tonight" and "the oprah winfrey show " the strike also lets cbs save money for costs of filming new shows
