asking for more mr bush signed the &# billion measure during a flight on air force one to his ranch in crawford texas where he will celebrate the coming of the new year the bill funds cabinet departments and federal agencies and foreign aid for the budget year that started oct the president today repeated criticism of congress for including earmarks in the bill that "provide a vehicle for
