caribbean cruises ltd the familys remaining holdings likely are worth more than &# billion tom pritzker chairman of marmon and effective head of the familys main business interests said in an interview that mr buffett was the ideal partner for marmon because of his reputation for being a hands off owner who lets good managers run their businesses "his philosophy is very consistent with our goals " mr pritzker said adding that was particularly important because the family will be partners with mr buffett in marmon for the next six years "this is a marriage not a sale " mr pritzker said the speed with which the transaction came together was vintage buffett in an interview mr buffett said he first heard about the deal less than two weeks ago when the pritzkers arranged to have a goldman sachs group inc banker meet him at the airport in san francisco with a sheaf of information about marmon mr buffett read the material on the flight back to his home in omaha neb and quickly asked to meet marmons top managers they flew out to omaha a few days later "i liked them " mr buffett said "they were my kind of guys i knew id be very comfortable " he said marmons array of industrial operations might not have been right for many buyers but "i dont mind people calling us a conglomerate now well be even more of a conglomerate " he said he plans to keep marmons chief executive frank s ptak in place and hopes to add some "bolt on acquisitions " the pritzkers have owned marmon for more than years based in chicago the company makes everything from plumbing products to electrical cable its biggest unit is union tank car a maker of railroad tank cars that more than a century ago was part of john d rockefellers vertical monopoly in the oil industry it was split off

pritzker family sold a minority stake in hyatt for a total of &# billion to goldman sachs and an investment company controlled by s robson walton an heir to the wal mart fortune the marmon and hyatt deals offer a road map for how the pritzkers are likely to run what remains of their empire after the family breakup is complete the asset sales will give liquidity to family members who want more independence while allowing tom pritzker and perhaps a few others to continue to run the core businesses with high profile outside partners although marmon is privately held it releases some financial information the company reported &# million in operating income in on &# billion in revenue compared with &# million in operating income on revenue of &# billion in not all of marmon will be sold the pritzkers are retaining substantial cash and certain "noncore" assets which they declined to identify mr buffett said the assets being taken out before the deal are "significant " but arent among the main industrial operations the deal price values marmon at &# billion the pritzkers are hoping that improving performance at the conglomerate will yield them a higher price when they cash out the rest of their stake mr buffett said he first met tom pritzkers father jay in and learned some savvy financial and tax moves from the older mr pritzker he said he had followed the family since then but hadnt had any business dealings with the pritzkers the pritzker empire founded in chicago more than a century ago was run for many decades by jay and robert pritzker both grandsons of founder nicholas j pritzker jay was a lawyer and consummate deal maker while robert an engineer spent much of his career overseeing marmon family cohesion began to crumble after jays death in although he and robert had anointed a trio of cousins led by tom pritzker to manage the empire some other family members started agitating for more control and feuding ensued with the empires way split approaching in tom pritzker and the others running the core holdings day to day have been engaged in a balancing act trying to expand the family holdings while raising funds to distribute to their siblings and cousins the participants already have received big sums of cash and any holdings not liquidated by will be divided between the family members two younger family members not involved in the family settlement liesel and matthew pritzker filed suit several years ago accusing their father robert pritzker of looting their trust funds which he denied they settled in walking away with about &# million apiece its unclear whether the long payout in the marmon deal will be popular among some of tom pritzkers relatives who have been seeking direct control of their wealth now billionaires in their own right
