the call "nows the time to put hillary as a person front and center right " over the phone came the chorus from the advisers "right " the debate was over a tactical shift to humanize the candidate and stress her likability began immediately looking close to invincible two months ago sen clinton finds herself in a tightening race for the democratic presidential nomination with eight days to go

their careers in the caucuses mrs clinton faces a strengthening barack obama and a consistently competitive john edwards the three are in a statistical dead heat although mrs clinton retains a strong lead in national polls and her change in message is playing well if she loses iowa she could be hobbled going into new hampshire and other primaries by this month her problems here had stirred speculation about a campaign shake up including a demotion of ms solis doyle yet even as this idea circulated ms solis doyle was gaining influence inside the campaign she is moving beyond executing strategy to helping make it she has overseen new commercials featuring personal stories of "the hillary i know" and an all county blitz through iowa in a "hill a copter " she talks and emails with her boss several times a day with prompts like "smile more " she is making budget decisions including a recent call to double the length of commercials in iowa to seconds sen clinton dismisses speculation

volunteers among her challenges is asserting control over some big egos the campaign has two power centers longtime advisers to former president clinton "the white boys " insiders call them and "hillaryland " a group of people mostly women whove been with her since she was first lady ms solis doyles source of power is the bond she has with the candidate she was the first person mrs clinton

talks to on any issue nobody knows hillary better than patti does " when she got the top post in mrs clintons presidential effort earlier this year some more experienced campaign pros figured ms solis doyle was picked for her devotion or to win points with the hispanic community "there were a lot of doubts whether patti was up to the job " says harold ickes a senior campaign adviser "she has dispelled that in spades " one worry was that her closeness to the candidate could blind her to problems she ought to spot and address after other democrats went on the attack during an october debate ms solis doyle sent out a fund raising appeal saying the candidate was "one strong woman " that led some to accuse her of "playing the gender card " ms solis doyle says her biggest problem isnt running the campaign per se but living apart from her two young children who remain with her husband in washington ten days ago she flew home to try to pack about two weeks worth of christmas

surer after meeting "this lady in long blond hair with a headband " but soon the two were on the campaign trail with a trip to florida "it was barely short of disaster " mrs clinton recalls "neither one of us knew what we were doing " though they had grown up very differently sen clinton in an upper middle class suburb and ms solis doyle in a mainly immigrant city neighborhood both were driven and they found common ground in their strong fathers when the clintons moved into the white house ms solis doyle became scheduling director for the first lady there what her family and friends call her "latina queena" persona emerged playful loud and domineering "i would be tongue tied because patti was so sweet and pretty " recalls jeff forbes who worked as president clintons scheduler but he adds "when it came to protecting hillary if you werent with her you felt the pain and deservedly so " while working in the white house ms solis married jim doyle a corporate lawyer mrs clinton on a trip to chicago met her aides parents and praised mr doyle to them when ms solis doyle had her first baby mrs clinton urged her to bring her crib into the white house often a "baby sleeping" sign would be hanging on her office door ms solis doyle proved her chops as a strategist helping in mrs clintons new york senate campaign in she was credited with helping define mrs clinton more broadly than as a former first lady and making sure she spent a lot of time in critical upstate counties in recent years she ran sen clintons political operation for the presidential run ms solis doyle assembled a campaign team in arlington va that was heavy on longtime clinton advisers who had worked together for years while she sat atop the organization chart mr penn with confidence in his firmly held opinions took the lead in setting the strategy and message ms grunwald who has done the clintons commercials for years became another big player also at the top of the hierarchy was terry mcauliffe campaign chair who is close to the clintons and is a fund raising machine for the first several months the campaign surged on mr penns message of "strength and experience " on robust fund raising though mr obama raised more at the start and on endorsements from establishment figures but in august the campaign faced a fund raising scandal the wall street journal disclosed that big contributor norman hsu who had bundled together nearly &# million in donations brought in some of them from people who seemed unlikely to be able to afford them within days he was exposed as a fugitive from an old grand larceny charge sen clinton gave up all of the donations in october sen clinton gave her rivals an opening to challenge her more forcefully as she stumbled when asked a debate question about the wisdom of giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants ms solis doyle braced for negative reaction to her candidates attempt to explain both sides of the issue in the following days she and mrs clinton discussed the senators immigration reform plan which includes an "earned pass to citizenship " ms solis doyle told mrs clinton that if her father who twice entered the u s illegally before managing to come legally were still alive "he would agree that immigrants should play by the rules and work hard " then on nov when all the candidates showed up in des moines for an important night of dinner speeches sen obama gave a powerful address setting in motion a surge in iowa polls suddenly mrs clinton was on the defensive "were getting the crap beat out of us " ms solis doyle told her team several days later fighting back sen clinton criticized sen obamas health care plan as not "universal " she slammed him for saying his foreign policy experience included having lived in indonesia as a child when her team chided him for having aspired to the white house even as a youth his campaign called it a desperation tactic some iowa voters were turned off ms solis doyle decided to move to iowa for the next two months on nov at her last full weekend at home before the caucuses she prepared dinner for her family while listening to a cd of her late fathers favorite latino music while daughter solis called "lee" and son joey watched a video she played a spirited game of scrabble with her husband who once worked for mr penns polling firm but now runs a policy research firm soon joey crawled into her lap ms solis doyle told her kids "i promise that when this campaign is over im taking a year off to focus on being your mom " back in des moines ms solis doyle switching from stylish suits to jeans snow boots and a suede hat assembled her staff in their windowless headquarters in an office park "we cant give up on excitement and passion " she told them coffee fueled she was running around the office shoeless by days end pepping up workers at the phone banks her cellphone ring tone is the theme from the broadway show "rent " and campaign workers broke out in song when they heard it in recent weeks ms solis doyle ms grunwald and communications chief howard wolfson have been taking the lead in shifting the focus to the candidates "likability" instead of her readiness to be commander in chief its a move that mr penn agrees with though he describes the new strategy as consistent with his message of "having the right combination of strength and experience with compassion " former president clinton too has stepped up his input "hes the best political mind in the world " ms solis doyle says "of course im listening to him " the stakes are high tempers hot ms solis doyle blew up two weeks ago when a campaign official in new hampshire was quoted as questioning sen obamas electability given his acknowledged cocaine use as a young man "i wont put up with this its inappropriate " ms solis doyle said accepting the officials resignation she frowned when mr penn stepped out to talk to the media after the final iowa debate dec and ended up referring to the cocaine issue again the heightened tension has made ms solis doyle much less patient some messages from friends although encouraging her to hang in there make her bristle "stop it " she fired back in one email "i know what im doing and im doing it " ms solis doyle redid her bosss calendar to ensure that sen clinton and her husband too would be in iowa nonstop except for two days last weekend and two days for christmas after the final iowa debate ms solis doyle jumped into an suv in sen clintons motorcade and headed to another campaign event while the senator
