tax report tipster rewards require patience law boosts payouts for irs informants in large tax cases blowing the whistle on big time tax cheats could make some informants wealthy as long as they have hard evidence and plenty of patience just over a year ago president bush signed legislation authorizing the internal revenue service to pay sharply higher rewards to tipsters in cases involving large amounts of money in some cases the reward could be as high as of whatever the irs collects the idea behind the whistleblower law is simple congress hopes the lure of much bigger rewards will prompt more informants to offer better tips and help the irs reduce the nations &# billion tax gap the difference between what the agency collects each year and what it thinks it should be collecting since the law was enacted the irs has received some large tips including one from someone who alleges that one of the worlds biggest companies underpaid its u s taxes by more than &# billion including penalties and interest that claim was filed just a few weeks ago on behalf of the informant by two washington tax lawyers greg lynam and scott knott who have given up their regular jobs at well known law firms in order to pursue major tax whistleblower cases on a full time basis at the ferraro law firm which has offices in washington d c and miami messrs lynam and knott say they already have filed at least five other separate claims with the irs one alleges that "a fortune company" entered into a series of transactions to improperly slash its taxes by more than &# billion including penalties and interest the two lawyers say they are working on an additional half dozen or so cases messrs lynam and knott tell clients not to expect speedy payouts since the irs cant pay a reward until it actually collects and the case is officially over informants generally should expect "somewhere between four and seven years to get paid " says mr knott they wont identify any of their clients or the targets separately bryan c skarlatos a new york lawyer at kostelanetz &amp fink llp says he has filed eight claims on behalf of clients since early february most of those claims involve companies but some involve individuals he says one alleges that a publicly traded company underpaid its taxes by more than &# million over several years he says he is evaluating two other claims to see whether they fit within the irs guidelines and have sufficient documentation "tax cases are based on documents and without the documents you dont have a case " he says so far the irs has received "a little over " reward claims under the new law says stephen whitlock director of the irss whistleblower office about half of those have poured in during just the past months he says while there are "variations" in the quality of the claims mr whitlock says the agency is receiving "some very good claims with good support and very promising leads " he declined to give details but did offer thoughts on what makes a good or bad claim "bad claims are speculative not a lot of evidence " mr whitlock says a weak claim would involve someone who says he or she suspects that something bad happened but doesnt have any documentation a good claim has "documentation of transactions or good solid paper trails " he says if you are considering filing a claim under the new program take a look at the irss recently issued guidance irs notice at the web site irs gov as the notice points out the new program is limited to very large cases under the new procedure the amount of award generally will be at least but not more than of the collected proceeds in cases in which the irs decides the information submitted by the informant "substantially contributed" to collection of tax the agency says but the irs can hand out smaller percentages in certain cases to be eligible for an award under the new program the total amount of taxes penalties interest and additional amounts in dispute must exceed &# million and if the "allegedly noncompliant person" is an individual that persons gross income must exceed &# for any taxable year at issue in a claim according to the irs notice fill out form which also is available on the irs web site any claims must be submitted as a statement under penalty of perjury if you arent eligible to file under the new law you may still be eligible for a reward under an old program where rewards typically cant exceed of the amount recovered the ceiling on rewards has generally been &# million in recent years but the ceiling and percentage may be increased under a special agreement according to irs data fewer than of the nearly claims filed since the late s under the old program have resulted in a reward beware of making "frivolous" arguments the irs says despite repeated warnings over the years from the irs and courts some people continue to espouse such theories as "paying taxes somehow is voluntary " or "only foreign source income is taxable " thats a great way to attract the irss attention the irs recently released an updated report with responses to some of the more common "frivolous" legal arguments by individuals and groups who oppose compliance with federal tax laws the summary www irs gov is called "the truth about frivolous tax arguments " penalties for making these kinds of arguments can be stiff a law raised the frivolity penalty to &# from &# tax court judges sometimes impose penalties of as much as &# "taxpayers should be careful in making frivolous arguments since courts have routinely rejected them " says irs chief counsel donald l korb the irs shoots down a tax strategy more than four years ago this column raised a question that several readers had asked about a possible way to dodge the so called wash sale rule a wash sale typically happens when you sell a stock or some other security at a loss and buy the same thing or something substantially identical within days that means days before or after the sale if you violate the rule you cant deduct the loss instead you add the disallowed loss to the cost of the new securities but suppose you sell a stock at a loss in your regular brokerage account can you immediately repurchase that same stock in your individual retirement account without running afoul of the wash sale rule several years ago some accountants said such a move would violate the rule but others werent sure after considering the subject at length back in a treasury department official declined to comment but in a recent ruling the irs said buying the same security for an ira or a roth ira within the specified period would indeed violate the wash sale rule moreover the agency said you couldnt add the disallowed loss to the cost of the ira "it seems a safe bet to predict that this strategy will no longer be high on the list of those year end strategies that advisers will be dispensing to their clients and prospective clients " says robert willens a tax and accounting analyst at
