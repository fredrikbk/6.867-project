in grains argentina doesnt keep distance as government takes firm control over farming profits drown out the protests buenos aires argentinas independent farm sector famed as religiously laissez faire and for bitter railing against u s and european union subsidies and barriers is no more over the past year the government has consolidated its hold on the sector taking advantage of sky high international commodity prices to raise export taxes on grains while the rising grain values have been a boon to state coffers and flooded the pampas with wealth rising domestic food prices have challenged a government that has made controlling inflation a major element of its economic policy the government now opens and closes the grain export registries like a tap companies must register all grain exports before shipping the goods when the government feels that domestic supply is close to being threatened the nozzle is shut it also limits beef exports to of levels in addition the export tax on soybeans was raised to from domestic grain users such as wheat millers dairies feedlots and poultry producers receive broad subsidies to compensate for price controls with each new

resolve that led to two nationwide farm strikes in decembers protest in response to increased export taxes was a march to a chapel in the small city of lujan about miles west of the capital buenos aires there farmers "prayed for restarting dialogue with the government in search of solutions " the buenos aires and la plata farmers group carbap said in a release farmers complain and then go back to the fields all offenses soothed by the subsidy programs and the seemingly limitless gains in commodity prices the government has made it clear that this is the new reality for argentinas farm sector and that the priority will be on providing cheap food to the nations residents with the former first lady cristina fernandez de kirchner having taken the presidential sash from her husband former president nestor kirchner on dec the sector has resigned itself to the new rules of the game during president fernandez de kirchners inaugural speech she vowed to continue the model implemented

november soybeans the countrys dominant crop were selling at argentine pesos &# a metric ton compared with pesos a ton on the same date a year earlier during the same period wheat prices rose to pesos a ton from pesos even with the increased export taxes which are paid by the farmer in the form of lower market prices profits have soared the increased wealth has made the bitter pill of the

than two million hectares more than five years ago cultivation has spread to the far fringes of the agricultural heartland and pushed north driving cattle even farther out to the marginal subtropical regions of the country the beef market has come under perpetual pressure from the government in argentina where a steak dinner is considered a birthright the average argentine eats kilograms pounds of beef a year the highest consumption rate in the world former president nestor kirchner banned all beef exports last year to prevent soaring domestic and international demand from pushing up beef
