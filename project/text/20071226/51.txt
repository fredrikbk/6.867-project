medicine for an ailing economy the american economy is now threatened by two different but interrelated problems the first is the declining value of housing and the second is the seizing up of the credit markets together they pose the risk of a serious economic downturn some even predict recession policy makers are now understandably reacting in the short term with steps aimed at blunting a spike in mortgage payments and calming credit markets but beyond palliatives we must come to grips with the underlying economic forces at play the more quickly we deal with them the shorter and less severe the eventual economic fallout will be what brought about the current situation the accumulation in recent years of large pools of excess savings around the globe particularly in asia and the middle east drove interest rates down making borrowing cheaper as a result the world went on a borrowing and buying binge with cheap money in hand asset values were bid up especially for housing and at the same time interest rates declined savers began to search for ever higher yields the financial market responded by manufacturing a variety of complex and opaque asset backed financial vehicles many linked to mortgage backed securities these products spread like wildfire throughout the financial system in part because they were given higher credit ratings than they deserved we now know that many of these products were far riskier than they were represented to be as water finds its own level after a flood so now the markets are seeking to bring supply and demand back into balance anything that frustrates those elemental forces will only prolong the pain and accentuate the dislocation for housing the market clearing forces indicate a fall in housing prices and a slowdown in home production we see complementary adjustments in credit markets values for asset backed debt instruments are going down reflecting the declining prices of the collateral behind those instruments risk is being repriced to more realistic levels spreads have widened and credit has become exceedingly tight some of this is called for and overdue however im concerned that the pendulum has swung too far the other way and that today even good credit risks are being frozen out credit markets simply are not working well as evidenced by the widening spread between the london interbank offered rate and the fed funds rate this choking off of credit poses the single biggest threat to the long economic expansion we have enjoyed addressing the problem needs to be a priority for policy makers and the challenge they face is to manage the political pressures to alleviate pain while allowing the necessary market adjustment process to occur let me offer some suggestions first while these adjustments occur good monetary policy is critical to sustaining growth maintaining employment levels and bolstering consumer and investor confidence the fed has responded with a series of measured policy actions but more will still need to be done to avoid a steep downturn despite the most recent inflation reports second good fiscal policy needs to complement good monetary policy in we saw this occur as the u s economy faced strong headwinds rarely in postwar history has a fiscal policy response been as well timed as those tax reductions today when considering possible responses the first priority should be to avoid harm the temptation to try to prop up the economy through dubious spending schemes must be avoided and with the economy today so fragile we must avoid increasing taxes for the foreseeable future by rolling back the tax reductions especially on the very lending and capital formation processes that are still frozen while monetary and fiscal policies are needed to reduce the fallout they dont get at the root causes of the problem third to do that our financial sector the real lifeblood of the economy needs a good dose of "r and r " the first "r" involves a significant restructuring losses must get recognized put on balance sheets and written down as we saw at hsbc total write downs are likely to be a multiple of whats been seen so far purging the bad assets is an essential step to restoring the credit markets we should expect to see weak firms folded into stronger ones history shows us that the sooner this happens the better because anything that prolongs restructuring risks a recurrence of the s&amp l nightmare or the decade of stagnation that still haunts japan for that reason regulators should help move it along however we also need to avoid a wave of overregulation that in the long run could shut people out of the credit markets and make it impossible for the next generation of homeowners to be part of the american dream the second "r" involves recapitalizing bank balance sheets to replace capital loses from restructuring lost capital must be replaced before we will get back to anything close to normal lending patterns the recent capital infusions into morgan stanley citi and ubs are signs of progress in this necessary process policy makers need to support this through prompt approval of restructurings and by keeping america open for investment from abroad fourth the credit situation indicates that we need a more coordinated and less fragmented approach to financial regulation today no one regulator has a comprehensive view of credit market conditions and the stresses in financial markets one strong national regulator with broad oversight of financial markets would put us in a much better position to avoid the kind of financial market turmoil we see today and to respond to stress in the financial system when it arises fifth banks should be required to stay on the hook after making an asset backed loan while securitization has clearly been an important cost saving financial innovation an important source of discipline is lost when a loan originator simply sells off a loan to an unwitting investor without any continuing stake requiring banks to hold on to some portion of these loans would be a good safeguard against improvident lending practices it would also help avoid the duplicitous behavior of publicly marketing an asset based security to customers while privately betting it will fall in value i would even go a step further to suggest that institutions be required to disclose this practice sixth the rating agencies performance in assessing structured financial instruments clearly shows the need for greater oversight to restore a sense of integrity regulators need to examine the many conflicts of interest that exist in the current system with good policies in place predictions of a recession need not become a self fulfilling prophecy by recognizing and adapting to inevitable and necessary market adjustments such an unfortunate outcome can and should be avoided mr snow is chairman of cerberus capital management l p and was u s treasury secretary under president george w bush see related
