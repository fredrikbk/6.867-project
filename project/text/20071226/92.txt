videogames expand a popular new phase of full body playing if you gave or got videogames as gifts yesterday you may have noticed something very different about how some of the hottest ones are played these days the top selling game console at the moment and one of this holiday seasons toughest finds on store shelves is nintendos wii which comes with a motion sensing controller that gamers swing around to play tennis or to dice up opponents with virtual swords guitar hero iii the music game sensation comes with a guitar shaped controller for jamming along to the rolling stones guns n roses and other groups another music hit rock band goes even further with guitar microphone and drum kit controllers what these products have in common is that they reject the conventional wisdom about how people want to play games for years the business focused on dazzling users with ever more sophisticated eye candy paying little heed to the fact that they were shutting out large numbers of potential customers with games that were just too hard to play the conventional game controller that boomerang shaped gadget you hold is a symptom of the complexity with more than a dozen buttons and two joysticks they look like you need a pilots license to operate one the wii guitar hero and rock band have found huge success in part by delivering new experiences with new devices for connecting to and controlling games it would be tough to feel like keith richards while mashing buttons on a typical controller but with a plastic guitar hero ax slung around your shoulder youre there game companies have experimented with unconventional controllers for years but a lot of them were clunkers that didnt sell well like the power glove a device introduced in that let users control nintendo games with simple hand motions its only recently that the commercial success of the wii and other products has helped foster a golden age for game interface development nintendo just released a product in japan called the wii balance board a pressure sensitive device that users stand on to perform yoga aerobics and other exercises as the wii critiques their balance and encourages them to get fit richard marks a senior researcher at sonys games division spends much of his time imagining new ways for consumers to interact with games dr marks created the technology behind the eyetoy a camera that plugged into sonys playstation the eyetoy inserts the moving image of a player into a game letting them do fun stuff like give a karate chop to enemies these days dr markss team at sony has created a demonstration for the playstation that allows players to sketch drawings with standard pen and paper scan them with a camera and then "play" their drawings on screen such technology could help games tap into the same creative energy at play on youtube and other sites with user made content dr marks says "our game industry is really good at making authored experiences but theres a new area that hasnt been explored where people want to make their own content " he adds one of dr markss dreams is to be able to use a camera for live motion capture in peoples living rooms for example hed like to see his son suited up as spider man on screen shooting webs from his hands by performing the same hand gesture as his hero it may be some years before game consoles are up to such computing challenges but part of the technology required for such feats so called d cameras is getting ready to hit the market at consumer friendly prices next year an israeli camera maker dv inc plans to introduce a d camera for less than &# its a more sophisticated version of the motion detection done today by the wii which gives users a wand shaped controller to hold as they play games in the boxing game that comes with the wii the console does a so so job of measuring when players use their fists to punch opponents a boxing game using dvs camera focused on the players from atop a tv set allows users to hit an opponent with far greater accuracy and to duck a punch zvika klier ceo of dv says the camera also will be useful for controlling avatars in online games in most online games today for example you make a character dance by hitting a button on a keyboard or controller with a d camera players could simply dance in their living rooms to make their avatars dance even movement itself may one day be optional san francisco start up emotiv systems has come up with a method of measuring the electrical activity of the brain through a helmet like device so users can control action in games by just thinking "up " "down" and other simple actions emotiv says this system wont replace the precision and responsiveness of traditional controllers but it could be a great way to augment the experience of say fantasy games where mind control is part of the picture so players of a star wars game may some day be able to "lift" an object by telekinesis instead of hitting a button on a controller the force
