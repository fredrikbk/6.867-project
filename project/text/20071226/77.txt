taxing e shoppers just in time for the holidays congress is reviving a plan to increase tax collections on internet consumers congressman william delahunts d mass bill subject of a recent house judiciary hearing would give new powers to americas tax collectors right now online stores that dont have a building in your state dont have to collect state and local taxes on your purchases thats because of a supreme court decision called quill the supremes ruled that forcing such obligations on companies with no physical presence in a state could cripple interstate commerce they also ruled that congress can have the last word on this question under the constitutions commerce clause mr delahunts bill would make mandatory the inappropriately named "streamlined sales and use tax agreement " forcing all but the tiniest businesses to answer to every one of americas taxing jurisdictions if making a small web operator calculate collect and remit taxes to every locality where he has a customer doesnt sound like "streamlining " wait theres more each merchant would also have to submit to audits from governments coast to coast and while "only" state and local governments currently collect sales taxes in the u s more than other governments can choose to collect them in the future and theres no limit on the creation of new taxing entities did we mention that the "streamlined" plan allows every jurisdiction to create two separate tax rates depending on the good or service sold anticipating growth in government and complexity the plan limits the tax collectors to two rates per zip code multiply that by americas zip codes and small merchants could potentially have to keep track of different tax rates depending on what they sell and to whom but what about nine digit zip codes could governments create different rates within each one yes indeed believe it or not it gets worse the board of state and local tax collectors that administers the "streamlined" plan recently amended the agreement now the plan would allow some states to choose whether to tax online purchases at the sellers address or the buyers depending on whether theyre in the same state the end result will be different tax rates for in state and out of state vendors a clear constitutional violation this change is reason enough for mr delahunt to withdraw his bill but there are others most states the intended beneficiaries of this new tax bureaucracy have not endorsed the agreement money hungry revenue departments have largely failed to convince their home legislatures to sign off so theyve gone to congress to whine about revenue "lost" to e commerce transactions we like presidential candidate fred thompsons view of similar claims by federal bureaucrats "it aint lost its in my pocket " the fact is that our various levels of government have been doing just fine in the era of electronic commerce state and local tax collectors have enjoyed consecutive quarters of increasing revenues a tax foundation analysis shows that even after adjusting for inflation state and local tax revenues have increased almost since when quill was decided throw in the generous federal to state transfers and the states and locals are now collecting almost &# trillion annually for consumers on the other hand sluggish retail sales demonstrate that congresss timing could not be worse see related letters "letters to the editor e commerce cultivating the golden goose without killing it" wsj jan
