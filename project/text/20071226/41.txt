invacare bounces back by moving production invacare corp is rebounding rapidly from a body blow dealt by cheaper competitors in asia by moving production overseas the producer of wheelchairs respiratory equipment and other home health care products is making great progress in cost reduction this year and expects further gains in said a malachi mixon iii chairman and chief executive in an interview a lot of the savings are achieved by purchasing and manufacturing more products and parts in china he said "two torpedoes hit us in and and the effects kept getting worse for several years " he said "now were coming back " the first of those blows came from competitors who began offering chinese made wheelchairs walkers and many other patient aids at prices below what invacare needed to fetch for its u s made products mr mixon said the second hit came from the u s government he said "which made precipitous changes in reimbursements" for a whole range of home health care products invacare sells its products mainly to independent dealers who are reimbursed by medicare and other government programs for many of the items they buy from invacare mr mixon decided the only answer was to begin buying and manufacturing in asia he made that decision very reluctantly he said knowing it would cost u s jobs only a few years earlier he had built a modern manufacturing plant in elyria ohio once he made the decision though mr mixon moved aggressively first he opened a buying office in hong kong to buy products from asian manufacturers next he opened two factories in china "this year we will do around &# million of purchasing and manufacturing in asia " mr mixon said about of the global cost of products sold "within three years roughly of global costs will be coming out of asia " those moves launched a major restructuring turning invacare into a designer assembler and distributor of home health care products instead of an integrated manufacturer that made most products entirely in house temporarily at least mr mixon had to stop thinking like the head of a growth company he said "and concentrate all managements energy and ideas on cost reduction" instead of growth "well be a growth company again " he said but probably not for another year at least meanwhile he has achieved one important goal "no one has a cost advantage over us " he said "we didnt cut product development spending " he said "and the quality of product from china is every bit as good as anything we can get in the u s " which ensures invacare products will remain technologically competitive another plus prices for home health care products "generally are stabilizing " mr mixon said noting that "will be the first year in four years in which the industry hasnt suffered cuts" in government reimbursements nonetheless prices are lower in than in because of previously ordered reimbursement cuts and intense competition u s employment currently is about the company said down from a high of about in despite several acquisitions that added to the u s work force world wide employment is about looking ahead respiratory products are likely to provide the companys fastest growth mr mixon said for several years invacare has been selling equipment that allows people with respiratory problems to fill oxygen cylinders at home instead of relying on a dealer to replenish the supply of oxygen tanks now the company is introducing a small battery powered oxygen concentrator that the user can carry with a shoulder strap much as one would a laptop computer it weighs six pounds and provides enough oxygen to meet patient needs at virtually all activity levels mr mixon said providing new mobility for people with lung disease and other respiratory problems about million americans use oxygen mr mixon said of whom are ambulatory indicating a sizable market for the new equipment invacare reduced costs for by &# million said gregory c thompson senior vice president and chief financial officer and the company currently is saving at an annual rate of &# million as a result the company expects to earn cents to &# a share from normal operations this year mr thompson said and generate &# million to &# million of free cash flow almost all in the second half after restructuring charges and expenses related to a total refinancing of the company this past february partly offset by a german tax credit net income for probably will be less than cents a share he said next year will be better messrs mixon and thompson said with higher operating profit and lower charges they declined to make a specific projection in invacare had a net loss of &# a share reflecting restructuring and other charges and a large write down of goodwill sales for will rise to about &# billion mr thompson said from &# billion last year while the restructuring is under way invacares european operations are providing most of the companys profits mr mixon said european businesses produce about of revenue some invacare products such as walkers canes and bathing equipment now are purchased in china vietnam and other asian countries mr mixon said other items including some oxygen supply units are made in the new invacare factories in china patient beds because they are costly to transport still are made by invacares florida factory standard wheelchairs are made in mexico or purchased in china invacares most complex products including customized wheelchairs are assembled in elyria at the invacare plant but many of the expensive parts are purchased or produced abroad "we can produce a customized wheelchair here in four or five days " mr mixon said while it would take weeks to deliver a customized chair from chinese plants but using asian parts cuts the cost significantly without compromising quality he said in both north american and european plants will be using chinese made electronic controls for power wheelchairs he said invacare has been making controls in new zealand but a rise in that nations currency and lower production costs at invacares plant in suzhou china dictated a change he said
