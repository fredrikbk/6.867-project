politics &amp economics korean equality starts early tense school lottery reflects bid to hurdle feudal past seoul south korea kim jae hee walked into the chilly gymnasium of younghoon elementary school and sized up the competition the parents of six and seven year old boys were there some from south koreas wealthiest families waiting for a shot at getting their child into the prestigious private school renowned for an english language program not seen in public schools through the morning parents walked one by one to the front of the gym pulled a foil covered wooden ball from a purple and green box and unwrapped it if the ball was blue their sons got in about one of every eight balls was blue admission to private elementary schools in south korea has nothing to do with money or academic ability under government order the nations private schools hold lotteries at the same time on the same day each december boys in the morning girls in the afternoon to fill first grade seats for the start of the school year the following march "its totally up to luck " ms kim said "that creates stress " the process is a collision of the south korean passion for education and the desire in this mostly homogenous society for social and economic equality the equality drive is partly a modern day backlash against the class system that governed the korean peninsula for centuries until it was colonized by japan in the early th century an often cited korean aphorism runs "if my cousin buys land i get a stomach ache " the government ordered private schools to admit students by lottery in and it levels out entry requirements at south koreas universities by making them consider not just test scores but grades activities and where students are from at south korean companies many employers pay workers based on seniority rather than merit to avoid controversies over fairness even the leading candidates in this months presidential election faced restrictions campaign posters were equally sized and couldnt stand alone posters for all candidates were taped up together on street corners and on the sides of highways "equal opportunity gives everyone a very good feeling " said lew seok choon a sociology professor at yonsei university in seoul "at the same time people want their life to be a success which means you need competition this is a universal conflict " for the administrators of private schools the restrictions on admissions and tuition make it harder to make their institutions stand out fees are about &# to &# a year and schools can only raise them with the approval of their parents association jung jin hae president of the south korea association of private schools said the group has urged the government for years to let private schools set tuition and pick their own students which he said would lead to greater diversity among schools "in a forest there are tall and short and thick and thin trees " said mr jung who is also the principal at a private school in seoul "at the moment theyre trying to make a forest with just the same kind of trees " for the parents the stakes are high getting in a private school typically exposes a child to specialized classes such as in a foreign language or art younghoons goal administrators said is to produce students who after leaving sixth grade could perform as easily in the middle school of an english speaking country as in a south korean one most private school students enter the public system at grade seven there are few private schools at that level and students must pass an exam to attend a high school where more classes are taught in english those "foreign language schools" send the most students to south koreas prestigious universities ms kim and her husband said they applied to enroll their son ji hoon in younghoon elementary despite the prospect of a minute commute "we want ji hoon to become a global talent not just a successful one in korea " ms kim said shim mi jung who came to younghoon later for the afternoon lottery for girls said she and her husband are so eager for daughter jung won to become bilingual that they are considering taking her abroad for a year or two if they dont win a spot in younghoon as younghoons popularity rose the desire for fairness had another effect zealous scrutiny by parents on the way it conducts its lottery for more than years the school had a teacher pick numbers out of a box in the school modernized the system and used a computer to randomly choose numbers but parents complained the software could have been rigged so younghoon created a system in which the parents pick the ball essentially putting the childrens fate in their parents hands parents complained saying the box wasnt big enough to adequately mix up the balls "sometimes the things the parents come up with just make our mouths drop " vice principal sim ok ryung said in a welcome speech on lottery day ms sim took pains to explain that the balls are all covered with equally sized foil squares parents arrived at the school with their children a step designed to assure that a family can only take part in the lottery of one school the first five parents selected plain wooden balls "thats when i started to get really nervous " ms kim said afterward a successful parent tried to pass the "winning vibe" by shaking hands with those who followed ms kim was the th parent to walk up to the box of the slots were already filled when she reached in as two teachers watched closely she unwrapped a plain ball she paused briefly then walked on as a teacher announced "apologies number " outside the school a short time later ms kim said "i can relax now but its extremely disappointing because i had my hopes up " in the lottery for girls ms shim mixed the box a little then pulled out a plain ball she chided herself for not mixing up the box some more "it almost felt like a test " she said both mothers said they will enroll their children in public school and in after school academies cram programs that supplement public school educations and are seen as necessary in guiding a child to a top university despite their disappointment they also said they believe in the process "i think the lottery system is fair " ms kim said "honestly its too early to test or set criteria for children who are only seven " eun young sa and sungha park contributed
