dojs free pass for tort fraud the defects of the u s department of justice have been the subject of much commentary but the allegations of incompetence or worse pale when compared to the free pass it has given to doctors and lawyers to commit mass tort fraud exceeding &# billion in the past years over one million potential litigants have been screened by agents for tort lawyers in asbestos silica silicone breast implant and diet drug fen phen litigation the lawyers sponsoring these screenings have paid over &# million for medical reports to support the or more claims generated by these screenings there is compelling evidence much of it reviewed in my published writings that the vast majority of these medical reports including chest x ray readings echocardiograms pulmonary function tests and diagnoses are bogus u s district court judge janis jack appointed by president bill clinton blew the whistle on this type of fraud two years ago it was she stated "clear that lawyers doctors and screening companies were all willing participants in a scheme to manufacture diagnoses for money " for a while it appeared that judge jacks extensively documented findings would spur law enforcement to curb mass tort fraud indeed the u s attorneys office for the southern district of new york which launched an investigation of fraudulent asbestos claims more than three years ago was invigorated by judge jacks findings to empanel a grand jury but it now appears as if neither this u s attorneys office nor the parent department of justice is going to prosecute mass tort fraud six months ago there were signs that justice was moving forward on some key cases involving one or more of the litigation doctors now unfortunately that activity appears to have all but ceased the dimensions of this fraud are stunning an asbestos screening of potential litigants generates about diagnoses of asbestosis if these same occupationally exposed workers were examined in clinical settings approximately would be diagnosed with asbestosis the total take for "excess" asbestos diagnoses is more than &# billion of which &# billion has gone to the lawyers more billions for bogus claims in the diet drug fen phen and silicone breast implant litigations can be added to this bill a comparative handful of doctors and technicians are responsible for the vast majority of bogus medical tests and diagnoses to indict and prosecute those responsible would require testimony from other doctors that the mass produced diagnoses cannot have been rendered in good faith to be sure doctors can differ in reading x rays or making a diagnosis but when a doctor has been paid millions of dollars to produce or even diagnoses in the course of mass tort screenings and when panels of experts have found the vast majority of these to be in error the most compelling conclusion is that the diagnoses were "manufactured for money " prosecutors on the federal and state level are nonetheless concerned that such a "battle of the experts" will raise reasonable doubt in the minds of juries and so they decline to prosecute these doctors let alone the lawyers who hired them this decision however gives the doctors a special dispensation to commit fraud asbestos litigation screenings ceased about four years ago when it appeared that the congress would create an administrative resolution of asbestos claims and judge jacks findings attracted prosecutorial interest but now that it has become clear that this department of justice has retired from the mass tort fray temptations are proving too powerful to resist a few weeks ago a full scale asbestos litigation screening was held in bartlesville okla lawyers may be dipping their toes in the water to see if prosecutors will respond if so they will find that the tepid response of this justice department is just what their doctors ordered we can then expect a resumption of the generation of bogus claims on a mass scale this would indeed be a shameful reflection on this or any department of justice mr brickman is a professor of law at the cardozo school of law of yeshiva university see related letter "letters to the editor a tort review board could eliminate fraud" wsj jan
