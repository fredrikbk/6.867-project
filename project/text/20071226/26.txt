ex residents are gone but theyre not forgotten south dakota isnt for everyone so when the state crafted a program to attract new workers it targeted people already familiar with its freezing winters and open spaces the thousands of south dakotans who leave every year the result is "dakota roots " a year old job placement service that matches expatriate south dakotans with companies that need workers across the country in an effort to repopulate declining work forces several states are going after former residents last fall north dakota launched a program called "experience nd" with an event in st paul minn vermont has "pursuevt " former iowa gov tom vilsack organized and attended receptions around the country for iowa college grads who moved away the reach of these programs is limited but states and companies that participate say they are worth the modest investment and are often cheaper than hiring a headhunter states figure it is a lot easier to persuade former residents to come home than it is to get strangers to move to a place they have never been to iowa officials say efforts to lure former residents have brought about of them back to the state states are always hungry for new people but the idea of trying to lure ex residents is fairly new most economic development efforts focus on attracting new employers often with a combination of tax breaks cheap real estate and cash yet relocation consultants say that for companies thinking about moving to a state one of the biggest concerns is having an adequate well trained work force "getting people to move back to an area will become a very important economic development tool " says dennis j donovan a principal at wadley donovan gutshaw consulting a corporate location consultant in bridgewater n j many of these programs use college alumni lists to reach out to former residents the internet and social networking sites like facebook have made tracking down grads easier in addition expatriates tend not to stray far from their states of origin and are inclined to cluster together people who leave the great plains states often go to minneapolis the canadian province of saskatchewan which also has a "come home" program has found that many of its college grads flee to neighboring alberta vermont as part of its new pursuevt initiative hired a research firm to find where its grads went and why they went there the research showed a large number live in the boston area and that many left for work reasons rather than because they wanted an urban environment in september the states department of economic development hosted an event that paired technology companies with about graduates of vermont colleges who had left the state more than invitations were sent out the gathering at a popular bar near bostons waterfront featured a jazz band and free hors doeuvres like seared tuna chicken satay and a table of vermont cheeses several attendees have expressed interest in working in vermont and the state says it plans to do similar events every three months "were not reaching out to the unidentified cold prospect " says mike quinn vermonts economic development commissioner the cost of these programs isnt large especially when compared with the millions in tax breaks and grants that are given to attract companies also though the programs are aimed at former residents they are open to anyone looking for a job in the state vermonts department of economic development says the recent event in boston cost about &# including consulting and marketing costs the budget for the year is
