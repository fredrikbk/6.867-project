what to do about endless campaigns while mr rove made many excellent points in his piece "the endless campaign " op ed dec on our presidential selection process his conclusion that we should spread it out more is wrong in when it was as he recommends by the time the process arrived in california the most populous state my wifes choice bill bradley and mine john mccain had been forced out because the pundits had selected al gore and george w bush that sucked all of the air and money out of everyone elses campaign either have one day where everyone gets to vote or caucus or revert to the way it was done in the more distant past and let the professionals choose their partys candidate they are the pros and with past performance as an indicator better at picking viable candidates than the "true believers" who tend to be the only ones voting in our current selection processes my wifes democrat choice is the former and mine republican is the latter in either case the selection should be made no more than a month before the national conventions which should be no more than a month before the general election and the candidates should not be allowed to declare much less campaign more than a month before that this is how they do it in england and a number of other countries it works because their politicians are occupied with what they are being paid for running the country and not occupied with what our system forces them to do raising money and running for office chris daly yucaipa calif while i am not a fan of karl rove his opinion expressed in his op ed is spot on he is exactly right in that a few states that are early in the primary caucus process have an inordinately high impact on selecting a nominee while the states that vote on feb may likely as not follow the bandwagon this is not exactly the representative process that should be the goal of this country while mr roves efforts during his work in the bush administration certainly do not suggest any bipartisan work whatsoever in his past his suggestion to work across party lines to make a more manageable fair and representative process that leads to the best candidate becoming our leader is a worthy suggestion richard shannon minneapolis mr roves critique of the presidential campaign process suggests a more sinister phenomenon afflicting our electoral process by packing primaries together we have unwittingly increased the risk of an extreme unpredictable media event determining the outcome of our choices of candidates this promotes the famous "butterfly effect" whereby one slip up or misinterpreted gaffe can create an information cascade that will overwhelm other factors in choosing a candidate remember howard dean information cascades introduce an unpredictable randomness to the selection process with the same non linear dynamics that create blockbuster movies books and asset market bubbles and crashes this hardly seems a desirable risk in picking the leader of the free world and the parties should be as horrified of the prospect as the voters michael harrington los angeles two plus years is insane why not take it to the ultimate conclusion and have a national primary on one day sometime in the late spring before the conventions then the candidates would spread themselves among the states where they think they can do themselves the most good and its all over in a much shorter time the conventions acknowledge their leader pick a vice president a platform and move on to the general election henry reeves rehoboth beach del
