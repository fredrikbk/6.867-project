me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q my tire dealer recommended i go down one speed rating from v to h on tires for my honda accord four cylinder automatic citing lower price and longer wear did i make the right decision brad ohlmuller red bank n j a as long as you arent pursuing land speed records youll be safe riding on h rated tires the h rating means they are designed to withstand sustained speeds of as much as miles per hour the v typically boosts that speed limit to mph even s rated tires travel safely at mph auto makers often equip cars with tires that can withstand higher speeds than the car will travel because the rating indicates how well a tire can handle the heat generated at those speeds while few drivers ever travel at triple digit speeds other conditions encountered in everyday driving like underinflation and poor alignment also cause damaging heat buildup so having a tire with a speed rating that seems like overkill isnt a bad idea there is more information on speed ratings at http www goodyeartires com kyt readingatire speedindex html q my mechanic recommended a fuel injector wash to improve performance by cleaning clogged injectors in older cars is this a worthwhile expense at &# per use elliot levy croton on hudson n y a the detergent additives in gasoline are typically enough to keep fuel injection systems clean the type of injector wash service you mention sounds like the washes flushes and purges that service centers use to nickel and dime customers i think you would be better off spending the &# on a special dinner for two q we are looking to replace our oldsmobile intrigue and the models im looking at include volvos and subaru outback hyundai sonata acura tl and toyota camry can you help narrow the field geoff cummings gilbert ariz a although the intrigue was a very nice though underrated car when new any of the vehicles on your list will probably make it seem slow and outdated the most natural way to narrow the field would be to separate the economy models the toyota hyundai and subaru from the more upscale volvo and acura the volvos and the acura are the most luxurious of the group the acura will probably be closer to trouble free than the volvo which is more stylish and has an especially solid feel on the road id put these two at the top of the test drive list
