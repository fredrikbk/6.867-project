credit downturn hits the malls centro properties woes underscore the state of commercial market the credit crunch triggered by the downturn in the housing market is creating problems in commercial real estate driving down prices of office buildings shopping malls and apartment complexes and leaving some owners scrambling for cash one victim is centro properties group the fifth largest owner of shopping centers in the u s the australian real estate company saw its share price fall by in two days last week as it struggled to refinance short term debt it took on to fund its &# billion acquisition of new plan excel one of the biggest owners of strip malls in the u s centro had planned to pay off the short term loans by selling long term debt via the commercial mortgage backed securities market but the lack of buyers forced it to get a two month extension from its creditors commercial mortgage backed securities or cmbs are pools of loans that are sliced up and sold to investors as bonds residential mortgages are packaged and resold much the same way but so far the cmbs market hasnt had any significant problem with defaults in another high profile case the clock is ticking for harry macklowe the new york developer who is struggling to raise financing by february to replace &# billion in short term money he borrowed to finance his heavily leveraged acquisition of seven manhattan office buildings this year the predicament facing centro mr macklowe and numerous others underscores the state of the once unflappable commercial real estate market for the past few months the sector has been in a state of near paralysis as financing has nearly dried up the number of major properties sold is down by half and many worry that the market will continue to deteriorate as property sales remain slow prices continue to drop and deals keep falling apart "where were really in a fog is on the capital markets side " said michael giliberto a managing director of j p morgan chase &amp co on a conference call last week about the state of the commercial real estate market the cmbs market was the engine that drove the commercial real estate boom over the past few years the issuance of cmbs allowed banks to get rid of the risk on their books lend with cheaper rates and looser terms and that made it easy for private equity firms to do huge real estate deals between and cmbs issuance rose to an estimated &# billion from &# billion according to commercial mortgage alert a trade publication that compiles its own statistics real estate investors arent the only ones feeling the pain many big banks issued short term loans to buyers and planned to sell them off later much the way they do with loans made to private equity buyout shops but the banks have gotten stuck with an estimated &# billion in fixed and floating rate loans on their books according to j p morgan some of the largest issuers have been lehman brothers holdings inc credit suisse group and wachovia corp lehman has said that about half of the &# billion in mortgage debt it was holding at year end is cmbs related wachovia and credit suisse declined to comment prices however havent appeared to fall though much like residential real estate there is often a period where buyers stop buying but sellers refuse to lower prices there is "cognitive dissonance" between buyers and sellers says dennis russo a real estate attorney for herrick feinstein "theres a period of time in which the seller cannot psychologically move his price down they havent accepted whats happening in the market " according to real capital analytics sales of significant office properties plummeted to &# billion in november a drop compared with november so few deals are getting done that many market experts say they dont know how to put a value on many buildings right now but almost everyone is in agreement that the valuations are dropping often deals arent done because financing either isnt available or is so expensive that buyers are insisting on price reductions that sellers wont accept for example ackerman &amp co a brokerage just pulled a suburban atlanta office building off the market after bids came in below estimates developer michael reschke has so far been unable to get financing for a j w marriott planned down the street from the chicago board of trade despite his willingness to put more cash into the deal than originally planned the commercial real estate market was still soaring in early long past the peak of the residential real estate market but a combination of frenzied deal making high prices and credit worries combined to sink the sector first private equity firm blackstone group lp made its record breaking &# billion purchase of sam zells equity office property trust the nations biggest owner of office buildings then it turned around and sold off many of the properties at even higher prices the frenzied deal making surrounding the eop portfolio came to symbolize frothy valuations which triggered a backlash in the lending markets in april moodys investors service said lenders underwriting standards had become too lax during the run up in prices the warning scared investors and prompted bankers to raise interest rates and required borrowers to put in more of their own money into deals the subprime mortgage downturn hit last summer prompting fears that the problems plaguing the residential market would spillover to the commercial side banks were caught holding debt on their books making them less willing to lend centro property got caught in the crunch its billion dollar acquisition of new plan excel a u s shopping center real estate investment trust came in february a moment many experts believe was the height of the commercial market now its lenders primarily australian banks are pressuring centro to sell assets before they will consider refinancing "certainly the private equity players played that game for a time and they could have been caught in a similar situation but they were very quick to turn around and sell their assets " said paul adornato a real estate analyst with bmo capital markets corp centros chief executive andrew scott didnt return calls for comment credit was so plentiful when mr macklowe purchased his manhattan office buildings from blackstone he only needed to put in &# million of equity to secure &# billion in debt which included a bridge loan and the senior mortgage people familiar with the deal say he is now looking for an equity partner people said a spokesman for mr macklowe declined to comment
