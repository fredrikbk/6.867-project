loyalty points that buy a night with travolta as guests build big balances hotels expand their rewards way beyond free lodgings for starwood hotels &amp resorts points michael and georgia soares might have spent six nights in paris at starwoods hotel prince de galles on the champs elysees instead the southern california couple used their hotel points to spend one night with john travolta and the cast of the movie "hairspray" at the films new york premiere "we walked the red carpet and everything it was cool " says mr soares a year old father of four who owns a restaurant in orange county with his wife the soares also attended the movies after party where they chatted with mr travolta and snapped a few photos with a growing number of customers like mr soares who have accumulated mountains of points hotels are finding they need to do more than give away hotel rooms major hotel companies such as starwood global hyatt corp hilton hotels corp and intercontinental hotels group now offer customers enrolled in their loyalty programs the option to spend their points on an a wide array of unique experiences from weightless space flight to cooking lessons from star chefs the hotel companies say that only a small percentage of their customers have enough points to spend on such experiences but that number is increasing the average nightly cost of a hotel room has surged and customers are racking up more points more quickly the simple reason the more a room costs the more points the guest earns also hotels have entered into a slew of partnership deals with credit card companies allowing cardholders to earn points with every dollar spent these forces have led many hotel companies to become stingier in their points programs hyatt hilton and starwood recently changed their programs requiring more points for higher end hotels and irking travelers who complained the changes caused a devaluation of their points staying at one of starwoods most luxurious properties now requires points per night for a standard room during peak season up from from points before the change last year hilton reclassified hundreds of its hotels into higher categories meaning more points are required for stays there for example the las vegas hilton which used to be a category hotel was reclassified to a category that means the cost of a night at that hotel increased to points from points hotel officials say that allowing people to use piles of points for movie premieres and concert passes isnt a ploy to get guests to burn points on something other than hotel rooms instead it is intended to create more loyalty and word of mouth buzz around the programs customers are "really craving more experiences that are out of the norm and we want them to be able to use their points to be able to do whatever they want " says adam burke hiltons senior vice president for customer loyalty hotel companies say that the costs of their points programs have risen as hotel room rates increase hotels themselves have to pay more to cover their expenses when guests redeem points that is because of a hidden business structure that governs the hotel industry hotel companies like marriott typically dont own many of their own properties instead an independent party owns the building and contracts with a hotel company that then manages the property under its brand hotels are famously reluctant to discuss the details of how their loyalty programs are funded but most programs generally work like this when a guest checks into a hotel and earns points the hotel owner pays a fee into a special fund set aside to cover the future cost of redeeming those points when the guest redeems those points for a free night the hotel management company takes money out of that fund to pay the owner back for the hotel room typically hotel management companies pay only a fraction of the cost of the published rate for a hotel room but hotels must have enough cash on hand to cover all the points floating around in the world in order to be able to cover all the possible redemptions hotel companies say regardless of whether a guest redeems points on vip seats at a justin timberlake concert or a night at the waldorf astoria it still costs the company money and companies are coming up with a dizzying number of brag worthy ways to redeem points members of hilton hhonors the hotels

intercontinental has teamed up with a company called cloud living to among other things offer its members the chance to fly an italian built fighter plane through simulated aerial combat points and swim with great white sharks miles off the coast of mexico points while many hotel companies set the "price" of the experiences in points some like starwood allow members to bid for experiences in online auctions earlier this month bidding reached points for a round of golf with pga tour winner mark calcavecchia and points for dinner with master chef masaharu morimoto recently starwood members paid points for access to the "entourage" premiere party points for a private party with new york knick david lee and of their friends and points to attend a taping of "the young and the restless" soap opera starwood loyalty program member mr soares says he was more than willing to spend his points on red carpet events that literally couldnt be bought but were a few moments with mr travolta
