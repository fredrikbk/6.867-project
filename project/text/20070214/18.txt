business bookshelf why money can now make its way around the world capital rules by rawi abdelal harvard university press pages &# investors today have the world at their fingertips literally they can sit at a computer and trade stocks bonds and currencies from around the globe these transactions coupled with foreign investment account for the vast majority of the worlds cross border capital flows theyve become a defining feature of the global economy exceeding &# trillion in and according to the mckinsey global institute increasing an average of nearly a year since within any given economy of course it is a truism that capital goes where it can achieve the highest return with the least risk seeking out well run companies and promising projects there is no reason that this principle shouldnt apply across borders as well bringing new levels of prosperity to the global economy and it does now but we should not take such freedom for granted at any time one country or another can limit the range of its own capital or shun the capital that is moving in its direction indeed a loose economic consensus into the s held that governments should restrict capital flows in the name of stability what changed rawi abdelal a harvard business school professor has advanced a novel theory in "capital rules the construction of global finance " drawing on extensive documentary evidence as well as dozens of interviews with high level finance officials and midlevel bureaucrats he tells a fascinating and largely unknown tale how a clutch of french socialists helped to upend economic orthodoxy and lead the charge for lifting restrictions on capital flows within europe and throughout the world the story begins in with the onset of world war i and the gradual tightening of what had been an open and largely unregulated global financial market the volatility of the interwar years think of s boom and the world wide collapse of the s set into motion a restrictionist impulse it was at the bretton woods conference in that policy makers and economists came together to codify such misgivings and to agree on regulating capital flows and fixing exchange rates this was a revolutionary idea prompting john maynard keynes to observe that "what used to be a heresy is now endorsed as orthodox " eventually though the new orthodoxy itself lost its force particularly as markets sprang up in the s in which governments or corporations deposited part of their assets in currencies outside their home market primarily in london since the deposits there were subject to virtually no regulation these "eurocurrency" markets says mr abdelal "represented the ad hoc evolution of international capital markets " such markets got a further boost when the u s and britain officially liberalized capital flows in the mid to late s followed by japan in bucking the tide was france mr abdelals story heats up with the election of francois mitterrand in the new president together with his majority socialist party set out to storm the bastille of the economy he announced plans to nationalize the banks and restrict cross border capital flows to such a degree that french citizens could take the equivalent of only &# with them for leisure travel outside france and were prohibited from using credit cards during such travel rather than create a socialist shangri la the moves led to economic chaos the french had to devalue the franc three times in two short years mitterrand then made what the french would elegantly refer to as a tournant but we may bluntly call a u turn this painful episode provided a powerful lesson to a number of senior french officials said one "we recognized at last that in an age of interdependence capital would find a way to free itself and we were obliged to liberate the rest " and so in a nixon goes to china move an unlikely collection of french socialists set out to liberalize the countrys controls on cross border capital flows with a determination that gave new meaning to laissez faire the liberalization didnt stop there over the next few years some of those socialists maneuvered themselves into the top jobs at places like the european commission the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development their collective memories of frances capital controls led them to push for a broad deregulation of capital flows "the french experience of the beginning of the s had been extremely convincing for me " said michel camdessus who became head of the imf in "i preached on every possible occasion that you cannot trust exchange controls in the long term " mr camdessus did not ultimately manage to bring about a change in the imfs policy given that his preaching reached a climax in the midst of the asian financial crisis and the russian default but jacques delors the head of the european commission had better success in european leaders with mr delorss urging approved a historic directive that ordered an end to restrictions on capital flows among all its members remarkably the european commission has never gone wobbly since holding all new members to the requirement and enforcing it vigilantly mr abdelal is unequivocal about the value of europes action "global financial markets are global primarily because the process of european financial integration became open and uniformly liberal " he also highlights how free capital flows got a boost from the two primary credit rating agencies standard &amp poors and moodys in the s both began to give higher ratings to government backed debt when the country in question had an open capital account while more statistics might have helped to document mr abdelals argument it is also to his credit that "capital rules" is not a data dump embellished by inscrutable charts and graphs the book is a mix of accessible political history and counterintuitive insight bringing to our attention one of the most important and least appreciated developments in the postwar global economy mr rees is a senior director at the white house writers group in washington and a former bush administration speechwriter
