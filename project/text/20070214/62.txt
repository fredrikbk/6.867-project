genetic tests pose tailored care one of the nations leading management companies of pharmacy benefits aims to confirm whether genetic testing can help eliminate the life threatening and costly complications that many patients develop after starting a prescription of the anticlotting drug warfarin the collaboration between medco health solutions inc and the mayo clinic on a study of warfarin users is one of the latest corporate forays into the emerging science of so called personalized medicine in which physicians use genetic or other molecular tests to tailor a patients treatment those promoting personalized medicine say the science boils down to delivering the right treatment at the right dose to the right patient at the right time which they say could make health care safer more efficient and cost effective doctors might use genetic tests to customize the dosage of a drug such as warfarin determine which treatment would work or pose safety problems or find a patients susceptibility to a disease such customized therapy already has been put to some clinical use some cancer treatments for example target certain genes or proteins and drug makers biotech companies medical institutions testing laboratories and government agencies such as the food and drug administration and the national institutes of health appear eager to advance the practice health insurers are watching with interest "i think this is an explosion about to happen " said robert field chairman of the health policy and public health department at the university of the sciences in philadelphia "five or years ago this was the promise of genetic technology today we are seeing the first applications i think five years from now certainly years from now this will indeed dominate medicine "personalized medicine would be able to tell us through genetic markers whos likely to respond positively and whos likely to respond negatively before you even start the therapy " that can have major implications reducing or eliminating harmful side effects saving patients from taking unneeded drugs and choosing therapies that fit a patients genetic profile such technology might save health insurers and others billions of dollars now spent treating life threatening side effects or on drugs that dont help some individuals or by preventing disease in patients found to be genetically susceptible this type of medicine also poses challenges including changes in a pharmaceutical industry that has been based on blockbuster drugs rather than gene oriented therapies aimed at smaller populations industry and government must answer questions about insurance coverage for new diagnostic tests and therapies and about regulatory standards for these new drugs patient privacy is another concern lawmakers in both houses of congress have introduced bills to bar insurance and employment discrimination based on genetic data it is too early to say how big the overall savings might eventually be from widespread use of personalized medicine the use of genetic testing to personalize dosages of warfarin a half century old drug known by the brand name coumadin could reduce national health care spending by &# billion a year a recent study by the american enterprise institute and the brookings institution estimates optimal doses of warfarin vary among patients and the wrong amount can increase the risk of serious bleeding or stroke the aei brookings study estimates that formally integrating genetic testing into routine warfarin therapy could allow u s patients to avoid serious bleeding episodes and strokes annually medco and mayo collaborative services inc plan this year to evaluate the potential of genetic testing on new users of warfarin one of the most widely prescribed drugs in the u s genetic testing can indicate how patients metabolize the drug which may help doctors prescribe the right doses "its no longer shotgun medicine its much cleaner " medco chief medical officer robert epstein said the harvard medical school partners healthcare center for genetics and genomics is recruiting new warfarin users for a similar study in november the center hosted a personalized medicine conference where representatives of medco insurer aetna inc and biotech and major drug companies participated trials showing the effectiveness of genetic testing for drugs like warfarin "would change dramatically for that drug how things are going to happen " said harvard medical school professor raju kucherlapati scientific director of the harvard partners center the science holds promise for new drugs and diagnostic tools aimed at cancer heart disease and aids as well drug maker pfizer inc for example is working with monogram biosciences inc to develop maraviroc which blocks hiv from entering healthy cells via a common viral pathway a monogram assay shows whether particular hiv strains use that pathway so doctors can determine whether maraviroc would be a good option for a patient pfizer has filed for u s approval for the drug two leading personalized medicine drugs genentech inc s breast cancer treatment herceptin and novartis ags leukemia therapy gleevec are on the market and are being studied for possible use with other products roche holding ag has received fda approval for a test for genes related to drug metabolism
