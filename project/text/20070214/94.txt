niche investing eats into etf returns new research suggests costs erode bottom line at some index trackers exchange traded funds are doing a reasonable job of tracking the indexes they are designed to follow but a trend toward niche products is eating away at investors returns new research suggests index funds and their newer cousins etfs which trade on exchanges like individual stocks are designed to closely mirror benchmarks such as the standard &amp poors stock index however they dont always deliver the exact returns as the benchmark expenses eat into an investors bottom line as do taxes and the funds trading costs etfs often have lower expense ratios than similar traditional index funds but investors also should factor in the additional broker commissions they pay to buy and sell etf shares the gap between the returns on a fund and its index is known as tracking error as a result the smaller the underperformance the better for investors with some exceptions etfs listed in the u s had a low index tracking error in meaning they delivered returns fairly in line with their target benchmarks according to a report from morgan stanley tracking error in averaged for u s major market etfs for u s "style" etfs for u s sector and industry funds for international portfolios and for fixed income etfs according to morgan stanley "its important for an etf to track a benchmark so investors shouldnt ignore tracking error " said sonya morris an analyst at investment researcher morningstar inc that means paying close attention to fees and other drags on returns such as index tracking error "many etfs fish in the same pond and theres not a lot of difference in their holdings so in this instance theres no reason not to go for the cheapest fund " ms morris said "with more esoteric etfs coming out expense ratios are creeping up so its something for investors to keep an eye on " morgan stanley said etf tracking error in general rose in from the previous year which it blames on "new etfs issued on less liquid market segments and etfs issued on less well known proprietary indices " etfs that focus in more illiquid areas such as small capitalization and emerging market stocks tend to have higher tracking error due to trading spreads and liquidity and portfolio management issues the report found indeed the current trend in etfs is toward increasingly specialized niche products and etfs that seek to beat rather than track indexes by incorporating elements of active management "many consumers are under the impression that all etfs are low risk and broadly diversified but thats not always the case especially when investing in a brazil or telecom fund " said herb morgan president of efficient market advisors llc of san diego vanguard groups etfs scored the best in the rankings thanks to the firms low expense ratios according to the morgan stanley report vanguard had the lowest average etf tracking error at followed by state street corp unit state street global advisors at the report said amvescap plc unit powershares capital management had the highest average tracking error at and the highest average etf expense ratio at according to morgan stanley many of powershares etfs have a strategy of trying to beat indexes rather than mirror their performance or they target specific slices of the market john southard managing director at powershares said one reason the company had higher tracking error is because the indexes the companys funds track tend to have higher stock turnover some of the etfs also outperform their indexes and the morgan stanley report only considered total tracking error he added
