eyes on the road ford banks on taurus revival whats in a name in the car business it could be a few hundred million dollars a year at least thats what ford motor co is hoping fords decision to yank the taurus and sable names out of the grave got a lot of attention last week to some it was another sign of disarray in fords marketing strategy for others it was evidence that alan mulally fords new chief executive is bringing a fresh common sense perspective to the struggling auto makers business still another viewpoint is that reviving the taurus name despite the years of abuse heaped on it by ford management shows just how crazy the u s auto business has become as the number of models on offer has spiraled above the answer all of the above it seems a century ago but from the late s to the mid s the taurus was a sensation launched at a time when the dominant player in the midsize sedan market general motors corp was pushing a bevy of boxy look alike sedans such as the chevrolet celebrity the taurus turned heads with its rounded aerodynamic looks and comparatively refined interior the first generation taurus had its flaws the model was recalled more than half a dozen times for various problems but the car kept selling and ford executives of the time explained that by pointing out that customers paid attention to what they called "things gone right " as much as "things gone wrong " around the same time toyota motor corp was starting to crank up u s production of its camry smaller and less adventurous in its styling than the taurus camry was key to toyotas main mission of catching up with sales of honda motor co s accord the japanese sedans while blessed with strong reputations for quality didnt offer tauruss blend of style size and power thats one reason why the taurus was americas best selling car from to another was fords focus on the car so powerful was tauruss success that executives in other industries looked to fords strategy for inspiration including a boeing co executive named alan mulally so what happened ford botched the taurus redesign creating a car that was less attractive and felt less roomy the companys attentions turned toward sport utility vehicles and taurus was allowed to decline into service as a rented mule with hertz and other rent a car agencies as its main customers toyota meanwhile goaded initially by tauruss success as well as the success of the accord rolled out successive generations of its camry each more powerful better featured and more "american" than the one before its an equation that sells more than camrys a year with more than models to choose from on the u s market consumer overload is becoming a serious issue for auto marketers divide the likely overall sales volume of the u s light vehicle market by and you get about cars sold annually on average per nameplate that isnt a recipe for big profits mr mulally says his interest in reviving the taurus began on the day he arrived at ford last fall "the taurus in my mind and the vast majority of customers minds was the ford family sedan it was dynamite and an industry leader but then we stopped investing in it " just changing the name of the five hundred to taurus doesnt mean mr mulallys solved all the problems ford still faces a challenge to communicate to customers who might have bad memories of the more recent less inspired taurus that this new taurus has a competitive engine and its a touchy subject but it might not be a bad idea for ford to make more out of the fact that the five hundred excuse me taurus shares a lot of its design and safety engineering with fords volvo luxury brand in the end the name matters less than the substance of the car that wears it joseph b white is the journals detroit bureau chief his column appears every monday on wsj com
