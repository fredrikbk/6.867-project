reported fiscal earnings yesterday the u s dockers unit was a standout posting an annual sales increase for the first time since just three years ago when dockers was struggling closely held levi strauss tried unsuccessfully to sell the division it had risen to prominence in the s when its khaki pants became the dot com uniform of choice but its pants fell out of favor hurt by competitors who jumped on the khaki bandwagon the dot com bust and a shift to dressing up so levi strauss went back to the drawing board the company hired john goodman as president of the u s dockers division the gap inc veteran who later went to kmart corp as chief apparel officer helped oversee the transformation of gaps banana republic from a brand known for safari inspired clothes to an upscale line for men and women he quickly consolidated merchandising and design leadership under two senior vice presidents one for mens and one for womens and set to work revamping the clothes under mr goodman now years

designing dockers mens apparel specifically for four occasions work weekend wear dressing up and golf and marketing it that way and it began upgrading the quality and style of its apparel while continuing to use technology to offer wrinkle and stain resistance as selling points in the fall for example dockers launched its most expensive pants to date &# dress pants made with super fine wool that is machine washable "im a merchant a product guy through and through " says mr goodman who took on added responsibility for global oversight of the brand last year "so its been about making sure our product is the best quality the most relevant and in some cases the most fashion forward that we can be " when he arrived he says "the product was not as style relevant as it could have been " even the brands name got a makeover its now called dockers san francisco to emphasize the lifestyle component and the brands roots levis experience shows that apparel companies can revive troubled brands by building on their identity and expanding their offerings but as gap which has been struggling with weak sales and profits has discovered it isnt easy and there arent any quick fixes after

since and far below the peak of &# billion dockers turnaround comes amid a khaki revival including a push upscale by designers hawking more expensive more fashion forward khaki a category that threatens to do to dockers what premium jeans did to the companys core levis brand designers such as dolce &amp gabbana and dsquared are now taking a crack at khakis dockers officials say their products are positioned to withstand the competition "as khakis get more premium we are looking at more fashion right products and better fabrics " says jim tibbs senior vice president of dockers mens merchandising and design one example is the &# iconic khaki dockers introduced last year straight leg flat front pants with the lived in look thats currently popular and details such as selvedge stitching that has a bound edge and doesnt fray "dockers seems to be where they are getting most of the growth " says j p morgan chase &amp co high yield research analyst carla casella who follows the company because most of its debt is publicly traded "it just shows that a little bit of focus goes a long way they found a way to add some edge and differentiate the brand " dockers also faces competition from other moderately priced apparel companies such as haggar chaps and department store private label brands that also offer clothes for weekends as well as for work "competition is pretty stiff " says andrew jassin managing director of fashion consulting firm jassin orourke group llc standing out will require "great product great positioning and great pricing its a challenge " the womens business has also been a challenge a senior design director hired last year for the womens business is focusing on making the clothes more fashionable and getting new styles into stores faster during the conference call officials said the efforts appeared to be paying off when he arrived mr goodman says some styles like high rise pants were "five years old "
