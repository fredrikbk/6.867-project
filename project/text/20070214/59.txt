for aluminum companies a crush of consolidation mining firms flush might make a move to buy alcoa or alcan aluminum companies may be next in line for consolidation as mining conglomerates scour for takeover targets speculation is building that bhp billiton ltd rio tinto plc or another mining titan could bid to buy one of the worlds aluminum heavyweights particularly pittsburghs alcoa inc or alcan inc of montreal doing so would enable bhp or rio tinto to consolidate its position in the growing aluminum market while preventing competitors from snatching up the few remaining blue chip players at a time of accelerating consolidation in the natural resources sector speculation about a possible transaction involving alcoa yesterday boosted the dow jones industrial average of which alcoa is one of the member stocks alcoa climbed &# or to &# on the new york stock exchange alcan was up &# or to &# also on the big board in london trading bhp shares rose to gbp &# while rio tinto rose to gbp the two companies also have shares traded in sydney australia where they both declined slightly the price of aluminum which is used to make everything from soda cans to airplane parts has lagged behind some other metals in the recent commodity boom in part that is because china a driver of demand produces significant quantities of its own diminishing the need for imports still analysts believe global demand will continue to rise rumors of a large aluminum deal have floated for more than a year heating up again in recent days after the times of london reported that bhp and rio tinto had both "drawn up plans" for a &# billion takeover of alcoa rio tinto and bhp declined to comment on the speculation and alcoa officials have played down the report "we view this as rumors and rumors only " said kevin lowery a spokesman for alcoa some analysts say they believe the rumors of interest from rio tinto and bhp are credible though they remain far from certain a deal will occur in part because they think the &# billion price might be too high there are good reasons why a big aluminum deal might be attractive mining companies have struggled in recent years to find and develop new sources of raw material supplies and many of them believe it is safer to pick up assets through acquisitions than attempting higher risk exploration projects also mining companies are awash in cash on profits earned since the commodity boom took off four years ago shareholders are clamoring for the companies to find new ways of spending that money to ensure they have strong growth prospects in the next decade despite a somewhat uncertain outlook for commodity prices this year long term aluminum demand is expected to remain strong world wide with global consumption doubling to million metric tons by according to alcoa estimates a metric ton is equal to pounds there also are important reasons why a deal might not come together consolidating more aluminum output under one roof could raise hackles with antitrust regulators especially since bhp and rio tinto already have sizable aluminum assets alcoa and alcan also come with significant "downstream" assets such as smelters that mining companies typically prefer to unload as they focus their businesses on the work of digging ore and minerals out of the ground rather than making that ore into metal most big mining companies prefer to spread their risk over a number of basic commodities and absorbing the bauxite and alumina assets of either alcoa or alcan could make them too reliant on a product already in their portfolio whose price growth might not match other commodities analysts say if bhp acquired alcoa for example roughly of its earnings would come from aluminum compared with about today says mark pervan an analyst at daiwa securities in australia he reckons an offer from rio tinto is somewhat more likely some analysts believe there is another perhaps even more likely suitor for an aluminum company such as alcoa or alcan xstrata plc the swiss company has expanded through acquisitions and some analysts believe it is keen to cement its place among the worlds diversified mining titans before the good times end that group includes not only bhp billiton and rio tinto but also companhia vale do rio doce of brazil and anglo american plc of london xstrata said it couldnt comment on any merger speculation it also is possible mining companies will wind up preferring alcan over alcoa although alcoa has overshadowed alcan by many business measurements for years that dynamic may be starting to reverse after a acquisition of french aluminum company pechiney sa and a reorganization alcan found itself on par with alcoa in terms of some divisions and assets though alcoa remains the larger company with a market value of &# billion compared with alcans &# billion alcan stock was up in the past three years while alcoas was down before yesterdays stock jump "you can say alcan has done better period " says john tumazos a metals analyst with prudential securities in new york
