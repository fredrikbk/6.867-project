candidates find a new stump in the blogosphere nearly a year before the first caucuses and primaries take place the presidential campaign advertising war is under way online candidates of both parties are already buying space on search engines blogs and other internet sites popular with political junkies and potential donors with candidates vying for the most open race for the white house in years and front runners on both sides announcing plans to forgo public financing the election promises to be a huge revenue opportunity not just for tv broadcasters "theres a blog primary going on right now " says henry copeland founder of blogads a north carolina based advertising service which automates the process of placing ads on blogs in exchange for a cut of the revenue but this years campaign web pioneers are already beginning to run into uncharted zones some online activists get offended if they think a candidate is paying for ads on internet sites of the wrong political stripe and some smaller locally influential blogs have gotten miffed at being passed over one of the most aggressive online campaigners has been the former democratic senator from north carolina john edwards who hired several full time bloggers and began advertising on political blog sites in december on the republican side arizona sen john mccain has run prominent ads on conservative sites including townhall com and national reviews "the corner" blog former massachusetts gov mitt romney took out ads this week on conservative blogs including "outside the beltway" and "captains quarters " directing potential supporters to his web site the campaign was part of a promotional effort tied to his formal announcement yesterday in a suburb of detroit as in the campaign candidates are also already placing ads on google sometimes paying to have their ads appear when a search is done on a competitors name a search of "rudy giuliani" on google yesterday returned not only an ad linking to the former new york mayors official campaign web site but ads linking to messrs romney and mccain this early in a primary season presidential contenders historically just compete for campaign staff and money this year they are competing for online support as well leading republican and democratic candidates have all hired bloggers to connect with the political blogosphere and to update and manage their official campaign blogs sometimes though that can backfire as mr edwards learned when two of his campaigns official bloggers were accused by conservatives of posting offensive comments on their personal blogs although mr edwards backed the bloggers after they apologized for their comments both resigned from the campaign this week separately expressing concerns that the continuing controversy and attention from conservatives might hurt his campaign as they feel their way across unfamiliar territory the most aggressive online pioneers are having mixed success dodging missteps even online veterans have been unable to prevent their candidates from stumbling one example is peter daou who joined the campaign of new york sen hillary rodham clinton after several years compiling a daily political guide for salon com when sen clinton launched her bid for the democratic nomination her campaign purchased ads on a number of popular political blog sites inviting people to participate in a three night series of video webcasts but the clinton team offended some democrats by purchasing ads on at least four conservative blogs and originally passing over some smaller local bloggers in a conversation "you invite people who dont necessarily agree with you " says mr daou "we tried to reach out to as many blogs as possible " the campaign also created hurt feelings among some more thinly read democratic bloggers who didnt get an ad in nevada which hosts an early primary in some local bloggers groused that the clinton campaign focused its advertising dollars with las vegas based blogs and ignored the rest of the state "wheres my ad " huffed one nevada blogger taylor marsh who wrote on her site on jan that she found it "a little annoying that clintons team thinks that people like me dont merit advertisement simply because our numbers dont reach the one hundred thousand mark " mrs clintons camp tried to smooth over the nevada mess by promising to buy ads on different blogs during future rounds of online ads "you simply cant possibly buy ads on every blog " says mr daou unlike other campaign ad buys blog ads come out of mr daous budget he says because theyre considered "blog outreach " candidates are also touting their grass roots support by pointing to the number of "friends" the candidates have on social networking sites like facebook and myspace john edwards has friends on myspace all told online spending by candidates political parties and third party special interest "soft money" groups like moveon org could hit &# million during the cycle compared with &# million in according to an estimate by pq media llc a connecticut research firm the most popular political blogs reach a daily audience of just a few million readers according to a study released last october by george washington universitys institute for politics democracy and the internet but they are more likely than the general public to actively participate in the political process the study found that about of daily political blog readers are male about are between to years old and reported an annual income of &# or more for now internet ad spending is small compared with spending on traditional radio broadcast and cable advertising the best read blogs still charge comparably little for ads a standard size weekly ad purchased through blogads costs &# on the progressive site dailykos for example or &# at hotair com a conservative video blog site by comparison a second broadcast television spot could set back a candidate anywhere from &# to &# a week in a market like des moines according to evan tracey of the tns media intelligences campaign media analysis group generally speaking buying ads on blogs doesnt provide candidates with a guarantee of positive coverage many bloggers gleefully post scathing critiques of candidates that run alongside their ads and accepting an ad by no means indicates a blogger supports a candidate mr edwardss own in house blogger mathew gross runs a personal blog "deride and conquer " and says he will accept ads for as little as &# a week from any corporation and democratic candidate including one edwards rival sen clinton who recently ran an ad on his site "ill take ads from pretty much anybody short of nazis and communists " says glenn reynolds a university of tennessee law professor who runs the popular conservative site instapundit com "if you only take ads from folks you agree with people will start to think your opinions are driven by the ads rather than the other way around "
