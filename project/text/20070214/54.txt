faa to ask for &# billion to ease traffic congestion washington with the skies becoming more congested each year the bush administration wants to build a new system to handle more airplanes and is expected to ask congress for permission to borrow up to &# billion to pay for it the &# billion would help build a new satellite based air traffic control system that would allow planes to know more precisely where they are in the sky and therefore safely fly more closely together that would allow more planes in the air at any given time the borrowing proposal is a crucial piece of the plan the federal aviation administration is expected to lay out today as part of its long awaited plan to reauthorize the taxes and fees that support the agency under the plan the agency could borrow the money in fiscal years through to finance new equipment for the next generation air transportation system according to a draft the system would be owned and operated by the faa the draft says at one point the faa considered a plan to create a quasi independent agency to borrow the money and build the new system the faa also considered leasing the system but those approaches appear to have been abandoned internally the borrowing plan came under heavy scrutiny from the treasury department it was still being debated inside the administration as late as yesterday afternoon and could be killed before the event planned for today to roll out the plan the draft legislative language makes clear the treasury secretary as well as the white house would have to approve any such loans before they were issued the proposal caps borrowing at &# billion and it all must be repaid by according to the draft the faa also proposes allowing airports to increase the passenger facility charge that is assessed to fliers to help pay for capital improvements it is now capped at &# a passenger the faa proposes increasing it to &# per passenger the faa is proposing a new system for taxing airlines and private planes that use the air traffic control system the administrations plan would assess user fees to commercial airlines based on factors such as the number of takeoffs and landings distance traveled and the weight of the aircraft the faa could charge higher fees for planes flying into particularly congested airports those fees would replace the passenger ticket taxes now in place and would provide a more stable source of funding to the agency general aviation including business jets and recreational planes would continue to pay fuel taxes but those taxes would more than triple to reflect the pressure these planes put onto the air traffic control system according to the draft plan the faa is proposing to increase the aviation fuel tax paid by piston aircraft from cents a gallon to cents a gallon the jet fuel tax paid by the larger turbine jets would go from cents a gallon to cents a gallon under the plan the taxes and fees would be based on how much it costs to serve each plane to figure that out the faa recently completed a cost allocation study that confirmed airlines have been overpaying and general aviation has been underpaying specifically it found commercial airlines were responsible for of the &# billion in total costs in in recent years the airlines have paid more than of the total the study found private turbine jets typically operated by corporations accounted for of the costs they have been paying about of the total the plan faces a tough trip through congress commercial airlines support the faas general approach but have a variety of complaints about its details general aviation is fiercely opposed groups representing business jets and recreational fliers have been lobbying against it for months their arguments are tailor made to persuade congress that lawmakers will lose power over the faa if they approve the plan they complain their taxes are likely to go up and that they would still be subject to certain user fees that could be set by the faa without congressional approval
