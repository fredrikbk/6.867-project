new york office vacancies rise manhattans class a office market vacancy rate rose in january the first increase since last march according to a new study but one month doesnt make a trend so industry watchers say it is premature to call it a cooldown the colliers abr report indicated the vacancy rate rose to from in december largely as a result of two large blocks of space hitting the market a square foot block of space at avenue of the americas became available when a tenant relocated to the new york times building at eighth ave and square feet at third ave became vacant when multiple leases expired "i dont think its necessarily a trend " said robert sammons director of research at brokerage firm colliers abr "its just a small blip but it might be good to calm the market a little bit and allow the real estate market to catch its breath " indeed asking rents have been surging especially in midtown manhattan and real estate prices have soared for properties and companies with holdings in the red hot manhattan office market just look at the recent frenzied bidding wars for equity office properties trust and reckson associates mr sammons said the two new vacant blocks of space are "well located and we think theyll lease pretty quickly " he said he expects manhattans vacancy rate to resume its downward march in february and believes the vacancy rate could fall to by year end he said financial service and law firms continue to hire causing demand for real estate space to increase among these segments however he said several consecutive months of rising vacancies or continued sharp increases in asking rents could trigger a slowdown "if it continued for a few months then you might see a pause on that side of things " mr sammons said also the "steep increase in asking rents" could cause some tenants to delay signing new deals or think twice about expanding their space in manhattan he said "they might consider splitting up their operations and moving back office space to the suburbs or the outer boroughs " he said dennis yeskey national director of the real estate capital markets practice at deloitte &amp touche considers the january data to be an anomaly not a trend he said the vacancy rate would have to tick up to or before the market would significantly slow "remember its the average in the country is double that " mr yeskey said "the average vacancy rate in dallas is about and theyre still trying to negotiate some rent increases " mr yeskey said manhattan has not seen a lot of new construction other than properties such as world trade center making the office market tight "it would take some big block tenants moving out of the city" and sharp rent increases for the demand supply balance to change he said in january asking rents for class a space in manhattan rose to &# a square foot from &# in december and &# a year ago the last time the manhattan office markets vacancy rate moved up was march when the rate increased to from in february at the time two large blocks of space at fifth ave and avenue of the americas became vacant after the tenants decided to cut back on their real estate needs in that case the square foot block at fifth ave was leased the following month to morgan stanley the square foot block at avenue of the americas remains vacant as for investor interest and bidding wars for new york office properties mr yeskey said he sees this trend continuing although he believes cap rates or returns for buyers will start to tick up "pricing has to slow down " he said "only in new york do you have buildings going at cap rates below year treasurys " he said this phenomena only happens in "world class cities" such as london tokyo and new york he said however he sees cap rates flattening or moving up
