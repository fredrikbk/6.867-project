a cultural conversation a diva who moves the crowd with more than her voice new york the operas of the czech composer leos janacek are not exactly popular hits but they are profoundly respected for their subtle musical beauties and probing dramatic values of his operas "jenufa" composed with later revisions is probably the most frequently performed it tackles head on an important social issue of its time namely the burden of illegitimacy on a young village woman the current metropolitan opera production of "jenufa" remaining performances are tonight at p m and saturday at p m with a live broadcast by sirius satellite radio is noteworthy for a strong cast starring not only karita mattila in the title role but the celebrated soprano anja silja as jenufas stepmother kostelnicka the woman who in a shattering climactic moment surreptitiously drowns jenufas illegitimate newborn son to clear the way for the young woman to marry a man who is not the childs father a berlin native ms silja is a living legend during the s her silvery voice and svelte beauty quickly propelled her to the vanguard of german opera production more important however has been her exceptional intelligence and insight as a singing actress with much of her experience in this area gained at germanys bayreuth festival as protegee of its epochal postwar director wieland wagner the composers grandson hence at a time in life when most sopranos are either in retirement or doing the master class circuit ms silja "i loathe master classes they are usually just ego trips" remains in demand in both the opera house and the concert hall the child of two actors ms silja began her professional career at age "i never went to school " she says during our interview at the metropolitan opera house "because my grandfather was afraid i would be spoiled by the wrong influences there so he began to train me himself when i was reading writing counting " and she emphasizes that "he was my only singing teacher " hardly your garden variety granddad ms siljas was a painter and sculptor who became a berlin journalist during the s moreover because he was interested in singing he studied in italy with the voice teacher of the tenor beniamino gigli "acting was the only thing my grandfather didnt teach me " ms silja says but he did open the door to wagner when during the wartime blackouts he would recount the old norse and german sagas to the child anja "explaining wagners dramas and playing the scores on the piano in the dark " because she preferred singing to learning the piano herself her grandfather encouraged this "we started slowly with wagners music and by the age of i was able to sing absolutely every single wagner role from alberich to the walkure and other things too " at endowed with a very high coloratura voice she began to give concerts "singing lieder by schubert brahms wolf on the first half and big opera arias on the second " by the time she was her grandfather was taking her to audition at various german opera houses where the managers threw up their hands because of her youth "but my grandfather didnt give up " she says and apart from doing the opera house circuit he also brought his granddaughter to audition at bayreuth every year starting at age "theres a tale " she says "possibly apocryphal that they used to say that wunderkind is here again and theyd all stop by to listen " destiny however took over when she was in the soprano leonie rysanek had to pull out of a slated bayreuth production of "the flying dutchman " the great wagner conductor wolfgang sawallisch phoned ms silja at the frankfurt opera where she was singing coloratura roles and asked her to audition for the part "he took me to bayreuth and accompanied me on the stage as i sang i saw somebody walking in the balcony then he came down wieland and said could you just move a little bit with that phrase and i did it and he pushed furniture around and made me move around the stage " for a month after that there was no word "obviously they were still searching but i have the letter wieland finally wrote to sawallisch saying we have no other choice than to accept your lolita and so began my wagner career and my relationship with wieland " until wieland wagners premature death six years later ms silja performed in more than of his watershed productions at bayreuth and elsewhere moreover their professional relationship quickly became deeply personal given that wagner productions were normally cast with mature singers ms siljas youth and beauty proved extraordinary assets to wieland wagner productions for example the bayreuth "lohengrin " in which she sings elsa under sawallischs baton remains a touchstone on cd wieland wagner was responsible for much of her training as an actress "i can only put it this way he brought out the best that was within me he did that with every singer every actor who worked with him and he trained us of course in one of the most important things a singer can know how to be silent for instance in the second act scene between wotan and brunnhilde in walkure brunnhilde must listen in silence for minutes so wieland taught me and taught all of us how to stand absolutely still and yet maintain stage presence " she says that he taught her techniques that she applies to any role "the fundamental idea of acting is that you listen to your inner self and you listen to the words granted i am a singer but singing is not my major interest it is the words and using the words to bring out the essence of the role that are more important to me " some of ms siljas greatest portrayals have been of women obsessed wagners senta richard strausss elektra and salome or of women outside the normal social circles the title role of alban bergs "lulu" and the lesbian countess geschwitz in the same opera the centuries old emilia marty in janaceks "makropulos affair" and of course the flinty kostelnicka in "jenufa " though she is traditionally played as cold and hard hearted ms silja regards kostelnicka as "a victim of circumstance she is an educated woman in an uneducated community well read a figure of wisdom therefore she is an outsider in addition she bears the burden of an unhappy marriage earlier in her life but she has her pride and this is all falling apart because of the illicit relationship between jenufa and steva so from the first moment she appears she is already a tragic figure " having observed that she always tries to put something of herself into any character she portrays i ask ms silja if there was someone in her own life upon whom she modeled her kostelnicka "no" she replies "i cant feel her upbringing i dont have her stiff pride but i can understand why she has it what i try to put into my portrayal is the love i feel for my own children and the fear that i dont do enough for them " she also says that while "jenufa" is an opera about real people in a real world unlike wagners music dramas with their archetypal characters she nevertheless prefers acting the work in the kind of stylized production currently at the met "it has a lot of space for the interpretation of the personality which traditional opera sets dont give you if you are tied up with opening doors or sitting at tables or drawing drapes or other stage business you cant concentrate on the inner spirit of the characters therefore i prefer this kind of stylized production " ms siljas eyes twinkle as she notes that at this stage her career has effectively come full circle "in my early days people were always criticizing me for my youth and predicting that my career would not last two years " she says "and now almost at the end of the career theyre talking again about my age why then do i go on its not that i am always loving so much what i do but i do feel the need to fulfill the ideas that wieland brought to the opera world of his day and to continue bringing them to people today " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal
