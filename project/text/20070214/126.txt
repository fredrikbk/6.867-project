the numbers guy farm group touts cheap food but uses some murky math online edition in case you missed it last tuesday was national food check out day a farm advocacy group claims that by feb "the average american earns enough disposable income to pay for his or her food supply for the entire year " the american farm bureau federation says it is "celebrating the continued affordability of food " and uses check out day to demonstrate that u s agricultural policies and farm subsidies are good for consumers "when you consider the average price increases that americans have absorbed for vehicles gasoline and other consumer products over the past years the cost of food really does seem like a bargain " a spokeswoman for the group said in announcing the date which has hovered generally around the first week of february since it was first calculated in local affiliates of the national farm group have been spreading the good word their efforts helped garner press coverage in papers including the herald journal of monticello ind the courier news of elgin ill and the lincoln neb journal star but a look at how the date is calculated suggests most american families still have some bread winning left to do to come up with the feb date the american farm bureau federation added up all personal food expenses and divided by personal income wealthier people generally spend more on food but a smaller percentage of their income which can skew the calculation consider a hypothetical nation of families in this nation nine families have &# in disposable income and each spends &# or of income on food each year the th family has &# million in income and spends more on food but a much smaller percentage say &# the first nine families would need days to pay off their food bill while the wealthier familys happy day would be jan so whats the check out day for the hypothetical nation as a whole it depends on how you calculate it if you were to follow the norm for many demographic stats and take the number known as the median line up the families in order and pick the middle one youd mark the holiday on feb but use the farm groups averaging technique and youd get total food expenditures of &# from a pool of income of &# million and all the food would be paid for by jan that calculation would make sense only if the nations families were pooling their resources to buy food for everyone crunching the numbers in a different way could mean marking check out day weeks or months later the farm groups claim was criticized on the web site of the meatingplace a trade publication for producers of red meat and poultry numbers guy reader jason jennings flagged that article for me "theres zero attempt to come up with a misleading number " said james sartwelle an economist with the american farm bureau federation a trade group representing thousands of farmers across the country mr sartwelle acknowledged that the washington d c groups estimate is "skewed to the right" of a median but blamed the lack of u s government data there is no single figure on how much americans spend on food the government uses at least three different data sets from different agencies to come up with estimates the u s department of agriculture which generated the numbers used by the farm group gets its numbers from surveys that ask respondents to keep a diary of their purchases or to report them from memory the usda publishes a chart on its web site calculating income and food costs across the nation it shows that the proportion of income spent on food has held steady at just below during this decade down from in and a peak of during the great depression in the usda reported that americans spent &# billion on food out of &# trillion in personal disposable income there were million americans that year translating to &# in disposable income per person and &# in food costs but the usda doesnt disclose the income and food spending data from each survey household which is the kind of detailed data that would be needed to line up the households in a row and find the median "it could be theoretically possible if we could get raw data from the usda " the american farm bureau federations mr sartwelle said the department of labors bureau of labor statistics uses a similar survey method though it presents numbers in a different way it divides households into five slices by income level the bls reports that food costs represent of income before taxes on average for the middle slice of households that proportion ranges from spent on food by the wealthiest segment of households to for the poorest group the overall percentage from all households is in line with the usda numbers the two agencies also agree that incomes have increased faster than food prices households in the middle income group spent of their income on food in and in according to the bls the suggestion that american food has become cheaper is reinforced by a usda analysis showing that a smaller share of u s personal spending goes to food than most other wealthy countries including the u k canada and sweden the bls data are full of interesting tidbits about the way americans spend their money another chart shows that alcohols share of total expenditures is almost exactly constant among each income group at meanwhile the department of commerces bureau of economic analysis measures food expenditures from the supply side rather than from surveys the bea calculated an estimate of food spending for that was higher than the usda number used to herald the arrival of check out day relying on that number would have meant a date of feb for the farm group these differences in methods make it difficult to compare apples to apples or in this case total spending on apples clinton mccully an economist with the bea told me that the survey method can undercount the amount people are spending on food "people get sick of filling those out after a couple of days " he said food check out day isnt the first holiday dreamed up to illustrate how paychecks get sliced tax freedom day marked by the washington d c tax research group tax foundation since the s usually comes in mid spring it was on april last year and is meant to show how many days the nation has to work to pay for its government that date too looks at the population as a whole and would vary considerably if calculated for individual taxpayers the day has garnered press coverage including in the journal and also criticism for failing to account for the skewing effects of the wealthiest taxpayers tax foundation economist curtis s dubay said the groups aim is to give attention to a national issue and said the day isnt intended to be a measure of the typical american family
