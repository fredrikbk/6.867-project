the mossberg solution playing sudoku without pen and paper electronic versions work on gadgets some clumsy steps once you get addicted to sudoku youll want to work on these number puzzles whenever you have a few spare minutes so rather than scribbling in a newspaper or carrying around a sudoku book some people use electronic versions on gadgets they carry around every day as a steadfast fan of the pen and paper method i resisted the high tech approach but when apple inc started selling sudoku for ipod through its itunes store last september i considered the convenience of having these puzzles on hand in something like an ipod cellphone or smart phone this week i set aside my trusty sudoku book and tried these puzzles on four portable gadgets a motorola razr cellphone apples gigabyte ipod and two palm treo smart phones the treo p running the palm operating system and the treo w running windows mobile the results surprised me the gadgets enriched an already compelling game the game i played on the treos had me competing online against other sudoku fiends and the ipods bright screen showed off colorful background graphics even the lower tech motorola razr cellphone wasnt as bad as i had imagined but there were a couple of big drawbacks using these electronic versions took time to master and a beginner might quickly grow frustrated also the electronic versions were clumsier than the paper ones at entering tentative answers which most players rely on to help solve the puzzle these electronic pencil markings were just too tedious to make it was especially difficult to switch back and forth between making digital pencil marks and permanent entries the treos running a version of sudoku from a company called real dice inc worked best overall thanks to touch screens and built in numeric keypads that saved steps and the treo games optional online competition made an otherwise solitary game social a sudoku puzzle consists of a nine by nine grid that resembles a tic tac toe board covered in graph paper its small boxes are partially filled in with numbers and the solver must use the process of elimination and logic to place numbers one through nine in each row column and section of nine small boxes i bought ea sudoku by electronic arts inc on the itunes store for &# and loaded it onto my ipod this game will not run on a computer screen it works only on ipods that can play videos ea sudoku emphasizes the games japanese influence asian music plays softly in the background while you work on a puzzle you can also play music from your ipod handsome backgrounds show scenes from the far east and even the games menus are written in fonts that look like they belong on rice paper but the ipods methods for navigating the sudoku grid using the scroll wheel four way touch or both are not ideal entering numbers into the puzzle involved a tough combination of too much scrolling to find the right box followed by more scrolling to choose a number pencil marks are a little more painful before and after using the pencil you must select an icon for pencil markings these show up as tiny numbers in each box journey points are acquired as you complete puzzles in ea sudoku harder puzzles are awarded more journey points and the backgrounds of your puzzles change as you progress i worked my way up through four skill levels and unlocked a surprise fifth level called "insane " i tested the treo w and p by downloading sudoku master ii one of the most popular sudoku games from hand held gaming web site handango com the game by real dice cost about &# for the palm version and &# for the windows mobile version because the latter comes with the original version of sudoku master the game looked the same on both operating systems the treo games were much more usable than the ipods if not as handsome the treo touch screen let me use its stylus to quickly jump around the sudoku grid and the treos numeric keypad serves as another way to enter numbers switching from pencil to permanent marks was still a pain but not nearly as bad as with ipods ea sudoku though sudoku master ii lacked striking graphics it lets you challenge other players online to finish a puzzle with you whoever fills in more squares without too many errors wins you can even chat with one another during the game i found other players in four of the games five difficulty levels and even earned a tie score against someone named texmex while i usually enjoy the unrushed concentrated thought that goes into solving a tough sudoku puzzle after playing a few rounds with others i liked the challenge of trying to quickly fill in the blank boxes on my motorola razr cellphone which uses verizon wireless service i found three sudoku games in verizons get it now downloading section i bought and downloaded usa today sudoku fusion for &# a month &# buys the game for unlimited use i was surprised to see that this download included regular sudoku and four other versions of the game as was expected the interface of the cellphone was cruder than that of the ipod or treos but its numeric keypad made number entry easier and the pound key toggled between permanent and pencil markings because of the phones smaller screen each of the sudoku grids boxes could hold only up to four pencil marks at a time you can add more but theyll be visible only when that box is selected the regular game is divided into five skill levels all of these games let you save and close your sudoku to do something else on your device and each puzzle can be timed or solved using helpful hints but of this small selection of games and devices the treo worked best for electronic sudoku ill stick to pen and paper for the most part but may be tempted to challenge texmex to another duel in the online competition mossbergsolution wsj com
