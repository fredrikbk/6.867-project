wrong numbers for telecom equipment companies pressure grows to give money back to investors frustrating some firms longer term goals carl icahns call for motorola inc to repurchase more shares is reverberating throughout the telecommunications equipment business even if the activist investor falls short in his motorola strategy which came to light late last month many telecom gear makers soon could face similar pressure to put more money in the hands of shareholders like motorola which makes cellular telephones home media goods and other communications products these companies are sitting on piles of cash motorolas main competitor nokia corp had &# billion of cash by the end of last year and just &# million in debt telefon ab l m ericsson has about &# billion of cash and only about &# billion of debt tellabs inc and sycamore networks inc among others are in similar positions mr icahn called it "ludicrous" for motorola to settle for an average interest rate of about on its &# billion of cash with a stake in the company he has demanded a board seat to pressure the company to use all of that money to buy back shares even the prospect of such a push at other cash laden telecom companies could trigger rises in share prices at least in the short term motorolas stock which had fallen by since mid october jumped by on the disclosure of mr icahns action motorola ended yesterdays session on the new york stock exchange at &# up cents if companies decide to accelerate or initiate share buybacks that could raise stock prices as well stock repurchases spread earnings over fewer total shares that raises earnings per share which theoretically should boost the stock price why the big cash holdings in the sector reserves have been building from solid cash flows from operations reduced costs through outsourcing and relatively scant merger and acquisition activity at the same time some chief executives want a cushion against possible hard times something many of them remember well from the last telecom bust when many equipment companies teetered near bankruptcy others point out the need to increase research and development spending but these explanations mean little for investors eager for returns in the form of higher dividends or stock buybacks now that the companies no longer have the allure of so called growth stocks they enjoyed in the s "while motorola is icahns first technology target we believe that it will not be the last " ping zhao an analyst at research firm creditsights inc wrote in a note to investors "a number of companies will be under pressure to actively manage their balance sheet " some telecom equipment companies think their money is better invested elsewhere ericsson the large swedish equipment company says it has no plans for a stock buyback but it isnt sitting on its cash either according to henry stenson an ericsson spokesman if two recent measures a &# billion acquisition of redback networks inc and a proposed &# billion dividend are completed the company would have &# billion in cash that is down from &# billion a year ago according to mr stenson although nokia is considered cash heavy by some investors it has stepped up its share buyback program in recent years spending &# billion last year and &# billion the year before according to a spokeswoman it expects to buy back another of its shares in the year following its next shareholders meeting in may a few telecom equipment companies have won plaudits from investors for their cash management cisco systems inc has spent &# billion to buy back billion shares since it began a repurchase program in according to a spokeswoman repurchasing shares isnt enough for some investors indeed since may motorola has spent &# billion to purchase shares out of &# billion it has set aside for buybacks the cash piles have stirred the attention not only of antsy shareholders but also of private equity companies which are regularly pitching buyouts to chief executives according to telecom officials private equity firms already have been hovering over the semiconductor sector where many companies also have large amounts of cash and little debt last september blackstone group led a &# billion takeover of freescale semiconductor inc a spinoff of motorola after beating out a group led by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co a month earlier the kkr group bought an stake in the semiconductor division of philips electronics nv for &# billion plus &# billion in debt some investors suggest mr icahns stake in motorola which has a market value of about &# billion isnt large enough to force the company to do something it doesnt want to do although he makes headlines with his bitter battles against management such as with time warner inc last year mr icahns strategy with motorola appears much more focused he sometimes simply takes positions in companies whose stock has fallen and where he sees potential gains motorola trades at about times estimated earnings for which is cheaper than its peers mr icahn "sees what we see which is an inexpensive stock and a lot of cash " says lewis kaufman a managing director at santa fe n m based thornburg investment management inc which has &# billion in assets and owned nearly six million motorola shares as of last september "his involvement increases the chances the cash will be put to its best use "
