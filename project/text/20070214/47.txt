economists react economists say bernanke remarks arent as dovish as they may seem online edition in senate testimony federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said that the fed is comfortable with current interest rate levels but stands ready to resume its tightening campaign if inflation doesnt moderate as expected the remarks were the first insight for economists into the central banks outlook for heres how economists reacted to mr bernankes pronouncements on interest rates economic growth jobs housing and more there were two key wording changes that could well become the language in the next policy statement that softened the imbalance first the chairman described the federal open market committees predominant concern as "the risk that inflation will fail to ease as expected" instead of "some inflation risks remain " second the fed is "prepared to take action to address inflation risks if developments warrant" instead of "the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed " brian fabbri bnp paribas perhaps the most interesting response during the session was in response to a question on housing when bernanke specifically noted the usefulness of watching the spring for more information with the focus on housing risks in his prepared testimony this comment suggests that june would be the earliest that he would consider adjusting rates drew matus lehman brothers global economics fed chair bernanke delivered an assessment of the economy that was notable in its increased confidence that inflation will subside while he did mention that the most recent fomc statement views inflation as the predominant risk the message coming from this testimony is one of a fed that is content to not act to avert that risk for an extended period given bernankes relaxed posture toward inflation we would not be surprised if the fomc were to move toward a neutral policy stance at the march meeting provided the january and february inflation readings are well behaved we view this outcome as a low probability event however and we remain of the view that the next move from the fed will be a rate increase coming in the fourth quarter of this year michael feroli j p morgan economics we dont think the bernanke semiannual monetary policy testimony was as "dovish" as the reaction in the treasury market would seem to suggest treasuries seem to have caught a bid off of the discussion of inflation and the idea noticeably absent from the feds forecasts that inflation pressures should continue to diminish gradually while bernanke discussed the abatement of temporary forces that had pushed inflation higher implying receding inflation pressures he repeated twice that the fomcs predominant concern was that inflation would fail to moderate as expected michael darda mkm partners at first blush this testimony may seem more dovish than that delivered in july we judge the statement as remaining consistent with a tightening bias although the fed is unlikely to act on that bias until it is more clear that the housing sector does not pose more of a downside risk to the economy in than currently expected we remain unconvinced of the logic of a lower inflation forecast given the feds model and the expected evolution of labor market slack and we still look for the fed to hike rates twice in john ryding bear stearns u s economics bernankes prepared testimony to the senate banking committee contained few surprises indeed he seemed to go to great lengths to present a balanced assessment being careful to offer both upside and downside risks to a relatively optimistic baseline scenario for growth and inflation the testimony should reinforce the view that the fed will remain on hold for the foreseeable future david greenlaw and ted wieseman morgan stanley research it is rare when a fed chairman can trudge to the hill for a semi annual testimony with a high degree of confidence that the fed will have to do nothing until his next appearance chairman bernanke finds himself in that position today in my view there are two small inconsistencies here first between the fomcs forecast that core inflation will be steady this year while bernanke echoes the soothing rhetoric of other fed officials "some indications that inflation pressures are beginning to diminish " second it is not clear to me why the fomc expects core inflation to ease in when they look for essentially trend growth and no backup in the unemployment rate bernankes discussion of why core inflation will ease focused on the salutary passthrough from waning oil and raw material prices to core inflation and the likelihood that shelter costs will cool in stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital
