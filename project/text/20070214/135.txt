vodafones caution may be a shrewd call a year ago vodafone group plc chief executive arun sarin faced heavy criticism for a european expansion plan so underwhelming that one big shareholder quipped that investing in the wireless company on the basis of its strategy was akin to buying a lottery ticket while most investors took comfort in the mobile phone operators decision to cut overhead costs and target fast expanding emerging markets such as india and africa they were disappointed by its approach for revving up revenue in the saturated european market where price wars have pushed call costs down rivals were pushing to put their equipment into hundreds of telephone exchanges and acquire operations that would bring convergence of mobile phone fixed line telephony broadband and internet tv services to european customers homes and businesses vodafone in contrast was going "asset light " meaning it intended to partner with other companies and rent the infrastructure as needed it was a strategy critics viewed as putting one toe in the water too slow and ineffectual now a growing chorus of analysts see vodafones approach in a more positive light as the alternative hasnt yet delivered on its promises perhaps the worlds largest mobile phone operator was shrewd after all some say "what they are doing is quite sensible " says ian fogg senior analyst at independent telecommunications research group jupiter research who has been positive all along "they are tailoring their strategy to local market conditions and making very good investment decisions depending on the opportunity in each market this doesnt preclude them from ramping up their capital investment if they need to yet at the same time they are not exposed to the risks some competitors are seeing " the rivals remain confident while acknowledging that demand for combined services is at an early stage and vodafone critics still abound in this camp cyrus mewawalla head of telecommunications research at brokerage westhall capital believes vodafone is playing a dangerous game in maintaining what he dubs a "mobile only" strategy he says corporate customers in particular increasingly want one stop shopping for telecom and information technology services he has had a "sell" recommendation on the companys shares for two years at last years gsm conference in barcelona much time was spent discussing the merits of "triple play" and "quad play " for established fixed line operators the triple play of broadband and television over the internet was seen as a lifeline reducing customer churn and stimulating greater usage and therefore revenue from telecom services among those reaching even further cable tv operator ntl inc under the virgin media brand and france telecom sas orange and telefonica sas o both mobile phone firms they have announced some of the most ambitious plans for quad play services these offer customers all of the above plus mobile phone services all on one bill as o orange and the united kingdoms virgin mobile began to integrate their businesses with those of fixed line telecom operators vodafone has taken a different path despite receiving gbp billion &# billion in the sale of its japanese assets to softbank corp in march vodafone opted for what mr sarin calls the asset light approach to gaining additional income from fixed line services while vodafone launched bundled land line telephone and internet service in germany using already owned assets it decided not to acquire fixed line infrastructure in the u k instead it signed an agreement with giant phone company bt group plc effectively renting out technology and repackaging it for customers under the vodafone brand in italy critics argue vodafone has taken an even less profitable approach to generating fixed line revenue it partnered with fastweb spa to co market each others mobile and internet services rather than launch its own the critics dont see how vodafone is going to achieve a target of obtaining of all group revenue from add on fixed line and advertising services within the next three years when it doesnt own the access infrastructure they contend bigger profits can be made by owning the equipment and operations through which services are provided those more bullish on vodafone see ownership as equally risky given it isnt certain that european consumers will opt to buy mobile phone tv internet and home telephony from a single provider for their part the companies pushing the quad play boundary acknowledge the challenges while exuding enthusiasm about the prospects "its still an immature market in terms of customers taking up all services " says a spokesman for o adding that there are early signs of customer demand in the czech republic as its service launched only in november ntl says it has yet to release any data orange notes that it has subscribers to triple play services in france spain poland senegal and mauritius at vodafone where there are million customers executives say they have been vindicated "back in may people said our strategy was a bit wishy washy and that they werent convinced but now its proven itself out " says alan harper director of strategy at vodafone "weve not seen any hard evidence from our customers or competition that quad play really has a lot of traction anywhere in europe " he says "triple play is getting some pick up like in france for instance but thats more beneficial for the fixed line incumbent youre not seeing the addition of mobile " he adds "rather than committing hundreds of millions of euros into something that is unproven at this stage were saying lets wait and see " morten singleton a telecom analyst at investment bank westlb who has become more positive in his coverage of vodafone notes that vodafone doesnt seem to have lost any ground on the revenue front as a result of its strategy westlb doesnt act as an adviser to vodafone his view is shared by other analysts contacted by the wall street journal "vodafones current strategy could have legs " mr singleton adds the company "can quite easily move into owning fixed line assets as and when needed " with mobile technology improving "it could be that it is able to provide the same services currently offered by fixed line telephony operators without the need for such heavy investment " for instance hspda technology allows personal computers and laptops to connect to the internet via mobile data cards he says vodafone is investing in the technology which mr singleton calls "super g " given the costs and uncertainty surrounding european consumer demand for quad play services from a single provider greater returns could be achieved by investing in fast growing markets says person name "gutberlet martin"martin gutberlet vice president of telecommunications research at independent research firm gartner inc among those india where more than six million consumers sign up for mobile phone services a month on sunday vodafone said it agreed to pay &# billion for control of hutchison essar ltd one of the countrys biggest mobile phone operators indias cellphone market makes a sharp contrast to many saturated european markets closer to home mr fogg the jupiter analyst sees an intensifying price war and lower profit margins as mobile tv and telephony firms compete aggressively for a share of each others markets monthly average revenue per user figures for european broadband for example are likely to drop from euros a month as of december to euros a month by he says he believes that vodafone through its partnerships with bt and fastweb is well positioned to gauge where the heaviest customer demand is and target its capital expenditures for example as carphone warehouse group plc and british sky broadcasting group plc install equipment in local telecommunications exchanges in most regions of the u k vodafone can expand operations in profitable regions while maintaining its "rental" deal with bt in less appealing areas vodafones mr harper doesnt rule out making capital investments "were saying lets test the reality of the market before making hundreds of millions of pounds of investment " he says he adds "where i get the best return is where the shareholders want me to invest vodafones money " still westhalls mr mewawalla sees dangers in vodafones primary focus on the mobile phone piece of the puzzle "the mobile sector is no different than the fixed line sector it is vulnerable to the threat of cheaper services based on internet technology " he says he says revenue from voice services could fall toward zero in the next five to years vodafone derives of its revenue from voice services "so it has more to lose than almost any other telecom operator in the absence of a dramatic change in its business model " he says vodafone says it already offers its business customers convergent mobile and fixed line services
