in charge of the dreamliner gallery the decisions these executives make add up quickly outfitting an average interior costs around &# million with first class seats selling for &# on up to &# until recently putting together the interior of an airplane was an month shopping marathon that required airline officials to visit dozens of individual suppliers to pick out everything from seats and carpeting to crash axes and emergency lighting hoping to eventually reduce the process to four months and cut some of its own costs at the same time boeing developed an online catalog and then gathered the various choices of interior items under one roof near the companys widebody airplane factory in everett wash since the showroom opened in january representatives from all nippon airlines co japan airlines corp ethiopian airlines northwest airlines corp and continental airlines inc have toured it and begun the first stages of selecting boeing says it will begin delivering the first of the dreamliners on order in may the dreamliner featuring new technologies in its skeleton and skin and fuel efficient engines has become the hottest selling new plane boeing has made most customers are ordering their dreamliners to seat to passengers and will use the planes on long haul routes both boeing and airbus in recent years have put considerable effort into making their customers plane buying experiences easier airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co scored points beginning in the late s by building a mock up center at its headquarters in toulouse france airbus now has mock ups of each of its major new planes including the giant double deck a during a trip to france a couple of years ago then boeing commercial airplanes chief executive alan mulally took a tour of the center and made no secret about how impressed he was when customers demanded something similar from boeing mr mulally and other top boeing officials "were very supportive " said ms rhodes although airbus offers customers the ability to experiment with certain items the boeing center is conceived more as a true design center customers can browse the different makes of seats entertainment equipment and other add ons in a theater like setting for example executives can try out rows and rows of different seats that might be used in first class business class or coach john leahy airbuss chief commercial officer and top salesman said he isnt surprised that boeing is trying take the concept a step further "i knew this was going to happen when we let alan mulally look at our mock up center " he said the dreamliner gallery occupies square feet and includes rooms dedicated to various aspects of the interior of an airplane want to pick out fabrics or carpet second door on the left passenger seats and in flight entertainment are in the room across the hall in another room they can play with samples of the planes led mood lighting they can test a working model of the

reception at the showroom airline representatives jumped from seat to seat pushing all the buttons of course that doesnt necessarily mean theyll pick the top of the line for their companys planes boeing envisioned the coach section of the having eight seats abreast each nearly inches wide but most carriers are choosing to squeeze in nine seats at inches wide boeing is promoting the gallery as the next step in designing and building jetliners but its also a tool to discourage airlines from going crazy with options "it got to the point that all of the customization was getting out of control " said randy atkins senior manager of customer integration for the program over customization frequently adds costs to production and has led to problems most recently for airbus deliveries of the first as have been delayed as much as two years in large part because of wiring problems associated with special interiors unlike automobile showrooms the dreamliner gallery has an element of fort knox to it most airlines jealously guard their new interiors so boeing set up each room so buying teams from only one airline at a time can be inside because most airline visits to the dreamliner gallery are expected to take from two days to two weeks boeing also built two private office suites "for smaller airlines that dont have relationships with some of the bigger suppliers its a great place for us to bring them for one stop shopping " said terry eastley an executive with aircraft leasing giant international lease finance corp ilfc which leases planes to airlines around the world has dreamliners on order when planning for the boeing selected options from most of the leading suppliers for high profile items the majority of the worlds leading manufacturers wares are displayed in the showroom boeing says it will still allow customers to choose equipment not on the approved list but airlines that stray from the standard catalog will be required to pay any extra cost
