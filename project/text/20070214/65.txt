hasta la vista ever since releasing the first major upgrade to its popular windows operating system in more than five years microsofts stock has been on a record tear downward one more down day and we would have been tied at nine for the longest tumble in the companys year trading history so what gives in short investors are increasingly skittish about microsofts vista late horsepower hungry missing some promised features and getting indifferent reviews the product is nowhere near the buzzmaker of its predecessors windows and windows xp analysts and investors are worried that the product is too little and too late so much so that vista wont fuel the usual earnings goosing upgrade cycle that such releases have in the past and there is early evidence that the vista worriers are right major firms are telling companies to hold off on upgrading and a short days after release vista has quickly fallen out of the top at online superstore amazons software bestseller list in truth vista problems are just symptoms of a deeper microsoft malaise monolithic software bits in a shrink wrapped box is a dying business it is being slayed by software sold as a service by open source and by ad centric online software i e google microsoft president steve ballmer sees this of course in a recent interview he said that many of the companys engineers had already turned their attention from vista to search and ads the game plan improve search to be better than googles while drawing more of the rapidly growing search centric advertising pie to microsofts own network the trouble is microsoft has been playing expensive catch up in search for years and is still losing share while its executives want to throw more engineers at the problem most google spoiled users of online search wouldnt know "better search" if they had it short of reading a users mind or disentangling our own confused ideas of what we really want when we type bizarro keywords like "newt porch iceberg " it is brutally hard to make search unambiguously better in some meaningful sense you can see some of this in a debate this week in the blogosphere about a lavishly funded self styled google killer called powerset to out google google the company has had to promise it will solve one of the least tractable problems in computer science gleaning true intention from natural language as opposed to keywords it almost certainly wont happen but it shows how absurdly high the hurdle has become to be meaningfully "better" in search meanwhile microsoft is trapped between vista and a google created hard place it is much like what happened to ibm years ago when microsoft laid it low with the company looking slow and the industry no longer afraid competitors now see windows as a heavy weight around microsofts neck one that keeps the company safely occupied on a treadmill far from their own businesses that is why the best news for them in the last few days came when microsoft began talking up a new version of windows set for yeah go for it guys knock yourselves out mr kedrosky is a venture capitalist and cnbc analyst
