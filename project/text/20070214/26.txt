corporate focus business a question for chairman bernanke is it time to yank the punch bowl sam zell wasnt planning to go to stephen schwarzmans million dollar birthday bash last night nonetheless the chicago real estate investor says he is "a happy camper " he sold equity office properties to mr schwarzmans blackstone group for a hefty premium making money for his investors and pocketing more than &# million in the process mr schwarzman is happy too and not just because rod stewart was singing at his party less than a week after completing the equity office deal blackstone is well on its way to selling off half the property it bought locking in billions of dollars in profit insiders believe the massive buyout will yield plus returns for blackstone and its investors in normal times a decision to dump &# billion of office buildings onto the market might depress prices anyone remember the law of supply and demand but these arent normal times some analysts have argued with a straight face that blackstones gambit may actually accelerate office price increases that suggests buyers are willing to pay mr schwarzman more because they think he knows something they dont and in normal times tapping the mortgage debt markets for four or five times as much money as has ever been raised there before to finance a &# billion real estate extravaganza might cause a meltdown but today that money flows like cheap champagne so think of mr schwarzmans th birthday as a sign of the times there is a big bubbly investment party going on out there rolling from one asset class to the next inflated by remarkably easy credit or as mr zell puts it "we have a massive excess of capital " ben bernanke wasnt going to go to mr schwarzmans party either instead the u s fed chairman had to prepare for his semiannual testimony before congress where he is likely to address two serious questions that arise from all this the first should the fed take away the punch bowl before the party gets out of hand mr bernanke is an economic historian and knows that when the fed tries to stop investor speculation it gets in trouble witness the feds tightening in the late s and the dismal decade that followed moreover the fed chief argues the liquidity flooding todays markets isnt really a monetary phenomenon the worlds central banks he believes are doing a good job keeping money creation in check and ultimately it is excess money creation that leads to inflation the feds no enemy instead mr bernanke argues that the funds flowing into investments are coming from what economists call the "real" economy fast growing countries in asia and the oil rich nations of russia and the middle east are growing and earning money faster than they can spend it the result is what mr bernanke has called a "savings glut " the worlds newly affluent who might have stuffed their money in a mattress in an earlier era now are parking funds in u s treasury securities and driving down interest rates that leads other investors unhappy with low rates to chase after higher returns wherever they can find them even if it isnt a purely monetary phenomenon however mr bernanke surely sees the danger for the economy in this scenario a glut of savings pushes interest rates down bids up risky assets and prods investors to do things they otherwise wouldnt and probably shouldnt do moreover measuring the central banks creation of "money" is an imprecise art such measures aside at some point plentiful credit buoys the economy and greases the way to higher inflation that is why investors will likely conclude after listening to the fed chiefs two day talkathon that he is far more likely to raise short term interest rates in the coming months than cut them the second question is more political than economic and more difficult to answer will disaffected workers crash the party mr schwarzmans birthday party and the swelling private equity fortunes it symbolizes are manifestations of the rising inequality that mr bernanke referred to in a speech in omaha neb this month and that he will certainly be asked about today and tomorrow americans have long been willing to tolerate unequal economic outcomes because of a faith that they too might someday have a shot at the brass ring recently however there are signs that faith is fraying financiers who celebrate fast fortunes made while workers face stagnant pay and declining job security risk becoming targets for a growing dissent
