ideas &amp innovators a look at creativity and how new concepts are born how an amateur inventor got wheeled footwear concept rolling many amateur inventors dream of creating a million dollar product in the garage but usually the only thing that ever comes out of that garage is the family car roger adams the creator of a new kind of skate shoe beat the odds mr adams founded heelys inc a carrollton texas company that makes sneakers that work like skates when the wearer shifts weight to the heels the company has sold more than million pairs of heelys as they are known world wide since they debuted in and they keep rolling in the six months ended june sales rose to &# million from &# million a year earlier born in tacoma wash in mr adams was surrounded by skating from the start he worked at the roller rink his parents owned repairing skates and manning the check room where patrons stored their street shoes from an early age he invented quirky homemade devices inspired by james bond movies in junior high school he used the center of a flash cube to fashion a ring that temporarily blinded people when they bent down to view it later he designed sound and lighting systems for skating rinks helping pay his way though college his family expected him to move into the family roller skating business instead he took a detour he was working as a mental health supervisor in oregon in the s "i was a counselor to other counselors " he says when he became disenchanted with the bureaucracy involved around the same time he says his marriage of years to his college sweetheart "began to dissolve " he quit his job and moved away from his wife and three young children looking for direction and inspiration in the fall he was sitting on a friends porch in manhattan beach calif watching roller skaters skateboarders and bicyclists on the boardwalk thinking back to a "happier simpler time" at his familys roller rink that led him to an idea "it occurred to me that all those things roller skates skateboards bikes had been around for a hundred years " he says "it seemed to me that there had to be some new way to have fun on wheels " his friend had a workshop in his garage he heated up a butter knife and began cutting apart some nike sneakers and experimenting with metal balls and wheels he "cannibalized at least four pairs" of sneakers in the first few hours he tried them repeatedly and kept falling until he accidently discovered the proper stance one foot in front of the other to maintain balance "i had a concept i wanted the wearer to be able to walk normally and then roll " he says "there is a stealth nature to heelys when you see a kid wearing them you wouldnt know theres a wheel in the sneaker until they started to roll " mr adams quickly decided he had a product to sell he spent all the money he had &# on pushing the project forward much of the money went to legal bills to get a provisional patent for his skate shoe and the rest went to product development he also took a job selling cars at a ford dealership to make ends meet "im not a betting man but i felt that i had a horse that was sure to win " he says mr adams now holds a number of patents relating to the skate shoe including the idea of placing a single wheel in the heel and the stance the wearer takes feet one in front of the other toes up and heels gliding he took the prototypes to seven different shoe companies and six sporting goods companies but none of his meetings resulted in a deal finally venture capitalist patrick f hamner offered funding heelys was incorporated in may and had an initial public offering in dec the company now has a market capitalization of &# million not everyone is high on heelys there have been reports of users having serious accidents while wearing them world against toys causing harm inc a boston watchdog group placed heelys on its annual " worst toys" list in saying the wheeled shoes could lead to injuries "safety is heelys top priority and so its important to recognize that our wheeled footwear is sporting equipment and not a toy " heelys chief executive mike staffaroni said in a statement "like any other recreational sport wheeled footwear should be used with the appropriate gear " mr adams says he has happily ceded the managerial aspects of heelys to others he considers himself the companys "chief tinkerer" and maintains a work space at heelys that he calls the "lunatic lab" where he works on inventing products "for me innovation isnt a team sport or something thats done by proxy " he says "its a personal obsession "
