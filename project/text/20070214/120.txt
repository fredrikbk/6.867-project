tax plan aims to show prices of stock buys seeking to raise government revenues without raising taxes a bipartisan group of lawmakers will join president bush today in supporting a plan to require securities brokers mutual funds and others to report the original purchase price that an investor paid for stocks bonds and other securities and thus cut down on underreporting of capital gains the proposal to be introduced in the house and senate aims to help close the "tax gap" the difference between what the government collects in revenue each year and what it believes it is entitled to collect internal revenue service researchers estimate the gap at about &# billion a year and lawmakers as well as mr bush would like to tap into that money to help pay for other priorities members of congress and the bush administration both say investors either intentionally or not often underreport the amount of money they make when they sell a stock by misstating the original purchase price both mr bushs plan and the proposed legislation would seek to correct that by requiring brokerage firms and others to track the purchase price and when an investor sells a stock bond or mutual fund report the "adjusted cost basis" to the taxpayer and the irs the adjusted cost basis factors in the purchase and sale price plus any intervening corporate action that affects value such as reinvested dividends stock splits or mergers mr bushs budget assumes the change if enacted would bring in about &# billion over years while the lawmakers assume about &# billion the legislation which is being lead by sens evan bayh d ind and tom coburn r okla and reps rahm emanuel d ill and walter jones r n c is similar to a bill introduced by mr bayh last year that never made it out of congress democrats now control congress so the legislation is seen as having a better chance of success the proposal could run into resistance from brokerage firms and others in the securities industry which complained in the past about the amount of paperwork required in tracking purchase prices
