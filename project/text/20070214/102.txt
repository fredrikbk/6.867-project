politics &amp economics can romney appeal to base republican quest starts with former governor forced on defensive des moines iowa former massachusetts gov mitt romney formally launched his presidential quest in an awkward position on the defensive to social conservatives who will play a big role determining the republican party nominee he is suspect for his prior stances on abortion and gay rights among the broader electorate overwhelmingly opposed to the iraq war he faces questions about his support for president bushs handling of the conflict one consolation for mr romney the same challenges confront his main rivals arizona sen john mccain and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani this double threat of a dispirited party base and more broadly an alienated electorate suggests why many republicans approach the presidential contest with pessimism while democrats likewise face a costly fight to pick a nominee their pack of candidates appears generally agreed on the main issues including opposition to the war and the partys voters are energized to seize the white house after taking control of congress in last falls midterm elections "a lot can change in two years but right now its going to be a tough uphill battle for any republican " said former longtime iowa gov terry branstad he along with former republican gov robert ray attended mr romneys rally at iowas state fairgrounds yesterday though they havent endorsed anyone mr romney nonetheless exuded optimism on his first official day as a candidate after a campaign buildup of more than a year he began with a morning announcement in michigan which holds an early presidential primary mr romney grew up in the state and his late father george was governor then he headed here to iowa before returning to michigan for a fund raiser today his announcement tour continues in two states with the earliest nominating contests south carolina and new hampshire ending with a rally tomorrow back home in boston the year old mr romney who recently finished one term as governor of heavily democratic massachusetts cited his record there in business and as the leader who rescued the winter olympics in salt lake city after an ethics scandal "if ever there was a time when innovation and transformation were needed in government it is now " he said mr romney said the site of his announcement the henry ford museum in dearborn was chosen to illustrate american innovation his audiences there and later in iowa numbered several hundred in contrast with the thousands at events for democratic sens hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois despite republicans election defeat in november mr romney said "weve lost faith in government not in just one party " like mr obama at his own candidacy announcement over the weekend mr romney depicted himself as a washington outsider poised to lead a generational movement for change even using the same word transformation repeatedly "i do not believe washington can be transformed from within by lifelong politicians " he said for months mr romney has struggled to persuade conservatives that he opposes abortion and gay rights despite videotaped comments to the contrary from his past campaigns in more liberal massachusetts yesterday he struck the notes that christian conservatives listen for "i believe in god " said mr romney whose mormon faith is a problem for some evangelical christians who are uneasy with the religion because mormons follow not only the bibles teachings but the book of mormon "i believe in the sanctity of human life " he added judges shouldnt make law said mr romney who as governor went to court to fight a massachusetts supreme court decision legalizing gay marriage he emphasized family prominent at the announcement were his wife of years ann five sons their wives and grandchildren mr giuliani has a tougher challenge than mr romney with social conservatives given his past advocacy of civil unions for gay couples and abortion rights mr mccain though he has an antiabortion voting record remains anathema to many christian conservatives for his disparaging comments during his presidential campaign for his opposition to a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and for the campaign finance limits he passed into law which some conservative groups say infringe on political free speech two other republicans kansas sen sam brownback and former arkansas gov mike huckabee offer socially conservative records but many republicans say neither could beat the democrat they most fear mrs clinton "what i keep hearing is that the value voters must pick a candidate that can beat hillary " says phil burress a christian conservative leader based in ohio while mr giuliani or sen mccain are cited as potentially best able to prevail in a general election he said "the value voters will not work for or support either of those candidates even romney is hanging by a thread " on the war mr romney nodded to "our desire to bring our troops home " but he warned that the consequences of leaving now could be "all out civil war" in iraq and a destabilized mideast that would drag the u s in deeper yet he also seemed to condition his support for mr bushs proposed troop "surge" on signs of progress "so long as there is a reasonable prospect of success " he said "our wisest course is to seek stability in iraq with additional troops to secure the civilian population "
