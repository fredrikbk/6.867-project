shifting down in humbling overhaul chrysler faces big cuts may lose jobs as trucks suvs slump sharing with mercedes with a painful restructuring slated for today chrysler becomes the last of the detroit big three to abandon hope of growing its way out of problems now it has a humbler goal making money daimlerchrysler ag is set to announce that it plans to cut some jobs and close factories at its chrysler group unit in the u s the retrenchment by the company that not long ago claimed to have risen above the problems plaguing general motors corp and ford motor co highlights the challenges unionized u s auto makers face its also a setback for daimlerchrysler chief dieter zetsche who got his job in large part because of his apparent success at turning around chrysler after a profit collapse in one striking feature of chryslers latest plan the company is turning away from the big pickups and sport utility vehicles that powered its profits in the past gm and ford which also rely heavily on those models are putting similar effort into more fuel efficient vehicles chasing a shift in consumer tastes driven by high gasoline prices chrysler is expected to close a sport utility vehicle assembly plant in newark del and possibly another truck factory near st louis daimlerchrysler will again push to cut costs by making its chrysler and mercedes units cooperate more the next generation jeep grand cherokee and mercedes m class could ride on similar foundations but many on the mercedes side fear working too closely with chrysler will hurt the luxury brands sales by sullying its image analysts believe chrysler will take a significant restructuring charge and report an operating loss when daimlerchrysler reports its fourth quarter earnings today most also believe problems will linger throughout the year adam jonas automotive analyst with morgan stanley said he expects chrysler to lose money in the first quarter and to have an operating loss of more than &# billion for excluding restructuring charges following an operating loss in believed to have topped &# billion mr zetsche had once vowed chrysler would see a sharp increase in sales to about million vehicles a year by from million in now chrysler group chief executive tom lasorda says hes willing to accept lower sales as long as dealers and the company are making money sales in were more than million vehicles chryslers restructuring could be the last chance mr zetsche gets to prove the wisdom behind the daimlerchrysler merger which sparked a flurry of deals and partnerships in the auto industry mr zetsches predecessor juergen schrempp once promised the combination of mercedes luxury cars and stylish chrysler designs for the mass market would create the worlds most profitable auto maker the merged company has fallen far short of that goal and its market value has plunged thanks to chryslers repeated breakdowns and more recently a rough patch for mercedes an increasingly vocal group of shareholders is calling on mr zetsche to dump chrysler "i believe it would be reasonable to break these two companies up if its possible at a low price " says juergen meyer a fund manager in frankfurt for swedens seb asset management which owns roughly million daimlerchrysler shares representing less than of daimlerchryslers value last october chief financial officer bodo uebber repeatedly sidestepped questions about the idea during a conference call with analysts and reporters daimlerchrysler later issued a written statement denying any intention to sell chrysler and such a move isnt considered imminent chrysler has workers including more than hourly workers it also has assembly plants and component and stamping plants in north america it isnt clear how it will eliminate the jobs but one option is offering buyouts to workers both gm and ford did so last year chryslers cuts would push to more than the number of hourly and salaried jobs shed by detroits big three since late all three detroit makers are in the throes of a historic restructuring hoping they can return to steady profitability by clearing away unneeded workers and unpopular models but shrinkage doesnt solve some of their core problems such as higher labor costs and weaker brand images compared with overseas based rivals as they try to cover pension and health costs the big three are constantly tempted to overproduce big cars that consumers may not want even as toyota motor corp and others make big profits with more diverse lineups in a sign that gm has yet to throw its past aside it announced yesterday that it will bring back financing deals a fire sale tactic executives had hoped to avoid after rolling out a new pricing strategy last year gm had weaker than forecast january sales and is under pressure to prove its new crop of models can sell when mr schrempp announced the merger of daimler benz and chrysler in may chrysler was highly profitable and enjoying one of the many booms that so often in its long history have been followed by busts in a new line of redesigned minivans flopped and piled up unsold at dealerships chrysler reported a &# billion quarterly loss the american running chrysler was ousted and mr zetsche was sent to detroit he was stunned by what he found mass inefficiencies runaway expenses a drab product line and few new models in the pipeline his prescription first shrink chrysler and then launch a barrage of new vehicles to lift sales and revenue over two years he cut jobs and closed six plants he slashed the development budget and challenged chrysler engineers to "do more with less" by using one set of basic components to create three or four different vehicles designers were urged to create bold eye catching vehicles without going overboard on costs an approach he called "disciplined pizzazz " a key piece of the strategy called for chrysler to introduce new dodge and chrysler suvs expand jeeps three model lineup and add variants of the dodge ram pickup at the time it seemed like a wise move pickups and suvs are big profit makers and few imagined gasoline prices would spike to &# a gallon mr zetsche also leveraged his connections at mercedes cajoling old colleagues at the luxury brand to lend engineering expertise to develop rear wheel drive sedans for the chrysler and dodge nameplates chrysler and mercedes were also supposed to cut costs by sharing some parts such as oxygen sensors sharing whole platforms between the two divisions remained taboo the re expansion of chrysler got off to a rough start caught off guard by rapidly rising rebates and incentives the company lost &# billion in the second quarter of mr zetsche took a big writeoff to cover the losses on discounts to move out the excess inventory but by chrysler gained its footing making a small profit the following year the first of its mercedes influenced rear wheel drive vehicles the chrysler became a smash hit with gasoline well under &# a gallon customers flocked to a version equipped with chryslers hemi v engine which added &# or more to the cars margin profits soared and in july mr zetsche got a big reward he was designated mr schrempps successor as daimlerchrysler ceo across the industry he was hailed for having found a way to make a detroit auto maker thrive in chrysler pulled off a feat neither gm nor ford could match it made money and gained market share mr zetsche and other chrysler executives pushed the idea that chrysler was no longer part of detroits big three "the general public still thinks of gm ford and chrysler as part of one group " mr zetsche told reporters in las vegas late in "i want to stop this tainted picture customers want to be associated with winners not losers it is hurting us " by the time mr zetsche took over the top job in january it even appeared his main challenge would be eliminating waste back in germany in fact chrysler turned out to be the bigger headache when gasoline prices spiked in late after hurricane katrina chrysler was poorly positioned because trucks suvs and minivans account for of its vehicle sales one highly anticipated suv the jeep commander bombed chrysler began piling up vehicles that had been built without any orders from dealers an eerie reprise of the practices that led to the companys near collapse in the late s and federal bailout in a huge stock of unsold vehicles sat outside its factories thousands more had to be parked at the detroit airport they were also visible on daimlerchryslers balance sheet in the fourth quarter of the value of the companys finished goods suddenly jumped to &# billion from &# billion while mr zetsche handled mercedess problems and other european crises such as political pressure over daimlerchryslers plan to sell part of its stake in airbus parent eads chrysler was left in the hands of mr lasorda a manufacturing expert with little hands on experience in marketing and sales although dealers were jammed with unsold cars chrysler kept its plants running mr zetsche remained upbeat about the u s division and persuaded of the logic behind the merger in the summer in a bid to clear out its inventory chrysler offered deep employee pricing discounts and started an advertising campaign featuring mr zetsche as "dr z " the effort fizzled in july chrysler fell units short of its retail sales goal "we lost money building inventory and then we lost money trying to get rid of it it was a tough lesson " mr lasorda said in an interview earlier this month by september it was clear chryslers whole strategy the one mr zetsche had implemented during his time in detroit would have to be rebooted in a conference call he warned that chrysler would suffer a &# billion operating loss in the third quarter and slash production for the remainder of the year shortly thereafter mr zetsche sent his top aide at mercedes rainer schmuckle to help mr lasorda cut costs over several weeks they met with chrysler suppliers toured its north american factories and scoured the divisions parts lists looking to shave an average of &# in costs from each new model their tour also highlighted two plants with excess capacity the newark del facility with workers makes the chrysler aspen one of the new suvs that were supposed to help boost sales as well as the dodge durango sales are so slow that the plant only runs for one eight hour shift a day normally auto plants have to run at least two shifts to make money the other is the st louis north plant where the regular dodge ram and heavy duty version are made the plant which employs about workers didnt start its work this year until feb due to slack demand and employees have been told that there will be more down time this year said dan corpuz financial secretary treasurer of united auto workers local which represents workers at the plant chrysler recently laid off people there "we dont have enough orders to keep the workers going " mr corpuz said "so people are nervous " also vulnerable are two detroit engine plants known as mack i and ii where production fell by in because of lack of demand for vehicles like the jeep commander jeep grand cherokee jeep liberty dodge dakota dodge durango and dodge ram already workers have been let go from the mack i plant which produces v engines meanwhile the german executives and mr lasorda hope to get more help from mercedes even mr meyer the fund manager who suggests a breakup says thats a good idea for now because it would be difficult to sell or spin off the u s unit "who would be willing to take over chrysler " he says porsche ags cayenne sport utility vehicle has generally been a success for the sports car maker even though it shares the underpinnings of volkswagen ags more mass market touareg suv such "platform sharing" between jeep and mercedes could help chrysler cut costs however platform sharing carries risks a few years ago fords jaguar unit used the guts of a ford model sold in europe to create a &# sedan called the x type but consumers havent taken it seriously as a luxury car and sales have flopped "theres a lot of fear" inside mercedes says one person familiar with the divisions internal operations "theyre afraid people will buy a cherokee and not a mercedes " mercedess archrival bmw ag pointedly markets itself as a "pure" luxury car maker
