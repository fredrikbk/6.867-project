danish biotech industry is poised for solid growth copenhagen denmarks biotechnology sector is expected to expand strongly this year as big pharmaceutical firms seek drugs to fill their new product pipelines analysts predict a flurry of activity in the sector after partnership deals between glaxosmithkline plc and denmarks genmab a s in december and between schering plough corp and alk abello a s in january those deals have highlighted the positive outlook for the industry on the copenhagen stock exchange the sector has risen about since february while the stoxx health care index a europe wide index of health care companies has gained in the same period " will be a good year for danish biotechnology again mostly driven by partnership deals and speculation of partnership deals " said anette rye larsen an analyst at brokerage gudme raaschou in copenhagen faced with rising drug development costs and increased competition from generic drug makers as drug patents expire global pharmaceutical companies are turning to small firms in biotechnology for new products danish companies are particularly appealing because compared with many other european biotechnology firms they are bigger better established and more specialized in certain areas such as central nervous system research says peter abelin portfolio manager at swedbank robur in stockholm swedbank robur has investments in neurosearch a s curalogic a s and bavarian nordic a s as well as genmab and alk abello the danish biotechnology sector is still developing however in comparison to the large u s biotech market where several companies have developed into full fledged pharmaceutical firms that can produce and market their own drugs ms rye larsen said the benefits of partnership deals can be substantial for biotech companies genmabs partnership deal with gsk for its blood cancer drug humax cd is valued potentially at &# billion depending on the success of clinical developments and future sales while alk abellos deal with schering plough for grass allergy vaccine grazax is valued at as much as &# million partnership deals usually give the buyer the right to develop market and distribute a drug in return for an upfront license fee milestone payments depending on the clinical development of the drug and royalties from sales neurosearch shares have risen about since mid december when the company said it was in talks with potential partners for its obesity drug tesofensine it expects to sign a deal within the first quarter and analysts estimate the drug could reach annual sales of between billion and billion danish kroner &# billion to &# billion "obesity is a potentially huge market but right now its a market that needs to be developed " said ms rye larsen she notes that a lack of government reimbursement programs for patients using obesity drugs can hold back sales neurosearch has also indicated that tesofensine may be used to treat other medical conditions such as depression and a partnership covering all potential treatment areas could be very big she added however there havent yet been any clinical trials investigating the use of tesofensine against depression neurosearch spokeswoman hanne leth hillman said curalogic which makes oral allergy vaccines similar to alk abellos hopes to sign a partnership agreement for its vaccine in the first quarter of chief executive peter moldt said shares of bavarian nordic have risen since u s authorities dropped rival acambis plc in november in a competition for a large u s contract for smallpox vaccines j p morgan estimates that astrazeneca plc glaxosmithkline and sanofi aventis sa will be the european companies most affected by patent expirations between and but that even more companies will be hit from in the u s pfizer inc will see its patent on the blockbuster anticholesterol drug lipitor which generates annual sales of about &# billion expire in four years of course investing in small companies and cutting edge technology is risky pharmexa said in august it was ending clinical research on a breast cancer vaccine its shares fell close to and have only recovered about since investors are now watching the outcome of phase iii trials for pancreatic cancer vaccine gv for which the company hopes to sign a partnership deal soon overall only about of all phase i drugs and to of phase ii drugs reach the market among drugs in phase iii research risks are lower but even so only about make it to market phase i clinical trials investigate the safety of a new drug in a small number of people while phase ii trials evaluate the efficiency of the drug in treating a specific condition if successful in these stages a larger efficiency phase iii trial is launched florian schoenharting co founder and partner at venture capital firm nordic biotech estimates the success rate for phase i projects among danish biotech companies has historically been closer to or well above the typical average nordic biotech has investments in seven of the regions biotechnology companies five of which are danish mr schoenharting founded genmab and has invested in andbeen part of initiating the listing of several other biotechnology companies in denmark including curalogic neurosearch bavarian nordic pharmexa and most recently lifecycle pharma a s danish biotechnology firms have historically based their research on specific markets and less on risky new science projects mr schoenharting says denmark also provides a favorable climate for small businesses "its easy to start and close a company and easy to hire and fire theres also the advantage of an established pharmaceutical industry in denmark " he says pointing to novo a s a major shareholder in novo nordiska s novo has venture capital holdings in more than small pharmaceutical and biotech firms including danish companies looking ahead the climate for danish biotech could improve further if a new government proposal to cut taxes paid on patent royalties is introduced as planned on april the proposal will be discussed in parliament before the end of march
