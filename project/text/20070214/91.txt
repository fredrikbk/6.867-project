conversation to hold on the phone this is something well need to discuss in person " that is why when things werent working out recently with a man she was dating she assumed it required one of those uncomfortable face to face talks before she could arrange it however the man sent her a cellphone text message "chek yr email " so she did his email read "this is getting too serious i think we should stop seeing each other if we could still be friends it would make me real happy " floored by the fact that she was being dumped by email ms olsen ignored him a few hours later he sent another text

almost one in cellphone users age to have "texted" someone out of their romantic lives according to a survey released this week by virgin mobile usa that stat doesnt even include emailed kiss offs yes the lack of face to face contact can avoid prickly encounters and get the deed done without bloodshed but as we contemplate valentines day it also is an indication that interpersonal relationships

organization in boston "there need to be new rules " tour the internet and you will find tens of thousands of breakup tales some are on sites such as dontdatehimgirl com or ihateher com many others are posted on peoples personal blogs "after we broke up jerk faced liar admitted lying to me " "i fell back on friends to console me the day after the breakup one said in the snottiest possible voice sorry you guys broke up but if you make us choose between you and him well choose him " "lolololol god im glad i broke up with her " "he kissed my worst enemy i forgave him he called me ugly so many times i forgave him " "i hate him for betraying me and treating me like the sniveling needy spineless person i am " this trend in public revelations "may feel cathartic but its inappropriate " says
