how good are zillows estimates popular home price web site often gets it right but can be way off the mark we find in the year since its launch zillow inc has made millions of americans familiar with computer generated estimates of home values created a new online addiction and become a staple of dinner party chatter but just how accurate is it a wall street journal analysis of recent home sales shows that zillows "zestimates" often are very good frequently within a few percentage points of the actual price paid but when zillow is bad it can be terrible off the mark by more than on one in homes in one case it was off by &# million zillow based in seattle operates a web site that offers free estimates and other online tools for real estate buyers and sellers it draws revenue from online advertising the journal looked at transaction prices recorded for recent home sales in seven states using data from first american real estate solutions a data provider in santa ana calif and compared those prices with zillow estimates which didnt yet reflect the sales the median difference between the zillow estimate and the actual price was that was close to the median "margin of error" reported by zillow itself on all transactions involving homes whose value it has estimated the estimates were about equally split between ones that were too high and those below the mark zillow came within of the price in a third of the transactions studied by the journal it was more than off target on of them in of the transactions zillow was off by more than zillow had estimated that a four bedroom square foot home in fall city wash was valued at &# the home built last year sold in early january for &# million "if you dont visit the property youre never going to know that its in an exclusive gated part of the neighborhood " says maria danieli who represented the sellers ms danieli says zillow may be fine for "cookie cutter" neighborhoods but "they cant compute" the values of the luxury homes she sells zillow executives acknowledge that the estimates can be way off in some cases the estimate "is a starting point" for people trying to figure out how much a home should cost says amy bohutinsky a spokeswoman for the company "we dont recommend it as the final word " sometimes the estimates take big lurches in brief periods as zillows computer analyzes the latest home sales data updated weekly "my god " said jonathan miller after he looked up his own house in darien conn on zillow last week "my value has dropped in six months theres no way that would be the market collapsing " zillow has the house pegged at &# down from about &# million last july mr miller chief executive officer of miller samuel an appraisal firm based in new york watches his local market closely and figures his home is valued at around &# million zillow can be quite accurate in some markets mr miller says but he argues that the estimates are hit or miss he suggests that zillow should produce only an estimated price range rather than an exact figure "when you go down to the &# level youre implying precision " ms bohutinsky the zillow spokeswoman notes that zillow produces both a range and a precise estimate and says users like both zillow also missed the target for josh benton a management consultant at kurt salmon associates in atlanta he sold a home last fall for about more than zillows estimate still mr benton says he found zillow useful for getting a sense of the relative value of houses in a neighborhood and he liked the sites aerial views of neighborhoods as a research aid "overall its an excellent site " he says zillows estimates come from a proprietary computer program that takes into account sale prices for nearby homes that appear comparable the size and other physical attributes of the home its past sales history and tax assessment data says stan humphries vice president of data and analytics zillow tends to work best for midrange homes in areas where there are a lot of comparable houses he says it is less accurate for low and high end homes because there are fewer of those and thus less data available from comparable sales known as "comps " values of rural homes are hard to gauge for the same reason partly for that reason none of the web sites can offer coverage of u s homes zillow says it has estimates on about of all homes even where there are numerous apparent "comps " computer programs like zillows can stumble when vital information is missing data fed into the computer for instance may not reflect the fact that a house has just been remodeled destroyed by fire or put into foreclosure reported prices can be misleading too sometimes homes are sold between family members for a token price or sellers offer incentives to buyers such as help with closing costs that arent reflected in the recorded price zillow isnt the only site offering such free estimates others include realestate com realestateabc com and reply com but zillows site gets more traffic than those rivals all of these sites appear to have overestimated the value of a house on olivant street in a tough area of pittsburgh that sold for &# last year in an auction of foreclosed homes as of early this month zillow estimated the value at about &# realestate com at &# reply com at &# and realestateabc com at &# several nearby houses are abandoned or boarded up blighting the block something computer models dont take into account zillow lets users try to correct for things computers might miss for instance people can use zillows "my estimator" tool to account for the value of remodeling or to choose what they regard as the most relevant "comps " screening out those that arent really similar homes making estimates is particularly difficult in some areas some states including texas dont provide public records showing housing transaction prices to improve its performance in texas zillow last month began tapping sales data from multiple listing services databases of property for sale through real estate brokers new york city also is a difficult area for zillow and other estimate providers because of the large number of cooperative buildings tax assessments are made on the co op buildings rather than individual units removing one indicator of value and there is less public information on such things as square footage in individual homes zillow says though the company is finding alternative sources for such data real estate agents and appraisers tend to sneer at web site valuations and insist that consumers still need their local expertise to get a true idea of values masood samereie an agent at century hartford properties in san francisco says one of his clients last year lost his chance to buy an attractive home because relying on zillow he made an unrealistically low offer alison van camp contributed to this article
