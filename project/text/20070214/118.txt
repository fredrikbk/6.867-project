real estate finance why investors trust vornado missing out on equity office opens up other opportunities expect a measured approach twice over the past six months vornado realty trust pursued the acquisition of a rival real estate investment trust and came up empty handed but dont look for the new york company to try another flashy deal just to prove it can investors and analysts say they believe vornado will settle back into the role in which it feels most comfortable looking for unique opportunities for real estate investment with reliable returns without taking on much debt the options arent obvious at least if vornado is looking to acquire more office property prices for office buildings in the markets where vornado concentrates new york and washington d c are at record levels making bargains almost impossible to find "i dont really know where they are going to go with their capital " says matthew ostrower a reit analyst with morgan stanley vornado is just as likely to turn its attention to other types of investments vornado joined two private equity partners to take toys "r" us private in july and the same year invested heavily in mcdonalds corp two companies with decidedly different business models from vornados a similar deal such as buying another retailer or some other company with valuable real estate holdings is within the realm of possibility for vornado analysts say whatever vornados next move investors and analysts expect the same opportunistic but measured approach that has characterized chief executive steven roth in the past "i dont think they would do something in a knee jerk reaction " says ross smotrich senior reit analyst for bear stearns "on the other hand the way they go about business is by looking out for these kinds of opportunities and they are not afraid to pursue them " indeed vornado chased a big fish and a whale simultaneously last year in july vornado bid for reckson associates realty corp of uniondale n y but eventually lost out to another reit at the same time vornado was discussing a possible merger with equity office properties trust the nations largest office landlord founded by real estate legend sam zell but eventually discussions fell apart and equity office announced in november it was being acquired by private equity giant blackstone group for &# a share in january vornado made another run at equity office with a higher bid a bidding war ensued and vornado went as high as &# a share in cash and stock before bowing out blackstone won the support of equity offices board with an all cash offer of &# and closed the &# billion deal including debt friday yet the market wasnt disappointed vornado stock jumped the day the company gave up vornado shares rose &# or to &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday after coming within a breath of winning equity office most any deal mr roth and president michael fascitelli conceive of is presumably within reach christopher haley a reit analyst with wachovia capital markets estimates vornados available cash and liquidity at more than &# billion vornado executives declined to comment vornados recent purchase of park avenue in manhattan at about &# per square foot or a first year yield below shows that the company is more comfortable with current market prices than some analysts might have guessed still prices keep getting steeper as part of its closing on the equity office deal blackstone arranged for the new york portfolio save for avenue of the americas to be sold simultaneously to macklowe properties for &# billion or &# a square foot a price that mr haley described as "unbelievable " vornado doesnt have to make big moves to keep shareholders happy simply completing the varied and significant development projects it has planned should pay off handsomely perhaps the most important of these are vornados plans with its partner related cos to remake the madison square garden arena and the penn station commuter hub opening up the possibility to build millions of square feet of retail and office space david greenbaum a vornado executive vice president recently told a shareholder group that he expected the public approval process on these plans to begin in the next months also real estate services firm grubb &amp ellis co recently reported that vornado plans to replace the nearby hotel pennsylvania with a million square foot office tower that will include five trading floors to be sure mr roth isnt king midas the companys investment in gmh communities trust a student and military housing company while initially successful hit what mr roth called a "speed bump" in the public markets making it a less attractive investment than other alternatives yet investors are willing to overlook missteps from a company that has delivered average total returns of over the past five years says dean frankel domestic portfolio manager of urdang securities management a vornado shareholder "i as an investor expect them to do what theyve always done which is go make good deals "
