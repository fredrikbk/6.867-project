fewer crashes may have lulled airline insurers price war in premiums raises financial stakes if a disaster should hit airlines are benefiting from a price war in the big ticket business of insuring themselves against crashes the competition results from some good news over the past half decade there hasnt been a major disaster that led to large insurance claims since american airlines flight crashed in queens new york city in late an unusually long stretch since then claims have fallen roughly according to ascend a consulting firm to the aviation industry in london the handful of major accidents in recent years happened in places where insurers pay much less for loss of life than in europe and the u s that falloff of big claims has made selling airline insurance look increasingly attractive drawing many competitors and pushing down prices last year alone at least insurers entered this specialized business since insurance premiums have fallen by half according to ascend while safety and lower costs are great news for the airlines and the people who fly on them the situation is a mixed blessing for insurers the relatively long stretch of low claims might have lulled underwriters into a false sense of security and what may be an ill advised price battle the price cuts are raising the financial stakes of future accidents for insurance companies aviation insurance brokers and industry analysts are warning that premiums have fallen too far and any future disaster could cause premiums to rise among the big players are aviation focused units of berkshire hathaway inc s general reinsurance co like u s aviation underwriters inc an underwriter at the firms new york headquarters wasnt available for comment a general re spokesman didnt return calls for comment another large player is american international group inc of new york aig is picking carefully among the shrinking number of commercial aviation risks that are priced attractively says spokesman chris winans "there are pockets of the commercial aviation market that have become increasingly competitive" since the rate increases that followed the sept terror attacks he says much of that competition is the result of low claims he notes but it isnt clear if improved safety records are necessarily a sign of more lower claims in the future "the big question is are rates falling because the skies are that much safer we really dont know yet " insurers have deep pockets and nobody is suggesting insurers couldnt cover the costs of a disaster they are backed by huge piles of capital to underwrite policies like these that pile of capital is actually growing due to the influx of new insurers into the business but at the same time premiums are falling the cost of even minor incidents is rising quickly that is partly because new aircraft are more sophisticated and cost more to repair than older models payouts for fatalities in air crashes also have jumped as the value attached to each human life lost in much of the world has risen quickly a major catastrophic accident today could cost insurers about &# billion last year the insurance industry paid some &# billion in claims ascend estimated for carriers many of which are still struggling financially any spike in insurance rates could be trouble after the terrorist attacks of sept for example airline insurance rates world wide rose fourfold industry officials say even though the u s and other governments intervened to allay the cost of terrorism coverage such broad price increases are common after a major loss and can take a bite out of airlines often skimpy profits "if airline a has a catastrophe airline b in another part of the world is going to see its insurance rates go up " said gehan talwatte managing director of ascend which recently completed a study of the issue and concluded that premiums "are running dangerously low " for now carriers are benefiting from declining insurance rates insurance premiums generally account for less than of airlines costs a trifle compared with fuel or labor but even strong airlines post net profit margins of only a few percent of revenue were insurance premiums to double this year if a major catastrophe struck it could erase the global airline industrys projected profits a premium increase also would create uncertainty in airlines financial planning damaging their efforts to increase the predictability of their expenses many carriers are now willing to pay extra for aircraft leases for instance and for special investment strategies that protect them against fluctuating prices for fuel one of the industrys biggest expenses "the unpredictable bounce effect is always a concern " said steve doyle who runs the airline practice at aon corp a major airline insurance broker declining premiums in aviation are a microcosm of global "softening" in the cost of some types of property coverage thanks to a virtual absence of large disaster claims last year property casualty insurers over the next few weeks are expected to report their best annual underwriting results since the s according to the insurance information institute a trade group based in new york many insurers and industry watchers fear these results presage the bust portion of the insurance industrys boom and bust pricing cycle the major insurance brokerages reported last month that in the fourth quarter policy renewal period aviation industry premiums fell from says aons mr doyle to below &# billion from more than &# billion the drop worries some underwriters axis capital
