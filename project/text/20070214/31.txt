and adding a twist a country club complete with swimming pools a boating lake and a big italian restaurant san diego hills which is based on the renowned forest lawn cemetery in glendale calif is billed by its developers indonesias lippo group as the worlds first cemetery with recreational facilities "we wanted to create something pleasant " says viven sitiabudi president director of p t lippo karawaci the lippo group unit developing the project "families should look at visiting their loved ones as a happy occasion rather than with dread " as southeast asias middle class grows american inspired real estate developments have captured the imagination of local property companies mammoth malls multi screen cineplexes posh gated communities and satellite towns are becoming popular bouyed by low interest rates and to annual economic growth in much of southeast asia singapore is even copying las vegas with two huge new u s style casino resort complexes on the drawing board including one to be developed by las vegas sands corp but as san diego hills shows asian developers can sometimes outdo their american role models in glitz and kitsch theres vivo city in singapore which features shops and restaurants a park with an amphitheatre for concerts spas dance clubs and yellow uniformed concierges that move around on segway electric scooters a ten story mall in kuala lumpur features a roller coaster in its atrium in china developers of luxury residential property are building complexes in the style of english manor houses or french chateaux san diego hills though is perhaps the only of the new developments that can claim to be a true world first the lippo group run by year old banking tycoon mochtar riady saw indonesias middle class balking at putting loved ones to rest in overcrowded government managed cemeteries and sensed a business opportunity the inspiration for indonesias first memorial park came from mr riadys son james a u s educated pal of the clinton administration who paid the largest political fine in american history in for illegally reimbursing campaign contributions to the democratic party a devout christian the younger riady visited forest lawn a few years ago and decided indonesia needed a similar development he hired a philippines born american manuel francisco who had years experience marketing private cemeteries in california to oversee construction of san diego hills but then mr francisco says james riady hit on the idea of expanding to include recreational facilities "he wanted to add an element that was not found in any other cemetery in the world " mr francisco says in the u s some cemeteries offer flower shops cafes and areas for children to play hollywood forever cemetery where old time stars including jayne mansfield and rudolph valentino are buried has developed touch screens telling the life stories of people interred on the grounds the lippo group decided to take san diego hills further theres "lake angeles" for boating swimming pools and a basketball court in addition to an italianate convention center and boutiques there are plans to open a seat luxury italian restaurant among the proposed names monte di dio or gods mountain the chapel will conduct wedding ceremonies as well as funeral services eager to attract islamic clients indonesia is muslim lippo has also built an imposing mosque on the site "were giving families another reason to keep coming back to visit their departed loved ones " mr francisco says "in addition to paying their respects they can be entertained too " with people dying each day jakarta competition for burial space is so fierce that in some cases fresh graves are dug on top of older ones if relatives have failed to keep up "rent" payments due every three years to the city council san diego hills which is promising never to disturb a body once buried is already attracting interest "its beautiful " says elsye phaais who works for the tabita foundation a company that arranges burials in jakarta for its members "its different from existing cemeteries which are something frightening " so far the developer says it has sold plots with a basic package of &# for a space in a public area or almost an average yearly wage in jakarta its only for the countrys elite for premium family plots the price spikes to &# per square meter among the first to be buried there the senior mr riadys parents who emigrated to indonesia in from chinas fuijan province mr riady a publicity shy multi millionaire who own properties in shanghai and hong kong writes in the brochure that visiting his parents in the cemetery where they were initially buried was "an inconvenience and hardship with pickpockets vendors and a sense of insecurity " jimmy sandjaja a year old factory owner recently bought lots for himself and his wife in the christian section of san diego hills "when i saw the riady family was buried in san diego hills i thought theyre doing this with heart " he says "theyll look after it " lippo group is starting out with a small area to test demand but developers have earmarked hectares of rolling tropical countryside for the project about twice the size of a large private cemetery in the u s and equal to the combined land area of jakartas crowded public cemeteries lippo executives say up to one million people could be buried here mr francisco says he is aiming for &# million in sales in the first year but he acknowledges that san diego hills with its mix of death and recreation throws up some unique marketing challenges "we started out by calling it a recreation center " he says of the complex now renamed a family center "but it wasnt too much in line with the solemnity of a cemetery "
