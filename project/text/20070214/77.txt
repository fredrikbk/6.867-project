jack obrien the director of stoppards the coast of utopia charts a wide course new york the director jack obrien has sketched out the first eight chapters of his autobiography working title "a probable apprentice " "it will by my coming of age in samoa " he says "i expect there will be three volumes at least " the scene the lobby of the lincoln center theater a few minutes into a late december preview of "shipwreck " part two of tom stoppards tolstoyan trilogy "the coast of utopia " over which mr obrien is presiding with the olympian strategic authority of tolstoys general kutuzov though with rather greater sociability and panache the cast set sail with "voyage " the first part in october "salvage " the finale opens officially on sunday which will bring the count of opening nights to three but mr obrien has been telling his players all along that the real premiere isnt until feb that will be the first time they tackle "utopia" in a single day as a marathon beginning at a m until then they will still be finding their bearings within his profession mr obrien is a colossus to the public at large hes more like the invisible man directors whose names people know robert wilson julie taymor peter sellars and richard foreman come to mind have signatures not mr obrien "im the antithesis " he agrees "some people say they can be led blindfolded into a production of mine and know that i did it i wish i knew how " regulars at the old globe in san diego where mr obrien has served as artistic director since might offer clues but dont count on it the drama of how and why he landed in california will surely take up several chapters in those projected memoirs judging from his work in new york in the new millennium mr obriens range seems boundless he has mounted the very dissimilar musicals "the full monty" gritty "hairspray" bouncy and "dirty rotten scoundrels" sleek for drama there were mr stoppards brainy elegiac "the invention of love" and shakespeares "henry iv " with kevin kline unforgettable as a falstaff straight off a rembrandt canvas yes there were misses too "imaginary friends " set in hell had mary mccarthy cherry jones squared off against lillian hellman swoosie kurtz for a night of bitchy vaudeville turns its run was short worse was to come "oldest living confederate widow tells all " starring ellen burstyn died on opening night as of december "hairspray" was six years into its broadway run and going strong and for the holidays there was a family treat the new york premiere of "dr seuss how the grinch stole christmas " a staple at the old globe for years in theatrical craft and art mr obriens "grinch" rivals balanchines "nutcracker " technically it is light years ahead for one magical moment snow falls in the auditorium real snowflakes that chill your nose and melt like dew best of all the effect is subtle the touch is light as a youngster mr obrien says he was "always a showoff " in his student years at the university of michigan jack obrien was the guy who sang and danced the male lead in every student musical "but when my hair went " he says "i knew i wouldnt be an actor it was a blessing " actor or no actor the man is a character check out the angular flair of his spectacles ready made for a cartoonists pen it was in in ann arbor that mr obriens destiny caught up with him in the person of ellis rabb actor director true believer in a theatrical romance the world at large had left behind in rabb had founded the association of producing artists known as apa and later as the apa phoenix repertory company the troupe flourished on broadway and on the road until when rabb rang down the curtain on a final production of "hamlet " directed by and starring himself mr obrien served as rabbs assistant for six years and as such also assisted single handedly the apas all star roster of directors which included john houseman eva le gallienne stephen porter and alan schneider "not only did i have to learn to watch in the manner of each director " mr obrien recalls "i had to take notes in accordance with their styles in the process i learned something about how a director shapes the material personally for rabb it would be about theatrics lighting cues porter didnt know or care about that for him it would be about the intellectual thrust of a play checking a show youd never give a le gallienne note to an actor in a houseman production " might mr obrien have a signature after all simply in his enveloping love of theatrical craft "you could stop at love " he replies "i love collaborating i love the egos i absolutely love actors i love their acts of faith im constantly falling in love with the process itself one thing you can never say about a piece of mine is that its lacking in enthusiasm " unlike some other directors mr obrien means it when he says his rehearsals are closed "this has been an issue as long as i can remember " he answered by email after reading my request for a variance "i think the rehearsal space is a safe one for the actors and the director no one not involved should ever be there because a the actors begin to act no matter what else you tell them and its always too early and b your observation of my invisibility is very much the point i need to always keep it that way " how about quizzing the actors "sure " mr obrien said "knock yourself out " every utopian approached for this story praised him without reserve more telling than the praise as such though were the specifics about the way he works this from brian f obyrne who plays the mammoth part of alexander herzen so called father of russian socialism "jack definitely leads from the front he plays on a large canvas in a way i havent witnessed with anybody else leaving it to us to find our way though he also gives a lot of guidance and hes quite incredible with this horrid space almost like a choreographer people dont know what a skill it is to direct that much traffic " billy crudup is seen as the squirrelly literary critic vissarion belinsky "its the sort of part i first started acting in college and that i always gravitated towards but since i started working professionally more often than not ive been offered leading man roles roles that come less naturally to me jack totally got it intuitively that it was a part id like to do in fact the only part i would have wanted " ethan hawke appears as the aristocratic mikhail bakunin shameless sponge and charismatic trouble maker "jacks got one of the brightest sharpest fiercest minds ive ever come across and yet hes not an intellectual stoppard is such a heady heady playwright jack comes from the heart if the director played the same notes as the playwright it would be all cake on cake " mr obrien puts it another way "dont double in brass " david harbour takes a different role in each show one of them requiring lavish whiskers and a stagy german accent was giving him real trouble for a while "when im having difficulty i tend to spin off into psychology into business jack brought me back to the simple narrative i never trust that but he told me to and i did and it worked " another with three roles to juggle is richard easton a friend of mr obriens for four decades and counting who in took direction from mr obrien in "cock a doodle dandy " his first full fledged broadway directing job "actors trust jack so do designers and other technical people hes always practical whatever it is he knows how to do it but he doesnt want to do it himself hes funny so theres always lots of energy in the room hes sentimental and he cries a lot hes thoughtful when rehearsals start he basically sits and listens and watches he has the confidence that whatever happens he can deal with it he uses what you bring he never thwarts you hes not in competition with anyone hes working with which is more unusual than you think " after one play spread out over three plays what do you do for an encore why cross the plaza for your metropolitan opera debut with "il trittico " giacomo puccinis "triptych" of three operas that add up to one opening april when joseph volpe the mets former general manager offered him the job mr obrien said he should be hiring three directors luchino visconti for the kitchen sink shocker "il tabarro" the coat robert wilson for the torture the heroine tear jerker "suor angelica" sister angelica billy wilder for the slapstick chaser "gianni schicchi " "and luckily " mr obrien informed him "youve hired all three " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on the arts and philanthropy correction yesterdays profile of theater director jack obrien incorrectly implied that he directed "oldest living confederate widow tells all " wsj feb
