old faithful most americans these days agree that couples should stay together only so long as both parties love each other that should you fall deeply and irretrievably in love with someone else you owe it to yourself to follow your heart that you shouldnt remain in an unhappy union purely for the sake of the children marriage the thinking goes should entail joy and mutual self fulfillment yet theres a hitch so to speak when characters in film or fiction act on these precepts the audience usually disapproves why is that in our private lives we consider it our right to leave even long term relationships if were miserable with imaginary people we apply the stricter fustier mores of the s so deep down might americans still prize loyalty over the pursuit of happiness screenwriters and novelists get around this retro rule of thumb by stacking the deck if a character who walks out on a marriage is to remain sympathetic the abandoned spouse must be blighted with grave flaws alcoholism a history of domestic violence sexual unfaithfulness etc lost enthrallment simply wont cut it wont protect your character from an audiences judgment that the deserting party is treacherous flighty or superficial for instance kate winslet is nominated for a best actress oscar for her role in "little children " in which she plays a housewife who falls for a househusband when they bring their kids to the same playground justifying their infidelity the housewifes husband has grown addicted to internet pornography the househusband has been unmanned by a domineering high flier wife nevertheless after plotting to run away together the lovers pull back from the brink the audience is relieved in staying the marital course the characters retain our sympathy for the deck was not stacked enough porn addiction and an undermining sex role reversal arent so intolerable that we can condone the destruction of two families in jay mcinerneys last novel "the good life " the deck is stacked more heavily the heightened circumstances of create an atmosphere of exception making the main characters passionate extramarital affair more acceptable still both their spouses have been having affairs as well yet ultimately these lovers too pull back from the brink if only for the sake of their children i thought we didnt buy into that nonsense anymore in make believe it seems we still do although ending on a more wistful note than "little children " the novel leaves the impression that by remaining in her marriage the protagonist did the right thing able to compel through sheer spectacle film may more easily succeed than fiction with unsympathetic characters thus more brutal movies about infidelity do not stack the deck in "we dont live here anymore " two couples that are friends as a foursome mix and match in "closer " two characters split from established relationships to form a new pair the excuse for straying in both instances is nothing better than "love " a justification that in fictional scenarios always seems strangely flimsy consider this bit of dialogue from "closer " dan "i fell in love with her alice " alice "oh as if you had no choice theres a moment theres always a moment i can do this i can give in to this or i can resist it " the audience is prone to agree even admiring critics have described the characters in "we dont live here anymore" and "closer" as unattractive with all this pursuit of happiness no one ends up very happy both movies cast the quest for self fulfillment that in real life we supposedly claim as a right as merely the ill fated exercise of chronic dissatisfaction in the classics of course romantic adventurism that bursts the bounds of marriage never works out very well madame bovary was delusional and had terrible tastes in men anna karenina threw herself under a train for a cad but has anything changed arent our sympathies still profoundly old fashioned this is not so minor a matter as sorting out how fiction writers might most slyly manipulate their audiences affections plenty of real relationships break up for no other reason than that one or both parties is "unhappy " or "in love" with someone else yet here in the world we cannot stack our own decks we cant rewrite the role of a partner with whom weve grown dissatisfied in such a way as to make our urge to flee more defensible if your husband isnt conveniently a heroin addict well he simply isnt we may officially embrace the view that a partnership can justifiably be dissolved for reasons of "unhappiness" or "love " yet we are not only the protagonists but the audiences of our own lives thus the same onlookers standards of judgment apply to our private dramas as they do to entertainment when we act trustingly on those ostensibly shared social precepts i began with were often shocked to discover that we dont sympathize with ourselves in my last novel i decided to deal from a straight deck hence i was stuck with the problem of how to make sympathetic a woman who leaves an amicable year relationship with only commonplace failings for "love" that ever dubious pretext should i have succeeded it was by taking on the horrifying experience of "not sympathizing with yourself" full bore for the morally grounded infidelity comes with built in retribution the anguish of reading your own story and instinctively siding with someone else the supreme discomfort of playing the part of a character who in a book or movie you would not like indeed the novel proposes that for anyone with a heart betraying and being betrayed may feel equally awful an apt valentines day reflection then given our high divorce rate we americans are obliged to think of ourselves collectively as less devoted than we once were and perhaps too consumed with individual satisfaction yet the sympathies of audiences in literature and cinema serve as a surprisingly reliable litmus test of a peoples underlying moral gestalt american audiences still do not like cheats philanderers or flibbertigibbets who violate previous commitments for elusory reasons like "love " neither do they approve of promises conditioned on the equally elusory state of "happiness " in this purportedly permissive time we still do not take vows lightly more than bliss we still revere faithfulness depending on your circumstances that enduring elevation of old fashioned loyalty may be a solace or a torture ms shriver is author most recently of "the post birthday world " a novel forthcoming next month from harpercollins
