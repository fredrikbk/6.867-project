common sense mortgage reits yields might be worth the risk smartmoney no doubt youve heard of the "efficient market hypothesis " which posits that at any given time all known information is reflected in a stock price hence its pointless to try to beat the market with superior analysis or information any success is just luck my question is this if the market is so efficient what accounts for the severe market reaction to the "news" that subprime borrowers have been defaulting on their mortgage obligations at a higher than expected rate last week hsbc holdings the big global bank that owns the former household finance a big subprime lender shocked investors when it said it would be taking a &# billion charge for bad loans in its mortgage portfolio more than analysts expected surely this cant have been a surprise for the past several years weve been regaled with stories of ever more creative mortgage strategies especially no interest loans "teaser" loans and loans to people with no credit or bad credit add a cooling real estate market and of course the result is higher mortgage default rates hsbcs disclosure caused its stock to drop this week its trading above &# down from a week high of &# ripple effects spilled out to stocks of other big lenders and to home builders as well as shares of real estate investment trusts that specialize in home lending banks like hsbc flip most of the loans they originate into the secondary market indeed hsbc with benefit of hindsight kept too much of households subprime portfolio but in many cases its the mortgage reits where these loans come to rest last thursday alone shares of home mortgage reits suffered massive market capitalization losses accredited home lenders dropped novastar financial dropped fieldstone investment fell more than and new century financial which also said it would restate results for the first three quarters of dropped more than last thursday and now trades at a third of its high for the year the carnage has continued this week albeit at not quite such a rate if the efficient market hypothesis has any validity an expectation of higher default rates was already built into these prices and most were trading well below their highs for the year its possible the pendulum has now swung too far just as the bond market overreacted two years ago to the downgrades of gm and ford bonds if so there may be some opportunities here at its current price of about &# down from a week high of nearly &# new century yields novastar financial this week trading at about &# was yielding ive been wary of the high yielding mortgage reits for some time mostly because of concern about rising interest rates and potential defaults but id just started to become interested again mostly because i felt all the bad news and expectations would be reflected in current prices obviously that assumption was wrong those kinds of yields seem too good to last but they could come down quite a bit say to the to range and still look attractive clearly only the most risk tolerant should even think about buying these shares and only then after doing further research as for myself im not ready to take the plunge james b stewart a columnist for smart money magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
