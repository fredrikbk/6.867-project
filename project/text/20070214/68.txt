hedge funds beckon small investors as a major private money management firm goes public individuals face alternative choices of varying risk one of the hottest stock offerings of the past year appears to give small investors a backdoor way into hedge funds but there may be better if costlier options for those who hope to diversify their portfolios last week fortress investment group llc which manages hedge funds and private equity funds made its debut on the new york stock exchange allowing anybody with a brokerage account to share in the fortunes of a company that manages money for the ultra rich many industry experts expect similar offerings to follow on friday its first day of trading fortress stock closed at &# nearly above its &# offering price yesterday the stock closed at &# fortress investors of course simply own a piece of a money management company but the offering is one of many recent signs that hedge and private equity funds once reserved for wealthy investors are seeping into the mainstream fund companies such as janus capital group inc and old mutual asset management a unit of old mutual plc are unveiling products that mimic the investment strategies of hedge funds which are private investment pools for wealthy and institutional investors or adding hedge fund like strategies in traditional mutual funds yet such products often have high fees and a number of new offerings are tacking on extra layers of expenses whats more many of the funds lack long term track records and some havent offered the protection from market downturns that investors generally expect from hedge funds none of that has hurt their popularity hedge like mutual funds which typically require minimum investments of just a few thousand dollars held more than &# billion at the end of up from a year earlier according to financial research corp indeed many financial advisers recommend that their clients devote as much as of their portfolios to alternative investments a broad category that includes hedge funds private equity funds real estate and commodities since such investments can behave much differently than stocks or bonds and lower the risk of an overall portfolio all this is happening as regulators seek to sharply curtail access to traditional hedge funds the securities and exchange commission has proposed a rule that would require hedge fund investors to have investment portfolios of at least &# million they are already required to have a net worth of at least &# million or an annual income of at least &# offerings like fortress give investors a piece of the hedge fund action without the high minimums hefty fees and long lockup periods that often come with traditional hedge fund investments wealth management firm contango capital advisors inc is considering using fortress stock as a piece of clients allocation to alternative investments says milton balbuena the firms chief investment strategist fortress "opens up this alternative universe to a wider set of investors " he says but fortress shares are not hedge fund shares and they dont have the same risks and rewards many investors buy hedge funds because they want to diversify their portfolios while hedge funds generally behave differently than stocks and bonds "fortress is going to be an equity when its all said and done " and wont offer the same diversification says david bailin head of alternative investments at wealth management firm u s trust a unit of charles schwab corp since hedge fund management companies tend to generate much of their income from fees that vary depending on the performance of their funds their stock is likely to be quite volatile industry experts say "the risk is that the market prefers steady earnings rather than lumpy or inconsistent earnings" and awards a low valuation to the shares mr bailin says while hedge fund investors are concerned with issues such as the managers track record and fees investors in a hedge fund management firm must also examine the diversification of the firms product offerings and the compensation of top executives a firm that manages different types of funds as fortress does is likely to better withstand the loss of asset and performance based fees if a single fund performs poorly experts say investors should also look for a compensation structure that ties executives interests to shareholders says jeffrey ptak a stock analyst at investment research firm morningstar inc if a firm pays key employees too little it may not attract top talent and if it pays them too much there wont be anything left over for shareholders generally "folks running hedge funds are in this business to be compensated highly " says joel schwab managing director of channel capital group inc which tracks hedge funds another risk since the fortress offering is the first of its kind in the u s theres little information on how the market will value such firms over the long run many hedge like mutual funds on the other hand have a longer track record and recent research suggests they can help investors boost returns without taking on additional risk such funds to be sure represent a vast array of strategies each with its own potential pitfalls some devote substantial assets to "short" positions or bets that a stock will fall a strategy that requires especially strong stock picking and timing a recent study by researchers at georgia state university northeastern university and london business school found that hedge like mutual funds substantially outperform traditional mutual funds though they lag traditional hedge funds by several percentage points a year most types of hedged funds "are significantly less risky than plain old stock mutual funds " says andrew clark head of research for the u s at fund tracker lipper inc a study by lipper published earlier this month found that both hedge funds and hedge like mutual funds generally help protect investors from stock and bond market slides without adding additional risk to the portfolio the study was conducted at the request of absolute investment advisers llc an alternative investment manager and lipper consulting client yet hedge like mutual funds dont always deliver the diversification and insulation from market meltdowns that investors expect from alternative investments the gartmore u s growth leaders long short fund for example lost nearly in the last year of the most recent bear market co manager doug burtnick says the fund should hold up better in future market downturns in the fund was managed by a different firm and pursued a strategy that had a larger exposure to the overall direction of the stock market he says another concern many hedge like mutual funds come with high fees that can take a big bite out of returns the average hedge like fund charges expenses of compared with for the average diversified u s stock fund according to morningstar a number of new funds essentially act like funds of hedge funds a structure that can tack on extra fees the beta hedged strategies fund for example which was launched last year invests in a series of separate accounts pursuing various hedging strategies and charges total expenses of investors must keep close tabs on their funds strategies to determine how much risk theyre taking the quant long short fund for example recently abandoned its traditional strategy in favor of one that allows it to devote to of assets to short positions "theres going to be more volatility associated with this type of strategy" than with a conventional mutual fund says jim johnson the funds co manager private equity funds which aim to buy companies and sell them for big gains are also inspiring offerings geared to smaller investors the powershares listed private equity portfolio an exchange traded fund launched late last year holds companies that invest in or lend money to private businesses a number of special purpose acquisition companies are raising money through public offerings typically using the proceeds to buy private firms meanwhile private equity funds of funds are available to wealthier individuals for minimum investments of roughly &# and up close to the hedge new vehicles are giving small investors exposure to hedge funds and private equity shares of hedge fund management firms may not offer the same benefits as traditional hedge funds some mutual funds using hedging tactics have strong track records but investors should watch for high fees and other potential pitfalls other offerings include a private equity etf and public companies formed to acquire private firms
