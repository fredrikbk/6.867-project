fiscally fit cutting back on cupid clutter her sons classroom celebrations leave terri confronting a deluge of kids toys online edition another valentines day has come and gone and my husband gerry and i say good riddance over the years a day meant to celebrate romance has caused little but trouble between us over gifts given but not received where to start there was the year gerry spent a bundle to send me roses at the office and i called in sick without telling him or the time during a particularly rocky period in our relationship that i spent all day planning a romantic dinner and gerry never showed how about the relentless teasing gerry endured from coworkers the year i sent a valentines day "handyman teddy bear" to his warehouse workplace love makes you do crazy things those memories and some others have put us off the holiday today gerry and i typically have dinner at a nice restaurant sometime later in the week to avoid overpriced valentines day dinner menus this year though weve found another reason to dislike cupid now were getting gift related headaches because of our seven year old son gerald the issue isnt gifts we give him but gifts he and his classmates exchange in addition to handing out valentines day cards kids today often give each other small gifts such as toys pencils or candies last month as i flipped through a party supply catalog that came in the mail i was surprised by the number and variety and cost of "goody bags" for valentines day at what point did valentines day become yet another occasion where we feel obligated to bombard children with gifts they dont need much less appreciate when gerry and i were geralds age valentines day was basically a popularity contest wed scratch our favorite classmates names on cheap paper valentines then toss them into a big box in the classroom the cards were later distributed by the teacher and whoever got the most cards won total cost to our parents less than &# for a set of cards total damage to our self esteem incalculable today most parents avoid hurting childrens feelings by having their kids send cards to all of their classmates but for some parents that isnt enough three years ago when our son was in preschool parents typically gave inexpensive lollipops or some other cheap age appropriate candy with the childrens cards over the years the gifts have grown increasingly larger and more expensive last year in first grade gerald brought home a backpack full of toy cars cartoon character paraphernalia wash off tattoos heart shaped chocolate lollipops and enough sweetarts to keep his dentist busy for a week it reminds me of the escalating gift giving orgy that childrens birthday parties have become last year as geralds birthday approached i wrote about our decision to scale back on birthday celebrations because the gift giving had gotten out of hand and not just gifts for gerald for our sons "cars" themed birthday last year the goody boxes for the kids invited to the party cost about &# each or nearly &# its likely well spend that much or more this year the birthday party circuit has already kicked off and it irks me how much parents are willing to spend to make their goody bag gifts stand out we recently attended a "happy feet" birthday party for a preschooler where each child received a large stuffed penguin that had to cost at least &# and a goody bag i fear valentine days gift giving has begun the same incremental escalation while shopping for cards for geralds classmates over the weekend i watched a woman with two school aged kids put a couple of dozen &# heart shaped candy boxes in her cart maybe im wrong and they werent for her kids classmates but i doubt it its scary to imagine the gift giving arms race taking place in those classrooms i wish parents would take a step back and ask themselves what such excessive gift giving could be doing to their kids and to other children last year my son dumped his backpack full of valentines day gifts on the kitchen table quickly picked out his favorites mostly cars and candy and soon forgot the rest i was disturbed by how little he appreciated the little presents in fact he didnt view them as gifts at all when i called the toys and candies "gifts " he looked at me strangely and said "theyre not gifts mom everyone got one " i argued that they were and urged him to thank everyone in his class the next day the "everyone got one" mentality also upset me most public schools like ours have kids who come from a mix of lower income and well to do households how does a child whose parents cant afford much more than a card feel when he or she is the only one in class who doesnt give gifts my parents had four children and on our income it would have been very difficult for them to afford gifts for our odd classmates next year ill probably end up buying cards and gifts for gerald to give for valentines day in a few years hell be too old to want to exchange cards with all his classmates though that will likely coincide with his desire to exchange cards with at least one of them until that happens ill do what i can to discourage excessive giving this year were going the card with tattoos route &# for kids should kids exchange gifts on valentines day are they being spoiled by too many gift giving celebrations write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about fighting celebration creep write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com many readers responding to last weeks column on gerry quitting smoking said they found it easier to quit for good with the help of nicotine replacement products though others said cold turkey was the only way to go a common theme the key to quitting for good was having their spouses support and replacing the habit with another one exercise read on to hear their stories then join us in a continuing discussion on how to quit smoking i made a similar promise to my wife that at age i would quit after years of smoking i was fortunate to have a client who is a well regarded psychiatrist specializing in addictions we discussed the range of possibilities and he urged me to not set myself up for failure by trying cold turkey instead he told me to use the patch after about seven weeks of gradual reduction of nicotine levels my body was finished with nicotine in fact the nausea let me know when it was time to drop to a lower level patch the oral fixation was another story i ate everything in sight especially chocolate during the seven weeks i put on pounds on top of the id accumulated since id graduated college it was at that point that i changed my life and made diet and exercise part of my lifestyle it took about months to drop the pounds william p seth cpa my wife and i quit smoking together a month after our wedding years ago we quit cold turkey but also participated in a group counseling program for a few weeks at the time medications to support quitting werent widely available i had been a heavy smoker and had tried to quit numerous times before with zero success we both felt that the counseling program made a real difference to us quitting together also helped since neither wanted to be the first to fall off the wagon we both gained weight quite a lot in fact at the time it was distressing but looking back it was a very small price to pay for longer and healthier lives david cantor i started smoking at and was smoking two packs a day when i finally quit at the age of i quit cold turkey when i was at the stage your husband is at now six weeks into it i found myself still fighting the cravings and gaining weight because of an improved appetite i decided that i would deal with the weight after i won the smoking war and added pounds to a pound frame once smoking was handled i was able to ramp up my exercise regimen and take off the newly acquired fat but not all of the weight i also made it a point to let my three children ranging in age at that time from to know that dad had a problem with tobacco and how bad it was it also served as a good talking point about drugs all three are now in their thirties and have never smoked or used drugs lee levin i stopped smoking on jan for my wifes birthday i found it easier to quit by wearing a transdermal nicotine patch the milligram patch is for first step quitters the box of patches is &# at the cvs store in miami the transdermal patch contains enough nicotine to last for hours it helps stops the cravings to light up now im on the second step and wearing a less potent transdermal patch milligrams of nicotine after a month without cigarettes my health has improved i jog with my dog three miles five days a week my overall health has improved and im a happier person for quitting raul vazquez i am and quit smoking cold turkey years ago after years of smoking at the time i quit i was smoking at least two packs a day the reason i quit was i wanted to live longer and i also had a new family with two young children for at least years after i quit there was never a day in which i didnt want a cigarette the two things that kept me off the smokes were my health and the absolute freedom not smoking gave me i no longer had to worry about whether i left a cigarette burning when we left the house i never had to worry about where to put the ashes when we were out i never had to worry about how many cigarettes i had since i quit in cost wasnt much of an issue but the freedom was choose freedom bob brownlee
