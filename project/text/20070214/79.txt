journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources parenting showering children with praise could hurt if it centers on intelligence instead of effort praise long considered the cure to a host of childhood and societal problems from bullying to alcoholism might in fact be a problem for kids writes novelist and journalist po bronson parents might enjoy calling their children smart but it can play havoc with a childs ability to learn for decades child psychologists and educators had operated under the assumption that praise boosts self esteem and ultimately performance but after some of the early research on praise was called into question some psychologists have begun looking at whether complimenting children on their innate abilities actually could hurt them mr bronson highlights a study of fifth graders conducted by psychologist carol dweck and a team at columbia university in which the children took three tests the second test purposely was made difficult enough that every child failed what the scientists found was that kids who had been praised for their effort recovered from that failure by the third test to achieve scores higher than on their first test meanwhile the students who were praised for their intelligence had scores that were lower ms dwecks conclusion you should praise children for qualities they can control like effort those praised for their innate brainpower might develop the sense that hard work isnt necessary applying this research to his own life mr bronson finds his child responds well to process centered praise good work chasing down the ball the problem is mr bronson discovers he misses giving his child unconditional compliments "youre great im proud of you" "we expect so much of our children but we hide our expectations behind constant glowing praise " being too quick with praise can be as detrimental as jumping in too soon to help with a homework problem it robs kids of the rewards of
