wimax starts to take shape in europe the deployment of wimax a faster form of wireless broadband has been two years away for six years jokes daryl schoolar a senior analyst for networking at market research firm in stat in scottsdale ariz "its like this great idea but always around the corner " he says and finally he adds the corner is in sight "i think its ready for the big time " after years of hype and promise wimax technology is taking shape in europe last year france and germany allocated licenses to wimax operators though they came with some significant restrictions and the u k s telecommunications regulator likely will auction licenses by the end of with new spectrum available to both wimax and other wireless operators in the u s sprint nextel corp recently announced a &# billion initial investment in wimax and is working with motorola inc samsung electronics co intel corp and nokia corp to roll out the technology in late if wimax is widely adopted mobile phone companies chip makers and equipment manufacturers all stand to gain wimax acts much like wi fi the wireless internet technology often available for free in cafes and hotel rooms but has broader reach about miles it also transfers data much faster than wi fi proponents say it works just like g the advanced technology available in many cellphones but is more potent indoors wimax is far less expensive to roll out than fixed line broadband while wimax enthusiasts say the technology is ready to deploy its operators maintain some european telephone companies dont want to see it hit the market given that they have spent tens of billions of euros on their g networks that includes paying more than billion euros &# billion for g licenses during the internet stock bubble mr schoolar says the g networks operate on a low spectrum such as gigahertz that allows customers to walk or take trains while on the phone or surfing the internet most wimax in europe currently operates on the gigahertz spectrum which isnt fast enough for that sort of mobility for now both france and germany restrict wimax from being used in a mobile context "there is a general sense that incumbent operators want to protect their investment " says vincent grivet co chief executive of maxtel a wimax company in paris "but we are confident that the regulators will eventually open wimax to mobility" by providing access to the lower spectrum radio waves "if you are a big incumbent and have already gone down the road to g " it would be expected that "there is a lot of lobbying going on to make sure that wimax never gets the spectrum that would let them go truly mobile " adds mr schoolar the market research analyst the established telecommunications companies say they arent blocking wimax companies many of them small start ups from getting the lower spectrum but that the technology itself isnt ready wimax operators paint a more positive picture of the technologys performance "than we do " says a deutsche telekom ag spokesman he adds that any company including deutsche telekom is interested in protecting investments against competition that could undermine them bt group plc the u k s dominant phone company maintains that wimax technology will take years to mature the company declined to comment directly on british regulator ofcoms decision to open new spectrum to wimax and g operators france telecom sa declined to comment publicly on any wimax spectrum issues many wimax proponents say that ofcoms planned auction of gigahertz spectrum to both types of operators signals that the regulator has enough faith in wimax to allow its operators to buy precious and limited spectrum for ofcoms part a spokeswoman says "we want to take a technology neutral approach because we believe the market is better placed to make decisions about what works and what doesnt than the regulator " a spokesman for the german telecommunications regulator says there are no immediate plans to allow wimax mobility in france a spokesman for the regulator says wimax operators would be allowed to become mobile at some point but such a decision is years away "we are in active discussions with the european regulator about this " he adds wimax operators maintain that the regulators stance amounts to unfair protectionism of g and eventually will be challenged by the european commission to date the commission has shied away from taking action on the issue but says it would like to give wimax and other technologies a chance to prove themselves on a level playing field a spokeswoman for european telecoms commissioner viviane reding says authorities are "listening to all parties concerned " andy mckinnon a motorola executive who works with wimax believes competition between g and wimax is temporary "there is room for both of these technologies and sometimes in the same devices " he says wimax proponents also see the technology playing different roles in different countries widespread in eastern europe where little broadband exists and less evident in places like paris which is introducing high speed fiber optic cables which are as much as times faster than a wimax connection alcatel lucent chief technology officer olivier baujard says that in some locations it is about cheaper for fixed line operators to deploy wimax than to dig up pavement and install fiber to a home "by the end of the third quarter of well see widespread deployment of wimax " he predicts he is currently testing the next generation of wimax
