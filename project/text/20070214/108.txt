politics &amp economics what drove the north korea deal u s hungered for diplomatic victory pyongyang for financial relief fading options for the u s and north korea led to a landmark agreement designed to shut down pyongyangs nuclear program but the follow through needed to reach the goal of a denuclearized korean peninsula could be thwarted by the same problems that plagued earlier deals the deal reached yesterday in beijing reflects in part a desire within the bush administration to show diplomatic progress on one front at a time of ebbing support at home and upheaval in the middle east for north korea the pact offers a way out of its harsh economic and political isolation four months after it tested a nuclear weapon president bush praised the deal reached after months of arduous negotiations and signed as well by north koreas four neighbors as a "first step" toward achieving a nuclear weapons free peninsula the agreement lays out the first concrete steps for disarming north korea since the u s china russia japan and south korea began to engage pyongyang in august other top u s officials cautioned that the way forward will present plenty of challenges pyongyang has made no overt pledges to surrender any nuclear weapons it now has verifying and monitoring its disarmament moves will be tough and missteps by any of the six parties could trip up the entire process the agreement marks a stark about face for the bush administration which having labeled north korea part of an "axis of evil " abandoned a similar clinton administration arrangement and said it would offer no incentives until north korea took visible steps to scrap its nuclear program hawks within the administration centered on the office of vice president dick cheney continued to argue until last fall that the u s should use economic and other pressures to try to topple north korean leader kim jong il who they said couldnt be trusted to uphold any promises according to current and former u s officials but after democrats emerged victorious in novembers congressional elections and with the departure of several administration hard liners mr bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice decided to make a run at a deal they found a receptive audience among their partners in asia most important beijing the deal was a victory for china which has sought to take a higher profile in global diplomacy and has played a major role in spearheading the talks harder to divine are north koreas motives senior u s officials involved in the latest talks said chinas decision to get tough on pyongyang after its october nuclear test combined with a u s led effort to squeeze the kim regimes access to outside finance may have tipped the balance under the agreement north korea will shut down within two months its lone nuclear reactor at yongbyon which is chiefly used to provide fuel for atomic weapons in return it will receive tons of heavy fuel oil most likely from south korea and china if the day deadline is met the six countries that participated in the talks would begin the next phase under which north korea must dismantle and seal the reactor effectively preventing it from ever working again for that north korea would receive a further tons of oil about equal to what the country consumes in a year and at todays prices valued at about &# million the six countries would later negotiate the disposal of north koreas existing nuclear weapons and weapons material they also aim to keep working toward a bigger goal of ending the antagonism that has lingered on the korean peninsula since the korean war of the s the parties created five groups to work on details for such things as paving the way for north korea to open diplomatic relations with the u s and japan the arc of events that brought the u s and north korea to the current state of affairs suggests there could be plenty of pitfalls ahead the bush administration came into office in determined to chart a tougher course on north korea than the clinton administration in washington accused pyongyang of developing a secret uranium enrichment program and violating a deal in which the u s agreed to provide it with light water reactors and fuel oil in exchange for a freeze of its nuclear program north korea reacted by expelling international inspectors reopening the yongbyon facility and plunging back into plutonium enrichment work the u s then helped launch the six country talks in two years later in september all parties agreed to a joint statement meant to lead toward a full denuclearization deal that tentative agreement was almost immediately derailed when the treasury department accused north korea of engaging in rampant counterfeiting of u s currency in july north korea tested at least six long range missiles then conducted its first nuclear test explosion three months later the moves raised the possibility that the north could develop an offensive nuclear capability or sell nuclear technology to others the nuclear test galvanized international support for sanctions on north korea and prompted china in an unprecedented move to back a united nations resolution to punish its erstwhile ally the turning point for the u s came in november when ms rice sat down with ministers on the sidelines of a regional forum in vietnam with pressure building at home to change course in iraq and to reach out to iran the administration decided to make a push on north korea by offering a phased set of rewards the north agreed to revive the six party talks several weeks later in beijing but those foundered on its insistence that washington open a door to lifting the banking restrictions on the night that round of talks ended the u s envoy to the talks christopher hill sent an aide to visit the north korean embassy with a message he would meet the north korean envoy in another city at a time of his choosing that represented an apparent compromise for the u s which previously had said it wouldnt engage in one on one discussions with pyongyang a few days later north korea notified the u s that its envoy kim kye gwan would like to meet in berlin in january mr hill checked with ms rice who agreed they should meet over three days of meetings at the u s and north korean embassies the two men wrote what one u s official described as the "clear outlines of an agreement " which formed the backbone of the deal signed yesterday the u s insists the key to the latest deal is that it is backed by china and south korea ms rice cautioned that it marks only a first step toward a much larger and more elusive goal of weaning north korea off nuclear weapons permanently no country that has developed nuclear weapons has ever agreed to give them up many experts who have worked on the north korea issue including several former clinton aides applauded the deal as long overdue some democrats in congress which would have to approve any aid to north korea offered similar praise but the arrangement came under immediate attack from prominent conservatives above all john bolton the administrations recently departed ambassador to the u n "it is really regrettable that we have reverted to a policy that has failed in the past " said mr bolton who served as mr bushs top arms control official until "this sends such a message of weakness to countries like iran that so long as you hold out this is the sort of reward you can expect " pressure drop key terms of the north korean deal north korea shuts the yongbyon nuclear reactor within days andpermanently disables its main nuclear reactor in return it receives million tons of heavy fuel oil as benchmarks are met north korea and the u s embark on talks aimed at resolving disputes and restarting diplomatic relations the u s begins the process of delisting north korea as a terror sponsor and ending trade sanctions japan and north korea seek to normalize relations permanent peace between north and south korea sought
