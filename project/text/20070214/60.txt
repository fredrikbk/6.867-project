freedom for sale the freedom tower at ground zero in manhattan still isnt much to look at a handful of beams rising from the pit roughly to ground level but this week has brought the welcome news that private equity funds and other investors are asking if its owner might be willing to sell the building that is supposed to replace the fallen twin towers the port authority of new york and new jersey has also hired a broker to shop the still unbuilt tower a sale is far from certain the rebuilding has been delayed by years of contentious negotiations with larry silverstein who leased the entire world trade center site from the port authority weeks before the attacks but as a private investor mr silverstein is the only party so far who has managed to rebuild anything at the trade center and he was able to do so because control over the site of world trade just north of ground zero was undivided unlike the mess of interests that have delayed the development of the rest of the site so putting the freedom tower into private hands would decrease the risks of further delay as part of the deal that finally got construction moving the port authority agreed to retake control of the freedom tower from mr silverstein but the ports record as a property manager is spotty at best and taxpayers are not well served by taking on the &# billion or more that the port would need to borrow to finish the tower the twin towers were underoccupied and underutilized for at least two decades after their construction letting private capital take on the risks of turning a profit on the new million square foot foot tower would ensure that history does not repeat itself at taxpayer expense
