faith based nonproliferation so after a couple of decades of broken promises missile launches and nuclear tests north koreas kim jong il has finally decided to give up his nuclear ambitions in return for diplomatic recognition and foreign aid the bush administration will no doubt be praised with scorn for finally being "reasonable" and recognizing "reality " but the exercise strikes us as something close to faith based nonproliferation perhaps the best thing we can say about the deal is that it is marginally better than the "agreed framework " the accord in which the clinton administration agreed to hand over two light water reactors and tons of fuel oil a year in exchange for north koreas promise to freeze its plutonium program pyongyang pocketed the oil only to demand more compensation within a few years while secretly enriching uranium in a separate nuclear program that it only acknowledged in this time there are no nuclear reactors on offer and north korea will get only of the promised one million tons of fuel oil and humanitarian assistance up front the remaining is contingent upon north korea providing a full accounting of all of its nuclear programs within days and ultimately agreeing to dismantle the works that includes nuclear bombs spent fuel and the clandestine uranium program which it now denies having but that the bush administration insists does exist the other difference from is that china is a party to this accord beijing has by far the most leverage of any country on pyongyang as its political patron and supplier of most of its energy needs china was instrumental in getting pyongyang back to the negotiating table after a three year absence and the u s is counting on it to help ensure the norths cooperation a senior administration official tells us that there has been a "sea change" in the chinese attitude toward north korea since last summers missile launch read beijing is furious and that beijing is now "heavily invested" in making sure that the deal succeeds we can only hope this is so however kim has proven he can stand up to china before and the dictators habit is to strike an agreement and then try to renegotiate it along the way for better terms he will have many chances to do so under yesterdays accord because the commitments and timetables are vague to say the least his one important specific promise is to shut down his plutonium facility at yongbyon within days the accord makes no mention of the plutonium his regime has produced nor of the eight or more nuclear bombs he is thought to possess nor does it refer to his uranium enrichment program much less specify that international inspectors will be able to roam the countrys vast network of underground installations for evidence of where that program might be bush administration officials say that they believe that all of kims nuclear activities are covered under the agreement and that kim will be expected to come clean in his day declaration but if he doesnt one danger of this accord is that it will start a traditional "arms control" process in which kim can stall and protest and the u s will be pressured to make even further concessions we can already see the lineup of south koreans chinese american media and state department officials all suggesting that the bush administration is being obstinate and "unrealistic" if it insists on intrusive inspections or on recovering all of kims plutonium meanwhile the immediate effect of the fuel assistance and promises of diplomatic recognition will sustain kims regime allowing him to sell the deal at home as a victory for his missile and nuclear blackmail the timing is especially ironic given that kims position arguably has never been more precarious thanks to u s imposed financial measures against the norths international banking activities treasurys blacklisting of banco delta asia in macau in september and the demonstration effect on other banks that did business with the north essentially shut down pyongyangs access to the global banking system the u s is now promising to review its banco delta asia action within days if that results in the government of macau releasing some portion of the &# million in bnas north korean accounts its yet another prop for the regime all of which is to say that this is far from the nonproliferation model set by libyas moammar gadhafi in the wake of saddam husseins ouster in gadhafi relinquished his entire nuclear program up front and only later once compliance was verified and the nuclear materials removed from the country did the u s take libya off the terror list and provide other rewards perhaps mr bush feels this is the best he can do in the waning days of his administration or perhaps in the most favorable interpretation he wants to clear the decks of this issue in order to have more political capital to control irans nuclear ambitions iran may look at this deal however and conclude it has little to lose by raising the nuclear stakes wed like to believe this will turn out better but history doesnt support such faith
