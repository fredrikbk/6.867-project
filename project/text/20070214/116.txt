taliban spring american and nato military planners in afghanistan are bracing for what they anticipate will be a major taliban offensive this spring expect more terrorism in kabul attacks on positions in and around the key pashtun city of kandahar ambushes on vehicles and attacks on european and canadian forces which the taliban consider with good reason to be the weak link in the nato chain expect too for the taliban to be decisively defeated the year was a bad one for afghanistan the rate of suicide bombings throughout the country soared the taliban found sanctuary in pakistans waziristan province and thanks to their "truce" with islamabad more than doubled the number of raids into afghanistan entire provinces in the country had almost no military or police presence to speak of and nato was unable to secure further troop commitments from its non u s members now the picture is brightening a year ago there were no afghan troops and no more than u s special forces in the southern province of helmand today there is an afghan infantry battalion and a british air assault brigade the u s is deploying thousands of soldiers from the nd airborne division while extending the deployment of the tenth mountain infantry brigade in anticipation of the spring offensive that brings total u s troop levels in afghanistan to roughly more than this time last year so much for the idea that the surge in iraq is starving our efforts in afghanistan the situation with the afghan military is also improving though a senior u s military official describes the process as a "steep uphill climb " in the desertion rate was today it is it helps that the afghan soldier has now had a raise to about &# a month it helps too that the u s is now investing &# billion over two years to better equip and train the army and to double its size to where the u s still has significant problems is with its partners in the region the fighting capabilities of european canadian and even british forces continue to lag far behind americas as does their willingness to fight italian prime minister romano prodi has been under intense political pressure to withdraw italys man contingent in afghanistan this week a canadian senate committee recommended withdrawing their forces if other nato countries dont increase theirs more problematic is pakistan president pervez musharrafs recent proposal to mine the border with afghanistan along the so called "durand line" is probably not serious but if it were it would not be helpful and while its true that the pakistan army lost some soldiers in fighting against the taliban its also true that their september truce represents an abdication of their sovereign responsibility to control their borders still the combination of more troops and a keen appreciation of last years mistakes puts the u s and afghanistan in a better position than a year ago to repulse the talibans expected spring offensive we hope our wavering nato allies feel the same way after all isnt afghanistan supposed to be the "good war" in the broader war on terror see related letter "letters to the editor enlightened self interest pakistan wants a stable prosperous afghanistan" wsj february
