equipment purchases these lenders generally charge double digit interest rates on par with the interest payments on high risk corporate bonds known as junk bonds lenders typically also get potential future stakes in the companies via warrants that can be converted into equity the warrants convert to equity if the start up eventually gets bought or goes public in contrast the venture capitalists who typically invest in such companies pay cash for an immediate stake in hopes of a payout later when the company is sold venture debt can be a risky path for early stage start ups the loans need to
