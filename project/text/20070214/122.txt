the daily fix hang in there baseball fans pitchers and catchers report online edition while the fix hides from a maelstrom of hail being driven through the streets by supersonic winds there are signs of spring elsewhere in this great land in florida and arizona baseball players are arriving in spring training camps to prepare for the season in the seattle times steve kelleys column feels like a warm breeze for baseball fans who could desperately use one "the pitchers and catchers report today " he writes "repeat the sentence over and over again like a mantra close your eyes and relax thinking about the warm desert sun take a deep breath and repeat the sentence again imagining felix hernandez throwing his first fastballs of the new year to catcher kenji johjima find your baseball zen and listen to the pop of leather as the pitchers throw their first long tosses hear the crack of the bat a spring sound as familiar as the robins first tweets soon the doors of safeco field will creak open spring is coming baseballs got next the pitchers and catchers report today that sentence is among the most magical in sports filled with promise and apprehension it is the harbinger of hope " in the washington post thomas boswell sees hope for the nationals not for but eventually in fact he compares the nats to the late s atlanta braves who were on the brink of kick starting a baseball dynasty if that sounds crazy consider that stan kasten one of the architects of that dynasty is now president of the nats "on opening day the braves did not have a single established player on their roster who just three years later would be part of atlantas world series team " mr boswell writes "zip zero only two obscure rookies tom glavine and ron gant two homers were even on the horizon as prospects now look at the nats their starting pitching is atrocious and granted nothing is as vital as your rotation but the rest of the team is credible to build a contender you need key players eight everyday regulars five solid pitchers and three top relievers hard as it is to believe washington already has seven of those puzzle pieces ryan zimmerman chad cordero nick johnson patterson austin kearns felipe lopez and brian schneider braves in early zero nats to start seven " hope seems to be in short supply in tampa however after seeing day of the new york yankees campaign the new york posts joel sherman starts on an ominous note "it was the clubhouse attendants slipping in jose veras nameplate above the spring training locker that for so long housed bernie williams " he writes "it was in congenitally non controversial mariano rivera lashing out about his contract status it was in joe torre knowing not to ask about an extension beyond the season because he recognizes what the answer will be and it was in the limping gait ashen face and slurred words of a slowed man navigating the bowels of legends field who used to be the boss but is now just a septuagenarian named george steinbrenner yankees pitchers and catchers have not even taken the field for yet it feels as if something is ending " after watching the chicago cubs spend money like drunken sailors this offseason cubs ace carlos zambrano who can be a free agent after this season would like to know where his check is "pay the man " urges rick morrissey in the chicago tribune "pay carlos zambrano what he wants for the simple reason that in addition to being a very good pitcher he has been a very healthy pitcher in his five year career he has suffered no loss of limb contracted no exotic diseases experienced no spontaneous combustion those maladies are a typical week for kerry wood in essence reward him for not being wood or mark prior two talented pitchers who couldnt stay healthy if you had them tailed by the mayo clinic team bus " mr morrissey argues that "if anybodys a gladiator its zambrano he won last year when the cubs won only imagine what he can do if the franchise ever wins on a consistent basis if youre a cubs fan used to having your heart ripped out youre probably imagining what zambrano will do with another team in " at the risk of being a spring training bringdown lets talk steroids on espn com mike fish kicks off a promising series by looking at why the dominican republic leads the baseball world in players suspended for performance enhancing drugs "how to explain it " he asks "should we blame it on the buscones pronounced boo scone ehs baseball street agents some of whom are suspected of starting teenage prospects on steroids to improve their ability to sell them to pro scouts on tainted supplements and a government that allows banned drugs to be bought over the counter on a lack of education about doping rules all of the above " thats part of an even handed examination of the issues and the pressures faced by young athletes for whom baseball could be a ticket out of grinding poverty for their entire families nba commissioner david stern left tongues wagging with recent comments that the league might allow a team to relocate to las vegas which strikes the fix as an insanely bad idea by the way but the most likely suspects for a vegas move the maloof brothers say they wont move the sacramento kings to their base of operations should sacramentans sacramentoes sacramenticians lets just move along worry dont buy the hype marcos breton advises in the bee charging that mr stern "is like the guy in the movie jaws who tosses blood and severed fish heads into the ocean sparking a feeding frenzy of sharks the only difference being the guy in jaws was shocked and frightened when the sharks took the blood stern banks on it " "why not start the fun of the nba all star weekend with a superficial image of a sexy hot spot that is aching for an nba team " he asks "why not shake up or subtly frighten cities such as sacramento where frustrated nba owners want a new arena and have had no luck extorting one why not dangle a las vegas franchise that could be impossible or impractical to realize because beyond the hype vegas isnt half the market sacramento is probably because its a lot more palatable to discuss hypotheticals when reality in the nba is the opposite of hot and sexy " last week soccer games in italy were played before empty stadiums leading one italian paper to opine that "italian football died last night " on slate robert weintraub says thats not true but perhaps it should be he reviews the sorry recent history of italian scandals and violence then compares them with the maladies that gripped english soccer in the s and are now behind it but for a variety of reasons corruption lack of tv rights fees a different brand of hooliganism mr weintraub doubts italy can recover as england did "an extraordinary intervention is needed " he writes "the domestic leagues should be shut down for at least the rest of this year and italian clubs should be banned from european competition the clubs should be punished for the criminal actions of ultras representing them there also needs to be a cleaving between politics and sport private ownership should be encouraged foreign if necessary so that the decision making and direction of the clubs dont go through layers of people with nonsoccer agendas mostly the italian football association needs to understand how farcical their sport appears to outside eyes " tip of the fix cap to reader chris trebon found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion
