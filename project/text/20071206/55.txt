how the credit crunch turned local governments pools can offer better yields but with risk exposure thirteen years ago today orange county calif sent tremors through financial markets when it filed for bankruptcy today that same county and states and counties nationwide with troubled investment funds face new worries this time they stem from the subprime crisis in florida the state run local government investment pool is poised to reopen today after a contentious meeting with investors on tuesday letting local governments and school districts make withdrawals for the first time in a week the fund was frozen last week by the state board of administration after billions of dollars were rapidly withdrawn because the fund had invested in subprime related securities it couldnt sell while floridas case has been the most extreme numerous other funds could be vulnerable nearly every state runs some kind of government investment pool offering city county and state governments a seemingly reliable place to park their cash government officials say these funds which are somewhat akin to money market funds are attractive because they often offer better yields and lower fees than the typical bank account "most local government pools are very similar to florida in what their funds can be invested in " says richard larkin a credit analyst at j b hanauer &amp co a parsippany n j based brokerage firm "therefore it is likely there will be other situations similar to florida " the consequences of a government fund losing money can have a direct impact on local counties towns or schools over time a municipality might have to raise taxes or cut spending if it loses access to some of its cash in florida jefferson county officials say their inability to withdraw funds from the local government investment pool has already caused the school district to bounce checks to its vendors in order to pay its teachers where orange county foundered on derivatives in the s government run funds in florida maine connecticut and washington state are stuck with commercial paper backed by mortgages that make them hard to sell the montana board of investments said investors there had pulled &# million out of the &# billion fund after learning it had invested in short term investments using asset backed securities as collateral chriss street treasurer of orange county said the county has been investing in sivs since before and that the underlying assets "were of a much higher quality than what youve been hearing about in florida " he added that subprime mortgage assets make up to less than of the countys sivs about &# million out of the countys &# billion extended fund which manages money for the countys schools are invested in sivs and are under credit watch by moodys about &# million out of the countys &# billion money market funds are invested in sivs but arent under credit watch he said adding that the county has been raising cash because it is in tax collecting season the county also has &# million in liquid money market securities that it could use for cash if necessary when asked if he would bet on sivs again he said "it depends on how all this works out this is new territory " overall there are more than of these investment pools nationwide holding in excess of &# billion in assets according to standard &amp poors "these funds try to act like safe money market funds but some also wanted to get a bit more yield " says peter rizzo an analyst at s&amp p "when you want to have your cake and eat it too" is when you can get into trouble he added in the first wave of the subprime crisis wall street brokerage firms hedge funds and banks stretching from germany to australia were exposed as victims from investments backed by subprime mortgages but now some of the same shaky securities are popping up in the portfolios of state run cash management funds that are supposed to be highly liquid and safe s&amp p rates only of these government run funds so far the fund of king county wash which is on watch for downgrade because of investments in debt issued by sivs is the only one to experience any trouble mr rizzo says but s&amp p also says that another hold either asset backed commercial paper or sivs which use subprime mortgages and other troubled asset backed securities among their collateral others however feel the rating agencies are partly to blame some officials at government funds say they are restricted to buying top rated paper and that they ended up buying distressed debt only because the securities received the highest ratings from the agencies "everything was triple a rated when we purchased it " says carroll south executive director for the montana board of investments these government funds werent supposed to walk this close to the flame orange countys crisis in triggered by a rise in interest rates after the county bet rates would fall led to a &# billion loss and the largest bankruptcy filing ever by a

value of the mortgages backing the securities has fallen and investors have refused to buy any more of this commercial paper even though it is unclear whether it has lost value the state funds are in effect stuck with securities that no one wants which is an especially bad problem for funds that are supposed to provide a place to park cash for the short term correctinos &amp amplifications
