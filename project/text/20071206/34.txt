fcc media ownership fight heats up washington media companies and consumer groups dont agree on many things but distaste for federal communications commission chairman kevin martins effort to rewrite the nations media ownership rules appears to be one of them they approach the issue from opposite sides media companies want even looser limits on what broadcast properties they can own while activists say mr martin went too far both are digging in for a contentious two week battle at the fcc which is scheduled to rule on mr martins plan dec mr martin proposes allowing media companies to own both a newspaper and television station in the nations biggest markets waivers allowing cross ownership of newspaper and broadcast properties in smaller markets would be considered on a case by case basis consumer groups argue this will lead to consolidation with less local news and less diversity of voices media companies on the other hand want looser rules arguing that the internet provides more competition in most markets as a bipartisan collection of lawmakers and media activists fights to put the brakes on the proposal mr martins skills as a political deal maker will be tested the fcc chairman says he intends to move ahead despite uncertainty that his fellow republican commissioners will give him the support he needs to win behind the rhetoric however he has already begun quietly laying the foundation for a likely challenge in court yesterday mr martin came under attack at a house hearing on the matter democrats accused mr martin of rushing through changes without giving the public sufficient opportunity to comment on his plans and republicans endorsed his overhaul but said he didnt go far enough the republicans concerns have been echoed by clear channel communications inc media general inc and other companies that had hoped mr martin would significantly loosen caps on radio and broadcast ownership mr martin agreed he could have gone further but said he recognized the need for caution "i think the commission should take what is obviously a controversial step gradually " he said and first deal with easing cross ownership prohibitions in bigger markets "where there is a plethora of voices " before looking at smaller media markets on tuesday a senate committee approved legislation that would require mr martin to slow the media ownership review by as many as six months a move that would put the matter in the spotlight close to the presidential election and almost surely delay a vote until a new administration takes over the bill isnt expected to pass congress in the next two weeks but was designed to send a message to mr martin that he should delay the vote compared with his predecessor michael powell mr martin has proposed relatively modest changes to the nations media ownership limits allowing media companies to own a newspaper and a television station in the top markets in the country as long as the station isnt one of the four most popular in its market media activists complain that mr martins cross ownership rule is riddled with loopholes that would allow far more consolidation in smaller markets in the fcc then led by mr powell narrowly voted to lift cross ownership restrictions ease limits on local broadcast ownership and raise the national broadcast ownership limit to of the audience the provision was later knocked down by congress the rest was challenged in the third circuit court of appeals in june the court ruled that the fcc hadnt justified changes to the rules and kicked them back to the agency this time mr martin has already quietly begun laying the groundwork for another legal challenge last week the fcc took an unconventional route to approving the temporary waivers that will allow sam zells &# billion buyout deal of tribune co to move forward instead of granting temporary waivers the fcc actually denied tribunes request the company gets a two year extension on its current waivers only if it sues the fcc about the denial that maneuvering would likely put the issue of media ownership limits before the federal court of appeals for the district of columbia which generally gives the fcc more deference than other appeals courts
