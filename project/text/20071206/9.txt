big pharma faces grim prognosis industry fails to find new drugs to replace wonders like lipitor over the next few years the pharmaceutical business will hit a wall some of the top selling drugs in industry history will become history as patent protections expire allowing generics to rush in at much lower prices generic competition is expected to wipe &# billion from top companies annual u s sales between and as more than three dozen drugs lose patent protection that is roughly half of the companies combined u s sales at the same time the industrys science engine has stalled the century old approach of finding chemicals to treat diseases is producing fewer and fewer drugs especially lacking are new blockbusters to replace old ones like lipitor plavix and zyprexa the coming sales decline may signal the end of a once revered way of doing business "i think the industry is doomed if we dont change " says sidney taurel chairman of eli lilly &amp co just yesterday bristol myers squibb co announced plans to cut of its work force or about jobs and close or sell about half of its manufacturing plants by between and annual industry revenue will decline estimates datamonitor a research and consulting firm that would be the first decline in at least four decades patent expirations are a big problem drugs are granted years of patent protection although companies often fail to get a product to market before half of that period has elapsed once it hits the market however the patent protected drug is highly profitable typical gross margins are to when patents expire generic makers offer the products at a price much closer to the cost of production pfizer inc will be particularly hard hit when the patent expires as early as on lipitor the cholesterol lowering blockbuster that ranks as the most successful drug ever pharmacists and managed care companies will aggressively fill prescriptions with generics reducing annual lipitor sales to a fraction of last years &# billion by merck &amp co will face generic competition to its three top selling drugs the osteoporosis treatment fosamax singulair for asthma and the blood pressure drug cozaar those three represent of the companys current revenue following the loss last year of patent protection for mercks cholesterol lowering zocor sales this year are expected to fall from &# billion in a merck spokeswoman said the company has several products in the pipeline that will offset its patent losses the rise of generics wouldnt matter so much if research labs were creating a stream of new hits but that isnt happening during the five years from through the industry brought to market fewer new chemical based drugs than in the last five years of the s despite more than doubling research and development spending in october moodys investors service which rates about &# billion in u s pharmaceutical company debt lowered its outlook for the u s drug industry to negative from stable the industry was long considered among the most credit worthy but in recent years moodys has downgraded giants schering plough corp merck bristol myers pfizer and glaxosmithkline plc in explaining its diminished outlook moodys said that drugs currently in development dont have as much commercial potential as earlier pipelines investors once huge beneficiaries of drug industry success have moved to the sidelines as the dow jones world index rose in the six years ended nov the ftse global pharmaceuticals index fell while many patients are benefiting from lower cost generics others are waiting in vain for relief of their suffering "in anxiety disorder the field has imploded in terms of drug development " said p murali doraiswamy chief of biological psychiatry at duke university medical school "ten years ago we had eight or nine different" anxiety disorder drugs under development but that has now "come to a halt " at last months big american heart association meeting in orlando fla there were just two high profile studies of experimental drugs on the agenda one for eli lillys anti blood clotting drug prasugrel posted results that left some doctors and analysts questioning whether the drug would be a big seller lilly however says it is "very pleased with the trials outcome " the other study was a postmortem on pfizers torcetrapib already known as one of the industrys most costly failures with &# million in budgeted research costs "there havent been any new therapies that are proven to reduce death and disability for atherosclerosis since the introduction of the cholesterol lowering statins" in the late s said richard c pasternak vice president of cardiovascular clinical research at merck atherosclerosis a buildup of arterial plaque is a major cause of heart disease as patent expirations loom pharmaceutical companies are reorganizing in five years many may look very different they will be in new businesses their cost structures may be slimmer and more flexible some familiar names may disappear in mergers companies are installing new leaders including outsiders like pfizer chairman and ceo jeffrey kindler who in joined the company as general counsel from mcdonalds corp "the era that created the modern pharmaceutical industry is in fact over " said richard evans a former wall street analyst and now a pharmaceutical consultant to be sure the pharmaceutical industry is still highly profitable sales will continue to benefit from the medicare drug benefit for the elderly and from growth in overseas markets the industry will continue to produce new drugs though at too slow a rate to sustain its size and cost structure analysts assess some players such as merck may fare better because of a more productive r&amp d operation according to sanford c bernstein &amp co research analyst timothy anderson it has never been easy to take a drug from the lab through animal testing and into human trials the industry estimates only one out of every to candidates makes it to human trials and many drugs that work beautifully in animals fail miserably in people but those odds seem to have worsened in recent years prompting debate about whether the cause is government regulation corporate structure or an excessive scientific reliance on chemicals rather than biology many drug company executives blame the fda for pulling back on approvals "very few products are being approved today " said bernard poussot incoming chief executive of wyeth the heightened scrutiny contributed to delays of two wyeth products this past summer the company has said would be blockbusters such as novartis ags diabetes drug galvus and sanofi aventiss weight loss drug rimonabant have recently been delayed by the fda over safety concerns safety concerns have also prompted the agency to require larger studies of new drugs novartis ceo daniel vasella says this trend has done more than any other to drive up the industrys r&amp d costs he cites novartiss blood pressure drug tekturna approved earlier this year which had more than patients in its late stage trial a decade ago a similar study might have had fewer than patients according to dr vasella christopher difrancesco a spokesman for the fda said "the number of approvals have declined because companies are submitting fewer drugs to the fda for approval the threshold for what we consider to be a safe effective drug hasnt changed " some say the industrys ballooning research budgets may be working against productivity most companies use a centralized system to allocate research money and the growing budgets have left the decision making to too few people who are too far removed from the research suggests mr evans who worked at roches u s subsidiary until spent several years as a wall street analyst and is now a consultant at a health care consulting firm he calls the system "a nightmare of complexity " as evidence of this problem some in the industry point to pfizer with an annual research budget that has grown to &# billion highest in the industry yet only a handful of drugs discovered in its internal research labs have come to market in the past decade and late last year the company lost its most promising hope when the cholesterol drug torcetrapib failed in late stage trials in a statement pfizer said it has the largest pipeline of midstage drugs in company history and plans to triple the number of late stage drugs in its portfolio by a few companies notably glaxosmithkline have begun breaking r&amp d into smaller groups though it is too early to gauge results some believe the industry which grew out of the european chemical business of the late s has remained too reliant on that foundation "for all our amazing advances in the last years we are still working with the tools of the first pharmaceutical revolution using advanced chemistry to treat disease symptoms " mr taurel of lilly said in a speech the future many believe lies in biotechnology unlike traditional chemistry based drug development biotechnology uses biological tools to create entire proteins often similar to those that occur in the human body this approach has yielded successful drugs to treat diseases such as anemia cancer and rheumatoid arthritis biotech drugs are especially appealing because they face no competition from generics no regulatory pathway yet exists in the u s for bringing to market generic biotech drugs so until congress creates such a pathway no generic threat will exist to the &# a month that genentech inc charges for its cancer drug avastin or the &# a year that genzyme corp gets for cerezyme to treat gaucher disease and biotechnology products tend to target specialized areas of medicine that dont require mass advertising or armies of salespeople so big pharmaceutical companies have spent nearly &# billion since to buy biotech companies according to health care m&amp a information service a unit of irving levin associates inc a norwalk conn research company while in there were deals amounting to &# billion in the first nine months of this year there were deals totaling &# billion including astrazeneca plcs &# billion acquisition of medimmune which followed a bidding war against eli lilly among others meanwhile novartis and pfizer recently announced the formation of in house biotech units the dearth of new products has led the industry to invest heavily in marketing and legal tactics that squeeze as much revenue as possible out of existing products companies have raised prices the average price per pill has risen since according to michael krensavage raymond james analyst companies raised advertising spending to &# billion in from &# billion in and since have nearly tripled the number of industry sales representatives to the industry spent &# million on lobbying from january to june according to the center for public integrity on "a variety of issues ranging from protecting lucrative drug patents to keeping lower priced canadian drugs from being imported " the industry also successfully lobbied against allowing the federal government to negotiate medicare drug prices the center said the lobbying has drawn fire from politicians doctors and payers and damaged the industrys public image aware that seven of the top drug launches of were generics pharmaceutical giants are pushing more deeply into that business in first nine months of this year novartiss generics unit sandoz grew roughly three times as fast as its branded drugs business and accounted for nearly of overall revenue "the balance is changing " says novartis ceo dr vasella in the coming quarters "we will continue to see a faster growth opportunity" in generics after pfizers antidepressant zoloft went off patent last year the companys own generics unit greenstone launched a generic version of the drug johnson &amp johnson has its own generics unit other companies cut deals with generics manufacturers licensing them the right to sell "authorized generics" that are identical to a branded drug that has gone off patent diversification is another hope roche holding ag is pursuing a &# billion hostile takeover of ventana medical systems inc a diagnostics company that makes the test used to determine whether women with breast cancer should receive herceptin a targeted biotechnology drug that roche sells in some markets the bid is part of a broad push further into diagnostics by the company which said in july that severin schwan who runs the companys diagnostics unit will take over next year as ceo yet none of these moves are forestalling cost slashing pfizer is cutting of its sales force astrazeneca is cutting of its employees and johnson &amp johnson is shrinking its staff by according to bernstein research as many as industry positions will be displaced over the next years according to wealth management company regentatlantic capital chatham n j astrazeneca glaxosmithkline and bristol myers squibb have also recently suggested they will outsource at least some of their manufacturing "there are lots of people in india china and eastern europe who can make products of the same quality as ours but at significantly less cost " says bristol myers squibb ceo james cornelius the outsourcing is expected to extend to research "we dont do any basic research yet in the lower cost countries but over the next few years to be successful youll have a constant emphasis on looking for that " mr cornelius says the coming difficulty is threatening every industry tradition "im talking to you from the th floor of an office on park avenue " mr cornelius says "a year from now i wont be talking to you from the th floor because were going to move downstairs out of these very expensive offices " sarah rubenstein and ron winslow contributed
