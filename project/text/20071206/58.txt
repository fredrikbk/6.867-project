hillarys revenge summoning the ghosts of the clinton impeachment may be taboo in the democratic presidential race but its apparently fair game as payback against those who participated in it thus is california senator barbara boxer exacting revenge against james rogan who has been nominated for a district court judgeship in california mr rogan was a california congressman in the s and one of managers of the impeachment hearings in the house he also has served as a prosecutor a municipal judge head of the u s patent &amp trademark office and since last year a superior court judge in california yet now ms boxer his home state senator is exercising her prerogative to "blue slip" him blocking a nominee to the federal bench even before he gets a hearing from the judiciary committee asked what she had against him senator boxers office told the associated press that mr rogan "was one of the most enthusiastic backers of impeachment he thought president clinton had committed high crimes and misdemeanors the senate certainly disagreed with that conclusion as did sen boxer " its an unusual spectacle for a mere district judgeship especially in california ms boxer and fellow senator dianne feinstein had worked out a system with the bush administration for filling federal district court vacancies through a commission designed to find consensus candidates known as the parsky commission its proposed nominees so far have all met the satisfaction of the two democrats until now mr rogan is undeniably qualified and has support from the likes of former clinton chief counsel lanny davis and former san francisco mayor willie brown ditto for such partisans as illinois governor rod blagojevich and a good chunk of the california house delegation including jane harman anna eshoo and grace napolitano even president clinton and mr rogan have reportedly had a cordial correspondence the judge sent him flowers in the hospital during his heart bypass surgery and even some impeachment memorabilia from mr rogans private collection as a donation to the clinton presidential library lets also recall that mr clinton did lie under oath in a civil case for which he was ultimately barred for five years from practicing law so the house had a duty to consider charges in her presidential campaign hillary clinton has tried to portray the s as a halcyon era of peace and prosperity while forgetting vanishing billing records and other ethics unpleasantness but the revenge against mr rogan is an indication that forgive and forget is precisely what a hillary presidency would not do senators boxer and clinton have been close for years with hillarys brother tony rodham marrying ms boxers daughter nicole in the rose garden in that marriage ended in divorce but the two women have remained stalwart allies if mrs clinton wanted her friend to desist she need merely say so barack obama has been saying that hillary clinton cant transcend the nasty partisan wars of which she was so central a part and the rogan payback suggests hes right shes also assembling the same retinue of clinton aides harold ickes sidney blumenthal who made the s such a parade of grand jury proceedings even when she has every incentive to let mr rogan pass to serve her own campaign image she and her allies cant help themselves
