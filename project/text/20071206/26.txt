credit crunch super fund for sivs hoped for &# billion may be half the size the three banks assembling a "super fund" aimed at helping to ease the global credit crunch are scaling back its size due to a lack of interest from financial firms that are supposed to benefit from the plan according to people familiar with the matter originally envisioned as a &# billion fund that would buy assets from the struggling investment vehicles the fund may now wind up being about half that size these people said a trio of large financial firms citigroup inc bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co have been working since september to find a way to provide liquidity for off balance sheet entities known as structured investment vehicles the sivs which issue short term debt to buy other higher yielding assets have been hurt by the credit crunch that has left buyers for the debt on the sidelines due to concerns about exposure to subprime mortgage securities people familiar with the banks plans say they are proceeding with the fund despite the smaller size the banks which have informally been seeking participation from other financial institutions expect to start a formal syndication process within the next several days in some cases the sivs are trying to solve their own problems last week hsbc holdings plc of the united kingdom became the first bank to bail out its own funds the bank said it planned to shutter two sivs and take &# billion in mortgage backed securities and other fund assets onto its own balance sheet it isnt clear if the super fund will succeed in helping to solve the siv problems if not banks that sponsor these vehicles could be forced to take their assets onto their balance sheets that would erode the banks capital bases potentially impeding their ability to lend furthermore accounting rules that would be associated with such a move also could erode the banks financial position already credit rating firms are beginning to take a hard look at the sivs and any downgrades could prompt more liquidity problems and scare off investors the fund would buy only high quality assets from the sivs essentially providing them with ready buyers for assets that havent attracted other buyers the sivs wouldnt be required to sell assets into the fund which is aimed at providing another option for sivs that might otherwise be forced to sell at fire sale prices although liquidity hasnt returned to the markets some of the sivs are balking at participating in the fund according to the people familiar with the situation other sivs such as citigroups have sold billions of dollars in assets and the sheer decline in their value may mean there is less need for a &# billion fund citigroup which manages seven sivs that were valued at &# billion this summer now estimates that assets held by its sivs total &# billion although little was known about the siv business until the credit crunch hit the current crisis has widespread implications for small and large investors although some financial institutions steered clear of managing these vehicles they are still exposed to the situation through money market mutual funds that invested in sivs funds that recently held some of the vehicles include barclays plcs barclays global investors ubs ag charles schwab corp deutsche bank ag bny hamilton funds and morgan stanley meanwhile the siv situation doesnt seem to be getting any better last week debt rating firm moodys investors service said it downgraded or put on review debt totally &# billion that was issued by sivs moodys downgraded or put on review for possible downgrade debt totaling &# billion that was issued by six citigroup sivs moodys cited sivs downgraded &# billion in debt and placed on review another &# billion
