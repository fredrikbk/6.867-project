the not paulson bailout the next time we suggest that the government give advice to the private sector tie us down until the fever passes a couple months ago we endorsed the idea of mortgage service companies voluntarily negotiating with subprime borrowers and investors to avoid a wave of defaults next year now come the politicians to wrap their arms around the idea and maybe give the u s a reputation for forcibly rewriting financial contracts dont cry for us argentina both treasury secretary hank paulson and the white house are touting a plan to freeze interest payments on up to two million troubled mortgages except were told that this isnt "the paulson plan " treasury says its only role has been as a facilitator to get everyone in the room and that the terms are being worked out by the private parties we wonder what these parties really think offering free advice is one thing but when the feds sit down as a negotiating partner the line between moral suasion and coercion starts to blur companies begin to think theyre hearing an offer they cant refuse so perhaps we should call it the not paulson bailout its not as if banks investors and mortgage servicers dont have incentive to avoid foreclosures on their own investors typically lose to of the unpaid mortgage balance when a home has to be resold due to foreclosure so they have every incentive to renegotiate subprime loans that are expected to become delinquent and that process is already well under way treasury sources say that wasnt good enough because this process is costly and complicated without uniform standards so they had to get everyone in the room and "facilitate " no doubt thats true but then contracts arent supposed to be rewritten on a whim they take two to untangle the u s economic and legal systems are built on the sanctity of contract and even the hint that government is compelling investors who now own these mortgages the banks having sold them as bundled securities to take less money puts the u s on a very dangerous road at a minimum it will raise the future risk premium that investors will demand for investing in u s real estate which means it will be costlier to get a mortgage in the future now some of our friends claim that freezing interest rates in this way doesnt violate mortgage contracts when securitizers purchase loans the pooling and servicing agreements normally assign servicers a fiduciary duty to maximize cash flows for the investors in some cases servicers can modify loan terms if this is consistent with "standard industry practice " this plan establishes a new "standard industry practice " we trust everyone is prepared to fight that out in court maybe for years to come because the lawsuits are going to test that "standard" practice claim the not paulson plan has other defects which borrowers will qualify for the lower interest rate payments almost all subprime borrowers will argue that they should benefit from loan forgiveness especially if theyve been responsible and sacrificed to make their payments the problem with imposing uniform loan forgiveness is that you quickly get universal take up rates moreover the evidence suggests that even when troubled borrowers receive a generous reset on their mortgage payments as many of of those borrowers still eventually default the refinancing plan might only delay the day of reckoning and lead to bigger losses in a falling market an analysis by the financial services consulting firm graham fisher calls this "the rolling loan gathers no loss" philosophy and notes its similarity to the strategy that prolonged the "s&amp l crisis and the japanese banking crisis " by the way another part of mr paulsons nonplan would allow states to float more tax exempt bonds to refinance subprime borrowers state housing authorities can now float tax exempts to help first time home buyers but treasury wants to let them float bonds to refinance loans or pay closing costs as well this is clearly a taxpayer financed bailout many in the bush administration and mortgage industry privately agree that this is dubious policy but they plead that its better than the alternatives being offered on capitol hill these include "antipredatory lending" laws and new bankruptcy provisions that are punitive and would delay any recovery in the mortgage market right on time hillary clinton weighed in with the truly awful idea of freezing subprime mortgage rates for five years presumably through the end of her re election campaign in shed combine price controls and contract repudiation an argentina double rather than cave to these impulses however the bush administration would be better off politically opposing anything that smacks of a "bailout " a public opinion strategy polls find that of americans oppose a mortgage bailout more than of homeowners are making their payments on time and they believe it is unfair to pay more in taxes to assist those whove been less responsible theyre right
