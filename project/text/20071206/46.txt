good intentions meet shades of gray in mainstreaming the disabled the issue of mainstreaming is often seen as an either or situation "parents of disabled students push for separate classes " page one nov it just isnt that simple as a parent of two boys who have both been in each situation i can tell you there are pros and cons interacting with the "normal" kids seems logical but the parents of those children dont understand the very difficult and stressful situation in which parents of disabled children must live while many normal students benefit socially by learning to treat the disabled with respect their academic education suffers and this is disturbing to their parents disabled childrens parents may work to teach their child sign language or implement a behavior management system however it is impossible to have what you work so hard for at home reinforced in the regular school classroom this is a tragic situation for most parents and educators regardless of ones personal opinion it is impossible to describe the new jersey parents plight as they pour their heart and soul into finding how to best help their child in this emotionally charged complicated and personal situation rick julien oak brook ill inclusion is like anything else when done poorly it doesnt work and simply calling something inclusion doesnt make it so in the most basic terms inclusion flips the old special education model on its head instead of moving children to isolated classrooms to receive specialized services inclusion requires that the services be brought to the child in the regular classroom the same one that his or her typically developing peers attend far from the disastrous outcomes youve reported when done correctly research shows that all children benefit those with and without disabilities for inclusion to be successful specialists teachers and families must actively collaborate to best meet the needs of children with disabilities there must be active support for inclusion from the administration and ongoing professional development in other words the resources to support inclusion must be in place to allow all children to reap its benefits this was clearly not the case in the situations you described the articles raise valid concerns for what happens when educators call something inclusion but in reality practice "dumping " or simply placing children with disabilities in the same classroom as their typically developing peers rather than using inclusion as a scapegoat for problems in schools we should be providing the resources to support it and allowing all children to reap its benefits pamela winton ph d senior scientist fpg child development institute project director fpgs national professional development center on inclusion university of north carolina chapel hill n c the issue of mainstreaming special needs children is very complex as a retired public school teacher i know that a great many parents agitate for inclusion to avoid the social embarrassment of acknowledging that their children are in a special education program however special ed teachers are trained for just those children teachers in "typical" classrooms have had one or two college courses in special ed and perhaps an in service or two often they resent having special needs students "foisted" on them and are unprepared the social and academic ramifications are huge and must be decided on a case by case basis a kalley b s m ed troy mich the discrimination occurs not when they are educated separately but together their needs are different and the purpose of education has to be for improvement rather than for equalization dr robert o fisch pediatric professor emeritus university of minnesota minneapolis the goal in education of the mentally disadvantaged should be to do whatever maximizes their learning and socialization possibilities in the case of autistic individuals with retardation it is abundantly clear that they just dont learn in the same way as the rest of us as a result the use of mainstreaming into regular schools with the emphasis on absorbing verbal instruction or taking social cues from the teacher fails to effectively educate these children in contrast numerous studies have shown that the applied behavioral techniques in use in most separate autism schools are optimally effective mainstreaming is a concept advanced primarily by two groups educators and politicians who want a cheaper alternative and idealists who want an inclusive paradigm and are zealous enough to ignore the fact that this happier paradigm often conflicts with reality eric p lofgren cranbury n j
