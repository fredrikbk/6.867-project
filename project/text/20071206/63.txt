in defense of hybrids as this newspaper reported earlier in the week more than half of all the hybrid mortgage loans built around initial "teaser rates" have been made to buyers with good credit this suggests that the willingness to take big risks in the midst of a housing boom is not confined to the impulsive or the myopic using the same comprehensive database milken institute researchers have unearthed other equally surprising facts about the origins of the current mortgage mess first a majority of the foreclosures between and september were made against borrowers with prime credit mortgages second among subprime mortgages foreclosed in the same time period teaser rate hybrids accounted for no more than a third of the total while this percentage will undoubtedly rise in coming months it just doesnt follow that hybrids are the true villain of the piece or that regulating away their use would take the air out of future housing bubbles indeed we believe that prohibiting hybrids as barney franks mortgage bill passed by the house before thanksgiving would effectively do would erode the efficiency of the mortgage market by limiting consumer choice propriety data from the san francisco based research company loanperformance on some million mortgages originated since makes it possible to trace the evolution of the current crisis hybrids which offered low fixed rates for periods of two or more years before becoming adjustable rate mortgages were not common until thereafter however they rapidly became popular peaking in before becoming an endangered species at the beginning of but categorizing hybrids as prime or subprime is not as straightforward as one might expect for while many analysts use a fico credit score of as a rough and ready dividing line there is a considerable gray area in lenders practices using the loan originators own standards some million out of a total of million prime mortgages issued between and the fall of were hybrids in the subprime category million out of a total of million mortgages were hybrids true a far higher percentage of hybrids than conventional mortgages have gone into foreclosure of hybrids compared to of conventionals and that gap will almost certainly widen as the teaser rate periods for millions of hybrids come to an end during the next few years but judging by the experience of the recent past very substantial numbers of conventional mortgages will also go south the money question then is how many foreclosures would take place if teaser rates had not been legal or if as the house wishes the regulatory barriers to using them had been more formidable the answer is surely "fewer" but perhaps not many fewer in at the height of the housing bubblemania two thirds of all the subprime mortgages issued were conventional fixed or adjustable rate loans we find it implausible that more than a modest portion of the people with marginal credit who used hybrid mortgages to bet that housing prices would continue to rise would have been unwilling or unable to make the same bet with conventional financing and what is true for subprime borrowers is surely true for prime borrowers who have defaulted on more mortgages since than their less creditworthy peers why should we put up with hybrid mortgages if they make the end of housing bubbles even a little bit more traumatic for the same reason that we put up with car loans with no money down and credit cards that are easy to obtain but charge premium interest rates any limit on the terms of credit exacts a price in both the convenience of credit and its availability the one area here in which we think washington could play a constructive role is in making sure borrowers know what theyre getting into a recent federal trade commission study revealed a third of mortgage borrowers didnt know what interest rate they were paying while half didnt know how much they borrowed tougher disclosure standards may well make sense but in the end it simply isnt the governments job to convince people that some financial risks arent worth taking or that housing prices can go down as well as up mr barth is a senior finance fellow at the milken institute and former chief economist at the federal home loan bank board mr passell is a senior fellow at the milken institute
