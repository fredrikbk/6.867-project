mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i have a year old pc which has a single physical hard disk divided into a small c drive that is almost full and a larger d drive that has lots of empty space i know i can move stuff from c to d but how can i either merge these hard drives or somehow make d the automatic destination for files i download a you can merge the drives into one larger c drive or redistribute space between them by using whats called a disk partitioning utility a program that rearranges the space on the hard disk without erasing your files one i have tested and found that works well is called partition magic and is sold by symantec short of doing that you can change the settings in programs you use to download or save files so that they store the files on your roomier d drive not every program has such a setting but many do these settings are usually found in the options or preferences sections of the software for instance in the latest version of the firefox web browser go to the tools menu select "options " and under "main " in the downloads section you can specify a folder on your d drive where it says "save files to " q in your review of the amazon kindle e book reader you praised its ease of downloading books but criticized the hardware design you seemed to prefer the design of the sony reader which costs &# less but said it offers fewer books if you had to choose between them which would you pick a neither is a compelling product however putting aside price as an issue i would choose the kindle despite its design problems the sony is slimmer sturdier and unlike the kindle it isnt prone to accidental button pushing but amazons device can download books directly without the need for a pc sonys cant and kindles online catalog of compatible titles is books more than triple the number sony offers unless you absolutely crave an e book reader now id suggest waiting for a system thats better than either however if youre going to invest &# or &# now in a device to read electronic books you would likely want the one with the widest selection of titles and the quickest easiest downloading process and thats the kindle q i use outlook express for my email i have been getting a lot of offensive junk mail id rather not even view for a moment is there a way to delete incoming mail in outlook express without having to first view the contents a you can avoid automatically viewing the contents of your email in outlook express and many other email programs by turning off the preview feature in outlook express click on the view menu then select "layout " and uncheck "show preview pane " then click ok after that you will have to manually open each message to view its contents however you may have to open some emails anyway in order to decide whether to delete them since spammers often use deceptive sender names and subject lines that make it hard to decide if they are worthy of deletion so you might consider installing an antispam program you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free of charge at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
