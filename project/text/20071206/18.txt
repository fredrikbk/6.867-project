bush to unveil aid to homeowners starter mortgage rates could be frozen for years political stakes are high washington president bush is set to announce a plan to help struggling homeowners avoid losing their properties including a temporary freeze on low introductory mortgage interest rates that would otherwise jump higher in the next few years the plan expected to be announced today seeks to combat a rising tide of foreclosures by making it easier for lenders to freeze the "starter" interest rate for certain borrowers for five years according to a document being circulated by the treasury department it includes an agreement brokered by bush administration officials between the loan servicers who would administer a rate freeze and the investors to whom the mortgage debt has been sold the agreement sets conditions under which rates on certain loans could be temporarily frozen it isnt binding but because it has the support of major investors it is expected to give loan servicers much more flexibility to quickly rework some loans and direct other borrowers toward refinancings the plan comes as anxiety grows about the economy generally and the troubled housing sector in particular and becomes an issue in the presidential race the stakes are particularly high for the white house which could shoulder the blame if the mortgage turmoil is seen as tipping the economy into recession interest rates on million mortgages are expected to reset higher next year creating a drag on the economy already foreclosure problems are contributing to waning consumer confidence and worries about falling real estate values yet announcing the plan isnt without political risks for the president either even before details of the plan were final it has stirred vocal criticism from some quarters including homeowners who are paying their mortgages and wont get assistance mr bush is focused primarily on helping homeowners not lenders or speculators the plan would stave off foreclosures for people who are making mortgage payments on time but who will be overwhelmed when the low introductory interest rates on their mortgages go up and who dont have the cash or home equity needed to refinance to screen out speculators owners would have to live in their homes the plan applies to loans originated between jan and july that reset between jan and july office of thrift supervision director john reich said this week that the plan could help "tens of thousands" of homeowners for other borrowers who are in somewhat better shape the white house also wants to speed up refinancings through the federal housing administration and other sources for example the administration wants to allow state and local governments to use more tax exempt bond programs to fund refinancings a move that congress would have to approve through a change in tax law one of the biggest points of debate has been how long to freeze rates investors favored a shorter time frame perhaps two or three years while federal deposit insurance corp chairman sheila bair favored a much longer period investor groups have faced growing pressure to be flexible however from both the administration and congress as the white house was preparing its announcement democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton said wall street must acknowledge its significant role in the current mortgage crisis and do its part to help solve it speaking in new york to finance industry executives mrs clinton said wall street enabled and often encouraged risky loans that devastated middle class families and threaten the overall economy
