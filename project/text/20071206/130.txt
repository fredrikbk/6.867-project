wonder land still a dangerous world the most disturbing thing about the national intelligence estimate on iran wasnt the news itself but how the episode displayed the wild and manic swings that now characterize american politics a regular watcher of our politics could be forgiven for feeling that one isnt watching a serious country but a place that conducts its internal affairs like a saturday morning cartoon show thunk boooinng for some time the conventional storyboard drawn for the bush presidency has been that the u s is led by a bumbling elmer fudd who outlandishly overestimates the danger from such imagined threats as saddam hussein syria or irans mysterious looking mullahs prominent political figures here design their comments on world events to fit inside cartoon dialogue balloons john edwards after the nie story broke denounced the bush cheney "rush to war with iran " sen harry reid demanded a "diplomatic surge " these wide all or nothing swings may serve the melodramatic needs of politics and the press but they dont much help an electorate that will vote a year from now to send a new u s president out into the world with or without the nies opinion of irans nuclear program that world is still a dangerous place lets assume for arguments sake that iran did stop its nuke program in why then in was iran performing test flights of the shabab and shabab ballistic missiles the latter with a range of some miles commenting at the time secretary of state condoleezza rice said the iranians "are not unaware that the security environment is one in which if they actually were to do something iran would suffer greatly " but as of this week they might not indeed last week just as the u s intelligence professionals were preparing to tell the world it could forget about iran as yesterdays news reports made clear the world is about to do the iranian defense ministry announced it has built a new mile missile the ashura in september it put on display the mile range ghadr missile if this is all an inconsequential feint its a remarkably big one north korea in july tested the long range taepodong a nuclear payload capable ballistic missile north korea has exported its missile technology to iran and pakistan and of course hezbollah in the same month north korea was testing the taepodong fired thousands of katyusha rockets at israel re establishing the operational viability of short range bombardment china is developing three strategic long range missiles the jl and the df and df a the latter two are mobile icbms this technology did not go away with the cold war in january after much effort to do so china successfully used a kinetic kill vehicle launched from a ballistic missile to destroy a satellite orbiting at miles altitude the bush administrations effort to place a missile defense system in eastern europe as counterweight to irans missiles was conventionally mocked by elite opinion as a re run of ronald reagans "star wars scheme " in fact japan australia germany italy israel and denmark are all attempting to develop antimissile technology france is building a short range ballistic missile defense system the samp t what are they all afraid of saudi arabia turkey egypt jordan the united arab emirates indeed virtually all the nations of the middle east are seeking nuclear power capability possibly its all just to keep the lights on in the tourist hotels but nuclear energy production is still a dual use technology it is now believed that israel bombed syria in september to destroy a nuclear bomb facility built in part by north korea this is a more complex and hair trigger world than the cold war years between the u s and soviet union the idea that george bushs handling of all these volatile moving pieces has been "incompetent" and has "isolated" the u s is a dangerous caricature though that caricature is the way our roller derby politics has chosen to talk about the world the nie iran drama this week is a case study reduced in press reports to another bush intelligence "flip flop " as though the president wrote this stuff himself in the oval office barack obama hillary clinton john edwards rudy giuliani mitt romney john mccain and even mike huckabee want us to entrust them with managing the worlds flourishing threats has any offered sufficient reason why we should in other political systems a candidates strategic policies tend to flow from his party here we mostly get whatever these hyper ambitious individuals choose to reveal during a campaign and the foreign policy views of their party in congress this wednesday after the nies release the democratic candidates had a fresh opportunity at an iowa debate to describe how their presidencies would address iran and the world john edwards chose to attack sen clinton for voting in september to label irans revolutionary guards as terrorists she and sen obama along with democrats in congress said the new iran intelligence estimate now mandates diplomacy only sen obama "they should have stopped the saber rattling should have never started it and they need now to aggressively move on the diplomatic front " but in a july essay for foreign affairs sen obama said nuclear weapons "in the hands of a radical theocracy" is "too dangerous " while he favored "tough minded" diplomacy with iran "we must not rule out using military force " which version is one supposed to believe the candidates seeking votes from their partys pacifists or the person who wants to represent his countrys interests in a hostile world one would like more on this than were getting from the candidates in both parties but the democrats especially have tied themselves to the word "diplomacy " giving the impression that the u s can literally talk its way out of any bad outcomes that iran syria north korea or free agent terrorists have planned for us put it this way would they like israel have bombed that factory in syria without pre discussing it with bashar assad or kim jong il no candidates answer to that will make everyone happy but the more than million americans wholl vote next year need a better idea than theyve got of how the next president plans to deal with the world not the cartoon world but the real world
