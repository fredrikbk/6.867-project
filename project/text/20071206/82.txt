obese kids face higher risk of heart disease in adulthood adding fuel to the claim that childhood obesity is becoming a major public health threat a large new study shows a strong link between childrens weight and their risk of developing coronary heart disease in adulthood the report published in the new england journal of medicine today examines the health records of more than danish schoolchildren born from through researchers found that as the children ages through gained even moderate amounts of weight their risk for heart disease later in life increased the greater the increase in the childrens weight the higher their risk adding credibility to the analysis the findings were consistent in each time period included in the study which covered decades before childhood obesity was considered a problem measuring childrens body mass index or bmi researchers found the association between heavier children and adult heart disease risk was present in both genders but stronger in boys than in girls who tend to develop heart disease later the average year old boy in the study feet inch tall and pounds had an risk of a cardiovascular event before the age of but for boys the same age who weighed pounds their risk of cardiovascular problems was about a third higher that doesnt bode well for modern american children who tend to be heavier than those in the danish study says david ludwig a doctor who directs the optimal weight for life program at childrens hospital in boston today one third of u s children and adolescents are considered either overweight or obese are above the th percentile in bmi meaning they are obese according to dr ludwig the author of a perspective accompanying the danish study which warns that the most devastating effects of the childhood obesity epidemic are yet to come previous studies have suggested the link between childhood obesity and adult heart disease but the danish study is the largest and most comprehensive analysis because the researchers gained access to national health data on virtually all schoolchildren in copenhagen and tracked them until when they were between and years old of the subjects followed men and women either received a diagnosis of coronary heart disease as adults or died of it jennifer baker an epidemiologist at the institute of preventive medicine center for health and society in copenhagen and the studys lead author said because higher bmi is associated with higher cardiovascular risk throughout the year study period "this indicates a biological factor underlying the association " but she said that doesnt mean that all overweight children are doomed "in our study at age the risks were moderate but by the age of the risks had increased dramatically " she said "this suggests that even in the short period of childhood theres a possibility of intervention to help these children reduce their future risk " in a separate article also published in the medical journal researchers used a computer model devised by cardiologist lee goldman executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences at columbia university to try to predict the impact that overweight adolescents in the u s would have on future adult cardiovascular disease by the researchers estimate the prevalence of coronary heart disease in to year olds will increase by as much as more than excess cases will be attributable to the increase in obesity they report dr goldman says the dramatic declines in death rates from heart disease over the past years could be undermined by the rise in childhood obesity while obesity alone isnt a risk factor he says it worsens other known risk factors for heart disease high cholesterol hypertension and diabetes keith winstein contributed to this article
