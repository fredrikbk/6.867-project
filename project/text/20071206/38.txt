faas runway safety work still falls short gao says washington the federal aviation administrations efforts to stop a growing number of safety breaches on airport runways are significantly flawed a government study concluded after peaking in decreasing and holding steady for a few years the number of "runway incursions" rose in the year ended sept according to a government accountability office review of faa data the incidents involve two planes or a plane and a service vehicle that fail to keep far enough apart and thus raise the risk of a collision pilots cause most incidents followed by air traffic controllers in many cases the threat of collision is small but other incidents require immediate action to prevent a fatal crash on july for example two jets carrying people nearly collided at the fort lauderdale fla airport when a boeing touched down just as an airbus a approached the same runway a preliminary report by the national transportation safety board found the two planes missed each other by less than feet the gao report found that the number of these serious incidents declined slightly the gao congresss investigative arm said that the faa is taking steps to address the problem but that the safety plan is riddled with flaws leadership shortcomings have left local aviation officials to figure out solutions on their own some technologies have generated too many false alerts data on runway incursions have been unreliable and the burgeoning issue of controller fatigue has been largely ignored several democratic lawmakers who have been critical of the bush administrations handling of aviation issues seized on the report as further proof of faa mismanagement "a safe flight begins and ends on a safe runway but the faa is taking too many chances and ignoring too many red flags " said sen frank lautenberg d n j mr lautenberg said he plans to introduce legislation soon to "refocus this administrations priorities to ensure safer runways safer airports and safer skies " the faa defended its plan but said it appreciated the gaos critique "we feel like we do have an effective and aggressive program in place to address runway safety incidents " said faa spokeswoman diane spitaliere "well look at the recommendations made in the report and give them very serious consideration " the faa has accelerated efforts to improve runway safety after a string of near misses in concert with many major airports it is installing new signs on runways and reviewing mishaps in communication the agency is also testing "runway status lights " which could help pilots from crossing landing or takeoff strips at the wrong time but that wont work the gao said until the surveillance technology at many major airports is fixed to reduce the number of false alerts that can lead pilots to abort landings adding to safety concerns and congestion the findings on controller fatigue may also fuel a long running labor dispute between the faa and its air traffic controllers the departure of many experienced controllers attributed by their union to the faas unwillingness to negotiate a new contract that could raise pay has led at least of controllers at facilities to regularly work six day weeks the report said
