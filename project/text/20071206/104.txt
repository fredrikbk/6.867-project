slacker digital player handles the drudgery for busy music fans more than million music fans know the joys of portable digital music players the ability to carry a large number of your favorite songs arranged in playlists of your design on a pocket size gadget but for some folks getting the most out of these players takes too much work or too much money converting cds to music files takes time as does selecting and downloading tracks from online music services and synchronizing players with pcs creating great playlists also takes time and effort some people prefer the old radio model where songs are programmed by somebody else and you just listen plus whether you download songs for cents apiece use a subscription download service for &# a month or sign up for satellite radio at &# a month the costs to keep your portable player filled legally can add up quickly so a new kind of portable player one for more passive and budget minded users is slated to arrive late next month its called the slacker personal radio and its name is meant to refer to people of any age who just want to sit back and listen instead of actively managing their music the new slacker players will come in three models ranging from &# to &# depending on capacity but the music they play will be absolutely free contained in preprogrammed internet radio stations instead of individually selected songs and albums the stations will be automatically refreshed with new tunes via a wireless connection built right into the device youll have to be near a hot spot for these updates but you wont need a hot spot just to hear your music because the songs are cached on the device and youll never have to plug it into a computer the player is tied to slackers free internet radio service slacker com which is already up and running and allows you to listen to music via any standard windows or mac web browser using the service you can personalize your player by selecting from over canned stations or by creating stations based around any of artists these stations will be beamed to your player wirelessly you can even choose which stations are loaded onto your player before the company ships it to you the company a san diego based start up of the same name hopes to make money eventually via advertising on the player and by selling an optional paid premium plan that offers some additional features ive been testing a prototype of the chunky black plastic slacker player which is dominated by a four inch color screen it has two redundant navigation systems a touch sensitive strip at the side of the screen and a wheel on one edge it provides a rich listening experience including album art and other photos artist bios and album reviews the sound is good and the wi fi wireless connection worked in both my home and office the two prototype slacker units i tried however were hobbled by bugs and glitches that the company must expunge by the release date which was originally slated to be this month for instance the players sometimes failed to wake up after going to sleep requiring a reboot the touch strip was unreliable one player failed several times to connect to my account battery life is well below slackers goal of hours between charges the company says it is aware of these problems and pledges all will be fixed slacker isnt the only portable player to offer programmed internet stations the rhapsody service offers similar customizable internet based stations on a couple of players and both the sirius and xm satellite radio networks offer portable players for listening to their stations although the stations cant be customized but all of these players require monthly subscription payments while slackers stations are free because slacker is based on internet radio it has some limitations imposed by the rules governing that format for example you cant specify a particular song to play or skip back to repeat a song and you can skip ahead only six times per station per hour even if you create a station around a particular artist the station will mainly be filled with artists the service considers similar songs by the artist you selected will be played only four times every three hours the player has a "heart button" for designating a song for frequent play and a "ban" button to eliminate the songs you hate if youre willing to pay or put in more effort you can get additional capabilities for example slacker players can hold and play some of your own songs in addition to programmed stations if you download a free windows software program and if you sign up for the premium option at &# a month you get unlimited song skipping no ads and the ability to save favorite songs on the device and play them as often as you like but the basic idea of slacker is to make portable listening free of effort and of service charges if the company can wring the bugs out of its new player and if its ads arent too annoying that formula may appeal to some busy music
