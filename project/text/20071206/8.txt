ahead of the tape is tech bust a blueprint for builders if the tech bust is a prelude maybe home building shares are about to reach their nadir as measured by the dow jones technology index tech stocks topped out in late march then they began a long slide that lasted until october and left them below their peak home building stocks as measured by the dow jones wilshire home construction index hit their peak in july since then theyve fallen the good news if the slide in home building stocks lasts as long as the tech stock decline it has only another two months to go the bad news in the past two months of the tech bust the tech index fell the tech index while nowhere near its peak has staged a big rally from its lows but its important to remember how much more dynamic the tech sector is than housing google wasnt even a public company until it is unlikely well see that level of innovation among home builders so maybe the better model for home building stocks is the japanese stock bubble that burst in japanese investors stayed away from stocks for years if thats right set your watches on home building shares to toll brothers likely has to face the music one way home builders are paying for the excesses of the housing boom is recent sales of their bloated land holdings home builder lennar corp set a low bar last week when it sold house lots across the u s at a discount land values may have further to fall as home prices decline and builders unload excess lots to generate cash that may give some investors pause about toll brothers inc the luxury home builder which has one of the largest supplies of land in the industry based on its rate of sales over the past months toll has enough land to last for years compared with an industry average of years says ivy zelman chief executive of zelman &amp associates an independent housing research firm while many builders are cutting home prices to burn through high cost land toll has largely held its prices but even toll which is fortunate to have a lot of older lower cost and well located land may have to fess up to the increasingly grim market toll forecast that it would write down &# million to &# million in assets in its fiscal fourth quarter and many analysts believe it will come at the high end of that range when it reports earnings before the market opens today "you reach a point where you can no longer avoid writing off assets on your books " says paul puryear a housing analyst at raymond james &amp associates "my gut reaction tells me that toll brothers is perhaps one of the companies with more medicine to take before this thing is over " michael corkery send comments to justin lahart wsj com or michael corkery wsj com
