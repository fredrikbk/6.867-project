day sign up for the e mail here a semi annual forecast from the oecd this morning lowered the groups outlook for growth in the global economy but expects the u s will avoid a recession that reassurance comes hours before president bush announces his governments most aggressive plan to limit the domino like effects of the mortgage mess highlighting just how dodgy a time it is to be making predictions among other estimates the organization for economic cooperation and development the capitalist worlds think tank said american housing prices wont fall sharply and that the u s real estate market will decline in an orderly fashion the plan treasury department officials and the big u s banks have negotiated is aimed in part at making that come true since the primary goal is to freeze interest rates on many riskier subprime mortgages that are soon due to sharply rise and the accompanying surge in likely defaults would only increase any surplus of homes on the market a document being circulated by treasury would make it easier for lenders to "freeze the starter interest rate for certain borrowers for five years the wall street journal reports the new york times says it "would allow distressed borrowers who are current on their payments to keep their low introductory rates and escape an increase of or more in their monthly payments when the rates expire " but it is expected to have lots of limitations that would "exclude many if not most subprime borrowers " the times says citing industry executives who have seen it among the excluded would be borrowers who are late on their payments or about of all subprime borrowers by some counts administration officials acknowledged privately to the los angeles times "that the plan was likely to face objections from low income borrowers who wont be helped and from investors who backed now troubled sub prime home loans that are at the heart of the mortgage crisis " and even before the announcement it is facing criticism from democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates who say the situation requires much more sweeping measures the l a times adds as journal columnist david wessel argues these are not ordinary economic times when the federal reserve could be expected fix the economy by lowering rates and with them the cost of borrowed money and thats partly because it was such a long era of cheap credit that helped create the mess "for years banks and investors lent freely they took big risks for surprisingly little reward " mr wessel writes "now theyre shunning risk big banks are reluctant to lend even to each other for more than a few days and are hoarding cash " and the problems go beyond mortgages to include rising delinquencies among credit card users and people who took out home equity loans the journal today also reports that "delinquencies in the auto loan market are ticking up to their highest level in several years " and mr wessel notes that all these delinquencies are "bound to make banks credit card issuers and other lenders wary " as it happens citigroup bank of america and j p morgan chase the three banks trying to put together a "super fund" that could buy a load of securitized subprime mortgage debt and thus shore up the credit markets are having a tough time generating interest among other financial firms thus they are scaling back the funds size the journal reports "originally envisioned as a &# billion fund that would buy assets from the struggling investment vehicles the fund may now wind up being about half that size " people familiar with the matter tell the journal meanwhile the fbi today plans to launch a mortgage fraud task force that will link together what the washington post calls the "widening net of state and local investigators digging into" the market crisis "investigators are seeking to uncover evidence of overvalued home appraisals shoddy lending practices and alleged irregularities in the packaging and sale of groups of loans that were marketed to ordinary investors state investment funds and big wall street banks " the post says sharon ormsby a section chief in the financial crimes section at the agencys headquarters tells the paper that fbi officials have opened mortgage related probes this year an exponential increase from the past a tough fight for u s energy bill the house is set to vote today on legislation aimed at boosting alternative energies at the expense of the oil and gas industry and the senate could follow next week but as bloomberg reports the bill faces a tough battle for senate and presidential approval the legislation features a &# billion tax incentive package tat includes &# billion worth of taxes over years on the five top oil and natural gas companies bp conocophillips chevron royal dutch shell and exxon mobil bloomberg adds and part of the money raised would fund an extension of tax credits for wind solar and biomass power providers as well as credits for hybrid cars the bill also would require that of power come from renewable sources by southern electric utility companies are hoping the senate will strip out that part of the bill the atlanta journal constitution reports claiming the region doesnt have the same ability to harness wind and solar power as do flatter sunnier parts of the country with democrats needing to win votes to shut off debate several republican senators have expressed doubt that the bill could get through with either the tax provisions or the renewable electricity standards attached the detroit free press writes some similar provisions were left out of the senate bill in june because of a lack of support a japanese sovereign wealth fund legislators in japans governing liberal democratic party are promoting the creation of a &# billion sovereign wealth fund akin to singapores giant investment company temasek "to improve returns on the countrys massive financial assets " the financial times reports the parliamentarians want a concrete plan for the fund by next spring and an actual launch within the year the ft says adding that the fund would be "run by professionals from all over the world " china bans film releases by u s studios chinese authorities have banned the release of american movies for at least three months variety reports the ban began saturday continues through february and could run until may sources tell the paper adding that the order came from political "echelons higher up than the state administration for film radio and television or the film bureau which normally handle movie industry policy and application " the result is that asian and chinese arms of the u s studios havent been given any release dates for the first two months of there seem to be three possible reasons variety says "first the ban is another example of the growing rift between china and the u s as the former becomes an economic military and political powerhouse" like the refusal of a hong kong port call for the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier which was apparently prompted by arms sales to taiwan and a washington visit by the dalai lama second "the film ban is seen in some quarters as retaliation against" the motion picture associations studio members for pushing the bush administration to take china to the world trade organization over intellectual property protection and market access the third reason variety says "is that such blackouts are one of chinas regular exercises in massaging figures so that local films have at least half the box office " also of note new york post
