china buzz complicates bhps rio bid competing chinese offer is considered unlikely but talk could be costly the prospects for a serious chinese bid materializing for mining giant rio tinto are slim despite persistent buzz in the financial markets and the media but the rumors themselves could complicate the takeover effort for rio by larger rival bhp billiton chinas business media and some foreign media have published reports in recent weeks suggesting chinas government and state owned companies are weighing a competing offer to bhps proposal for rio which values the company at &# billion with rio shares trading above bhps u k and australian offer prices the reports have resonated because china is among the worlds largest consumers of key minerals and chinese officials and executives already have expressed concern a bhp rio union could give suppliers greater pricing power for iron ore and other materials essential to chinas economic boom for its part rios chief executive said last week the company had listened to the chinese entities that contacted it but had "not engaged" with them a spokeswoman for anglo australian rio which has offices in melbourne and london said yesterday there "has been no change" in its position most analysts say political financial and logistical hurdles to a chinese bid make one highly unlikely it would be "impossible for chinese companies to succeed" in a bid for rio said mei xinyu a researcher at the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation a beijing think tank affiliated with chinas commerce ministry he cited likely resistance in australia and other western countries to a chinese bid to take over resources on such a scale still the persistence of the reports could nonetheless complicate matters for bhp which also has offices in melbourne and london rio officials have argued that their company is worth far more than bhp is offering and any talk that other suitors might be interested in bidding at a higher price helps buttress their case it could also help rio persuade its shareholders that they should wait to see if other serious offers emerge even a whiff of interest from china "adds mystique" to rio as a target said peter arden a melbourne research analyst at ord minnett an australian investment firm "if no one else is interested it all looks hollow but if there is someone interested then i think it looks better for them even if that someone isnt likely to go the distance " the latest report of a possible chinese countermove came tuesday when a chinese newspaper st century business herald said it had interviewed xu lejiang chairman of shanghai baosteel group chinas biggest steelmaker and quoted him as saying "theres a strong possibility of launching a bid " the paper said mr xu suggested a bid could top &# billion the report caused shares of baosteels shanghai listed subsidiary baoshan iron &amp steel co to rise tuesday and sent rios london shares up tuesday on wednesday rios shares in london rose to gbp &# several baosteel officials later denied mr xu made the reported remarks baosteel would need enormous help to make an offer real the company reported &# billion in cash and short term investments on its balance sheet at the end of last year indeed no single chinese company has the cash for a solo bid which if it reached &# billion would be times the value of chinas largest overseas acquisition to date two of the three major foreign investments by china this year have lost value which is likely to discourage chinese officials from such a move for rio any chinese move would also require the overt backing of chinas government and would face certain political resistance from foreign governments especially in australia home to key rio mining assets australia cited national interest in blocking an effort in by what is now royal dutch shell plc to acquire australian energy producer woodside petroleum ltd however a counterbid to bhps cant be ruled out chinese analysts say because the deal is so important that executives in chinas steel industry and other related sectors are looking at a full range of possible options among the alternatives acquiring a stake in rio that makes it difficult for bhp to secure approval from enough rio shareholders for a takeover to proceed but that too could be complicated not least because the value of the stake could drop if bhp backs away a bhp official declined to comment on the latest reports from china people familiar with the companys thinking say it considers a chinese counteroffer unlikely and bhp may be willing to offer a significantly higher bid that would render the prospects of a chinese rival bid moot bhp chief executive marius kloppers has said he is willing to wait as long as a year to complete a rio deal ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article
