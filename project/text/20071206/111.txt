the s that really counted forge of empires by michael knox beran free press pages &# nations possess a history all their own with ordeals identities and defining events that lack even vague equivalents elsewhere but it is also true especially at certain pivotal moments in history that nations face similar crises and choices though in the end they may respond to them in radically different ways works of comparative history try to map the instructive differences among similar events occurring in different places michael knox berans "forge of empires" is exactly such a work of comparative history examining russia the u s and the unifying german states during the s a decade as turbulent as our own s but with more momentous and far reaching effects in each case mr beran shows there arose a tension between on the one hand paternalistic custom and the privilege of entrenched groups and on the other the demand for new political arrangements and greater freedoms the statesmen in his story alexander ii abraham lincoln and otto von bismarck responded by transforming the institutions and political culture of their societies with acts of "revolutionary leadership " the outlook of these statesmen varied of course as did their success only lincoln mr beran argues followed the project to its logical conclusion of a political order based on liberty and rights he begins with alexander ii facing the crisis of a russia newly defeated in the crimean war a backward economy rooted in serfdom had failed to sustain russia as a great power alexander realized that emancipating the serfs was a precondition for wider reforms but feared rightly as it turned out that such a move would alienate the nobility taking away both their property and their source of cheap labor he took several cautious steps before declaring the emancipation on march and then pushed through other changes to establish something closer to a market economy but alexander with a certain ineptitude had unleashed forces that he found hard to control freedom seemed to imply instead of liberty under law the removal of all restraint anarchy terrorism and a deep disillusionment followed alexanders liberalization and the reforms that russia so needed gave way to reaction especially after his assassination two decades later at around the same time slavery and the sectional question divided the u s and brought war in the aftermath of southern secession as mr beran notes lincolns presidency even before the crisis unfolded had the wider mission of creating an integrated national economy one built on tariffs and the industrial policy of alexander hamilton and henry clay this project along with abolishing slavery underpinned the founding of the republican party when it emerged from the wreckage of the old whigs in such a way mr beran says lincoln and the republicans joined a moral and a material conception of progress the civil war forced the pace of events and made national unity a nearer reality than it might otherwise have been prussia faced nothing like the crises of america and russia in the s but bismarcks revolutionary statesmanship united the german states under prussian leadership in what benjamin disraeli called the german revolution the "white revolutionary " as bismarck came to be known grasped the potential of political reform to reinforce authoritarianism and push along state building as prussias minister president he tamed the legislature forcing it to accept the kings absolute control over the army and crucially its budget german liberals never recovered from the defeat when william ii dismissed bismarck in "dropping the pilot " as sir john tenniels famous cartoon in punch magazine had it the kaiser cast aside the leadership that had kept turmoil in check german politics leading up to world war i saw repeated efforts to leap over internal divisions with aggression abroad in short the system bismarck had created failed to work smoothly without bismarcks guiding hand mr beran makes a strong case that the revolutions of the s and the leadership that created them had a transformative effect not least by inciting a backlash joseph conrad once observed that although idealists come forward at the beginning of revolutions the later stages nurture people with less noble motives thus germanys revolution became prussias war ravaged downfall and russias liberalizing efforts ended up fueling a disastrous conflagration after and america mr beran quotes walt whitman wondering "whether there was not something ruinous in the very success of lincolns revolution " such cultural pessimism in the late th century was not uncommon henry adams and other critics of the "great barbecue" of the gilded age saw something ruinous too their laments set in motion a dark recurring theme in american public discourse freedom has its costs mr beran reminds us along with its blessings "forge of empires" shows just how much events overtake intentions
