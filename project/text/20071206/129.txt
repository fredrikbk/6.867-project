vranos may try to reopen ellington credit fund mortgage bond trader weighs revival attempt with side pocket plan michael vranos blew it with one of his big hedge funds this year now he may ask investors for a second chance mr vranos is the best known mortgage bond trader on wall street but the effects of the subprime debt implosion caught the hedge fund investor by surprise and his ellington credit fund tumbled through october pushing its assets down to about &# billion according to people close to the matter the average hedge fund is up about this year ellingtons november returns havent been determined yet it got so bad that his &# billion firm ellington capital management llc stopped allowing investors to exit or invest in the fund saying oct that quotes it received from wall street traders for certain assets werent reliable because of a lack of trading in vast parts of the market another smaller debt fund also was frozen looking for a way out of the bind ellington is considering putting the funds illiquid assets representing more than of their holdings in so called side pocket accounts used to hold hard to value assets and then reopening the funds early next year according to investors briefed on the possible move that would enable ellington to accept new money to try to take advantage of the credit markets distress according to the investors such a move likely would force investors to wait months for ellington to realize value from the funds illiquid mortgage assets according to the investors the difficulties underscore the problems that even veteran bond traders are having amid the credit market upheaval they also come as asset backed collateralized debt obligations or pools of debt run by ellington face growing problems and even as ellingtons largest hedge fund the &# billion ellington overseas partners which makes bets on higher quality debt rose about through october those gains are one reason some investors say they may be willing to give mr vranos another chance and put new money in a relaunched credit fund despite this years heavy losses these are the latest challenges for mr vranos a weight lifter whom friends once referred to as "captain iron " he was one of the top traders at investment bank kidder peabody group in the early s and his unit was at one point responsible for more than two thirds of revenue at the firm but the huge size of mr vranoss groups positions strained kidders balance sheet as the market tumbled in general electric co eventually sold the firm he left in to start ellington but in the fall of the hedge fund saw steep losses on the heels of long term capital managements collapse and sold assets amid pressure from its lenders but he has led ellington to annual gains averaging more than over the past years through earlier this year mr vranos told his investors that he and his team were preparing for a slowdown in housing but he didnt realize how drastic the effects of the problems would be although ellington doesnt generally make bets on the direction of markets and specializes in relative value trades buying securities seen as attractive and betting against overpriced investments ellington began to see losses part of the problem earlier this year ellington bought more than &# billion of subprime residential mortgage loans from fremont investment &amp loan ellington sold the bulk of the loans to investors in securitization deals but kept some slices of them those tranches have tumbled in value ellington also owned mortgage residuals riskiest portions of the mortgage backed securities which havent performed as well as the hedge fund expected its hedge positions didnt keep pace in july and august as investment banks began seeing their own mortgage debt related hits mr vranos began getting nervous that his lenders would come under further pressure and might stop lending to ellington so he began selling positions to repay lenders but the sales came at a rough time in the market when there were at times few investors willing to do any buying and ellington which was prompted to accept lower prices recorded deep losses on the trades lately mr vranoss bets have been better investors say but he hasnt been able to dig out from the big hole and some of his investors need to get money out leading the firm to raise the idea of putting the investments in a new vehicle other investors say they figure mr vranos will find bargains amid the mortgage market mess so say they may be willing to give him more money to invest if they follow through on the idea ellington has told its investors it wouldnt earn a performance fee on their money in the funds until the firm is able to earn back their losses in the reopened funds but ellington would be able to profit by accepting new investments charging a management and incentive fee on that new capital it isnt clear what kind of appetite investors might have for rolling the dice on mr vranoss fund once again earlier this year ellington tried to raise &# million to fund a new company that would buy up subprime mortgages only &# million was forthcoming the market continues to struggle though some investors have been expressing interest in looking for bargains
