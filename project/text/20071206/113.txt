the evening wrap foreclosing pain online edition president bush unveiled his administrations plan to help homeowners facing foreclosure on a day littered with dour reports on the state of u s mortgage and housing markets at a white house press conference mr bush detailed several measures designed to keep borrowers with subprime adjustable rate mortgages from entering foreclosure at its heart the plan would fight a rising tide of foreclosures by having lenders freeze the "starter" interest rate for certain borrowers for five years the majority of subprime adjustable rate mortgages carry an initial "teaser" rate that holds for two years and then change rates annually or "reset " potentially adding hundreds of dollars to monthly mortgage payments and pushing some borrowers into default with a wave of resets expected to peak next year an aftershock of foreclosures is expected to follow mr bushs initiative includes an agreement brokered by administration officials between the loan servicers who would handled the nitty gritty details of a rate freeze and the investors to whom the mortgage debt has been sold a big sticking point in those talks was getting investors who had purchased the mortgages after they were bundled into securities to agree to accept lower interest payments president bush said million homeowners could be eligible for relief under the plan which includes the rate freeze and helping people refinance into more affordable mortgages the center for responsible lending estimates that only households would be eligible for the rate freeze and says the qualifications are too strict while investors might be disappointed to get a smaller return than they had planned on administration officials can argue that its in their interest to renegotiate rates rather than contend with a surge in defaults that already seems to be gathering strength ahead of mr bushs speech the mortgage bankers association reported that during the third quarter the percentage of mortgage loans that were at least days late climbed to its highest point since and foreclosure initiations jumped across all loan types the quarterly delinquency rate for mortgage loans

was for the quarter up from in the second quarter such statistics have been attracting attention in washington especially with a critical election year nearing during a hearing held by the house financial services committee chairman barney frank d mass raised the specter of tougher regulation in a bid to motivate lenders to modify loans for borrowers facing foreclosure "the fewer mortgages that are restructured the stronger the argument is going to be for much tougher enforcement going forward " he warned the possibility of a flood of foreclosed homes hitting would also weigh heavily on
