fiscally fit gifted child when loved ones swamp your kid with presents its the time of year when calls and emails pour in from our family and close friends all asking the same question "what would gerald like for christmas " its not always an easy question to answer despite our year old sons ever growing wish list when gerald was much younger i balked at making suggestions i thought it was tasteless to compile the equivalent of a virtual bridal registry for our sons christmas gifts but ive since discovered that helping others choose his gifts helps me keep family and friends from going overboard with their generosity and overwhelming our home with toys the gift suggestions i make consider a number of factors including our relationship to the gift giver and often the current state of his or her finances some members of my extended family are less well off than others and this year a few are caught in the mortgage crisis thats put the squeeze on so many homeowners in years past when i didnt specify inexpensive gifts gerald might like i was dismayed to find that some family members generously bought things that probably taxed their budget and with such a big family simply saying "gerald likes anything nerf or star wars" inevitably leads to duplicate gifts and disappointed givers my husband gerrys family is very small but somehow we wind up with the same gift giving dilemma unless i specify an inexpensive game or toy gerald often is overwhelmed with gifts i fear gerrys brother and aunts and uncles feel obligated to lavish expensive gifts on the few children in the family then there are my own divorced parents who insist on buying large expensive toys and bikes no matter how much i urge them to show restraint gerry and i are also blessed with many longtime friends with them giving and getting gifts for our kids is an excuse to get together with the result that more stuff winds up in our already overcrowded homes because there are so many children to buy for its generally accepted that extremely inexpensive gifts are the way to go before i make suggestions i spend time on toy retailers web sites looking for little presents that would please gerald just as much as big toys a &# packet of five matchbox cars will elicit the same yelp of pleasure as a &# remote controlled car last year gerald had just as much fun playing with a &# star wars legos v wing fighter as he did his &# legos classic imperial star destroyer with the benefit of hindsight santa could have substituted the &# robotic dinosaur he ignores with a &# spalding hi bounce ball he plays with endlessly one suggestion i wont be making this year gift cards ive tried i used to urge out of state friends and family to consider them so they wouldnt have to wait in line at the post office to mail bulky toys in practice after two years gerald has nearly &# in gift cards still unspent this year well probably "regift" the cards by using them to buy gifts for others you may wonder why i dont suggest the easiest and most thoughtful gift of all a charitable donation in geralds name dont think i havent tried geralds cousin rylina is autistic and last year gerald and we worked hard to raise money for autism speaks since he participated so enthusiastically i figured many of our family and friends would feel such a donation would be meaningful for gerald some did welcome the suggestion but most said theyd feel bad if all the other kids were unwrapping toys while he unwrapped a charitable gift tax receipt still ill try suggesting a donation again this year concentrating on family and friends who would otherwise be stuck mailing geralds holiday gifts for the rest ill compile geralds virtual gift registry then ill call friends and family and ask for gift suggestions for their kids so i can get started with my own shopping email fiscallyfit wsj com
