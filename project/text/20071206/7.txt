bondss team has trouble deciding whos on first over two days last week baseball star barry bonds tried to persuade top san francisco defense lawyer john keker to represent him in a federal perjury case but the talks started faltering when the multimillionaire slugger asked mr keker to handle his case at a steep discount say several people briefed on the conversations mr keker who charges a &# hourly rate thought the request was ridiculous these people say especially since mr bonds made nearly &# million in salary between and alone mr keker also balked at the players demand to have an out of town law firm review the bills most importantly mr keker was concerned he wouldnt have control over mr bondss public relations and legal strategies and bridled at the prospect of collaborating with the players current legal team mr keker who has represented former enron corp executive andrew fastow among others declined to comment an attorney for mr bonds said he wasnt available for comment yesterday mr bonds was nearing a deal with cristina arguedas a well regarded defense lawyer based in berkeley calif said people familiar with the situation her last minute hiring after the failed overture to mr keker four years after mr bonds was called to testify before a grand jury probing a san francisco bay area steroids dealer and two days before his arraignment for lying to that grand jury about steroids use is just the latest trouble to hit mr bondss legal strategy mr bonds whose arraignment tomorrow will unfold in san francisco federal court has seen his legal moves repeatedly backfire as his lawyers have angered prosecutors and squabbled with one another much of the disarray can be traced back to mr bondss advisers unlike many celebrity defendants who respond to legal woes with flotillas of high paid lawyers and public relations experts mr bonds has largely depended on a high school friend who works as a private investigator and bodyguard for guidance on hiring lawyers and laying out legal strategy say several people working on the case meanwhile his legal team has been spearheaded by michael rains an attorney who usually defends police officers accused of misconduct in state court and who has little federal experience in august the slugger added john burris a plaintiffs lawyer with whom mr rains has a contentious history and whom mr rains didnt want on the case under this team mr bonds has done little to polish his troubled public image and has seen his legal team blindsided by an indictment for which they had no ready public response as a result the year old player may face a prison term of one to two years if convicted at issue is whether mr bonds lied in when he told a grand jury that he never knowingly used steroids or other performance enhancing drugs to gain a conviction prosecutors will have to prove mr bonds took steroids and knew at the time what they were mr bonds has publicly said he has never knowingly taken such substances when it became clear to mr bonds in that he would be called as a witness in the investigation of balco a burlingame calif supplement maker that he had been a client of he turned to danny molieri a high school friend and former police officer it was mr molieri who referred the ballplayer to mr rains a pleasant hill calif attorney who is known in local police circles for being the go to lawyer for police officers with legal problems say people involved with the case mr molieri declined to comment after he was hired mr rains a year old former police officer himself quickly went on the offensive while defense lawyers and prosecutors involved in federal criminal probes in san francisco usually stay in regular contact mr rains did the opposite he publicly accused mr bondss prosecutors of using the grand jury as a "perjury trap" for the baseball player later he was quoted by the new york daily news as saying "ive kicked their prosecutors ass in private ill continue to kick their ass in public " since then his only communication with prosecutors has been a series of critical letters he has sent them says laura enos a san francisco lawyer who handles mr bondss business matters mr rains declined to comment last year after two san francisco chronicle reporters published a book accusing mr bonds of steroid use using grand jury transcripts leaked to them by a lawyer in the balco probe mr rains announced his client was going to sue the authors but rather than questioning the veracity of the books claims the suit asserted that the book was based on illegally obtained information prompting sports columnists to say the suit amounted to an admission by mr bonds because he didnt deny the books allegations the suit was dropped after a san francisco judge declined to freeze the authors profits in august mr bonds tried again to stem cheating charges after boston red sox pitcher curt schilling accused him of admitting to steroid use mr bonds retained todd schneider an employment lawyer recommended by mr molieri mr schneider says he then contacted mr burris an oakland calif plaintiffs lawyer to be in charge of responding to public accusations against mr bonds but there was a problem mr burris had previously opposed mr rains in several high profile cases and there was little love lost between the two in mr rains had threatened to sue mr burris for allegedly bringing unfair charges in a berkeley calif police brutality case the two lawyers also clashed in litigation over a group of oakland police offices accused of brutality mr rains won two mistrials in the criminal case but mr burris nabbed an &# million settlement for alleged victims of the officers so mr rains lobbied hard against mr bonds hiring mr burris say people briefed on the case apart from the animosity between the two lawyers mr rains felt that any defamation suit mr burris might file on mr bondss behalf would yield little result since libel laws generally protect speech about public figures nevertheless mr burris did threaten a suit against mr schilling in august before abandoning the idea still mr burris a former prosecutor says he continues to monitor public statements for potential defamation suits since then mr burris has spoken publicly for mr bonds on criminal and civil issues even though he and mr rains arent in contact when mr bonds was indicted on perjury charges last month mr burris says he learned of the development from reporters he says he wasnt given a copy of the response that mr rains had prepared though mr burris gave extended interviews about the criminal case to journalists "i wasnt part of the process " says mr burris mr burris is critical of mr rainss handling of the case saying he believes mr rainss attacks provoked prosecutors "i dont believe in antagonism for the sake of antagonism " he says had he been in charge mr burris says he would have kept an open line of communication with prosecutors ms enos the business lawyer for mr bonds says mr keker was at the top of a list she and mr rains compiled of federal defense lawyers to recruit for the case while it is possible mr keker could still take the case if mr bonds drops his demands for control the sluggers representatives have contacted other bay area lawyers and he is especially hoping to hire ms arguedas say people familiar with their talks ms arguedas declined to say whether she plans to represent mr bonds mr bonds remains concerned about attorney pricing one bay area defense lawyer who charges substantially lower rates than mr keker says that when the the bonds camp recently contacted him about joining the case his representatives again asked to have legal bills reviewed by an independent firm something he had never before heard
