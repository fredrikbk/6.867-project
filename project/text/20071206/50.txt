heisman is no key to nfl glory university of florida sophomore quarterback tim tebow is the odds on favorite to win the heisman trophy this saturday as the nations outstanding college football player since the colleges serve as a farm system for the national football league and mr tebow is the best player in college he should be a cinch to make it in the pros right not according to history in the modern era of the nfl only a handful of heisman trophy winners have enjoyed genuine success in the pro ranks consider the following in the past half century scarcely one in five heisman winners has become a major pro football star of the past only four o j simpson earl campbell marcus allen and barry sanders have gone on to be voted the nfl most valuable player by the associated press only seven of the past heisman trophy winners roger staubach mike garrett jim plunkett tony dorsett george rogers marcus allen and desmond howard have been starters on super bowl winning teams three of the past seven heisman winners chris weinke eric crouch and jason white are no longer even playing with the nfl last years winner troy smith who won by the widest margin of any player in heisman history is on the roster of the baltimore ravens this season but has not yet thrown a pass the last heisman trophy winning quarterback to win a super bowl ring was jim plunkett in playing for the oakland raiders some feel the reason heisman winners seldom make it in the pros is simple the voters didnt pick the best player in the first place for instance jim brown by consensus the greatest running back in nfl history was a three time league mvp but didnt win the heisman in college neither did such all time greats as johnny unitas fran tarkenton walter payton lawrence taylor john elway joe montana and peyton manning michael david smith of pro football prospectus thinks that the failure of most heisman winners to make it in the pros can be attributed to some basic differences between the college and pro games "in college football theres so many different schemes from the option to the run and shoot that an incomplete football player can thrive in the right college system the right college offense can hide a players flaws but in the nfl those flaws will be exposed " bill walsh a college coach for stanford university and the san francisco ers in the nfl felt it was often a question of maturity "joe montana won four super bowls for us " he told me in a interview four years before his death "but i dont know that he was really the best quarterback in the country coming out of college i thought he had the potential to become the best " but many top college players including some recent heisman winners dont have the luck to be drafted by teams that can give them a fair chance to develop "football " says bob boyles author of "fifty years of college football " "is the ultimate team oriented game where a quarterback cant become a star passer without receivers streaking into the open and catching the ball while unsung linemen mount great pass protection " an example says mr boyles is matt leinart the university of southern californias heisman winner who was considered a cant miss prospect when he was drafted by arizona the difference in the talent level between the usc trojans and the arizona cardinals must have come as a shock to mr leinart in college he was surrounded by all american caliber linemen and playing the same backfield with such pro prospects as running backs lendale white now with the tennessee titans and reggie bush himself a heisman winner now with the new orleans saints at arizona mr leinarts supporting cast has been far less imposing quarterbacking for the cardinals mr boyles notes mr leinart "is sometimes hit more times in a single game than he was in an entire season at southern cal " this season he has been on the injured reserve list since oct reggie bush is experiencing a similar fate with the new orleans saints in at usc mr bush had what is regarded as one of the most remarkable seasons in college football history averaging yards per carry so far in two years with the saints he has averaged just after games the saints are just then there are some heisman winners who perform well despite the teams theyre drafted onto but dont get the recognition they deserve mr walsh noted that tim brown the trophy winner "played years for a raiders team which only won a dozen games more than they lost yet hes second on the all time list for receiving yards if hed have been lucky enough to be drafted by a team with great passers like joe montana and steve young whos to say he couldnt have surpassed jerry rice " for some students of the college game though the question of why heisman winners dont have much success in the pros is beside the point lets give the final word to legendary college football writer dan jenkins who says "the heisman shouldnt have anything to do with the nfl it should be awarded strictly on a guys performance as a collegian its not like a player should have to justify his heisman by becoming a pro star " mr barra writes about sports for the journal
