the expat life when china really is that far away online edition there are trade offs to being an expat living in a foreign land you are exposed to an array of new people places people foods and ideas as long as you remain open to it there is something exotic waiting to be discovered but you give things up too and sometimes you strongly crave comfort stability and familiarity over excitement exoticism and newness i recently discovered this during one of my few moments of true regret about not being home in america that occurred on thanksgiving when i missed my familys last supper friends here sometimes talk with sadness about missing grandmothers funerals brothers weddings nephews and nieces bar mitzvahs and confirmations and other family functions large and small everyone has their tales but weve all made our choices and most of us accept the trade off weve made which seems overwhelmingly positive to me my wife and i have made serious efforts to miss as few big family events as possible as have many of our friends with some determination it feels as though you can have it all but the world keeps turning no matter where youre standing on it my parents recently decided to sell their house in pittsburgh our family abode for years since i was and move to an apartment i supported their decision and i was happy that i had the chance to spend some time there in august kicking around my old stomping grounds and exploring some of the nooks and crannies of the old house i thought i was fully at peace with the whole thing living abroad has largely lightened my attachment to places and things and made me realize how much it is the people that matter i thought i would long for our house in maplewood n j and that it would be weird to return for visits staying on the same street at my aunt and uncles house and staring across the cul de sac to the house that is no longer our home occupied by a tenant that has been surprisingly easy we have crates full of belongings in storage somewhere in north jersey and ive never thought about any of it i thought i had moved on to a higher plateau then my parents house was actually sold the house has been our familys gathering place and refuge for most of my life its hard to imagine it being gone and doing so made me reconsider many of my assumptions and stood on its head my conviction that i was not attached to places but as much as i already miss that pile of brick and mortars what really hurt me was being absent from an intimate family gathering one that felt important to me when they heard the house was sold my brother and sister in delaware and new jersey respectively changed their plans and headed to pittsburgh for one last holiday together in the tudor house where we all grew up i wanted to be a part of it and i wanted my kids to be a part of it suddenly china felt a long way from home part of this is my attachment to my native city displaced pittsburghers are a unique lot with strong feelings for the city we left behind there are web sites dedicated to the pittsburgh diaspora and the editor of editor of one recently wrote me to discuss my different feelings about being an american expat living abroad and a pittsburgh expat living in new jersey perhaps becoming an expat was easier because ive long felt like something of an immigrant ive heard many friends in china say thanksgiving is when they feel the most acute longing for home and extended families but i havent felt that way before this year each year here i have played a turkey bowl football game with a group of americans then limped home to host people always including a wide mix of nationalities and at least one person who has never celebrated the holiday before they all love it and sharing the holiday in this way has been a true pleasure highlighting the kind of easy cultural exchange that can enliven expat life its a big plus on the positive side of the trade off ledger furthermore the first time we hosted thanksgiving and roasted a turkey ourselves was a surprisingly momentous occasion it made me feel like an adult more than anything else had more than getting married having kids buying a house or moving to china it was also one of the first times i really started thinking about some of the ways that moving overseas has liberated me and helped me break out of the roles i used to play without much thought i am thankful to be blessed with a large supportive family but forcing myself to step outside of it for a while has helped me grow up and take full responsibility for myself and living abroad has been a big part of that process still these benefits come with a price which i have not often confronted some long time expats and former expats have told me you dont really grasp this issue until you return to your home country that was the experience of our friends maria and steve barnett who returned to the states last year after four years abroad maria was surprised to realize how much she enjoyed her first thanksgiving back home surrounded by extended family like us she had hosted huge feasts each of her years abroad reveling in the company of friends and feeling a special closeness in sharing something so american so far from home still she says "being back with family this year reminded me of how much we missed while overseas " write to me and ill post selected comments in a future column please let me know if you want to share your thoughts but dont want your letter published read comments by readers on my previous column about voting and remaining politically active from abroad thanks for telling people living abroad where they can register to vote you gave a fair selection of alternatives of course i was delighted to hear that you were able to use our services in china that the government there has not blocked access to our web site this was good news marina mecl director of voter outreach oveseas vote foundation i was happy to discover your organizations web site i found it easy to use and very helpful now well see if my ballot arrives i would like to add one observation to your excellent article "long distance democracy takes missionary zeal " i am currently the chairman for republicans abroad in spain where i have lived for over years like our global chairman chris fusner in my first years in spain i was not very politically active however as i came to understand spain and europe more i came to understand how precious is the american system of government and wanted to work to help preserve our unique american sense of individual liberty by helping republican candidates it surprises me that so many americans abroad live in totalitarian states and yet are willing to work to elect democratic candidates who want to build socialism in america as well this is the reason for my "missionary zeal" on behalf of republicans abroad which leads me to spend hundreds of hours and several thousand dollars a year from my own pocket to support our volunteer organization which unlike democrats abroad does not receive funding from the national committee of our party james levy chairman republicans abroad spain thanks for the kind words living abroad gives many a renewed appreciation for american values and the american system but as im sure you know that does not mean the same thing to everyone living here has helped me realize how fragile some of our civil liberties are and how important they are in separating us from repressive governments and police states for almost years i have worked part of each year ranging from one to months outside the u s as a contract software developer in the french west indies i have spent almost all of every november for that period outside my country and up until i have always been able to find a way to vote even in local and off year elections usually i was able to stop in at my local town hall and complete my absentee ballot some time in october during a quick trip back to the states but after things got very different challenges of the ballots including lawsuits delayed the certification of the ballot by the secretary of state so long that my ballot which by law must be sent by mail for the election reached me the day before the election given that the ballot must again by law be mailed back there was no way my vote would be counted i talked to others like me in similar situations and we found that we had all been denied our franchise we also found that the systems set up to gather the votes of overseas military worked perfectly and all those votes got in given that the expat voter tends to be slightly more likely to vote democrat and the military traditionally vote republican i was not surprised to find that most of the delays came from republican or associated sources in my case as a voter in a state that votes as blue as blue can be the loss of my presidential vote didnt make a difference in the election but i was also denied my say in my local and state races and referenda ed oconnell nice piece the most frustrating thing is having to request the form to get a ballot every year why cant it be automatic and of course with primaries its even worse ive voted for a number of years but im going to pass this year as a massachusetts voter it really doesnt matter any more the only questions are by what margin and for congressional candidates will there be any opposition john zarwan i found out at the last election that you can go to the embassy to vote in the presidential elections my absentee ballot had arrived but my husbands hadnt he could pick up a ballot at the embassy just not for local elections they had a list showing the addresses where you needed to send the ballots the embassy then sent them federal express at their expense to the u s it was a really unique experience there was a handful of us all strangers all voting together helping each other figure out the paperwork and probably canceling out each others votes because of the time difference you can go right up to election day keary liu thanks for the information keary keary liu is a friend in beijing
