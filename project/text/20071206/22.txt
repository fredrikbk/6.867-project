colleges move boldly on student drinking exploiting an exception to federal privacy laws schools increasingly notify parents when kids are caught with alcohol when mindy and tom gunn sent their son away to college this fall they expected the school to send them a bill they didnt expect a letter saying hed been caught drinking but two weeks after their son john enrolled at the university of wisconsin whitewater the school notified them that the year old had violated the campus drinking policy the letter encouraged his parents to talk to him about it and it invited them to call a school official if they had questions "one of my biggest fears when we sent him away was that hed get into the party scene " says mindy gunn of janesville wis "i was glad to know the school will keep track of what he does and let me know " the virginia tech shootings and other tragic incidents on campuses this year have shown that many colleges and universities are reluctant to reach out to parents when there are signs of trouble such as a missing or potentially suicidal student citing a federal law meant to protect student privacy many schools rope off young peoples records from parents and authorities but in one area administrators are increasingly exploiting an exception in the law that allows them to reach out drinking and drugs a growing number of colleges such as texas tech and ohio university are deciding to call mom and dad about underage drinking and illegal drug use often at the very first signs of trouble in an effort to involve parents early on the university of new mexico in albuquerque this fall began sending letters to parents of underage students the first time their child is caught drinking or using drugs a toughening of their four year old policy of notifying parents after a second offense parents "have been an integral part of their sons or daughters lives forever " says randy boeglin dean of students and director of residence life "our challenge then is to bring them into the partnership mode with us " schools say they are being spurred to create or strengthen parental notification policies by new reports of excessive drinking on campuses as well as worries over their own liability for students substance abuse problems the concern is that student injuries related to alcohol use could give rise to lawsuits in addition the tragedy at virginia tech in april where a troubled student killed people and then himself has served as a catalyst for schools to re evaluate how and when they will reach out to parents theyre also getting indirect encouragement from the u s department of education which recently provided new guidance for colleges and universities on the family educational rights and privacy act or ferpa the law that protects the information in a students educational record including grades and disciplinary reports ferpa contains exceptions that allow schools to share information with parents or authorities in certain circumstances including when the school deems there is a "health or safety emergency" or if the parents declare the student to be a tax dependent the college parental notification policies for alcohol and drug violations utilize an exception added in to ferpa that allows schools to call parents if a student gets an alcohol or drug violation and is under years of age after the law was changed some colleges created parental notification policies while others insisted that contacting parents would go against their goal of nurturing independence in their students the alcohol exception is perhaps easier for colleges to use than exceptions for say health and safety where it is harder to determine when to act "what is a health or safety emergency and what is an imminent risk of danger to the student those are nebulous terms whereas the drug and alcohol exception has a direct tie to judicial proceedings so its clear whose responsibility it is to act " says karen ann broe senior risk analyst at united educators a risk management and insurance company in chevy chase md to ensure that all schools understand their options last month the doe issued three new ferpa guides for parents universities and k schools "we want to emphasize that you can involve parents with these students if there are problems " says leroy rooker the director of the family policy compliance office at the doe which administers the law indeed college administrators are eager to find a solution for alcohol and drugs which they say are among the most pervasive and intractable health and safety problems on their campuses a study published in march by the national center on addiction and substance abuse at columbia university or casa found that in there were more than deaths from unintentional alcohol related injuries among college students up since also in students were victims of alcohol related date rape or sexual assault and almost students were assaulted by a student who had been binge drinking for years colleges have been struggling to get a handle on the problem theyve made kids caught drinking illegally take online alcohol education courses and banned alcohol advertising from sporting events now more schools are seeing parents as one component in a comprehensive solution "students are increasingly tied to their parents with instant messaging text messaging and cellphones " says fran cohen dean of students and assistant vice president at the university of rhode island one of the first schools to adopt a parental notification policy in "theres tremendous potential for parents to support the decisions of students " but there are skeptics of the policies as well some administrators worry that notifying parents at the first sign of trouble prevents students from learning to cope with their own problems and campus health care providers worry that the threat of parental notification will make students less likely to seek help for alcohol related illnesses even some parents are voicing concern when the university of missouri announced it was implementing a parental notification policy several years ago a number of parents wrote the school to say they felt the plan violated their childrens right to privacy the university then tweaked its proposed policy now it sends a form at the beginning of each year to parents of new students under the age of and asks them to sign and return it if they dont want to be notified that their child is using drugs or alcohol so far in parents have opted out nevertheless many parents and even students say the notification letters can be useful immediately after his violation for underage drinking at the university of wisconsin whitewater in september mr gunn called his mom and told her a letter was coming from the university she talked to him about being responsible and told him he would have to pay the &# legal fine himself he was also put on probation for a year by the school and ordered to take a &# online alcohol education course now he says he hasnt been drinking since the incident "the policy keeps kids in check " he says "you cant really do anything and get away with it " in may the university of georgia ramped up its parental notification policy instead of contacting parents after a second violation administrators now send a letter home after the first offense at the same time the university toughened its minimum sanctions for an alcohol violation putting students on probation for a first offense and suspending them if they get a second offense while on probation last semester the university sent out notification letters to parents have gone out since the beginning of august says brandon frye assistant dean of students but he says its too early to tell if the policy is successful in reducing underage drinking schools agree that for the policies to work the key is to engage parents "its not just about notification its about involvement " says lori berquam dean of students at the university of wisconsin in the university began calling parents of students who have alcohol or drug violations in certain circumstances such as when a student is transferred to a detoxification center or a student gets three violations a fourth results in suspension when talking to parents ms berquam or someone on her staff explains the schools concerns about their child and asks the parents if there is any background information they may be able to supply if the school feels it is warranted it may recommend counseling tony and lee ann christ say they desperately wish their sons school had reached out to them in february their son brian then a senior at the university of virginia called home and told his dad he needed help he had become addicted to heroin the elder mr christ immediately took brian out of school and sent him to rehab in december he died of an overdose at age after his death his parents learned that the university had caught their then year old son with marijuana in his room two weeks into his freshman year the school had also caught him with beer in his room the next semester the universitys judiciary committee found him guilty of violating the schools alcohol and drug policy in both instances and mandated community service the first time a dean also referred him to counseling the school never notified his parents despite having a parental notification policy already in place officials at u va say the schools policy is to notify parents only after an actual arrest or if there is reason to believe a students health is in jeopardy "were trying to help students become independent adults and manage their own affairs " says patricia m lampkin vice president for student affairs "its a balancing act " brian was never arrested and the school points out that his family did have an opportunity to observe him themselves when he took a leave from school the semester before he came out about his drug problem but mr christ says he nevertheless wishes the school had taken the early signs more seriously "privacy as its practiced today keeps parents in the dark " says mr christ a stockbroker from falls church va this year mr christ encouraged u va to adopt a policy called brians rule in which they would agree to "promptly and fully inform parents" if a dependent students behavior was deemed destructive or illegal the school declined to approve the plan saying it believes its current policies are adequate keeping tabs steps parents can take to partner with schools learn about the law the governments new guide for parents on ferpa can be found at www ed gov policy gen guid fpco index html talk to the school ask if the college has an alcohol policy and how it is enforced get a waiver if the school doesnt notify parents consider asking the student to sign a form to waive his or her ferpa rights some colleges offer such waivers
