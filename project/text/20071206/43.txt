genentechs avastin suffers setback fda panel votes against use of drug to treat breast cancer a food and drug administration advisory panel told the agency genentech inc s blockbuster avastin shouldnt win approval to treat advanced breast cancer a blow to company efforts to expand the market for the drug avastin is approved in the u s for use in forms of colon and lung cancer and had world wide sales of &# billion last year the fda typically follows the recommendations of its expert panels however yesterdays vote was split closely european regulators approved avastin as a breast cancer treatment in march and the drug is probably being prescribed "off label" for the disease by american doctors but fda approval would let genentech promote the drug for breast cancer in the u s and make it more likely for insurers to cover such use genentech which is majority owned by switzerlands roche holding ag wants to market avastin as a first line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer based on a study sponsored by the national cancer institute the nci study compared patients taking avastin or bevacizumab along with the chemotherapy drug taxol or paclitaxel to people taking taxol alone the trial showed an apparent benefit for avastin patients taking the drug had a median increase of months in how long they lived without the disease getting worse median "progression free survival" was months with avastin and months without it but fda officials questioned some aspects of the genentech application the agency stressed that patients taking avastin in the main nci study overall didnt live significantly longer it also said avastin didnt show a clear benefit in a separate study in patients with metastatic breast cancer that had previously been treated several panel members said the lack of a proven survival benefit left questions about whether the drug was truly helping patients "our approval would rest completely on buying into progression free survival " said ralph dagostino chairman of the mathematics and statistics department at boston university "i dont think we have that ability at the moment given the data thats before us " others on the committee said they felt there was meaningful evidence avastin could help patients and an overall survival advantage can be difficult to prove when people may get multiple other therapies as their cancers progress the agency also said there were more safety issues among the patients taking avastin fda officials said they believed six deaths were likely or clearly tied to the drug regimen in the avastin patient group for a rate of the agency attributed no deaths to taxol taken alone genentech officials said this number wasnt clear because of how the studys data were collected agency reviewers highlighted an issue that could have broader implications how to measure and weight progression free survival there has long been debate over what evidence is needed to prove that a cancer drug works if it hasnt clearly helped patients live longer in the nci avastin study the fda said it saw disagreements among researchers over whether and when a patients cancer progressed maha hussain the panels chairwoman and a professor at the university of michigan said she felt there were "too many uncertainties in how data was collected " she said she believed that an approval based on such a study "lowers the bar " susan desmond hellmann genentechs president of product development said company officials "remain convinced that avastin is helpful for patients with metastatic breast cancer " genentech officials said the nci study showed no evidence of a systematic bias despite varying reads of some particular patients results
