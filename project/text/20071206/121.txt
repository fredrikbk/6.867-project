the thrills have gone sentimental the thrills teenager virgin records &# youd think a year old might be too young to take a sentimental view of his teen years or to look ahead to middle age but singer songwriter conor deasy manages to do so with wit and poignancy on the thrills new album "teenager" virgin the dublin based band decided to move away a bit from the southern california influenced gloss of their first two albums and go for a more approachable sound thats a blend of alt country and celtic rock "teenager" brings to mind the waterboys with a touch of the beach boys harmonies but more so their contemporaries the arcade fire and the magic numbers mr deasys lyrics give the disc its extraordinary and entirely affecting dimension "i had a title before i had the songs " he told me when he called from his girlfriends home in los angeles "i wanted the songs to be emotional and direct at first i was in very adolescent territory but it became a record about growing up the title became more enigmatic as the record unfolded " the thrills toured relentlessly even before their debut album "so much for the city" virgin and each time they returned to dublin the center of irelands economic boom they found a changed landscape "if you were in dublin years ago and you went back today youd hardly recognize it " mr deasy said "everyone knew each other now it caters to people who work nine to five theres a lack of respect for the past " finding the town he knew all but gone drove mr deasy to memory at first he resisted the theme "i didnt want to be heavyhanded " he said adding that reportage didnt interest him "but then i started to think what an older middle aged person might make of it " thus the album has a broader perspective and a lovely narrative arc the teenage point of view emerges in the early tracks when the narrator is eager to leave a town he sees as inert and limiting in "nothing changes around here " he cant wait to escape mr deasy sings "if youre looking for comforting words so long " in "the midnight choir " memory is bittersweet "the marching band played for the families through the streets beautiful symphonies they sing a hymn we used to believe in " but then mr deasy introduces his wider scope "ill return under cover of night oh those were simpler times ill return like a river running home " he sings in "im so sorry " and the title track isnt from a teenagers viewpoint but from an older man who is looking back "you remember being beautiful regrets regrets regrets " in the fragile countryish ballad "shouldve known better " he sings "i harbor doubts i didnt live my youth with sufficient recklessness i envy your youth yes i envy your youth i once had big dreams like you girl " the thrills were formed when a pre teen mr deasy and multi instrumentalist daniel ryan his next door neighbor moved from sharing their parents beatles elton john and simon &amp garfunkel albums to playing music together "most bands start out as a group of friends their limitations give them their chemistry " mr deasy said "we were truly horrific but we were so determined the odds are so against you you have to be wide eyed and optimistic " wanderlust led the group to san diego in and after a return to dublin to san francisco a year later choosing san diego as a destination was "so random " he recalled "we figured its got weather its on the beach but we couldnt get into bars for the whole summer wed been drinking in pubs since we were " while in san francisco they listened to bob dylan and the velvet underground augmenting their taste for brit pop bands like blur oasis pulp suede and other descendants of the smiths and he added keyboard player kevin horan "had a serious fetish for the beach boys " the thrills current sound seems the right platform for mr deasys lyrics "my hope was that wed stumble onto something different " he said of the bands new music "i didnt want superficial changes but a real gear shift into something more organic " recorded in los angeles the bands first two albums have a pop sheen "teenager" was recorded in a vancouver studio and overly slick it is not pedal steel mandolins and banjo elbow for room amid the chiming guitars bass and splashy percussion and melodramatic songs that in another context may have demanded grand finely honed arrangements are offered with a charming casualness as if the band just decided to play what felt right even the sparkling vocal harmonies of "theres joy to be found" sit on a loose almost casual arrangement the thrills new music has appealing jagged edges that seem the perfect accompaniment to mr deasys ruminations on people struggling to find their place in a changing world mr fusilli is the journals rock and pop music critic
