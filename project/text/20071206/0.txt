a family cursed an audience blessed iphigenie en tauride metropolitan opera through dec new york stephen wadsworths compelling new production of glucks "iphigenie en tauride" which opened on nov at the met reflects the operas roots in greek tragedy and the composers reaction against the ornamental excesses of baroque opera the action of "iphigenie" exists almost entirely in the music and in the inner travails of its three principal characters mr wadsworths visually austere and formal staging is thus a very different experience from the elaborate physical detail and multiple vivid character interactions that characterized his previous met production handels "rodelinda " the opera is an intense meditation on a bloody family curse the final chapter in the murderous history of the house of atreus iphigenie susan graham rescued by diana from the altar where her father agamemnon tried to sacrifice her in order to pursue the trojan war has spent years in barbaric scythia as priestess of dianas temple forced to perform human sacrifices herself in constant anguish and haunted by the sacrificial knife that is nearly always in her hand she dreams though she does not know of how her mother clytemnestre killed agamemnon and her brother oreste killed clytemnestre the two worlds come together when the tortured oreste placido domingo whom she does not recognize and his beloved friend pylade paul groves arrive in scythia and are designated as the priestesss next victims thomas lynchs remarkable set lit by neil peter jampolis suggested the savagery of the scythians the blocky inner walls of dianas monumental temple glow red in flickering candlelight and a huge coarsely carved statue of the goddess loomed in the shadows at stage left beside an enormous sacrificial altar a narrow cell at stage right served as a separate playing area so that even "offstage" characters remained in view the whole design cleverly constricted the mets big stage creating intimacy and intimidation at the same time the chorus was used sculpturally and symbolically the priestesses in martin pakledinazs earth toned robes and turbans and the soldiers were integrated with a dozen dancers choreographed by daniel pelzig with exotic ferocity as whirling dervishes and cossack leapers agamemnon and clytemnestre nonsinging actors also appeared in one poignant moment iphigenie and oreste mysteriously drawn to each other crouched on either side of a wall that dissolved to reveal their mother standing between them her hands on their heads the concluding moments of the opera featured a silent little psychodrama as iphigenie came to grips with the fact that her brother had murdered her mother and forgave him it all made perfect sense particularly in the first half which has the best music and the tightest dramatic structure louis langrees conducting muscular yet sensitive sculpted the narrative emphasizing both variety and continuity in this somber rather oppressive tale the singing of the three principals was impassioned ms grahams richly detailed iphigenie was filled with warmth and despair mr grovess bright tenor brought force and intelligence to pylade and mr domingos clarion sound was also impressive though he seemed at times to be channeling siegmund in "die walkure " having the usually baritone role of oreste sung in a tenor adaptation however eliminated some of the contrast and tension of the crucial oreste pylade relationship indeed the interaction of the three characters sometimes seemed a little abstract the intention was there but it was not entirely realized by the performers in the brief role of the scythian king thoas baritone william shimell let the characters fury and instability affect his pitch which was uncertain the well prepared chorus was beautifully tuned and like its greek predecessor a character in itself college park md the big edward hopper show at the national gallery through jan has relatively few paintings with people in them and those people usually isolated often seem like architectural elements as much explorations of light shadow and geometry as hoppers lighthouses on the maine coast but composer john musto and librettist mark campbell have animated five hopper paintings and turned them into "later the same evening " an minute opera commissioned by the national gallery the clarice smith performing arts center and the university of maryland school of music the piece was given its premiere on campus by the singers of the universitys maryland opera studio and the national gallery orchestra at the smith center the creators whose previous collaboration "volpone " was a brightly textured comedy balanced humor with pathos in "evening " the mysterious figures of the paintings get back stories and conflicts the lingerie clad girl of "hotel room " having failed as a dancer in new york has written a "dear john" letter to her boyfriend and is going back to indianapolis the elegant middle aged woman of "hotel window" confesses her dissatisfaction with her late husband as she nervously awaits a new suitor the couple of "room in new york" reveal their troubled marriage all the characters come together at the theater "two on the aisle" where they watch a new musical wittily depicted by an orchestral interlude soliloquies segue into well wrought ensembles the theater of course is a place where unconnected individuals experience a single event though often very differently thus the opera comments on the themes of isolation in the paintings and gives the figures quickly sketched but vivid lives that intertwine drama and banality yet like hopper mr musto is a modernist and while his singable expressive melodies and transparent colorful orchestrations make his music accessible it also has a bracing unsentimental quality some of these brief encounters suggest possible happy endings but nothing is certain director leon major scenic designer erhard rom and lighting designer nancy schertler kept things simple the set is an art gallery displaying the five paintings and chairs are moved around to create the individual vignettes david o robertss costumes reflect the clothing of the painted figures and five of the seven scenes begin as tableaux that immediately come to life standouts in the member cast included lush voiced mezzo jenna lebhertz as thelma the theater usher whose post performance coffee is inspired by "automat " and adam hall whose bright tenor illuminated the stage struck jimmy a non hopper figure glen cortese was the able conductor shaping a lively appropriately picturesque performance ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
