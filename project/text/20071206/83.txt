on style where yellows a faux pas and white is death travelers find business attire isnt right for many countries dressing for a sauna meeting during a sales meeting in scandinavia several years ago michele crockers group decided to finish their afternoon discussion in the sauna in the nude in accordance with regional custom now ms crocker a year old nutritional supplement executive has some advice for fellow business travelers pack a bathing suit for trips to northern europe in case you wind up in a sauna "people talk business in there together " says ms crocker who fortunately had a swimsuit to don she recalls the incident as part of her formative world travel education "i just didnt know where to look " she says todays globe trotting business travel can require extraordinary sartorial footwork far from diminishing travel technology has expanded it and the opportunities for awkwardness eye contact and the warmth of a handshake are vital components of successful trading relationships but that friendly smile will do you no good if your wardrobe makes you look like a rube or worse insults your host "as an executive you have to be humble to the culture " says ms crocker who now travels to places like namibia turkey peru and argentina for her job and theres no end to potential faux pas around the world among the considerations to be mindful of is that many hindus in india may be offended by your finely tooled leather belt and briefcase some shades of yellow are reserved for the royal families to wear in malaysia and white is the color of mourning in parts of asia for the most part a dark well made business suit and conservative accessories like ties belts and simple jewelry will get you safely through business in major cities around the world so its easy to get complacent what with global retail groups making fashion seem similar the world over and chain hotels sanitizing travel with consistent service from manhattan to kuala lumpur times have changed since say my mother who traveled extensively around the world between and taught me to wash clothes in a hotel room sink and twist them in a towel until nearly dry and to carry travelers checks in a hidden belt but there are still nooks of the globe that dont offer a marriott hotel room with laundry service and an iron in every closet just ask paul langner the marine terminal manager for teevin brothers land &amp timber co in rainier ore where he figures the logistics of moving timber around the globe on a recent trip to inspect a hardwood plantation he flew to costa rica drove four hours over washed out roads to the panamanian border and slept in a thatched roof hut a band of howler monkeys provided his morning wake up call before dawn somewhat earlier than called for mr langner who is transitions from suit wearing executive to paul bunyan in the midst of these far flung trips he rolls his business suits in tissue paper and leaves them in an airport locker to be retrieved for executive meetings which tend to take place in the cities that he flies to when he heads to a logging camp he dons a pair of rugged khakis from duluth trading co otherwise "theyd look at you like are you one of them sissy boys " he says "theres dress for success and theres dress for camaraderie " and then theres laundry after washing his khakis in a sink mr langner has in the past fashioned two drying racks from bent coat hangers and shoved one up each pant leg to stretch them taut and wrinkle free another tip comes from a photographer i know who travels with a ball of string handy as clothes line for broken suitcases and all manner of emergencies but you dont have to travel that far afield to face fashion pitfalls carol kasper former medical director of the world federation of hemophilia and a hematologist with the university of southern california has spent years jetting around the world to meet with health ministers and address medical conferences along the way shes developed a set of sartorial rules for professional women that covers much of the world they include avoiding flowered prints in germany where they suggest frumpiness and choosing skirts in japan in china pants for women are preferable "can you get away with plaid well in the u k you can " she says "i need to look respectable professional reliable " says dr kasper who is "its a matter of saying do i fit into this world and its a matter of ones comfort " yet even with decades of travel under her belt dr kasper has stumbled attending a tehran conference she wore a black raincoat over black trousers and tied a scarf on her head in an attempt to respect local expectations for women the tight scarf made her scalp sweat and itch and the coat felt clumsy "two of the men were dressed to the nines in their wonderfully fitting western suits and i felt so bedraggled " dr kasper recalls a better choice might have been flowing pants under a long sleeved loose fitting dress also worth noting for any western woman traveling in the middle east is that women there often use bobby pins to loosely attach big square scarves to their hair for women traveling to less liberal arab countries its often a good idea to check with the u s or canadian embassy for guidance on local custom and expectations according to a book called "dos and taboos around the world for women in business " switzerland is one country where your garments are likely to garner notice for the excellence of their wools careful seams and handsome linings and russians are more likely to buy a whole look from a designer than people in other parts of the world while that may not be necessary for travelers its a sign of how important it is to put your best foot forward dr kasper also advises taking fast action if you believe youve made a mistake such as last year when she entered a conference room in a cairo hotel wearing a long sleeved business suit with a skirt that covered her knees "i found that i was showing more flesh than any other woman in the room " she says "i hurried back to my room and changed into a pantsuit " email christina binkley wsj com
