botox faces worry lines in smooth skin game botox which hit &# billion in world wide sales last year is the only drug of its kind that the food and drug administration has approved as an antiwrinkle therapy but botox maker allergan inc s u s monopoly could end late next year putting pressure on the california company to defend its franchise medicis pharmaceutical corp of scottsdale ariz is set to announce that it has submitted an application to the fda for approval to sell a rival botulinum toxin reloxin for cosmetic use barring a snag in the regulatory process reloxin could start showing up in dermatologists offices a year from now botox shots are the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in the u s with four million injections in up from a year before according to the american society of plastic surgeons last year botox accounted for nearly a third of allergans revenue split almost evenly between cosmetic and medical uses while botox and reloxin arent identical many physicians who have tested them say the similarities far outweigh the small differences competition will be waged largely on price consumer marketing and professional loyalties that tie companies to their doctor customers currently allergan and medicis compete in the arena for so called injectable dermal fillers that treat wrinkles using a different mechanism than drugs medicis sells the market leader restylane while allergan came on strong this year with juvederm which was introduced with a splashy campaign in january physicians and patients are hoping that reloxin will be cheaper than botox whose price has risen steadily "many dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons are excited about the possibilities for a lower priced form of botulinum toxin " says joel schlessinger an omaha neb dermatologist who participated in the reloxin tests submitted to the fda patients typically pay at least &# for botox injections which wear off after four months or so at a cosmetic dermatology meeting in las vegas on saturday dr schlessinger discussed his reloxin trial of patients who were randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a placebo the most common side effect was headaches which occurred in about of the reloxin patients and of the placebo group a finding that dr schlessinger called insignificant the average duration of reloxins antiwrinkle effect was days about the same as botox he said several patients who first used botox and then had reloxin thought the new drug might have "a little quicker time for onset " he added however the test wasnt designed to compare the two drugs so such impressions arent reliable indicators of how the drugs would perform head to head allergan points to botoxs dominance in europe where other botulinum toxins are sold as evidence of its strength the irvine calif company claims an cosmetic share in five european markets where reloxin is sold by paris based ipsen under the brand name dysport ipsen disputes allergans figures and says that europe isnt a level playing field because ipsen doesnt have regulatory authorization there to promote dysport as a cosmetic treatment dysport was originally launched in the u k in and is marketed for various motor disorders and forms of muscular spasticity a week ago ipsen filed an fda petition to sell dysport in the u s for cervical dystonia a chronic condition in which the neck is twisted or deviated cosmetic marketing rights in the u s were acquired by medicis from ipsen two years ago nick lowe a dermatologist at the cranley clinic in london says that both botox and dysport are effective but botox accounted for about of the cosmetic treatments delivered by his clinic over the past two years dr lowe says that botox doesnt spread under the skin as readily as dysport so its easier for physicians to control dysports diffusion characteristics can be an advantage in some patients such as men with heavy forehead muscles he adds dr lowe says he is "pro botox" but has consulted for allergan and medicis securities analysts look to the ongoing u s battle between mediciss restylane and allergans juvederm for clues to what might happen once theres an alternative to botox they estimate that juvederm has grabbed as much as of the filler market despite the strong reputation of restylane juvederm sales were helped by an early physician giveaway program and some modest volume discounting they say more importantly however allergans consumer advertising has spurred expansion of the overall filler market benefiting both companies "botox is more of a household name than restylane but why wouldnt the same thing happen" once there is competition for botox says david steinberg an analyst at deutsche bank ag "were in the middle of a vanity boom so all of the companies involved should win " patients waiting for sharp price cuts could be disappointed he adds the market will become a duopoly and it will be five to years before there are a lot of competitors still the arrival of reloxin could slow or even end allergans annual botox price increases says peter bye an analyst at jefferies &amp co this would help to appease dermatologists and plastic surgeons who have complained vehemently about allergans botox pricing allergan is viewed as "historically arrogant" by some of these high volume users who are thought to be ready to "stick it to allergan" once theres an alternative available mr bye says reloxin could take of the botulinum toxin market in the u s in the second year after its launch the analyst calculates of course the timing of the fdas approval for reloxin is uncertain medicis says it submitted data for patients treated at sites and expects an fda response within months but approval could be delayed if the agency requests additional data analysts say that agency officials may be reassured by the drugs track record in scores of other countries at least two other injectable botulinum toxins are in the pipeline a year or more behind reloxin germanys merz group is developing its nt drug for cosmetic use and purtox is in pivotal human tests sponsored by breast inplant maker mentor corp of santa barbara calif further down the road is a topical form of botulinum toxin that is being developed by revance therapeutics inc a small venture in mountain view calif
