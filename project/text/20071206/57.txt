ibm makes chip speed advance use of optical signals could drastically cut size of future processors international business machines corp scientists described a "significant milestone" in speeding up computer processors by using optical signals on a chip instead of electronic signals within five years the advance could lead to tiny energy efficient chips that process far more information than todays chips process without overheating ibm said the amount of processing that now requires a supercomputer the size of a refrigerator could be accomplished in a laptop in a paper in the journal optics express researchers from ibms t j watson research center in yorktown heights n y described a device on a silicon chip that controls pulses of light through a device called a wave guide will green leader of the ibm research team said "its bringing the capabilities of fiber optic networks down to the level of a chip " fiber optics has remade the telecom industry because it is much quicker and takes far less energy than sending electric signals over metal wires "you can put hundreds of times more data on an optical wire than on a copper wire " mr green said the development is an important step in the emerging field called silicon nanophotonics physics professor tom koch at lehigh university in bethlehem pa saw the paper and said "people have presumed these structures optical modulators are large and theyve reduced it by a factor of " he said he knows of several companies that are working on using photonics to connect racks of computers in data centers or circuit boards within computers to increase speed and reduce energy use ibm is developing the technology on the chip as opposed to between circuit boards or between computers other semiconductor makers such as intel corp are working on silicon nanophotonics ibms technology would lead to chips that mix traditional electronics with optics wave guides or wire like structures on the chip on which photons flow would carry information among traditional processors on various parts of the chips keren bergman a professor of electrical engineering at columbia university who is familiar with the paper said that one of the major challenges in semiconductor design is the limited amount of power that can be put on a chip before it starts to overheat or cause other problems "the amount of energy we expend on moving data around the chip is growing " she says the ibm breakthrough resolves that by using less energy to move data ibm said the technology is likely to prove especially useful in chips that have nine or more processor cores such multicore chips have become standard design for high speed microprocessors as designers put more and more cores on a single chip communication among them is taking increasing amounts of energy the optical technology will permit such communication with less energy "you can put hundreds of times more data on an optical wire than on a copper wire " mr green of ibm said in ibms design a laser separate from the microprocessor chip sends a beam of light to a silicon modulator on the chip the modulator is a very fast shutter that is opened and closed by the stream of data from the processors light pulses are zeroes and dark pulses are ones when the light reaches the next core it is turned back into electrons for further processing
