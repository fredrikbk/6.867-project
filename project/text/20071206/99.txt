politics &amp economics romney to take on issue of faith vaguely speech aims to ease uncertainty over mormonism and to sway evangelicals windham n h the bustling activity of the windham junction country store stopped suddenly tuesday morning when tom eifler addressed republican presidential hopeful mitt romney "later this week youll be talking about your mormon background " the year old said hesitantly and then asked mr romney to comment on the "risk factor" of the speech "yeah actually im gonna be talking about uh " mr romney said at first faltering then recovering "faith in america " he elaborated "im not gonna be talking so much about my faith in america but the faith of our religious heritage " later mr eifler a romney supporter shook his head and whispered "theres a lot to be lost here " mr romneys address today at the george bush presidential library in college station texas will be one of the most closely watched of any so far in both parties campaigns the candidates goal to extinguish concerns about his mormon faith that are damping support among his partys powerful evangelical voting bloc mr romney is expected to be as generic as possible focusing on his upbringing and his family avoiding the differences between his beliefs and those of other christians political analysts say mr romney shouldnt delve into specifics about the church of jesus christ of latter day saints with its history of polygamy and a reputation to some of being cult like "evangelicals regard mormonism as a cult " said matthew wilson a professor of political science at southern methodist university and an expert on the religious right "if he gets into talking about specific theology he has gone off the track " the church has about million members in the u s by not talking specifics the former massachusetts governor risks feeding into another image problem already criticized by other candidates for supposedly flip flopping on issues such as abortion he risks coming off as inauthentic on yet another issue and yet with the iowa caucuses less than a month away and former arkansas gov mike huckabee a southern baptist minister and conservative christian favorite nipping at his heels there mr romney decided to speak about religion since the speech was announced sunday mr romney has been campaigning in new hampshire where evangelicals play less of a role than in the other early voting states of iowa or south carolina mr romney delivered an abbreviated version of his stump speech four times and the same "fiscal responsibility in washington" powerpoint presentation at two rotary luncheons on two different days while rarely asked about his faith mr romney dropped subtle lines as if to practice for todays speech which he says he wrote himself a week ago from a room in the hilton suites in boca raton fla "were by and large a god fearing people " he told workers just off the line at a plastic crate manufacturing plant in raymond n h "even those who dont believe in god believe in something bigger than themselves a purpose driven life if you will " in manchester the day before mr romney was equally vague when an audience member asked him about what he would say today mr romney said he would discuss faith "not a particular brand of faith not a particular sect or denomination but the great moral heritage we have " at several points he mentioned the "inalienable rights" given by the "founding fathers " a campaign staffer later said that in preparation for todays address mr romney read jon meachams "american gospel god the founding fathers and the making of a nation " mr romney is drawing on history while making more than a subtle nod to it comparisons have been made between mr romneys appearance today and a speech on religion by democratic presidential nominee john f kennedy in both took place in texas both men had been badgered by the press to address their faith yet the goal of mr romneys speech is very different mr kennedys catholicism was well known if misunderstood mormonism is relatively new and unfamiliar mr kennedy aspiring to be the countrys first catholic leader spoke about the separation of church and state to calm fears that he would follow the popes orders bruce schulman a professor of political history at boston university says the question for mr romney isnt whether he will take orders from salt lake city "i dont think people want to know about romneys mormonism " dr schulman said "i think they want to know romney is like them " by focusing on his family including his wife ann and their five sons mr romney can help voters overlook his mormonism and "stop the bleeding going towards huckabee " dr schulman said even voters who say mr romneys religion isnt an issue for them recognize that for some it might be after hearing mr romney speak in hampton n h on monday judi arsenault and trisha plante stood toward the front of the auditorium and talked about the misconceptions of mormonism ms plante a year old teachers aide who is catholic said "i think years ago there was a big mystique about having wives so many wives " "the mormon church is so not a part of that at all any more " said ms arsenault a year old stay at home mom who is also catholic "thats so not it " polygamy was practiced by members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints in the s though it was prohibited in the campaign says there is no link between the timing of the speech and the recent polls that give mr huckabee a slight lead in iowa a state where mr romney has led for months yet mr huckabee is undermining a central part of mr romneys strategy for winning the nomination becoming the more acceptable alternative for evangelicals to front runner rudy giuliani the former new york mayor is pro choice and has been married three times "romney became the default option for many evangelical protestants " said dr wilson of southern methodist university for mr romney to slow mr huckabees momentum a key will be to tout his electability his organization including paid staff and grass roots effort outdoes mr huckabees in all of the early voting states he also has considerably more money than his other opponents mr romneys best bet for winning the evangelical vote may be to face off on feb known as super tuesday against mr giuliani dr wilson says "but he has to get to that point "
