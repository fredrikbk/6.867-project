the evening wrap catch &amp release online edition fifteen british sailors and marines will soon be on their way home from iran nearly two weeks after they were snared in the persian gulf bringing an end to a crisis that had put energy markets on pins and needles president mahmoud ahmadinejad called his decision to pardon and release the sailors a "gift" to the british people in honor of easter and muslim observances of the birth of the prophet muhammad it was unquestionably a surprise there had been some indications in recent days that tehran and london were moving toward a resolution british prime minister tony blair had said yesterday that the next hours would be "fairly critical" to untangling the mess but no firm signs that an agreement was imminent then at a news conference where he first pinned a medal on the chest of the coast guard officer who captured the british sailors mr ahmadinejad said that the britons would be turned over "i announce their freedom " he said there soon followed a media covered ceremony in which the britons each shook hands and spoke briefly with the iranian president the men in the group were done up in suits and open collared shirts that appeared designed to echo mr ahmadinejads style of dress while faye turney the female sailor who had figured prominently in a number of videos broadcast by iran appeared wearing a headscarf a few offered some words of thanks to the president who responded "you are welcome" in farsi the impetus for the release remained uncertain though parties on all sides said that the freeing of a senior iranian diplomat who was being held in iraq played no part in the breakthrough mr ahmadinejad told reporters that britain had sent a letter pledging not to wander into iranian territorial waters again but britains foreign office would not discuss the contents of the note and said that "we have said all along we made our position clear " britain has argued that the sailors were in iraqi waters when they were taken and that tehran has offered inconsistent coordinates in arguing its case the two sides had resumed talks in recent days however senior iranian diplomat ali larijani had said that tehran was seeking a diplomatic end to the stalemate and reportedly had talks with members of mr blairs government later today damascus came out to claim that they had played a pivotal role in resolving the matter syrian foreign minister walid al moallem speaking as house speaker nancy pelosi departed damascus following talks with president bashar assad said "syria exercised a sort of quiet diplomacy to solve this problem and encourage dialogue " but if mr ahmadinejads smiling and joking with the captives made for some interesting theater theres little indication that relations between the west and tehran will soon thaw as mr ahmadinejad was still blasting away at his foes the iranian president said hed be willing to rebuild his countrys ties with washington only if the u s "changed its behavior" and defended irans right to a nuclear program which has been the largest sticking point in irans relations with the west the captives crisis perhaps not coincidentally got rolling just as the united nations security council was preparing to slap new sanctions on tehran in the meantime iran seems likely to claim it treats its captives far more humanely than the west does thus the trim suits and the audience with the president for the detainees and some analysts say that iran scored victories by sparking a debate over who controls certain parts of the persian gulf and by forcing britain to break away from the rest of the iraq coalition for direct talks for oil markets relief whatever the eventual geopolitical fallout from the captives controversy oil markets heaved a sigh of relief after the release of the sailors was made public crude oil futures had soared amid the standoff as traders feared that tehran might decide to clamp the flow of oil shipments to apply pressure on the west if iran did shut down its oil exports it would be no small affair the country is the fourth largest exporter of crude oil in the world and whenever iran begins to bicker with western powers over its uranium enrichment program or iraq or whatever disagreement bubbles to the surface energy markets get jumpy indeed the stalemate over the sailors helped to push crude to multimonth highs in recent sessions crude dropped by more than a dollar a barrel early but some traders said that the market had already started to back out iran risk premiums from the price of oil earlier this week and by the close of trading the front month contract on the new york mercantile exchange was lower by only cents to settle at &# even at that crude is still up for the year to date
