politics &amp economics pelosi places big bet on trade house leader seeks middle ground and hopes to keep party united washington democratic leaders have made a bid to keep several free trade agreements alive by pitching a deal on labor and the environment to the white house now the question is whether that approach stakes out enough of a middle ground to win over both the bush administration and a sufficient bloc of the democratic party despite deep unease within her own party house speaker nancy pelosi is betting a tentative "yes " her office believes that if the bush administration agrees to the deal then as many as half the house of representatives democrats would back pending free trade pacts ms pelosi and other party leaders believe the deal could allow democrats to reclaim their traditional pro trade position and pave the way for new bipartisan unity on trade at stake isnt just the fate of a handful of pending u s trade deals with countries in latin america and asia the more fundamental issue is whether the divided government in washington can find common ground that allows trade liberalization to move forward on terms acceptable to both parties the effort comes at a time of rising anxiety about foreign competition amid job losses in industrial states and the increasing flight of specialty jobs to cheaper overseas locales "we have gone from stalemate and a stale debate to perhaps the biggest chance for progress in years " said rep rahm emanuel of illinois chairman of the house democratic caucus who has given conditional support to the proposed trade deal "but this has to be part of a much bigger agreement " getting there wont be easy nearly half of the democratic freshmen in the house and basically all the freshmen senators came in expressing skepticism about the merits of free trade and even if a deal is hammered out on bilateral trade deals the big prize renewing the presidents soon to expire authority to negotiate trade agreements that congress considers on a straight up or down vote would still probably remain out of reach the white house welcomed ms pelosis overture but faces some tough political and policy calculations it wants to continue to push free trade pacts like the one just concluded with south korea the administration also recognizes it must more aggressively protect domestic interests as it did with last weeks decision to impose duties on some chinese paper imports but giving in too much to democrats demands could roil mr bushs political base and business constituencies and risk undermining republican support for his trade agenda at issue is a democratic package that house ways and means chairman charles rangel of new york put forward last week in a last ditch attempt to rebuild trust with the administration on the trade front which collapsed during mr bushs first six years in office essentially the house leadership has offered to back administration trade deals with panama peru colombia and south korea which are pending congressional approval the white house in return would strengthen labor and environmental protections in those agreements and demand terms that expand access for consumers in developing countries to low cost medicines beyond that the democrats want assurances that the administration will back a raft of democratic proposals on education worker training and health care some but not all related to trade deals the strategy carries plenty of risk for the democrats a contentious trade vote in coming weeks could inflame and spotlight divisions among democrats over a sensitive issue at a time when the party has found unusual cohesion on iraq and other issues it also could blur the distinctions between the two parties that helped democrats gain control of the house and senate last year and give mr bush a boost at a time when he is unpopular within the democratic ranks democrats in november won many seats by sharply criticizing recent free trade deals as favoring corporate interests at the expense of employees prompting some to argue that the party shouldnt now steer away from that criticism "if the democrats allow the lines to be blurred they are setting themselves up to lose the very seats they picked up " said lori wallach a longtime critic of unfettered trade who heads public citizens global trade watch marshalling democratic votes or more would mark a clear victory for the white house which won just democratic votes for the central american free trade agreement in if mr rangels proposal clears the house it probably wouldnt face major revision in the senate max baucus of montana mr rangels counterpart in the senate has welcomed the house overture as a "framework" upon "which we can all agree " still house leadership aides concede mr rangel has a high bar to clear in persuading the administration to accept his proposal the democratic demand that u s trade partners must "adopt maintain and enforce" international labor organization standards has stirred sharp opposition in some republican and business circles there is also opposition to a proposal to scale back some patent protections for drugs in developing countries a large democratic faction is also expected to oppose any future trade deals no matter what changes are made mr rangel spent two months haggling over details of a proposal with rep sander levin of michigan chairman of the ways and means committees trade subcommittee and a longtime advocate of tough labor and environmental provisions for trade deals at the same time mr rangel engaged in wide ranging talks with u s trade representative susan schwab on how far the administration could go on march mr rangel asked ms pelosi whether the democrats were ready to push forward on trade she weighed her response over the weekend and met with democratic house leaders the following monday her message said one staffer was that the democrats have "core values on trade" and had to ensure free trade remains "a hallmark of the democratic party in the tradition of president john kennedy " mr rangel presented his proposal to bush trade officials two days later still the rangel package only goes so far even with white house concessions the colombia deal would likely face special scrutiny because of antilabor violence that is prevalent there the south korea deal could also face big hurdles in congress especially from lawmakers anxious to carve bigger market share for u s auto makers and beef farmers in the countrys restricted markets and any bilateral trade cooperation isnt likely to extend to the bush administrations top trade priority securing an extension of the presidents special trade promotion authority it isnt just democrats who are seeking a change rep phil english of pennsylvania is part of a bloc of republicans that wants to rewrite many of the countrys trade and regulatory laws to make it easier for companies to fend off foreign competition he supports the spirit of the rangel proposals but isnt sure they go far enough the reality he said is that "neither party has come up with a formula to convince people to tolerate free trade "
