agriculture usdas new rules may curbsupplies of organic coffeesalon april organic coffee could become a scarce pricey commodity in the wake of a recent u s department of agriculture ruling samuel fromartz says on salon in a decision last month the department said it would step up certification inspections for small farms outside the u s where most tropical crops like coffee and cocoa are grown since farmers are required to pay for the costly inspections themselves the move could prompt smaller operators in developing countries to switch to conventional farming methods says mr fromartz who has reported extensively on the organic food business since the usda has required farms to hire inspectors in order to be certified organic in the past the department had a special provision that allowed small farms outside the u s to be inspected only every few years now however every farm will have to be visited annually as has been the practice for u s farms inspections can cost &# to &# a day a potentially significant burden on farmers who can earn &# annually advocates for small farmers and cooperatives say growers in countries like brazil and ethiopia depended on the system of staggered inspections to be able to afford to ship products to wealthier countries which make up the bulk of the coffee market larger plantation style farms could pick up the slack but mr fromartz says organic coffee is so labor intensive that it is impractical to farm on a large scale plants are grown under a shade canopy on steep hills and need to be harvested and weeded by hand "farmers seeking higher income may make the switch to nonorganic methods tearing out native shade trees and relying on herbicides and pesticides to boost bean yields "
