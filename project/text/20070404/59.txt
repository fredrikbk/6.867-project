how will tribune pay its debts highly leveraged deal leaves little room for error despite tax breaks tribune co and sam zell just took out a risky loan on the future of the newspaper industry now they have to start paying it back the big question hanging over tribunes &# billion buyout deal unveiled monday is this how do they plan to do that given that the newspaper industry faces uncertain prospects financed almost entirely by debt the buyout will leave the newspaper and tv concern staggering under more than &# billion in debt when existing borrowings are included that is about times tribunes annual cash flow a ratio several times higher than typically carried by most media businesses "we think it is possible that tribune is leveraged higher than the total assets of the company after taxes " wrote hale holden an analyst at barclays capital in an interview yesterday mr zell defended the borrowing "the actual debt burden is less than any of the other alternatives tribune had " including the self help option the company was exploring he said "our structure allows us to rapidly pay down debt because of the employee stock ownership plan " to structure the buyout tribune and mr zell are engaging in some fancy financial footwork adopting special tax efficient structures such as the esop tribune also plans to sell the chicago cubs baseball team which could fetch about &# million even so "the transaction leaves little room for error " says peter appert a newspaper analyst with goldman sachs "we feel that given the cash flow that our company generates and the tax advantages of the structure that the debt levels while high are manageable " tribune chief executive dennis fitzsimons said in an interview monday mr zell will become tribune chairman upon completion of the deal and said that his longtime associate william pate would also serve on the board "obviously all you have to do is look at all the other companies ive run and i think it is safe to say ive been an aggressive owner in driving value in everything ive been involved in " mr zell added tribunes properties include the los angeles times chicago tribune and newsday of long island as well as a string of television stations many carrying programming for the nascent cw network mr zell believes the company can be more aggressive in its strategy particularly on the internet to boost revenue according to a person familiar with his thinking but as newspaper investors have learned predicting the future course of the business is difficult a year ago private equity firms such as chicagos madison dearborn indicated they could be willing to pay &# a share for tribune according to people familiar with the matter today that kind of money has long been scared away from the newspaper industry where a decline in ad revenue worsened suddenly last summer mr zells deal with tribune involves a buyout offer of &# a share the esop structure brings clear tax benefits the employee share plan combined with tax breaks available to companies that adopt so called s corporation status will let tribune avoid paying corporate taxes that last year cost the company more than &# million according to a person familiar with the deal but saving taxes wont be much help unless tribune can pay its interest bills and that is where things could get tricky analysts say last year tribune paid &# million in interest on its borrowings which it could easily afford given its &# billion in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization with the new debt load the interest expense could rise to roughly &# billion annually based on an average interest rate of estimated by one bond analyst yesterday tribune is likely to pay a higher rate on new debt than in the past as its credit rating has been downgraded to junk status in the wake of the deal while tribunes revenue has remained flat overall for the past several years its earnings have declined slightly and the company is off to a difficult start for this year with revenue down through march from a year earlier mr fitzsimons tribunes ceo told employees monday that there would be "limited staff reductions" to compensate for the declines in revenue though he added that he hoped to accomplish those mainly through attrition the staff of the los angeles times tribunes single biggest division has been bracing for layoffs for weeks yesterday mr zell met with tribunes general managers and publishers who had come to the companys historic chicago headquarters to be briefed on the deal if ad revenue keeps falling as many analysts expect tribune will have to cut costs another option would be asset sales though tribune says it isnt planning such action selling cash generating assets isnt likely to solve a financial crisis unless the sale price is extraordinarily high whats more despite the tax breaks the new company will have it would still be liable for capital gains taxes on profits from asset sales at least in the next few years s corporations can sell assets tax free after years some people estimate that the tax rate on selling the los angeles times one highly sought after asset could be around which would make it prohibitively expensive to unload directly despite interest from local los angeles moguls such as david geffen it is always possible of course that mr geffen or another potential buyer could try to structure some complex tax efficient structure mr geffen says "im still interested in making a deal for the l a times " mr zells offer beat out a proposal from two other los angeles businessmen ron burkle and eli broad who could still come back with a new offer for tribune a person familiar with mr burkle and mr broads thinking said they are "meeting with their advisers and continuing to study the tribune opportunity " mr fitzsimons said tribune wasnt planning any big asset sales though "there may be some real estate assets we choose to sell off " the person familiar with the deal said any real estate sales would likely be in the "tens of millions of dollars " a tiny portion of tribunes property portfolio which is estimated to be valued at around &# million so the companys esop will likely pay off its loans the old fashioned way which could take time mr zell who is contributing &# million in equity to the deal expects the esop could pay off between a third and a half of the debt within years according to the person familiar with the deal if things go well mr zell stands to profit handsomely upon completion of the deal mr zell will receive a year warrant to purchase of tribunes common stock for &# million corporate debt levels have soared in recent months reflecting the increased appetite for leverage among private equity firms and other investors still newspapers with higher fixed costs and declining revenue are under particular pressure and such a leveraged deal in the newspaper world is untested last year when a group of local investors bought the philadelphia inquirer they were forced to make severe cutbacks in order to compensate for the papers declining earnings
