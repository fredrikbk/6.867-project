vioxx successor faces fda hurdles merck pushes replacement for disgraced painkiller but safety issues linger next week an fda advisory committee will hold a public meeting on merck &amp co s arcoxia a new medication which is part of the same class of drugs as vioxx called cox inhibitors the agency is expected to rule by the end of april on whether to approve arcoxia merck says it is forging ahead with arcoxia because theres still an unmet medical need for painkillers for arthritis "there are obviously a variety of drug treatments for it but there is an immense amount of patients out there who are not satisfied with those therapies " says sean curtis head of mercks clinical development program for arcoxia who will be speaking at the advisory meeting the drug would provide "an additional treatment option for those patients " he says dr curtis says there are a lot more data on cox drugs than there were around the time of the withdrawal of vioxx merck pulled the drug from the market in september after a study linked it to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes compared with placebo critics however complain that mercks major study of arcoxias cardiovascular safety doesnt do enough to prove that the medication is safe since it compared arcoxia to a drug that itself has an increased cardiovascular risk vioxx was a blockbuster drug used by millions of patients during its five years on the u s market the drug had &# billion in global sales in its last full year on the market the purported benefit of cox inhibitors is that they relieve pain while going easy on the stomach older painkillers such as ibuprofen and aleve known generically as naproxen block two enzymes called cox and cox these medicines known as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids can damage the stomach and intestines arcoxia vioxx and pfizer inc s celebrex are a subset of the nsaids that aim to reduce the gastrointestinal problems by only blocking cox some former vioxx users say they would welcome a new cox inhibitor cynthia daube an arthritis patient from rochester minn says she had taken vioxx for several months until it was withdrawn now shes taking an aspirin product which she says is "adequate " but vioxx did work better for her she says and she might give arcoxia a try once it has been on the market in the u s for a year or so "i did like vioxx it did make me comfortable i think more so than what im taking now " she says "i might be interested in arcoxia but i would be cautious after all of the publicity from vioxx " indeed many former vioxx patients complain that the drug was the only thing that worked for them merck says it hasnt decided whether to bring vioxx back to the market eric matteson chair of the rheumatology division at the mayo clinic in rochester minn says some patients have chronic long term pain and inflammation and arcoxia "can offer us at least another alternative " merck tested arcoxia in a massive study called medal that included patients enrolled in three trials the study showed a similar cardiovascular risk for arcoxia and an older drug diclofenac but fda committee members may question the use of diclofenac as the comparator because while diclofenac is not categorized as a cox drug experts including the american heart association view it as closer to the cox s than other painkillers in its class "what they did is say our cox is similar to another cox " says bruce psaty a professor at the university of washington who wrote about the issue in a recent new england journal of medicine commentary "thats not terribly reassuring " steven nissen immediate past president of the american college of cardiology also pointed out that more patients on certain arcoxia doses dropped out of the study due to high blood pressure "i do not believe that arcoxia should be approved " he said mercks dr curtis defends the companys use of diclofenac he says merck chose diclofenac because it is not a cox inhibitor and because when the company was designing the study in there was evidence emerging that certain drugs other than diclofenac might block the heart protective effects of aspirin which the company expected many patients in the trial would take dr curtis also emphasized that diclofenac is prescribed very widely world wide "to judge yourself against a clinical standard like that is very valuable " he says there also may be debate over arcoxias benefits for the stomach the medal study showed that arcoxia was no better than diclofenac at reducing the risk of serious gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers with significant bleeding but arcoxia did have a comparatively lower risk of "uncomplicated" gastrointestinal problems such as less serious ulcers but a recent commentary in the medical journal lancet said arcoxias gastrointestinal benefit "is certainly not large and might not be clinically relevant " wall street analysts are skeptical that the fda will approve arcoxia even if it is approved in the u s theyre not optimistic about its sales potential "we sort of view arcoxia as dead and we dont have any estimates for it " says barbara ryan a drug analyst at deutsche bank if it is approved "it will probably have a very nasty label and they probably wont be able to advertise it to consumers " arcoxia is currently being sold in countries in europe latin america asia and the middle east outside of the u s arcoxia drew &# million in sales in that makes it currently a minor player for a company as large as merck but while the market for these types of drugs has shrunk it is still significant pfizers celebrex the only cox inhibitor currently on the u s market rang up more than &# billion in global sales in and the company this week began a new direct to consumer marketing campaign arcoxias road to the u s market has been bumpy in march merck withdrew its fda application for the drug in order to "better position the product to compete successfully " the company said at the time later that year merck said it would gather more data for regulators on arcoxias effect on the heart it didnt resubmit its application until december then about a month after vioxxs withdrawal in fall the fda asked for additional safety and efficacy data on arcoxia late last year merck submitted new data and also scaled back its fda application for the drug reducing the dosages for which it is seeking approval and limiting its use to osteoarthritis alone not other uses it had previously sought such as rheumatoid arthritis or acute and chronic pain the company says it plans to seek approval for expanded uses later next weeks advisory committee meeting will force the fda to publicly revisit the politically sensitive issue of the cox drugs for the first time since when it won strong "black box" warnings on all the nonsteroidal painkillers and got pfizer to agree to pull its cox bextra off the market the agency as well as its advisers are under pressure to show they are paying attention to any signal of risk the fda is drawing close scrutiny from congress which is weighing drug safety legislation and vioxx has been a lightning rod for critics who have faulted the fdas handling of safety issues the fda said in written answers to questions that it doesnt believe that cox painkillers are necessarily more risky for the heart than other nonsteroidal painkillers for the agency to consider approval a new drugs safety profile has to be "convincingly shown to be comparable to what is known for the class and it does not pose any demonstrated unacceptable risks" beyond the cardiovascular danger of all the painkillers the fda said that means studies big and long enough to provide "reasonable characterization of safety including comparative cardiovascular safety " the fda said safer than vioxx vioxxs maker merck is asking the fda to approve arcoxia a new so called cox inhibitor some details a big study comparing arcoxia with an older drug diclofenac showed a similar heart risk but the company didnt compare arcoxia to vioxx some doctors say the study doesnt prove arcoxia is safe
