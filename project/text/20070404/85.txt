no headline available five years ago this month at the age of detroit real estate tycoon a alfred taubman was sentenced to prison for a year and a day in "threshold resistance " his slim but juicy memoir he writes of walking into jail "most people have to think a moment before they can point to the worst moment of their lives not me " mr taubman goes on to argue not surprisingly that he was framed what is surprising is that he presents a better case than his lawyers did mr taubman writes in an affable conversational tone that makes it not impossible to sympathize with him the first third of the tale nonetheless is dull he discusses his years in retailing and his redesign of stores to minimize their "threshold resistance " which is "the physical and psychological barrier that stands between a shopper and the inside of a store " his first project for the development company he started with his father in was a stand alone bridal shop in his native detroit nowadays his company taubman centers owns and operates shopping malls across the country with the money he made from store development mr taubman began collecting art in the s about years ago he began to focus on sothebys the international auction house with headquarters in london and new york not as a customer but as a prospective buyer operating in the red and fending off an unwelcome takeover bid sothebys was looking for a white knight and mr taubman already had ideas about how to improve business for starters the auction houses staffers should stop being rude and condescending to customers "had they been shoe salesmen" at a taubman mall he recalls of sothebys representatives he had dealt with in the past "they wouldnt have lasted a day " after acquiring the auctioneer with a group of investors mr taubman decided to change its business to business model sothebys went from catering to art dealers to trying to hook the dealers clients mostly art collectors on the theater of auctions that move which had the effect of driving up demand was a key factor in what has been a decades long climb in art prices meanwhile the thriving mr taubman fortified by the prestige of his sothebys connection went on to become a pillar of palm beach society then in january rival auctioneer christies announced that it was cooperating with the federal government in an antitrust probe it unfolded that executives of the two firms had colluded to raise the fees they charged sellers at auction but which executives most of christies top management received amnesty for being the first through the door to prosecutors under questioning sothebys president diana "dede" brooks admitted to price collusion meetings in the back seat of a limo with christies chief executive christopher davidge but she "flipped" on mr taubman testifying that he made her do it this charge he vehemently denied at the time and has ever since the sothebys trial that began in november was one of the more elaborate legal he said she said contests in corporate history mr taubman writes that when the scandal first broke and before he knew that ms brooks would be his chief accuser he had met with her and a sothebys lawyer to discuss the government probe and at one point joked "i dont think id look good in stripes " the "lighthearted aside " he says was "intended to dismiss the unthinkable outcome of my going to jail " in her testimony later ms brooks recalled the episode as one where mr taubman had said to her that she could end up being the one wearing stripes a threat that she might go to prison whom do you believe in mr taubmans hostile portrait of ms brooks she is so accomplished at undercutting her rivals that she should be writing her own book of corporate backstabbing tips he tells of a time when he grew angry with michael ainslie sothebys president before ms brooks who seemed to be perfecting his tennis game on company time in retrospect mr taubman now realizes he became aware that the executive was out of the office only because ms brooks "had put in an elaborate office intelligence network to alert her to every ainslie absence " the minute mr ainslie left the premises "dede would call me with a matter requiring immediate attention " eventually she won mr ainslies job but mr taubmans account of the sothebys affair has a few perplexing moments he grants that he met with christies chairman sir anthony tennant several times but he insists that the only agreements they struck had to do with mundane matters such as not criticizing each other in the press and not "poaching each others experts " he also says that after learning of the federal price fixing investigation "i called dede the next day" a surprising delay and that the two didnt meet until days later but if mr taubman is unable to prove his innocence in "threshold resistance " his argument is sufficiently compelling to leave the reader thinking that he was at worst a bystander he points out that aside from ms brooks virtually every other participant in the conspiracy traced the origins of the collusion to christies specifically to christies chief executive christopher davidge the first man to be granted amnesty by prosecutors and the man who met with ms brooks as his trial comes to a close in the book mr taubman invokes the concept of threshold resistance this time noting that it "existed between the jury members and me i saw it in their eyes as they glared at me from the jury box " mr taubman says he wanted to testify in his own defense hoping to connect better with the jurors but instead followed his lawyers advice and stayed off the stand a decision he now regrets his case was further sunk he says when the judge refused his lawyers request that the jurors be instructed "that meetings between competitors are not necessarily illegal " so what was prison like the aging mogul never quite got there he was held for most of his imprisonment in the federal medical center in rochester minn a facility "loosely affiliated with the nearby mayo clinic " he writes with some humor of bad food if sell by dates indicated that "something should have been consumed by july we were eating it in january" sad visits from friends and a bunkmate who nagged to be adopted one gets the impression that like the actor who says "im not a doctor i play one on tv " mr taubman played the role of gentleman auctioneer at sothebys bumbling along until his lack of involvement in the daily doings of his business landed him in prison while he is able to describe the retailing trade in great detail in "threshold resistance " his tales of sothebys are revealingly mostly about the toasts he gives and hunting parties he goes to his mall holdings "were the heart of my business and my identity " he writes but implicit throughout the book though he wont say it outright is the idea that he was only a figurehead at his own firm tally ho the book is finally a cautionary tale for those who pick a company for the social access it might give them ms peers writes on art and culture for the journal
