oil demand buoys import hub galliano la stationed in a cluster of squat offices in louisiana cattle country a small crew keeps watch over the ellis island of foreign oil in one building in the louisiana offshore oil ports or loop central command complex cameras fixate on three buoys bobbing in the gulf of mexico miles away the buoys demarcate where supertankers deliver crude to the only points on the u s coastline capable of receiving such large oil vessels computers in a second building track loops pipeline as it comes onshore terminating just north of galliano some of the crude will be stockpiled at loop for the rest the process will end days later at refineries from texas to illinois loop has gotten busier as u s demand for imported oil has increased the queue of tankers has lengthened with the pipeline consistently brimming near capacity and the storage caverns always full the once underused import hub is being reviewed for a possible expansion to the pipeline which already carries of u s imports but as the oil industry spends billions to add global production capacity other trends suggest the timing is wrong for the first expansion in loops year history the conventional wisdom holds that even though imports will keep rising much of the foreign oil will come not from supertankers from the middle east but via pipeline from canada "we continue to do studies around expansion " said gary heminger executive vice president at marathon oil co which owns a majority stake in loop "we do not have enough demand yet " the uncertainty underscores the central paradox of loops existence despite playing a central role in securing the nations oil supply the deepwater port concept remains more popular on paper than in practice mr hemingers words harken back to loops early years when the port was seen as more of a white elephant than an import hub as construction wrapped up in the late s loop was thought to usher in the era of the supertanker massive vessels capable of carrying two million barrels of imported oil or up to twice as much as the next largest tanker class the ports designers labeled the finished facility "phase one " building in the ability to double capacity from the original million barrels a day oil companies envisioned a network of similar ports spanning the u s coastline but soon after taking its first shipment loops president sounded a different note "a year ago we were trying to get support to double our capacity but we couldnt get the oil companies to provide the guarantees we needed to finance the expansion im glad we didnt get it " william read then president of loop told the new york times in phase two remains confined to blueprints loop opened for business when oil imports were declining on the heels of the energy crisis and just before the start of a recession five years after opening loop ran at one third capacity and lost money oil imports began to pick up however and the port moved into the black in loop has since been consistently if unspectacularly profitable and notched its highest profits in with &# million in net income on &# million in revenue according to standard &amp poors rising imports have never led to a broader embrace of the loop model however in a consortium of oil companies scuttled a proposal for a deepwater port off the coast of texas over concerns about future demand for foreign oil more recently unocal corp in weighed a deepwater port miles south of beaumont texas but unocal now part of chevron corp shelved the idea after it failed to secure enough pipeline commitments those plans fell victim to what pfc energy consultant paul tossetti describes as chronic second guessing in the oil industry when it comes to building for the future "theres been a great deal of uncertainty about where future crude supplies might come from " he said loops three owners marathon royal dutch shell plc and murphy oil corp are debating whether to implement phase two the project would add capacity to the pipeline the sole barrier to increasing the amount of oil shipped through the port with the space to expand the pipeline already built into loops infrastructure the decision will hinge almost completely on whether enough refiners sign up for the added capacity to justify the construction expense "were still trying to gather commitments to make the pipeline expansion happen " said loop spokeswoman barb hestermann "nothing definitive has been decided yet " on the surface the numbers support a bigger loop u s oil production is expected to increase slightly as large fields in the gulf of mexico come online but energy analysts expect imports to meet the bulk of new demand by refiners will be importing an additional three million barrels a day above present levels the energy information administration predicts alternative ways to deliver crude have kept loop from charging more for its services even as pipeline space has become tight said aniki saha yannopoulos a standard &amp poors analyst a large crude carrier can avoid the port by engaging in "lightering " in which oil is transferred to smaller tankers or barges before being shipped into facilities far smaller than loop the calculus on whether to expand loop also rests on the level of middle eastern crude imports expected to be flat in the coming years imports from nations along the persian gulf last year fell to their lowest levels since according to the eia oil from the canadian province of alberta transported by pipeline is displacing gulf coast crude at midwestern refineries the midwest accepted fewer barrels a day from the gulf coast in than it did five years earlier according to the eia canadian imports rose by barrels a day over the same period data show canadian crude could find its way to marathons garyville la refinery just miles north of loop to meet expanding capacity there mr heminger said loop faces other challenges beyond the canadian invasion venezuelan and mexican crude some of which arrives in the u s via loop is also on the decline mr tossetti said while african crude typically brought on smaller tankers that can offload on the east coast is on the rise either way the middle east will likely play a secondary role in the import picture until new supplies from the gulf of mexico canada and africa decline "its very muddied " mr tossetti said "if you want to look really long term u s crude production is going to go down in the next or years then you have to go to longer haul crude "
