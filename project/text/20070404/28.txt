changing faces respirator testing gets an adjustment some jobs need a mask but diversity is challenge for keeping a snug fit pittsburgh the face of america is getting fatter and longer and thats become a pain in the neck for les boord mr boord is an engineer at the national institute for occupational safety and health a federal agency dedicated to preventing workplace injuries on the outskirts of this city long associated with steel making he runs a person lab that tests and certifies gas masks and other devices that protect workers from inhaling chemicals dust fumes and other harmful substances by law all employer supplied respirators as these products are known must be certified by niosh that they create an airtight fit on a broad range of faces to ensure that they do mr boord a year old with close cropped gray hair and wire rimmed glasses each year puts hundreds of respirators through his labs test chambers using real people but finding people with facial features that match the average face in todays diverse workplace has become more difficult as the american mug has grown wider and more varied in the past few decades as the beltlines of americans have expanded the faces of workers have gotten pudgier the width length and overall shape of workers faces have changed as more women minorities and immigrants have moved into jobs previously dominated by white men of european descent this increasing diversity adds up to only small changes in the average size of american faces but that can have a big effect since respirators designed for the average have to accommodate so many different face shapes and sizes these days about of the workers who use respirators on the job have trouble getting a proper fit from the respirators niosh certifies "faces come in different sizes and shapes " says mr boord americans he adds "are getting bigger " even a small change "can have a big impact on the shape of a respirator " for the record mr boord thanks to polish dutch heritage has what for decades was a pretty standard american visage the changes in facial dimensions that niosh is tackling are tiny mr boords lab has put together one statistical model of the average american mans face that is only millimeters wider than an older out of date version thats about the width of a pencil point the new model face is also millimeters or nearly a tenth of an inch longer than the old one more than three million americans including miners firemen nurses and construction workers use respirators on the job the masks come in all shapes and sizes half masks full face some with hoods some have their own air supplies or use filters to neutralize toxic fumes compounding the challenge of defining an average face for testing these devices is a difference of opinion over which characteristics are most important in ensuring a representative sample one study of facial characteristics that niosh conducted emphasized nose protrusion while a different study pointed out the importance of nasal root breadth the width on the nose near the area where it meets a persons eyes for years mr boords lab has recruited people from the pittsburgh area to test respirators the testers qualify to participate if their faces match a set of dimensions developed in by los alamos national laboratories using facial dimensions taken from air force servicemen last summer tom vogt a year old paramedic and volunteer firefighter who fits the air force facial criteria pulled on a full face respirator with a green air tank and stepped into a foot by foot chamber chilled to to degrees below zero mr vogt who is of german heritage and has tried some respirators for niosh since moving to pittsburgh two years ago spent minutes in the chamber alternately sitting and walking up and down a step box to simulate work he and other testers are paid &# to &# per test session mr vogt says it is satisfying to "leave my mark" helping niosh but mr boord now needs testers with faces different from mr vogts the air force criteria were based on mostly white young and physically fit men a group unlike todays typical fireman or hard hat fully of all firefighters of american health care workers and of those in law enforcement are overweight or obese according to niosh in mr boords lab paid a company called anthrotech inc &# to create a database of facial characteristics in hopes of coming up with better guidelines for selecting respirator testers the company measured the foreheads chins eyes and other features of people from eight states the effort was judged inconclusive for mr boords purposes by experts from the national academy of sciences who reviewed anthrotechs work for niosh they found the results didnt fully capture the diversity of the u s population among other things it said the company relied too much on states with large populations of white americans of europeans lineage and didnt give enough weight to states like california that have large asian and hispanic populations bruce bradtmiller president of anthrotech yellow springs ohio says "its almost impossible" to find a sample that precisely matches the racial reality of america but he adds that anthrotech used statistical weighting to correct any shortcomings in its data and believes the results were accurate manufacturers of gas masks and other respirators are testing new materials and designs to make their products fit a broader range of faces some are working with soft silicone rubber that squishes into different shapes to fill in any gaps others are looking at inflatable fittings to do the same thing in the meantime mr boord is turning his efforts to new statistical models for choosing real life testers one uses the air force data as a starting point but makes the average face size slightly longer and wider thats where the increases of and millimeters come from the other uses complex dimensional data that look at nose protrusion jaw width and other dimensions a paper on these methods authored by scientists in mr boords lab will soon be published in a peer reviewed journal if the paper receives positive feedback niosh may start using the new methods to identify respirator testers in a few years
