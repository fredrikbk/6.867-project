scripps seeks success online e w scripps co s aggressive shift into growth businesses should help it overcome recent stumbles with a push into cable television channels such as the food network and hgtv scripps has evolved from a company heavily dependent on newspapers to one that gets less than one third of its revenue from the stagnant industry thanks to rapid growth scripps shares have traded at a premium to those of its publishing peers although the stock has lost ground recently as scripps doused expectations that it might restructure its newspaper portfolio and posted a slowdown in its online shopping comparison business for investors willing to look past those hiccups scrippss proven track record of shifting resources into promising businesses should translate into success in its next frontier online "theyre faced with what all their peers are faced with a difficult revenue situation " said mike simonton bond analyst at fitch ratings "theyve been able to withstand that with their diversification " some investors are disappointed scripps hasnt been more drastic in its transformation into a non newspaper company and there are questions about its ability to translate the success of its cable networks into the internet sphere still the success of all media companies is tied to their ability to tap fast growth areas and scripps started the process earlier than most with stellar results more than a decade ago the cincinnati company launched hgtv a cable channel about home repair decorating and gardening next was a controlling interest in the food network and several other niche tv channels today scripps generates more than half of its profits from its cable networks a business with better than profit margins and with annual growth while slowing in the double digits scripps generates less than a third of its revenue from newspapers limiting its exposure to the troubled industry now scripps hopes the cable networks efforts online can be the next growth engine as marketers shift dollars online and in particular to web sites with online video scripps hopes its library of cable programming on web sites such as foodnetwork com and hgtv com can generate entirely new revenue streams how much isnt clear but online revenue at the networks leapt last year and scripps is sanguine that it can increase the roughly of total company revenue that its cable web sites are generating said tim stautberg scripps vice president of communications and investor relations "its probably another couple of years before its big enough to move the needle in terms of overall results " said goldman sachs analyst peter appert but "this could be the next big thing for scripps " scripps recently hired an executive from yahoo inc to lead online strategy at the cable networks in a bid to capitalize on advertisers interest in online video it also introduced a new video player on its web sites and online visitors can search nearly hours of cable programming scrippss other online ventures however may have less promise scripps spent close to &# billion on shopzilla and uswitch which allow consumers to compare prices online for products and services investors were alarmed when growth slowed in the fourth quarter and again when just weeks later scripps cut its segment profits forecast for this year success in the business is important because the interactive sites were responsible for of scrippss operating revenue in assuming the company had owned uswitch for the full year the company said the slowdown at shopzilla came after it cut back on search advertising to drive people to the web site in the long term scripps said it will keep more revenue from visitors who enter its web site directly rather than those directed from third parties "shopzilla and uswitch i think will work out to be good ventures " said david carr jr who co manages an &# million scripps investment at oak value capital management "the question is will they be as good as the cable networks overall that remains yet to be seen " there are few peers with a comparable mix of assets though which some investors fret keeps scripps from being appropriately valued "im frustrated by where it trades " said mr carr "theyre still caught up in the world as being looked at as a newspaper company " that makes scrippss stock price perhaps dependent on dumping this business entirely and scripps has disappointed investors on that front in early january scripps stock touched its highest level since after executives said they might separate the newspapers including the rocky mountain news in denver and the commercial appeal in memphis tenn from the rest of the company the stock went on to hit a week high of &# on jan scripps was careful to hedge the possibility the companys stock nevertheless tumbled when just weeks later scripps said it had no plans to spin off separate or sell its newspaper division scripps stock hasnt yet clawed back from the losses its shares closed yesterday at &# apiece in new york stock exchange composite trading shareholders remain hopeful that scripps will find a way to divest itself of at least some of the newspapers a process complicated by the terms of a trust governing scrippss ownership scripps investors said mr carr should trust the company to do the right things for long term success "although we dont like the price right now " he said "this company has done well with growth earnings and production to holders eventually it can be appreciated by the market "
