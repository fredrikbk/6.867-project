investors split on chinese stocks foreign sentiment shifts from market locals hang tight beijing many of the worlds big investors may have had enough of chinese stocks after a record breaking run yet the enthusiasm of this countrys own investors for local stocks is only increasing whom should you listen to even if domestic investors are right it could make little difference to the china focused funds available to investors outside the country as access to domestically traded shares is so limited those investors might be better off taking cues from big international institutions than chinese investors operating in what remains a closed financial system "generally the medium or long term prices follow the fund flows " said michael osullivan senior equity strategist at state street global markets his companys data on the holdings of global institutional investors show they started selling overseas listed chinese shares as early as january and havent returned to the market despite continuing gains in domestic shares as local funds continue to pour money into stocks listed in shanghai and shenzhen both chinese and foreign investors are generally optimistic that the nations

they are doing this year the msci china index which measures the performance of the overseas listed chinese stocks available to international investors fell in the first quarter of benchmark indexes for stock markets in slower growing economies like the u s europe japan and australia performed better yet chinas domestic shares as measured by the corresponding msci china class a share index were up a stunning for the quarter that is surprising because it was the domestic market particularly shanghai that grabbed headlines with the plunge on feb however that turned out to be just a blip in the local markets rise by contrast international investors had begun pulling out of chinese stocks well before that crash and have continued to "investor sentiment turned suddenly in the week ending february a full three weeks before the big selloff in chinas equity market " said brad durham managing director of emerging portfolio fund research since that date global investors have taken out about &# billion from the china focused mutual funds tracked by his firm he said while some money moved back into chinese funds at the end of march it hasnt made up for earlier losses that is part of

of &# billion a year earlier now funds that invest in stodgier developed markets are getting most new money institutional investors have been " gravitating to cheaper regions and cheaper sectors and
