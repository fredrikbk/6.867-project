phoenix retail projects subsidy triggers backlash state legislative push seeks to penalize cities offering such incentives when local leaders in phoenix agreed to a &# million subsidy for a acre urban village called citynorth last month they gave a big boost to a massive mixed use project in a competitive market but they also triggered a backlash that resulted in a state legislative push to penalize cities offering subsidies to retail projects under proposed legislation arizona cities would lose a dollar of state revenue for every dollar they offer as incentives except in certain cases such as redevelopment or historic preservation "we need to put a stop to this " says state sen ken cheuvront a phoenix democrat who is backing the legislation subsidy opponents say the proposed law would prevent cities such as phoenix and scottsdale from trying to outbid each other to attract retail projects in the past five years cities in the phoenix metropolitan area have given more than &# million in incentives to retail developers according to mr cheuvront but proponents of the incentives warn that penalizing cities for subsidizing retail developments would likely send developers looking for deals in other states such as colorado and california the measure might also encourage developers to instead locate on arizonas indian reservations costing the city needed tax revenue adds peggy neely a member of the phoenix city council who voted for the incentive "most indian reservations have the flexibility to make a deal work " opposition to such incentives has surfaced in other cities in kansas city mo last week former city auditor mark funkhouser was elected mayor in part because of his opposition to tax increment financing a popular economic development incentive but such sentiment runs counter to the mood in many cities where local officials are using subsidies to land projects such as more pedestrian friendly town centers in phoenix the issue has sparked controversy in part because a dozen or so cities in the area accounting for million people rely heavily on sales tax making them eager to attract large retail projects phoenix for example derives its &# billion general fund budget from sales tax according to city officials though phoenix mayor phil gordon supported the subsidy to citynorth he has in years past sought to reach agreements with other cities to end such incentives appealing to phoenix area public officials in to "close the public checkbook on these projects " mr gordon says now phoenix cant "unilaterally disarm " but he supports the pending legislation among the most outspoken proponents of the bill has been the local newspaper the arizona republic which says developers are taking advantage of competition for retail projects to win subsidies from cities when they would build anyway "puh leez " said the republic in a march editorial "with the regions growth machine at full throttle success is a given " mr cheuvront sponsored similar measures in and only to see them fail but this year he predicts the bill will succeed in large part because the backlash against the citynorth subsidy has drawn together conservative republicans and liberal democrats on march separate versions of the bill introduced in the arizona legislature passed house and senate committees gov janet napolitano hasnt indicated whether she would sign such a bill into law the &# billion citynorth project which wouldnt be affected if the bill is passed is one of several major retail developments in the works in an affluent area north of downtown phoenix known as the northeast valley it is being developed by chicago based thomas j klutznick co which is partnering with kenneth himmel of related urban a unit of related cos site preparation started in november the project to include nearly six million square feet of retail residential and office space is expected to take a decade to complete klutznick has already announced a nordstrom department store as an anchor tenant "its a true urban core for the northeast valley " says john klutznick vice president at thomas j klutznick adding that the streetscapes for the project are inspired by famous urban corridors such as bostons newberry street and oak street in chicago mr klutznick says citynorth couldnt be built as planned without the subsidy the phoenix city council approved the incentive by a vote on march agreeing to rebate of the citys share of sales tax up to &# million or for years whichever comes first phoenix officials say the subsidy and structured parking as opposed to surface lots will ensure a project with attractive public spaces and a more urban feel corrections &amp amplifications the streetscapes planned for a retail project in phoenix known as citynorth are inspired in part by bostons newbury street an article in wednesdays property report incorrectly identified the street as newberry street wsj april
