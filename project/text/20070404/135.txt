the informed patient hospitals target risks of color wristbands hospitals are banding together to reduce the risk of deadly errors from an unexpected source mix ups over colored wristbands used to alert staffers to critical information about the most vulnerable patients in recent years hospitals have widely adopted color coded wristbands as visual cues reminding staffers to check for medication allergies special risks and even the existence of a signed end of life document known as a do not resuscitate order but with no standard guides to designate specific meanings for each color the wristbands designed to protect patients are actually increasing the risk of harm safety experts say endangering patients transferred between hospitals and confusing nurses and doctors who rotate among several hospitals where yellow might mean "do not resuscitate" in one and "restricted extremity for blood draw" in another to address the problem a number of hospitals around the country have formed groups to standardize color designations in their states and regions they are limiting the number of colors and bands to avoid confusion and taking steps to ensure that labels and stickers used in patients medical records correspond with the colors and meanings used on the wristbands hospitals are also purchasing bands embossed with pre printed messages to reinforce the meanings such as "allergy" or "fall risk" and asking both patients and staffers to remove any colored charity or social cause bracelets that might add to the confusion hospitals have long tagged every patient admitted to a hospital with a standard issue clear or white wristband made of reinforced paper or plastic with identifying data such as the patients name and birth date in recent years some have added bar codes that can be scanned to verify identity and check medications against the patients medical record new radio frequency identification technology if widely adopted will enable hospitals to use wristbands embedded with special chips both to track patient movement in a hospital and to access important information about allergies medications and special orders but the majority of hospitals in the country have yet to invest in such technology and still rely on more archaic paper systems for them color coded wristbands can provide an extra safety net in a chaotic setting many are modeling their wristband initiatives on guidelines developed by a group of hospitals in northeastern pennsylvania where hospitals started a grass roots "color of safety" task force last year this followed a report by pennsylvanias patient safety authority an independent state agency that a patient almost died during cardiac arrest because she was incorrectly designated "do not resuscitate" with a yellow wristband the nurse who did it had worked in another hospital where yellow meant something else the mistake was discovered and the patient was resuscitated according to the safety commission "every day our patients are transferred into acute care hospitals where the color banding was totally different from ours so on a daily basis we were putting our patients at risk " says bonnie haluska chairman of the color of safety task force and assistant vice president of inpatient services at allied services rehabilitation hospital in scranton while of the hospitals surveyed in the state used color coded wristbands there was no single standard so allied working with other hospitals in the region developed five standard color definitions and created manuals and brochures explaining the program for both hospitals and consumers the state safety authority which has shared the results of the work with several other state groups developing their own programs provides the materials for free online through its web site psa state pa us the western region alliance for patient safety formed last year to help the nonprofit institute for healthcare improvements " million lives" national safety campaign used resources from the pennsylvania effort for its own project to standardize wristband alert colors for hospitals in seven western states last month the new mexico hospital association which is also part of the alliance announced its own statewide voluntary initiative to standardize color coded wristbands used in member hospitals this followed a survey in january that found wide variation in the use and colors of wristbands in the state with at least seven different colors used to designate that a patient doesnt want to be resuscitated and four to designate allergies the western hospital group endorsed three standard wristbands red for allergy alerts yellow for fall risk patients who may be weak because of illness or surgery and purple for patients who have signed forms requesting that no one administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation or cpr if their heart stops or they stop breathing "the wristbands dont replace the medical record but they are the first line of communication " says barb averyt project director at the arizona hospital &amp healthcare association a member of the group hospitals can train staffers including janitors housekeepers and transport personnel who wheel patients between units to recognize the colors "so if someone is mopping the floor and they see a patient with a yellow bracelet trying to get out of bed they know they have to call the nurse " ms averyt says while the standards were being hammered out some hospital staffers raised concerns about the use of certain colored wristbands says debbie weller manager of quality enhancement services at scottsdale healthcare which operates two hospitals and is opening a third in november some felt any bracelet indicating a do not resuscitate order would be demeaning to patients she says and one doctor even raised the question of whether patients with the purple dnr bracelets might worry about the quality of care they would receive as a result the scottsdale hospitals decided to modify their own dnr bracelets by marking a plain wristband with a purple "jewel" small enough "so no one needs to see it from feet down the hall " says ms weller scottsdale healthcare elected to use the standard red and yellow wristbands recommended by the western task force but while the guidelines strongly suggest that hospitals dont write actual patient allergies on the allergy wristbands believing it is safer for staffers to check the allergy in the medical record scottsdale modified its allergy wristbands so specific allergies can be written on the bands surgeons and anesthesiologists indicated that was more efficient than having to take the extra step of going back to check the patient chart hospitals in the programs are also taking steps to alert local communities and educate patients about the new wristband standards explaining the meaning of different colors at admission emphasizing the importance of wearing wristbands during their stay and pointing out the risks associated with wearing their own personal wristbands while the hospitals provide refusal forms to patients who dont want to wear color coded bracelets or to take off their own social cause bracelets hospitals in the various state programs say they havent had a problem with patient refusals email me at informedpatient wsj com
