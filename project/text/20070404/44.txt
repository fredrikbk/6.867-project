fix picks the masters online edition phil mickelson could go on a game show one of the oldies like "to tell the truth" or "ive got a secret" and no one would be able to guess his secret hes the masters tournaments defending champ given his lackluster play of late he sure hasnt played like one and of course in the media at least professional golf these days starts and seemingly ends with the question how did tiger do lately the answer would be "pretty well thank you very much " tiger that would be tiger woods for those who need a last name toyed with the field and the course in winning the british open in july then birdied his way to the pga championship in august those two were part of a string of seven in a sort of row in march in his final tournament before the masters tees off he pretty much smoked the same field hell face tomorrow winning going away even with a cautious over par final round but if you think all the way back to a year ago mr mickelson won the masters by two strokes over tim clark theres a trivia question for you his second major in a row in june lefty was one hole away from taking the u s open title for a third consecutive major title but then his mind his wayward driver fore left and that huge hospitality tent took over leading to the stunning collapse by the "idiot " his word not mine so the golf year opens for real now with the first major and as on those old time game shows there are many more questions than answers even tiger the tournament before last shot an opening round normally a recipe for a win only to shoot a final round ending bogey double bogey triple bogey with its recent changes augusta national has become a big boys course and perhaps a better "true" test of golf than the years other three majors thats more than surprising in that the other majors have reasons for being the national opens for the u s britain and the professional golfers who were neglected in golfing history when amateurism reigned supreme but the masters is just a club championship of sorts if you consider your club to be the entire world of course just try to call up at "our club" and get a tee time in the masters since tiger has turned pro there havent been many or even any fluke winners no ben curtis paul lawrie or todd hamilton here of the past masters champions only mike weir in hasnt won at least a second major and mr weir certainly has to be in the discussion of possible masters champions this year the tim clarks seemingly can get close but no green jacket so in looking for this years winner there likely is no need to go beyond the top in the world golf rankings the fix pick needs to go no lower than four for its selection that would be ernie els who is likely over the heartache of shooting a brilliant final round in only to be nipped by a not very high jumping mr mickelson mr els says he has rededicated himself at age to his golf and hopes to become number one in the world so far this year on the pga tour mr els is first in putting average second in scoring average and fifth in sand save percentage and he has two u s open titles and one british open crown already no fluke here and oakmont site of mr elss first major win is next in june if he wins this week mr els wont be able to go on "ive got a secret" and stump the panel hell be smiling so much that everyone will get his secret very very quickly mr carroll after attending rules school recently was asked by an augusta national official to be a rules official at this years masters the official probably didnt mean it as he was laughing hysterically at the time write to him at tim carroll wsj com
