inside wal marts threat research operation the wal mart stores inc worker fired last month for intercepting a reporters phone calls says he was part of a larger sophisticated surveillance operation that included snooping not only on employees but also on critics stockholders and the consulting firm mckinsey &amp co as part of the surveillance the retailer last year had a long haired employee infiltrate an anti wal mart group to determine if it planned protests at the companys annual meeting according to bruce gabbard the fired security worker who worked in wal marts threat research and analysis group the company also deployed cutting edge monitoring systems made by a supplier to the defense department that allowed it to capture and record the actions of anyone connected to its global computer network the systems high tech wizardry could detect the degree of flesh tone on a viewed internet image and alerted monitors that a vendor sharing wal mart networks was viewing pornography wal mart has since disconnected some systems amid an internal investigation of the groups activities earlier this year according to an executive in the security information industry the revelations by mr gabbard many of which were confirmed by other former wal mart employees and security industry professionals provide a rare window into the retail giants internal operations and mindset the company fired mr gabbard a year employee last month for unauthorized recording of calls to and from a new york times reporter and for intercepting pager messages wal mart conducted an internal investigation of mr gabbard and his groups activities fired his supervisor and demoted a vice president over the group as well mr gabbard says he recorded the calls on his own because he felt pressured to stop embarrassing leaks but he says most of his spying activities were sanctioned by superiors "i used to joke that wal mart paid me to be paranoid and they got their moneys worth " mr gabbard says wal mart says it permitted recording employee calls "only in compelling circumstances and with written permission from the legal department " but because pager messages were sent over a frequency that was not secure mr gabbard inadvertently intercepted pages from non wal mart employees as well a u s attorney is investigating whether any laws were violated as a result of the phone and pager intercepts aside from that possible infraction wal marts surveillance activity appears to be legal u s courts have long held that companies can read employee emails and wal mart employees are informed they have "no expectation of privacy" when using company supplied computers or phones the surveillance of people in public places is also legal wal mart has always placed tight limits on what its employees can do while at work for instance it bars store employees from using personal cellphones on the job managers receive a list of email addresses and phone numbers their employees have communicated with and a list of web sites visited according to current and former employees and the company limits internet access blocking social networking and video sites but wal mart appeared to go beyond most companies in its sleuthing it didnt just scan emails written on the corporate email system technology it was helping develop allowed it to view emails that employees sent to or received from private accounts such as hotmail or gmail whenever the employees were hooked into the wal mart computer network according to mr gabbard and others with knowledge of the system the security operation and its surveillance technology "seems orwellian " says robert k west founder and chief executive of echelon one a security research and consulting firm composed largely of former corporate chief information officers other activities like infiltrating critics groups went "beyond the scope of the typical information security organization " he says wal mart declined to give details about its surveillance activities a company spokeswoman sarah clark characterized its security operations as normal "like most major corporations it is our corporate responsibility to have systems in place including software systems to monitor threats to our network and our intellectual property so we can protect our sensitive business information " she said "it is also standard practice to provide physical and information security for our corporate events and for our board of directors and senior executives " according to several former wal mart employees the companys roughly person threat research and analysis group hunts computer hackers through cyberspace trolls colleagues emails looking for misbehavior or proprietary data theft and tries to plug damaging information leaks members work on the third floor of the wal marts bentonville ark technology offices they enter a separate glass enclosed structure by holding the palm of their hand to a biometric reader that grants them access to a dimly lit work area colleagues call it the "bat cave " the group "is no longer operating in the same manner that it did prior to the discovery of the unauthorized recording of telephone conversations " said wal marts ms clark " we have strengthened our practices and protocols " according to mr gabbard wal mart began beefing up its electronic call surveillance after the sept terrorist attacks in response to government requests to employers in general to help find terrorist cells mr gabbard says he was directed by two former fbi agents working for wal mart to set up a system that could track any calls to and from syria yemen and iran among other countries the search was unsuccessful only flagging an apparent call from iran that turned out instead to be from an indian jeweler according to mr gabbard later he says he used the same equipment to intercept and record calls from the new york times the electronic surveillance accelerated in october when confidential company memos began appearing on the web site of a union backed anti wal mart group wal mart watch according to mr gabbard one such memo suggested that because of rising costs and criticisms of its worker health insurance the retailer should revise its policies by hiring healthier workers and requiring all jobs to perform physical activity such as retrieving shopping carts concerned about the leaks wal mart began working with oakley networks inc a developer of "insider threat management" gear to track employee and suppliers computer usage over its network according to mr gabbard and an industry source one oakley system is able to record an employees computer keystrokes and deliver a tivo like replay of his or her computer activities according to tom bennett oakleys vice president of marketing oakley networks confirmed the advanced capabilities of the system but says it doesnt identify customers apart from the u s defense department the system goes beyond keystroke capture products and email filtering packages by "providing a view of content moving over your network " says oakleys mr bennett suspecting that the leaks of confidential memos might have come from mckinsey employees who had been working on a health care project at wal marts bentonville ark headquarters at the time of the leaked memo wal marts security experts used an oakley device to monitor the mckinsey internet activities according to mr gabbard and others wal mart ultimately took no action "we continue to work closely with mckinsey and we have no evidence that anyone there ever inappropriately shared confidential information " wal marts ms clark said monday mckinsey declined to comment wal mart also used an oakley product to monitor suppliers use of the wal mart network mr gabbard says that using the program that can monitor flesh tones on a computer screen his team found a vendor downloading pornography and reported it to wal mart and the vendors executives he doesnt know the outcome wal mart declined to comment on the incident mr gabbard says he also used his computer skills to find information on wal mart critics in march he searched a south carolina democratic party web site for information on nu wexler the spokesman for the anti wal mart group wal mart watch wal mart knew that mr wexler planned to be in northwest arkansas during an annual company conference mr gabbard said he found personal photos of mr wexler stored on a publicly available folder on the partys computer which allowed wal mart security to identify mr wexler "wal mart has far bigger concerns than my vacation photos " said mr wexler after being informed of the surveillance "someone would have had to dig for quite a while to find that link " in late spring wal mart learned that several anti wal mart groups might protest at the annual shareholders meeting in june company executives were concerned the civil rights group acorn the association of community organizations for reform now and local up against the wal members would disrupt its meeting wal mart sent a long haired employee wearing a wireless microphone to up against the wals fayetteville ark gathering and eavesdropped from nearby says mr gabbard "we followed around the perimeter with a surveillance van " he says "it is not the companys policy to infiltrate organizations or events and we would not condone any associate engaging in such activity " said wal marts ms clark wal mart also directed its surveillance operations at critical shareholders according to a january memo reviewed by the wall street journal security units were asked to "do some preliminary background work on the potential threat assessment" of those submitting proposals to its june shareholder meeting particularly those whose resolutions the company was trying to block the list included proposals from a boerne texas religious group the new york city controllers office and sydney kay an year old retired science teacher who submitted a resolution requiring that board nominees own at least &# million in wal mart stock and his year old sister hilda kaplis "it is standard business practice to do an overall assessment for potential disruptions at a major event like our shareholders meeting involving plus people " said ms clark reached at his dallas home mr kay scoffed at the notion he posed a threat to wal marts annual meeting "i am a nobody " he said
