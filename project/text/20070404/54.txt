golden oldies stax releases a th anniversary boxed set stax the music label responsible for superior soul r&amp b and an occasional slice of the blues in the s and early s is observing its founding in everything but name by releasing "stax th anniversary celebration " featuring of the best tracks from its vaults it could have released twice as many or more without a dip in quality in fact it did release twice as many in under the title "stax story" and almost times as many in in the superb boxed set "the complete stax volt singles " two subsequent collections from the archives of stax and its volt subsidiary raised the number of tracks issued in the past years to more than times whats in the th anniversary box a joy from the first cut to the last "stax th anniversary celebration" is a reminder of the glory days of r&amp b when singer song and band came together with fervor to spark body and soul the music all but sweats with the musicians passion there are no drum machines and no vocal bent to pitch by software the punchy horns are real brass and reeds not lines played on synthesizers now and then a musician flubs a note or misses a cue but an absolute reliance on musicians creativity can deliver brilliant pop music thats timeless especially if the vocalists are the likes of eddie floyd otis redding sam &amp dave and the staple singers stax began when jim stewart and his sister estelle axton started satellite records in brunswick tenn they moved it to memphis and converted a movie theater into a recording studio as we learn in the indispensable liner notes by rob bowman mr stewart and mrs axton retained the theaters sloping floor and angled walls creating a room that was responsible for the labels distinctive clean sound backed by the marketing and technological savvy of atlantic records a label that knew a good thing when it heard it satellite scored its first big hit year old carla thomass "gee whiz " in the year the label changed its name to stax the mar keys gave it a second national hit with "last night" and the personnel for the foundation of its success the band included steve cropper on guitar and duck dunn on bass shortly thereafter the organist booker t jones arrived at stax and with drummer al jackson and mr cropper formed booker t &amp the mgs joined by mr dunn the group was a hit machine for stax but more so it served as the nucleus of its house band which later included isaac hayes mr cropper also wrote and arranged many stax hits though it was cut before the mgs came aboard ms thomass "gee whiz " a clever twist on the eras ballads for slow dancing contains most elements of a classic stax hit the band is assertive but not intrusive in this case even when a violin solo rises from the string section and as the song builds in intensity ms thomas serves the lyric with earthy grit and simmering grace fittingly this marriage of composition vocalist as song stylist and a smart arrangement played by a band with flair kicks off the th anniversary set the collection succeeds as any sampler should we want more redding hes represented by "ive been loving you too long " "respect" and " sittin on the dock of the bay " and more sam &amp dave whose three songs here all composed by staxs most reliable songwriting team of mr hayes and david porter include the lesser known hit "you dont know like i know" but not the great ballads like "when something is wrong with my baby" or "i cant stand up " and more of the staple singers whose hits "ill take you there" and "respect yourself" illustrate their distinctive blend of gospel and r&amp b mr floyds "knock on wood" demands a revival of the soul shouters career but the set also celebrates wonderful singers many close to forgotten mable john sister of little willie john and one of ray charless raelettes had a string of hits for the label on her masterwork "your good thing is about to end " also written by messrs hayes and porter her voice settles amid the honeyed lines of the memphis horns warm sophisticated soul is represented by william bell who in addition to recording a number of hits for stax co wrote "born under a bad sign" for the labels resident bluesman albert king though he may be better known these days as the voice of chef mcelroy in comedy centrals "south park " mr hayes was a formidable presence at stax and his album "hot buttered soul" was a landmark recording his melodramatic reinterpretation of "walk on by" foreshadows his iconic hit "theme from shaft" with its inventive use of strings and woodwinds both songs are in the new set "stax th anniversary celebration" also reminds us the label was the home for snappy soul instrumentals the mar keys"last night" may sound like scores of other southern horn and organ workouts of its era but a deft sax solo by don nix signals the groups interest in the jazzy side of r&amp b the performance is father to the bar kays"soul finger " a two minute party with sweeping horns and a crisp guitar solo by jimmy king meanwhile with a sound so tight it crackles with tension booker t &amp the mgs showed how their competence and focus could turn basic riffs into intriguing pop their artistry is staxs in microcosm mr fusilli writes on popular music for the journal
