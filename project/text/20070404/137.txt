the mossberg solution getting families synched up calendar software has clean look nimble functions families everywhere are constantly searching for better ways to coordinate their schedules and many have looked to technology for help while emails and text messages are useful parents are hard pressed to find a simple efficient digital replacement for post it notes and wall calendars numerous companies have tried to design computers made specifically for the kitchen with hopes of becoming the best digital hub the latest of these the h p touchsmart pc from hewlett packard co boasts a beautiful touch screen for quick access but is expensive and enormous even worse the touchsmarts calendar software program is limited and unintuitive this week i tested cozi central www cozi com a free downloadable calendaring program from cozi group inc that works on most windows pcs not just expensive new computers that hog kitchen counter space cozi offers a built in family messaging system and shopping or to do lists that the whole family can edit starting today cozi also automatically synchronizes with microsoft outlook calendars allowing work events to be considered in the family calendar and vice versa plus it can be used well beyond just the family windows pc it has a web based version so family members can use it from a browser on any computer anywhere even a macintosh and it will send schedules and shopping lists to your cellphone via text messages or through an audible text to speech program cozi sounds complicated because it does so much but its actually pretty simple it was designed specifically with its audience in mind busy moms and dads who will quickly revert to the paper calendar if a program is too complicated or time consuming cozi central impressed me with its functionality and attractive overall look it incorporates various ways to connect families with their calendars at home and on the go and every screen is clean and uncluttered it could stand to improve in three areas adding notifications of changes made by other family members allowing response messaging from family members to cozi now messages can only be sent out from within cozi and improving the way an entire months schedule looks on screen but cozis attributes are overwhelming enough for you to want to use it with your family i used cozi in both of its formats as a downloaded program on my windows pc and as a web based program both coordinate and sync with one another web access provided the pc based version of cozi central has a few extra features including the ability to show a month view and to automatically generate photo collages after downloading and registering the names of two main users and up to six additional users for the calendar i named my calendar and created a password this password can be shared with family members or whomever will also use the calendar nothing in cozi is private i also installed cozis new outlook toolbar which syncs your outlook calendar with your cozi calendar the first sync took about minutes but thereafter synching was quick under a minute each time something changed on either calendar cozi centrals main page is appropriately called home and it reminded me of a bulletin board with four things tacked on a solid color background in the top left a photo of your choosing is displayed the top right shows a brief view of your familys calendar over the next few days the bottom right shows one of your lists such as groceries or to do and another space on the home page lets you type and send emails or text messages to family members in the calendar section the names of those registered are designated with color coded tabs across the top of the screen to see one persons calendar select his or her tab the all view shows everyones events on one calendar each person is represented by a different colored dot all calendar entries can be typed into a designated space at the bottom of the screen in just about any format i typed "bridal shower tomorrow from noon three " and "bridal shower" was added to the next day on my calendar from p m specifics such as reoccurrences and locations can be added by selecting the event this lean toward the casual allows for fast easy entries by all family members not just the person who uses cozi most often the cozi program that was installed on my windows pc showed a variety of calendar views i prefer to see an overall month view of my calendar at all times but couldnt see all weeks of the month simultaneously in cozi the more events you have per day the less youll see of your month the web based version of cozi only offers a vertical view of the next few days for users who integrate microsoft outlook calendars with cozi special settings can be adjusted so that hundreds of business appointments dont start cluttering up the family calendar the shopping list section on the home bulletin board opens current lists by default lists called groceries wholesale and other are already set up but new lists can easily be added items are simply typed in and the pc version of cozi uses a list of popular items to automatically finish words as you type items can be crossed off by selecting a check mark the message section of cozis home page sent text messages and emails to others almost instantly after i entered text and selected send i never had to open a separate email program or type an email address or phone number but the recipient of these messages cant respond cozi only sends outgoing messages and cant receive replies the company hopes to add this feature in the future the phone and email options that work with cozi could be useful in a bind if youre away from home and need to know a schedule or grocery list you can dial in from a cozi registered phone number to hear these things read aloud or sent to you via text message you can also send text messages to cozi to request information or whoever is at the computer can send this data out directly from within the cozi program itself if a family member changes or adds something to cozi theres no way of knowing cozi needs to implement some kind of notification system that gives you the option to be told of any changes photo collages are started from the cozi home page these immediately fill your screen with about five to seven related photos at a time without any work on your part each collage lasts for about seconds by default and typing "s" will let you send the currently displayed collage to anyone as of now cozi is free of advertisements this summer a series of interactive advertisements will appear alongside your calendars or lists these ads incorporate content into your cozi but only if you ask for it for example if you create a shopping list for a certain store and an item in that store is advertised on your screen you can click the ad to put that item in your shopping list cozi just works it looks clean organized and uncluttered regardless of hectic schedules its also easy enough for anyone to use and cozi group inc is constantly working to improve the program which is a good sign but even its smaller faults can be overlooked for usability cozi makes kitchen computers or family computers anywhere in the house more useful edited by walter s mossberg
