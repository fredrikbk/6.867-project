complicated than" simply landing mr donovan mr bozich writes "he needs to make a quick and accurate read on donovans interest and decide whether billy is actually a live recruit if so barnhart has to prove he can recruit him better than smith recruited tyler hansbrough brandan wright or the other whiffs that created his growing unpopularity if not barnhart has to move on and secure another coach
