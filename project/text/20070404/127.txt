product but it isnt selling as well as intuit would like the maker of the top selling tax filing software recently said turbotax sales have been relatively flat from last year and analysts are speculating that it may be losing market share to h&amp r block which makes the taxcut software intuit shares slid more than on the sales news to below &# and havent yet recovered they closed wednesday at &# well below a week high of &# adjusted for stock splits set in october but many analysts are optimistic saying the stock can return to that level if intuit can make a strong showing down the home stretch of tax filing season ratings and disclosures follow the bull case top of taxes turbotax dominates tax software with intuit estimating it has million customers that account for roughly of the market "as the market leader and most recognized brand in software online tax preparation turbotax is well positioned to continue to profitably grow" its user base wrote scott schneeberger at cibc world markets noting that the software online category typically captures the largest chunk of new tax filers each year he said he thinks turbotax and other similar products are in a better position than outside accountants or tax services to win over the remaining million or so do it yourself filers intuits other prominent products are quicken which citigroup analyst brent thill called the "pre eminent brand" in personal finance software as well as quickbooks a line of accounting and payrolls products for small businesses that makes up of intuits revenue late innings many analysts expect intuit to hit a home run to end tax filing season making up for a lackluster start intuit gave its sales update when a third of tax season remained and daniel cummins at banc of america securities wrote that intuit can "meet or beat" revenue forecasts if the company can continue to sell turbotax at prices marked up from last year he said "the great hitters make adjustments at the plate " and that he is encouraged by intuit "tweaking prices intra season " referring to intuit raising some tax filing costs in february and turbotax prices by as much as this week vikram churamani at lehman brothers said unit sales are picking up pace despite the higher prices which should help inuit achieve its to unit growth target and his turbotax revenue estimate of &# million up year over year as "the final days of tax season experience more activity versus the prior days momentum should continue " he wrote intuitive cash intuit has been able to accumulate more than &# billion in cash which it has used for stock buybacks and acquisitions when its shares fell below &# in may intuit decided to use about half of that cash to repurchase more of its own shares and also institute a for stock split effective in july both moves are generally considered to be shareholder friendly and can help increase the stocks price indeed shares of intuit rose from below &# to nearly &# by october but have since fallen back below &# still many analysts see the stock returning to october levels within a year mr thill at citigroup noted that buybacks are contributing about to per share earnings growth as intuit returns &# million in cash to shareholders over the next year "we believe intuit is one of the better earnings growth stories in software " he wrote the bear case not so fast intuit said recently that through march sales of turbotax were up less than in this tax season from last years disappointing investors and sending shares reeling in the box sales of the software fell more than offset by a gain in web based sales the results were "disappointing " said laura lederman at william blair who raised her rating on intuit to "outperform" before the sales update "our upgrade appears to have been premature " she conceded ms lederman says she is unsure whether the results indicate that the tax market is slowing or that inuit is losing market share j p morgans adam holt said after the news that he thinks it is "unlikely" the company can exceed its goal of to unit growth and lowered his own forecast to from and also cut his revenue growth estimate "we believe intuits stock will continue to face pressure as investors worry about unit growth in the large and highly profitable tax business " wrote gregory smith at merrill lynch chopping block while turbotax has languished h&amp r blocks taxcut has gained ground with sales growing about year over year one reason several analysts speculate is that intuits initial &# to &# increase on turbotax this year from last years prices may have backfired "we continue to see more evidence that h&amp r block is gaining share this year versus intuit in the tax software market " wrote mr smith he says consumers appear "less willing to pay a premium for intuits market leading product " that doesnt bode well for next year either he said raising questions about customer retention and future strategy for turbotax glenn greene an analyst at thinkequity partners added that intuit has "very limited pricing leverage for next tax season " and may even have to cut prices in the future to keep its market share merger mixup intuit closed its &# billion deal for internet banking company digital insight but ran into trouble in its quest to acquire payment processor electronic clearing house the &# million transaction announced in december was mutually terminated by the companies in part because of a probe into allegations of echs electronic payment systems being used for online gambling analysts say the outcome is disappointing for intuit because the acquisitions of ech and digital insight were seen as being complementary with ech helping the company further bolster its offerings for small business and online banking and lessening its reliance on the cyclical tax season with growth in its tax related revenue lagging ms lederman says the pressure is on "it makes the digital insight acquisition all the more important" for intuit as it tries to expand its business especially after the ech deal fell through write to worth civils at worth civils wsj com disclosures cibc world
