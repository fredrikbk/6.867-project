the fast and the furious join the country club set kaufman county texas bill georgas is building a gated community on ranch land here but where a golf course might have gone hes constructing an automobile race track "instead of the th green " he says "youll be looking at four miles of asphalt " set upon almost acres about miles east of dallas racers ranch will feature an square foot clubhouse where homeowners will be able to enjoy a burger and a beer while watching their neighbors stretch the limits of their ferraris porsches and corvettes mr georgas says even as cities are luring people back to downtown neighborhoods with their melting pot appeal suburban and exurban "lifestyle communities" are emerging with ever narrower niches their market aging baby boomers who increasingly find themselves with the time and money to pursue a singular passion such as cars horses or aviation these specialized communities are popping up across the u s near ocala fla where john travolta resides along with his boeing pilot terry jones thayer is developing jumbolair aviation estates the countrys largest private airstrip in sheperdstown w va peter corum is building the crofts an equestrian estate community with stables trails and lots up to acres and in suburban dallas wellstone communities llc and texas aerobics guru dr kenneth cooper are developing one of the nations first fitness villages a acre project where residents will be assigned personal trainers doctors and dieticians as the real estate market boomed in recent years developers have tried to lure home buyers with branded communities with mixed success a home in a john deere signature community for example offers a garage full of john deere gear including a lawn tractor and two years of free maintenance in enterprise ala country music singer kix brooks of the group brooks and dunn teamed up with ronnie gilley properties inc to develop brookwood a residential community where homebuyers are offered guitars signed by mr brooks niche developments like racers ranch take the idea of associating a brand with a neighborhood a step further creating country club communities around a specific pastime the premise is risky because it narrows the pool of potential buyers and pushes up prices the upshot is that projects can take years to complete for example ms jones thayer of jumbolair aviation estates says of lots have been sold since her project began in primarily to jet setting executives and aviation enthusiasts the lots which are between and acres sell for &# to &# and dues run another &# a year so far only five homes are finished still developers of such communities have successfully tapped into the internet which has allowed marketers to bring like minded people together not unlike electronic dating services john b lowery president of wellstone says developers are more importantly mining a demographic that in addition to having time and money maintains a youthful mindset "these are people who grew up with the rolling stones " says mr lowery "theyre not going to be content to play shuffle board " there will be few excuses to slow down at mr lowerys &# million fitness development known as cooper life at craig ranch which is emerging on what was once agricultural land some miles north of dallas in mckinney texas the project which is under construction will offer a total of cottages townhomes and mid rise condominiums for &# to &# million already built are a gleaming square foot fitness center olympic size pool and tennis courts use of the facilities costs &# a month per household and includes concierge service "our objective is to create a community where health care is an easy choice " says dr coopers son tyler cooper who is helping to oversee the project mr georgas and his partner dan gage both of whom previously worked in telecommunications hatched the idea for racers ranch several years ago while driving their porsches at a road course near fort worth in their downtime they found themselves either wilting from the heat or bundling up against the cold "we thought if we had a clubhouse we could be having a drink relaxing right now " says mr georgas in they teamed with a group of investors to pay &# million for a working cattle farm among rolling hills and wooded creeks of kaufman county setting aside the bulk of it for conservation in return for a tax break locals were initially alarmed at news of the track dispatching some calls to county officials with questions and concerns but the relatively remote site of the track and its private status has allayed fears mr georgas and mr gage say they intend to mute the noise of the cars with a berm as high as feet that they expect to construct with the earth that is removed to build the track u s motor sport road courses are becoming increasingly popular places for amateurs to drive their cars and live the autobahn country club in joliet il has plans to build condominiums but the residential nature of racers ranch coupled with its secluded rural setting is something of a novelty mr georgas and mr gage are looking to sell five acre lots for &# a price that also includes full use of the clubhouse track two pit areas and day use garage so far he has only commitments "weve got a lot of people sitting on the fence " says mr gage " mr georgas and mr gage initially planned to start construction when they had commitments from buyers but last month they said they have acquired a loan that will allow them to start construction of a clubhouse and a foot wide track that will loop around pastures through thickets and over creek beds with those amenities in place they believe their concept will catch on like a golf community racers ranch aims to attract members as well as residents lou gigliotti a long time dallas area professional race car driver and corvette aficionado is among those who have reserved a lot he says the chief selling point of racers ranch is that many of the cars produced today are built to reach speeds drivers can never experience if theyre obeying the law the tracks one half mile straight away will allow drivers to reach speeds as high as miles an hour about the same as racers on professional courses such as upstate new yorks watkins glen international "to hot rod it youve got to have a place like racers ranch " says mr gigliotti that means about double the insurance rates of country club golf communities and a safety program whereby mr georgas and mr gage say they will determine the ability of the drivers who use their track and certify their progress before they are permitted to operate at high speeds but the track will be designed without walls in all but the pit areas allowing out of control cars to roll off the course and reducing the chance for crashes and injuries
