stormy markets foreign stocks often offer a safe harbor dont run home in tears so far in both u s and foreign stocks have had a turbulent time the utterly predictable response pundits are once again proclaiming you cant reduce risk by investing overseas convinced dont be foreign shares remain a great way to diversify a u s portfolio different strokes suppose you own the broad u s stock market as represented by the dow jones wilshire index and you want to diversify which of these two investments should you add to your portfolio an investment that over the past years has climbed in every year that the u s stock market has climbed and fallen in every year that the u s market has fallen an investment that in each of the past years has always done at least three percentage points better or worse than the u s market in fact in three of those years the performance gap was percentage points or more the second investment certainly sounds like the better diversifier but its a trick question the reason in both cases i am describing morgan stanley capital internationals europe australasia and far east index this might have you scratching your head why do many experts argue that foreign shares provide scant diversification for u s investors its true that since the mid s there has been a marked increase in the correlation between u s and foreign stocks but just because u s and foreign shares rise and fall at the same time doesnt mean they generate the same return "people hear that the correlation is very close and they dont realize that the returns can be totally different " says meir statman a finance professor at santa clara university in california "its one thing to say that markets go down together its another thing to say they go down by the same percentage " also consider the longer term story despite their close correlation morgan stanleys eafe index has soared a cumulative over the past five calendar years easily outpacing the dow jones wilshire s gain permanent position folks will no doubt look at foreign stocks impressive five year performance and pronounce "oh yes international equity exposure is a key component of a well diversified portfolio " but what theyre actually thinking is "boy i need to get me some of those hot foreign stocks " as prof statman notes "people will speak the language of diversification when what they really want to do is chase returns the moment that returns disappoint people will forget about diversification " this of course is foolish if you pile into foreign stocks after they have posted healthy gains and abandon them when they slump you could find yourself buying and selling at just the wrong time my advice stop treating international investing as an optional extra foreign shares account for more than half of the worlds stock market value so they deserve a permanent place in your portfolio consider earmarking or of your stock portfolio for foreign shares and then stick with your target percentage come what may the best way to build your permanent position is with mutual funds richard schroeder a financial planner in amherst n y suggests buying harbor international and dodge &amp cox international to tap into larger companies t rowe price international discovery for smaller company exposure and vanguard emerging markets stock index for a pure play on fast growing developing markets vanguards fund is available as both a mutual fund and an exchange traded fund "if youre investing overseas to avoid tomorrows point drop in the dow jones industrial average youll be disappointed " mr schroeder argues "but over a few years youll get widely divergent results i think u s investors should have at least of their stock allocation overseas "
