politics &amp economics u s korea defer sticky issue for now trade deal excludes products made in north seoul south korea one of the more artful compromises in mondays free trade agreement between the u s and south korea concerned another country north korea south korea wanted to include in the agreement products that are made by its companies at an industrial park just across the border in kaesong north korea but the u s didnt because it worries the norths government may benefit from the complex in the deal the countries agreed to form a committee to study the issue at a later time the differences over the kaesong complex show how history and regional politics often influence bilateral trade discussions seoul says the industrial park shows what is possible if north korea opened itself broadly to market driven economics and reunification with the more prosperous south washington objects to pyongyangs oppressive regime and to its nuclear weapons program which the government recently agreed to begin dismantling the u s hasnt engaged in significant trade with the north for years and exercises a trade embargo it wants to maintain a coalition of countries isolating the country until kim jong ils regime demonstrates its willingness to fully abandon its nuclear program and makes progress on human rights kaesong is more important symbolically than economically hyundai group founder chung ju yung in forged an agreement with the north to build the acre complex the idea was that north koreans would work for ultralow wages by south korean standards currently about &# a month at factories built by companies from the south and elsewhere before his death in mr chung envisioned the kaesong complex would expand to become a giant planned community with people living and working there but so far just small companies have built factories to produce clothing shoes and some household goods employing about people none of south koreas major companies operate in the industrial park businesses have been reluctant to invest in the zone because of uncertainty a political dispute might suddenly shut it down and because some countries might not accept products made there hoping to boost the parks fortunes its developer hyundai asan inc based in seoul had been telling potential tenants in promotional materials that factories built at kaesong would be eligible for the same trade incentives as those built in south korea now however south koreas largest trade deal wont cover the products that emerge from the park "we hoped in this free trade agreement that made in kaesong products would get the same treatment as made in korea products " said jang whan bin senior vice president at hyundai asan "we are a little disappointed in the near future we hope that the u s will reconsider " the agreement postponed discussion about kaesong and allowed both countries to say they got what they wanted for some south korean politicians who support the kaesong project the promise of future discussions with the u s is good enough before the deal song young gil a national assemblyman had said he would withhold support for a trade pact that excluded kaesong but yesterday he said he was satisfied "its a good point to have a committee to look at this later on when we see how north korea is doing with denuclearization" and other changes he said "i can persuade some civic groups and voters that this approach is an incentive to enhance reconciliation on the korean peninsula " south korean trade minister kim hyun chong said monday that the u s had accepted south koreas request to include products from kaesong "in principle " he even suggested that if other economic areas develop between north and south korea the u s also may agree to consider them the leader of the u s delegation deputy u s trade representative karan bhatia said "thats just a discussion we will undertake under this free trade agreement goods from kaesong will not be entering the united states "
