new outlets for political junkies john atkins is the kind of voter who gets tossed out of town hall meetings for expressing his opinions too loudly but recently the oakland calif truck wash manager has found a venue thats better suited to his combative style last week he noticed that presidential candidate barack obama had posted a question on a new yahoo election portal asking voters how to better engage people in the democratic process intrigued mr atkins posted a reply the country should ban lifetime politicians so far hes gotten nine responses from yahoo users "on the internet theres no way to shut this genie down and the words are going to get out " says mr atkins whose yahoo email is oneramblingredneck presidential candidates arent the only ones hitting the campaign trail earlier and more aggressively this election internet sites such as youtube myspace and yahoo are also trying to carve out a bigger role for themselves their hope is that providing a venue for political debate will help drive traffic and campaign advertising dollars to their sites youtube last month started a channel for candidate created videos where voters can also post video and text responses so far mitt romneys youtube channel has amassed the most videos at while joe biden trails with yesterday myspace announced that it would hold a "virtual election" on jan for its million members to vote for their favorite presidential candidate aol meanwhile in february introduced a new feature that pulls together bloggers posting about the elections among other political topics the yahoo election portal that mr atkins stumbled across which was launched last month offers links to pages for each presidential candidate and user generated discussions and photos recently hillary clinton posed a question to the public through the site "based on your own familys experience what do you think we should do to improve health care in america " that garnered more than responses but voters who expect a quick reply to their web postings from the campaigns themselves may be in for a surprise while many of the presidential campaigns have new media teams that organize and monitor online activities they typically dont have the staff to write back to individual posters on these sites says obama campaign spokeswoman jen psaki while "were certainly engaged with other sites our focus is on driving people to our own web site mybarackobama com " in his posting mr atkins challenged all the candidates to sit down with him for a one on one conversation about the country he hasnt heard back from any of the campaigns politicians for years have used the web to disseminate information about themselves and raise money and some general interest web sites have been active in recent elections during the last midterm vote for example some smaller web sites with social networking features including hotsoup com and essembly com played a part in the political debate but big sites like yahoo and aol have tended to limit their election role to providing straight news and information now those sites as well as ones like youtube and facebook that either didnt exist or were in their infancy during the last presidential election are taking advantage of a slew of now popular interactive tools including online video and digital photos to step up their efforts "the audience is already engaged so we have to roll out new features now " says lewis dvorkin an aol vice president theres also more money at stake for the web sites this time around campaigns are projected to boost their ad spending and a bigger slice of those dollars are likely going to online than in the past during the presidential elections campaigns spent &# million on web advertising e mail marketing and web development in the elections the figure could grow to around &# million says the media research firm pq media some of the big web sites have already benefited from campaign advertising mr mccains campaign has advertised on aol says an aol spokeswoman while the clinton and obama campaigns have advertised on facebook according to a facebook spokeswoman yahoo has also had some campaign advertising though such ads are "just getting under way " a spokesman for the site says as part of their quest to reach younger voters many of the presidential candidates have created profiles on the popular social networking sites facebook and myspace myspace members can now donate to candidates by clicking on a button or can copy an image to their own page that has a campaign slogan a sort of bumper sticker for the digital age meanwhile on facebooks campaign profile pages users become "supporters" rather than "friends" the term usually used on the site of the candidates jason martell a year old self described political junkie in lena wis is using myspace to try to contact presidential candidates about a plan he has posted on his myspace page for reducing energy consumption last week he posted a note in the comments section of mrs clintons myspace page urging people mrs clinton included to check out the plan mr martell who is unemployed also has sent personal notes to "friends" of mrs clintons on myspace asking them to pass his plan on to mrs clinton mr martell who hasnt heard back from mrs clinton or her campaign doesnt think the candidates myspace pages are substantively different from say their own campaign web sites "i think theyre just advertising themselves " he says still he says he thinks the pages nonetheless improve his chances of getting his message across to mrs clinton and other candidates of course all the new online tools make it easier for critics and spoofers to get their voice heard as well early last month an anti clinton video spoofing a apple commercial was posted on youtube turns out an employee at one of mr obama campaigns vendors had created it since then an anti obama clip also spoofing the same apple commercial has been posted on youtube youtube and other web sites say they dont plan to stop users from posting negative videos or comments "theres going to be a degree of unpredictability" on the internet says jordan hoffner youtubes director of content partnerships "thats the nature of the medium were in " some of the sites are working on additional features that they hope to roll out in coming months yahoo for instance is developing online campaign t shirts that a web users avatar can dress up in the site also plans to launch analytical tools so that a user could type in a search query such as "giuliani and taxes" and pull up a map to see where in the country other people are searching on the same terms many of the sites also plan to introduce online voter registration later this year or next year jeff brooks a year old safety consultant in cincinnati spends at least half an hour a day online checking out political news and engaging in political discussions with other internet users "ive gotten my wife more interested in the election because of what im reading and discussing" online says mr brooks adding "i spend more time than i should on this stuff "
