cant balance bills with a free lunch our columnist learns a curious media and technical inversion has taken place in recent years watching television which used to be free of charge has become expensive while using the internet once expensive is becoming increasingly free almost paying for itself last week i did a little experiment to take advantage of these two trends to help offset the cost of a recent television boondoggle i ended up surprised by the experiments relative success owners of big screen high definition tv sets know that simply bringing home a huge box from the local electronics store doesnt get you hdtv you also need to upgrade both the equipment and the service from your cable or satellite company dish network my provider wanted &# for the hd version of its tivo like dvr and another &# a month on top of my existing bill i would also have to continue subscribing for another months it seems feudal servitude is the price one has to pay to watch planet earth in p i signed up and agreed to be waiting at home one day last week between noon and p m for the dish rep to show up as i was going to be home doing nothing for five hours i got to wondering how much free stuff could i download or otherwise procure from the internet during that time enough to put a dent in the outlay for the new box being installed i decided to try there would be rules of course like nothing illegal or pornographic the first step was to get a free email address to use for the project a step that later proved to be among the wiser ones i took most email services by now offer a gigabyte or two of free email service yahoo has even announced unlimited storage but not until may by searching around i found inbox com which was advertising free email with five gigabytes of storage at least it was last week this week it was down to two free gigs not only is email free of charge these days but so is back up storage something i can always use an outfit called streamload com was boasting a rather formidable gigabytes of storage for free i got an account and uploaded a big video file to test it out it worked just minutes into the project i already had gigabytes of storage to my name on ebay i found gig drives listing for &# including shipping using the peculiar economics of my little experiment i calculated i was one third of the way to working off the cost of my hd dvr pirated and thus free music and movies abound on the net of course but if you spend a little time you can download free entertainment that is entirely legal many recording artists for instance now offer free mps as marketing tools for new albums arcade fire the toronto rock group has the first track of its new album free for the taking at download com buying the same track at itunes would have cost me cents a number of web sites are offering free downloads of movies whose copyrights have expired and thus are in the public domain at emol org there are scores of movies you can get without even signing up i chose the version of "the little shop of horrors " in which a year old jack nicholson makes a brief appearance channeling peter lorre amazon wants &# for the same title i recalled that during the dot com glory days you could get photos printed for free and discovered that the good times had returned shutterfly for example was offering by prints for free at a typical cents each another &# was being added to the assets side of my ledger up until now the sites i had been dealing with seemed entirely reputable but there is a seedy side to the world of free which you can stumble onto simply by searching for that word you will be barraged with offers for free samples free lunches even free money it is caveat moocher of course an outfit called etracks promises free songs exclamation point in the original the much finer print tells you about the voice messaging service you are also signing up for costing &# to set up and then after one free month &# a month thereafter the free money outfits invariably require you to first work your way through several "levels" of their programs such as by enlisting in one of those object of the month clubs that automatically mail you list price books or records youd never yourself buy any tacky looking site that promises to install free emoticons on your pc is almost surely also going to install spyware or adware in the process and many "free" sites are simply collecting email addresses to sell to spammers after no time at all in this gray market of free the spam started arriving at my new inbox account before time ran out i had managed a few other slightly more esoteric free services such as ftp hosting for my own web site at the end of the afternoon i added up the booty and it came close to &# not enough to build a staircase leading nowhere but enough to begin amortizing my new dvr which means the next time dish calls about my bill ill be able to ask instead of cash how about a glimpse of jack nicholson in his youth email me at lee gomes wsj com corrections &amp amplifications the rock group arcade fire is from montreal not toronto as was incorrectly stated in wednesdays portals column wsj april
