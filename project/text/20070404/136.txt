business day sign up for the e mail here on the subjects of greenhouse gases the constitutional balance of powers and most of all iraq president bush is making clear he will wield what he sees as the unequaled decision making powers of his office mr bush went before reporters to again say congress was playing politics with the lives of american troops in iraq by attaching withdrawal timelines to his latest request for emergency war funding his veto threats against such bills well known mr bush warned that if congress doesnt give him a bill he can sign by mid april the army will have to cut back on equipment and quality of life programs for national guard and reserve troops while training will be curtailed affecting guard unit readiness and possibly delaying deployments to iraq and afghanistan if the stand off stretches into may he said some units wont be able to replace others now on the battlefield "the bottom line is this " he said "congresss failure to fund our troops on the front lines will mean that some of our military families could wait longer for their loved ones to return from the front lines and others could see their loved ones headed back to the war sooner than they need to " congress he reiterated "shouldnt tell generals how to run the war " democrats dont see it that way "the american public sent a clear signal that they want this strategy in iraq changed thats what this bill is about " sen jack reed said on the "newshour with jim lehrer " "we are in danger of a strategy that seems to be more of the same the status quo it doesnt appear to be working and the american people are quite concerned about it " democrats and some republican opponents of the presidents strategy argue that the new "surge" of american and iraqi forces in baghdad hasnt produced a lot of improvement a charge supported by iraqi morgue and police statistics reported by the washington post while violent deaths in the capital declined a bit in march violence rose elsewhere in the country and especially suicide bombings the post reports a total of iraqi civilians and policemen were killed last month which was down from february but the number of iraqi policemen killed across the country nearly doubled to and "the numbers of unidentified bodies found across baghdad are rising again suggesting an increase in sectarian motivated death squad killings " the post says since recent months have already seen an onslaught of reports about the iraq wars corrosive effects on military readiness and shortened stints at home for frontline troops as newsweeks michael hirsh points out the crux of the difference between mr bush and his opponents seems to be mr bushs strategy as he has repeatedly defined it and as he underlined yesterday america cant afford to fail in iraq "and the way you fail is to leave before the job is done " thus he vowed congressional conditions wont be tolerated because americans risk their own security unless they stay in iraq until their objectives are achieved and the prosecutors mr bushs rose garden offensive against the democrats came at the start of a congressional recess that put most of his opponents out of town and the administration moved to profit from that absence on another front mr bush plans to use a recess appointment to name conservative academic susan dudley in the white houses top regulatory post the wall street journal reports ms dudley has generated opposition from environmentalists and liberal interest groups and her nomination to lead the office of information and regulatory affairs also met resistance in the republican led congress of last year the journal notes allegations of efforts to bypass congresss advise and consent role helped fuel the scandal over the administrations firing of eight u s attorneys but mr bush expressed confidence yesterday that his administration is in no jeopardy on that front there has been "no credible evidence of any wrongdoing and thats what the american people have got to understand we had a right to remove them we did remove them " he said "and there will be more hearings to determine what ive just said no credible evidence of wrongdoing " those hearings seem increasingly likely to include monica goodling an aide to attorney general alberto gonzales who helped coordinate the dismissals with the white house and who has asserted her fifth amendment right against self incrimination to avoid testifying about the matter on capitol hill house democrats yesterday asked for a personal interview with ms goodling saying they wanted to evaluate the legality of that refusal the new york times reports and greenhouse gases mr bush also said that while he takes "very seriously" the supreme court telling his administration it has the power and potential responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases "were taking some time to fully understand the details of the decision " and he added that he considered his administrations approach to the issue already sufficient as the new york times reports "but the courts ruling was being welcomed by congress and the states which are already using the decision to speed their own efforts to regulate the gases that contribute to global climate change " the times notes "as a result congress and state legislatures are almost certain to be the arenas for far reaching and bruising lobbying battles " who

overnight " the researchers now say "the timing of hormone use is key " the journal says the data indicates that during the five to seven year study hormone users aged to had a lower risk of dying of any cause than study participants who were given a placebo "the new analysis is especially important because it most closely measures effects on the typical hormone user a recently menopausal woman in her mid s or early s who seeks relief from hot flashes and other symptoms " the journal adds what the study also found the new york times adds is that "women in their s and s who still had hot flashes and night sweats were at increased risk for heart attacks even if they werent taking hormones and if these women took hormone therapy their risk was higher still " dr jacques rossouw a researcher for the national heart lung and blood institute who led the study tells the times that women older than shouldnt take the hormones at all but he cautions that even this suggestion needs additional study
