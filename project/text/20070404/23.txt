business world climate of opinion al gore will have no trouble finding in mondays supreme court ruling more evidence that global warming is a reality indeed a dire threat he will soon say you can take this to the bank words like "now even a majority of the supreme court has recognized the danger of global warming " and hell be right in the sense that the court invokes the magic word "consensus" for a physical fact that itself is unproven unprovable and exists purely in the realm of speculation al gore has made himself in his curious way the personification of a societys impulse to manufacture political certainty out of irresolvable scientific uncertainty of which the supreme court is the latest culprit victim you can see this by arranging the questions related to global warming in descending order of urgency the most urgent by definition is mr gores claim that the atmosphere is in such a calamitous state that we have "no more than years before we cross a point of no return " how does he know asked interviewer charlie rose last year mr gores answer "i accept the fact that the most respected scientists whose judgment i think is the best are now concerned that we may be in that territory " the second question is whether human produced carbon dioxide is driving this dangerous warming invariably mr gore cites a single observation that such a belief is the "consensus" of scientists only at the third question is there evidence that global warming is actually occurring do we enter the realm of the observable air and sea temperature can be measured the standard observation is that the planet has fitfully warmed by one degree celsius over the past century but this figure is produced by massaging inconsistent readings from many times and places different assumptions would produce different trends or none at all and thats without considering whether a planetary "average" temperature is even a meaningful datapoint some have likened it to averaging all the phone numbers in the phone book in any case evidence of warming is not evidence of manmade warming it would surprise the public and even the supreme court to know how utterly the science of global warming offers no evidence whatsoever on the central proposition what fills mr gores film books speeches and congressional testimony are scientific observations and quasi scientific observations all right they concern polar bears mosquitoes hurricanes ice packs and everything but whether humans cause global warming some of this evidence may suggest weakly or strongly the existence of warming trends in particular parts of the world such local trends both cooling and warming have been observed in many places and many times more dubiously some may indicate a generalized warming but none offers any evidence that carbon dioxide is causing warming mr gores method is the equivalent of trying to prove that jack killed jane by going on and on about how awful it was that jane was killed polemicists in favor of human caused global warming liken skeptics to tobacco lobbyists who denied the link between smoking and lung cancer in fact it makes a useful analogy suppose the world consisted of exactly one smoker who could be observed only from a distance to test the theory that smoking causes lung cancer if he died of cancer it wouldnt prove smoking causes cancer if he failed to die of cancer it wouldnt prove smoking doesnt cause cancer the link between smoking and cancer is made by observing millions of smokers and nonsmokers indeed what led scientists to seek systematic evidence of a link in the first place was anecdotal evidence that smokers of whom there have been millions appeared to die in unusual numbers from lung cancer nothing remotely similar has been involved in developing the hypothesis that carbon dioxide creates warming the relevant observations are a mess measured global temperature has both risen and fallen for considerable periods during the past century even as co has risen steadily the geologic record suggests the world was much cooler in the past despite co concentrations higher than todays unlike smoking and cancer theres no anecdotal observation for the hypothesis that co causes planetary warming it may or may not be true but to believe it is a "scientific truth" is to make a leap of faith not science the consensus that human activities are causing global warming is purely a social invention theres no way of showing it to be so and no self evident reason for preferring to believe its so the "consensus" is in truth a product of itself now we are prepared to get the joke it came during last falls supreme court oral argument about global warming when the learned justices allowing the word "consensus" to serve as evidence of manmade warming devoted themselves instead to a solemn discussion of how many inches of sea level rise and thus how many square miles of coastal inundation the epa is guilty of failing to prevent by refusing to regulate u s tailpipe emissions which account for just of human co output sen james inhofe is notorious for saying the theory of manmade global warming is a "hoax " obviously we need a better theory than that of when head counting is a useful way of estimating the validity of a factual proposition and when it isnt until then its perhaps sufficient to say that many people believe in manmade global warming because many people believe in manmade global warming al gore believes in it because many people believe in it many people believe in it because al gore believes in it and so on right up to the highest court in the land see related letter "letters to the editor global warming gasbags" wsj april
