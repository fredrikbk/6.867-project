its too late to say stop the free trade world we want to get off your article on alan blinder and free trade is extremely important "job prospects pain from free trade spurs second thoughts " page one march key decisions should be made today based on judgments predicting our future high level intellectual jobs such as tax returns sophisticated computer software engineering and architecture drawings and student mentoring are already being delivered on the internet from india and other countries we have been losing high paying manufacturing jobs for some time it is necessary that we revamp our education system restoring accountability however no matter what we do we will still lose millions of these jobs should this result in prohibiting the receipt of intellectual products on the internet or stopping companies from offshoring manufacturing jobs of course not we would lose companies and jobs to other countries we would be unable to compete world wide and the costs of goods would go up while our income goes down what is our future in a free trade economy not bad technology will bring the cost of goods and services down new jobs particularly in service areas will pay reasonable incomes we must maintain a strong rule of law without artificial trade barriers this will continue to attract the rich with their jobs from all over the world provided we dont tax in a way that scares them to other countries we will also continue to attract investors world wide who will purchase our bonds and create more businesses short term artificial solutions will result in long term stagnation richard j riordan counsel bingham mccutchen llp los angeles mr riordan is a former mayor of los angeles and a former california secretary for education globalization has been extremely productive and beneficial but perhaps it has cycled into a new phase in which the practicality of protecting ones primary market has been forgotten perhaps we are taking the u s end market for granted perhaps ensuring long term success requires some reallocation of the means of production back to the u s this is pragmatism not protectionism and a little bit of good old risk management joann m barry c f a chicago lets see what would an eminent free trader economist do when he notices that one of the job categories now considered to be a target for offshoring is "economist" james kennedy rumson n j its about time economists realized that the free trade platform isnt a level playing field particularly for the future of the u s economy smart developing nations such as china and india tend to underprice their output in order to industrialize and accumulate foreign reserves these countries also use national pride to effectively block unwanted imports just look at the success of the u s auto industry in penetrating the japanese market as long as the u s is willing to finance other countries industrialization by opening our doors to their exports and we excuse their trade barriers to our exports we will continue to diminish our economic base juan f lago senior vice president senior lending officer first intercontinental bank doraville ga prof blinder unfortunately calls for intervention by the government the entity that is largely responsible for the problem in the first place the government has neither the information nor the incentive nor the expertise to determine for what jobs our workers should be trained the private sector does but government control of the education system prevents the private sector from acting if the government were to institute a voucher system for primary and secondary education the private sector would respond with schools that train students in the skills they need to compete in the global economy yes the private sector will make mistakes but those mistakes will be far fewer and more quickly corrected than those made by government bureaucracy antony davies ph d research fellow the mercatus center associate professor of economics duquesne university pittsburgh thank you very much for your excellent article which finally addresses the rot beneath the glitter of free trade that many of us have suspected for years offshoring american jobs will ultimately gut the middle class of this country dan gavin lexington s c could it be that our economic leaders have crawled out of their caves awakened to the sunlight of truth and discovered what all my drinking buddies at the crossroads bar in columbia city ind could have told them years ago our nation its industries and the american way of life are being if they havent already been destroyed by an unfair trade policy that allows everyone to take advantage of our nation and its people i will not relent in my opposition to the north american free trade agreement until one economist can look me in the eye and tell me what benefit this nation has gained from the imposition of this misguided and unfair trade agreement scores of plants within driving distance of my home are sitting empty because of nafta millions of american jobs have been lost and for what benefit etson hougland c p a fort wayne ind behavioral economics a subject that alan blinder knows something about teaches that people often read too much into the dominant facts currently before their eyes in fearing recent technological innovations that make "outsourcing" more likely mr blinder himself seems to have fallen victim to this psychological malady do todays technological advances put more pressure on american workers than did the arrival of electrification automobiles aviation container shipping and the microchip is todays increased competition from foreign workers really that different from the massive post world war ii entry of women into the work force unlikely mr blinder should chill out donald j boudreaux chairman department of economics george mason university fairfax va
