bank of america hits snag in bid to woo the rich private banker to leave as u s trust purchase leads to culture clash the top executive at u s trust a private banking operation being acquired for &# billion by bank of america corp has decided to quit this summer dealing a setback to the big banks ambitious push to become the leader in the lucrative business of managing rich peoples money peter k scaturro the year old chief executive officer of u s trust was supposed to continue leading the private bank and oversee bank of americas existing private bank unit once the deal is completed later this year but following a series of disagreements over how the combined operation should be run mr scaturro has decided to step down this summer people familiar with the situation said the disputes that prompted mr scaturros exit range from which computer system to use to whether bank of america should begin charging some of u s trusts ultrarich clients to use automated teller machines but while the problems arent seen as dire enough to derail the takeover they underscore the difficulty financial supermarkets like bank of america are having in adapting their mass market philosophies to rich people with different standards of service than everyday customers bank of america has lacked a renowned private banking name and has struggled to persuade clients that its private bank offers the type of personalized service they expect the charlotte n c bank pitches its size as a benefit since it can approve large personal loans but that heft also means clients often are steered toward a suite of the banks own products mr scaturro declined to comment a spokeswoman for u s trust referred questions to bank of america bank of america confirmed mr scaturros exit saying "we thank peter for his efforts in the early stages of the transition planning process and wish him the best " the bank says it will deliver the best of both companies to clients and provide "the highest level of personalized service products and performance " the likely new head of the combined private wealth management unit is frances aldrich sevilla sacasa president of u s trust according to people close to the situation she has been one of mr scaturros top deputies both at u s trust and when he was ceo of citigroup inc s citigroup private bank u s trust founded in counts some of americas oldest dynasties among its clients including the astors and whitneys and requires a minimum of &# million to open an account the firm has about &# billion of client assets bank of americas private bank has about &# billion under management mr scaturro who led a turnaround of u s trust after taking over as ceo in was an integral part of the bank of america combination bank of america chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis told cnbc after announcing the acquisition of the charles schwab corp unit that "weve got great leadership peter scaturro and that team is outstanding " bank of america offered mr scaturro the job of president of private wealth management overseeing both u s trust and its own private bank with compensation that could have exceeded &# million in unveiled in november the u s trust acquisition was touted as a deal that would allow u s trust clients to keep their white glove service and highly tailored investments while benefiting from the giant banks balance sheet and geographic reach bank of america got a top brand name in wealth management and a management team with a record of attracting and serving wealthy clients yet according to people familiar with the situation mr scaturro grew discouraged in recent weeks as brian moynihan bank of americas president of global wealth and investment management started stripping u s trust of its core strategies mr scaturro a highly driven entrepreneurial executive wanted to keep u s trust intact and apply his management principles to bank of americas private bank mr moynihan these people say wanted to overlay bank of americas systems on u s trust the bank requires its executives to be team players and mr scaturro was reluctant to compromise or take direction people familiar with bank of americas side of the transaction said the bank meanwhile balked at mr scaturros desire to report to mr lewis rather than to mr moynihan according to people familiar with the situation bank of america executives steeped in a more middle america culture also looked askance at u s trusts lavish new york headquarters according to people familiar with u s trusts side of the deal mr scaturro has a company car and driver to take him to and from work and to business functions mr lewis by contrast regularly drives himself to his offices as do other high ranking bank of america executives bank of america disputes that its executives were put off by u s trust practices pointing out that their bank entertains its clients lavishly and already operates one of the largest private banks in the u s one of the biggest clashes between mr scaturro and mr moynihan revolved around investments mr scaturro wanted wealthy clients to have their own set of financial products ranging from stock and bond portfolios to hedge funds and private equity investments mr moynihan wants to centralize the investments to serve a broader group of bank customers mr moynihan described the model in a february presentation to investors breaking clients into segments with investable assets of &# to &# million &# million to &# million and more than &# million despite his decision to quit mr scaturro is entitled to a lump sum of &# million in cash and shares valued at &# million when the deal closes according to his agreement with schwab under mr scaturro u s trusts earnings jumped to &# million in from &# million in bank of america has described its private banks earnings growth as "sluggish " and the units net income fell last year by or &# million after announcing the deal mr moynihan told analysts on a conference call that the bank planned to "keep the u s trust legacy keep the identity " and to run a "unified business across the entire wealth spectrum under peters leadership " but his and mr scaturros vision of how to treat this specialized clientele clearly differ for one thing mr moynihans mantra is "scale" mechanization and a one size fits all product suite has made bank of america excel in such areas as branch and business banking where products are commodities and where "customer delight" scores are scrutinized mr scaturro by contrast preaches "specialized service" to millionaire and billionaire clients who demand constant attention and performance the companys marketing events include intimate dinners for clients with top authors or politicians private concerts and cocktail parties at its manhattan townhouse mr moynihan according to people familiar with meetings held to orchestrate the banks integration viewed some of u s trusts marketing events as overly costly and ineffective bank of america and its predecessor nationsbank has been among the most aggressive at categorizing its "rich" clients from super rich down to merely rich and tailoring services along those lines which has meant some people accustomed to personal bankers end up steered to toll free phone numbers for service during one integration meeting mr moynihans team even suggested charging atm fees to u s trust clients seen as the ultimate insult to pampered customers who entrust millions to their advisers another battle revolved around technology according to people familiar with the discussions bank of america required u s trust and its clients to switch to its technology platform the move made it easier to automate the businesses yet for u s trust clients a change to their accounting and tax reporting systems could be trying bank of america says it is in the process of surveying u s trust customers about their priorities and is committed to shepherding them to the combined company in a careful and personalized way "our job is to make those customers even happier " said alexandra c trower a bank spokeswoman bank of america reached its unprecedented size through more than acquisitions during the s and s as the bank scurried from one deal to the next it hemorrhaged customers of companies it had paid dearly to acquire mr lewis has made integrating acquisitions a top priority in his six years at the helm and bank of america seems to have made progress in absorbing aspects of acquired companies cultures the bank boosted its share of new england customers after it bought fleetboston financial corp in in part because it adopted a popular integrated statement that showed all of a wealthy customers accounts still mr lewis remains leery of letting any unit operate under a different culture or name and was loath to let u s trust stand alone
