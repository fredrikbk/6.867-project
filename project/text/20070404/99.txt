ogilvys new digital chief discusses challenges hoping to sharpen its focus on digital media wpp groups ogilvy north america has named an interactive marketing veteran to the newly created position of chief digital officer jean philippe maheu a onetime chief executive of interactive ad agency razorfish will work with both clients and senior ogilvy managers to develop digital ad efforts ogilvys move is the latest sign that big traditional ad agencies under pressure from clients are trying to make web based and mobile advertising a stronger part of their day to day operations but as advertisers are shifting more of their ad budgets into digital media many are wrestling with a shortage of digitally experienced creative staffers at their ad agencies the issue was highlighted by nikes recent decision to move part of its business away from its longtime ad partner wieden + kennedy because of dissatisfaction with the shops digital abilities persuading madison avenue veterans to become more digitally aware wont be easy but ogilvy an iconic name in the ad world whose clients include ibm american express and unilevers dove has been forced to confront cultural barriers before its appointment of mr maheu comes about two years after the firm combined its traditional advertising division with its ogilvyone marketing services unit forcing creative heavyweights to work more closely with colleagues in less glamorous areas such as direct marketing and data analysis mr maheu years old left razorfish now part of aquantive in and joined the academic world for the past couple of years he has worked with various digital startups below carla hendra co chief executive of ogilvy north america and mr maheu discuss how clients are pushing for knowledge of digital techniques and the challenges to providing that expertise the wall street journal why is it crucial for ogilvy to have a chief digital officer ms hendra every single part of the ogilvy business has to be infused with digital because it affects how consumers and customers behave now we are really trying to move beyond what has been web the online branding and online direct marketing and e commerce advertising to move into content and community plays to do that we want someone whose full time job is understanding everything about the digital landscape and how to apply new technology to ideas and what kind of partnerships and alignments we need wsj if you didnt make this move what would happen to ogilvy going forward ms hendra if we didnt do this there might be cannibalization we might see some sort of shrinkage that we dont want to see who would have known a couple of years ago about the youtube phenomenon or the myspace phenomenon who would have known that the networks would start to go online in real time with their tv shows to stay ahead of that you have to have people who get that wsj on madison avenue the people who come up with ideas for traditional ads and the ones who figure out where those ads should appear are often segregated should the same hold true when it comes to digital advertising mr maheu in the digital world the line between the two is very blurry and getting more and more blurry in the offline world you really have two different processes one is to produce the ad and one is to place it in the online world the creative and the placement are so connected that you cant do one in a different phase you really have to think of the two as one integrated process wsj we continue to hear chatter that clients still hold back the majority of their ad dollars for promotion in traditional media tv radio and the like does ogilvy believe that tide is about to turn what forecast do you see for your clients spending patterns ms hendra we do see that tide turning the way ive always thought about it was kind of a turning point and was really the tipping point and now we are really going to see it shift wsj how will you manage the bruised egos that will no doubt result when you try to get and year old executives to make digital advertising more a part of their daily working lives do you think you will have to spend time cracking the whip mr maheu im actually looking forward to working with guys who have been around the block a few more times than i have and have been very successful at creating great brands the driving factor is not me its actually the marketplace once you see how clients are working they are asking questions they are asking how much should we spend and how much should we allocate on budgets and how can we continue to strengthen a brand or build a new brand to win in the marketplace wsj how do you expect ongoing interest in watching tv via the internet or the emergence of apples new web friendly television to change traditional tv ads mr maheu whats interesting is that the tv culture is changing more than the ads tv content is changing and you will see more and more five minute content webisodes the concept of the minute program or one hour program is a very artificial concept i want to be clear those changes are going to happen over a very long period the tv spend is still worth what around &# billion in the u s but there is no question that the younger generation is not watching tv the same way that i watched tv as a teen advertiser sponsored content is going to grow very fast and its got to be multichannel its going to be customized to the size of the screen and to how users use that
