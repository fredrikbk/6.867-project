feasible " said a u s official working on the issue in many ways u s allies such as saudi arabia and jordan have been trying to do the opposite in recent months courting iran to draw it away from syria say arab diplomats saudi officials have held a string of meetings with senior iranian leaders in recent months in a bid to stabilize lebanon the palestinian territories and iraq but riyadh has largely isolated damascus saudi officials say king abdullah has taken personally the murder of mr hariri a close friend of the saudi royal family though the saudi monarch seemed to soften his position
