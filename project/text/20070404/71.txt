jobs and immigrants while politicians haggle over immigration reform the u s economys demand for workers foreign and domestic continues to grow on monday u s officials began accepting applications for the available h b visas the kind that go to foreign professionals for the fiscal year starting in october by tuesday the quota had been filled making this the third straight year that the cap was reached before the fiscal year had even begun its another example of the disconnect between immigration policy and labor market realities a common assumption of immigration critics is that alien workers are either stealing american jobs or reducing home grown wages but both notions are flawed according to a new and illuminating study by economist giovanni peri for the public policy institute of california using census data mr peri analyzed the effects of immigrant labor on california home to some of all foreign born workers in the u s the university of california at davis economist found "no evidence that the inflow of immigrants over the period worsened the employment opportunities of natives with similar education and experience " as to wages mr peri found that "during immigration induced a percent real wage increase for the average native worker this effect ranged from near zero + for wages of native high school dropouts and between and percent for native workers with at least a high school diploma " this means immigrants not only arent "stealing" jobs theyre helping to boost the pay of native u s workers these findings arent as shocking as they might first seem once you consider the abilities that immigrants bring here and how they compare with those of u s natives most immigrants fall into one of two categories unskilled laborers with less than a high school diploma and skilled professionals with advanced degrees in of california workers who lacked a high school diploma were foreign born as were of those with doctorates by contrast across the entire u s natives are concentrated between those two extremes they comprise just under a third of workers without a high school diploma and only of those with ph d s what this means is that immigrants on balance serve as complements rather than perfect substitutes for u s workers for the most part the two arent competing for the same jobs so rather than displacement what were getting is a bigger economic pie this dynamic has resulted in a more efficient domestic labor market greater investment higher overall economic growth and more choices for consumers "in nontechnical terms " writes mr peri "the wages of native workers could increase because the increased supply of migrants is likely to put native workers in jobs where they perform supervisory managerial training and in general interactive and coordinating tasks which makes them more productive " more workers also mean more consumption so "immigration might simply increase total production and demand without depressing wages " it turns out that immigrants compete most directly with other recent immigrants mr peri found that "foreign born workers already here sustain the largest losses in real wages losing between and percent of their real wage" from to its true that most immigrants compete for jobs more directly with low skill u s natives but even here the job preferences differ with foreigners more likely to be found in agriculture while less educated natives tend toward manufacturing mr peri finds that even unskilled foreign workers have a slight positive effect on the wages of their native counterparts other economists such as george borjas of harvard have found a slight negative effect in this cohort in any case and considering the overall net economic gains any immigration reform designed to protect this small and shrinking subset of unskilled native workers would seem short sighted at best as congress prepares to give immigration policy another go expect to hear lots of talk about the dire consequences of immigrant labor the facts and the california experience argue otherwise
