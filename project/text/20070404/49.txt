fitzgeralds cover up for a prosecutor who claims to be a truth seeker patrick fitzgerald sure can be secretive even now that the scooter libby trial is over and his "leak" investigation is all but closed the unaccountable special counsel wants to keep his arguments for creating a constitutional showdown over reporters and their sources under lock and key mr fitzgerald is fighting release of the affidavits he filed with the d c circuit court of appeals to justify compelling two reporters to testify about their conversations with mr libby and to throw one of them in jail for days until she did so also under court seal are eight pages of a redacted d c circuit opinion by judge david tatel that explained the courts decision to support mr fitzgeralds pursuit of the reporters in january dow jones which publishes this newspaper and the associated press requested that the d c circuit release this material now that the case is wrapped up by demanding that the reporters betray their sources mr fitzgerald caused a legal collision that went all the way to the supreme court the public the press and other prosecutors all have what the dow jones ap motion calls "an undeniable and overwhelming public interest" in knowing the arguments and information that mr fitzgerald made to the court his demand and the d c circuit ruling set a precedent that may well encourage other prosecutors to force journalists to betray their sources too his effort also appeared at least to us to violate long standing justice department guidelines concerning such pursuit of journalists his pursuit is all the more puzzling in retrospect because we now know that mr fitzgerald already knew at the time he was demanding that the reporters betray their sources that the real leaker was richard armitage not mr libby the two reporters he subpoenaed and their lawyers did not know this at the time however and if they had it might have changed their arguments or decisions at a minimum prosecutors and reporters deserve to know what evidence the d c circuit found so compelling so we can all avoid such future collisions congress also has an interest now that it is contemplating a "shield law" to protect media sources in his reply to the dj ap motion mr fitzgerald tries to hide behind rule e of grand jury secrecy he claims the integrity of grand juries will be compromised by the release but much of the material was already disclosed during the libby trial if not leaked earlier and the far larger risk to grand jury integrity would be if mr fitzgerald misled the courts about what he knew and when he knew it in order to coerce the two reporters to testify as a "special counsel" appointed by his good friend and former deputy attorney general james comey mr fitzgerald operated essentially without justice department supervision he once said himself that he "served as the functional equivalent of the attorney general " now he wants the d c circuit to give him a free pass as well the dow jones ap request is about holding mr fitzgerald accountable for what he told the courts if it is the same as what he told the public then the prosecutor should have nothing to fear from the release of the affidavits or judge tatels redacted opinion
