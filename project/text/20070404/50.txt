french language purists put brakes on car makers paris car makers attempting to entice french customers into showrooms with the latest crossover vehicles could run afoul of the government and their guardians of the language instead of using the word "crossover" a cross between a sports utility vehicle and a classical sedan design in their advertising marketers in france should be using the officially approved term "vehicule metis" literally "mixed race vehicle " for more than a decade defenders of the french language have been trying to turn back the tide of anglicisms invading the language the year war has already produced lists of hundreds of terms whose use is forbidden within the administration and discouraged in the private sector the battle began back in when jacques toubon culture minister set up commissions to weed out intrusions into the french language that were threatening to pollute its purity the commissions covered most walks of life and special attention was given to the financial and industrial sectors where english language terms were creeping in at a rate that alarmed guardians of the french language the commissions are the responsibility of the ministry of the sector with which they deal under the umbrella of the ministry of economics finance and industry special commissions were created to supervise the oil and gas telecommunications information technology nuclear chemical engineering and automobile sectors the automobile panel produced two lists with a total of of prohibited terms last year apart from "crossover " they include expressions such as "city car" which must be replaced by "citadine" while "customization" must be substituted by "personnalisation " one of the first tasks of the commission in was to decree that the english term "anti lock braking system" or abs must be replaced by "antiblocage de securite" happily leaving the abbreviation unchanged the common rail direct fuel injection system used on some diesel engines is supposed to be called "rampe commune a haute pression" in france and what is termed a minivan in english speaking countries must be called a "monospace" in france once the "commissions for terminologies and neologisms" have identified the terms that they feel need weeding out they submit them for approval to a panel of language experts then to the venerable academie francaise the institution that sets the rules on the french language government ministers in the relevant department then get to have their say and once officially approved or rather disapproved the offending terms are published in an official gazette once or twice a year however isabelle hugues who supervises the commission on economic and financial terminology for the finance ministry told dow jones newswires "legally theres no obligation to use the approved terms what were trying to do is encourage people to substitute french terms for non french ones with the administration showing the example " french government officials can only give you their "courriel" address the word for e mail in official french not the one where they want to receive e mail and public sector contracts can only use officially sanctioned terminology but car makers must be wary about talking with pride of the latest models glittering in their showrooms "showroom" is also verboten the preferred term being "salle dexposition " david warten a sales representative for pacific motors a dealership for chrysler jeep and dodge in france said he would like to see a crackdown on english terms especially in advertising "i try to avoid using foreign terms with customers but customers often use them and im not going to contradict them " mr warten pointed out that perhaps a good place for france to start rolling back anglicisms would be road signs "in france the sign at an intersection says stop whereas in french speaking quebec it says arret "
