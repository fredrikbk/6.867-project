the afternoon report ahmadinejads gift online edition iran said it would release british service members that it detained nearly two weeks ago in the persian gulf ending a diplomatic standoff between tehran and london that had sent energy prices soaring on fears of a broader conflict president mahmoud ahmadinejad said that he had decided to pardon the sailors and marines framing the move as a "gift" to the british people on the occasion of the birthday of the prophet muhammad and easter the group was captured on march purportedly for navigating into iranian waters to board a vessel as part of a routine security operation in the gulf britain has contested irans version of events saying that the sailors were well within iraqi territorial waters and that tehran had submitted conflicting accounts of exactly where the sailors had been taken prisoner mr ahmadinejad made it clear that tehrans view of what led to the episode hadnt softened "i want to thank the iranian coast guard who courageously defended and captured those who violated their territorial waters " he said before pinning medals to the chests of the coast guard officers who detained the british force iranian television also showed mr ahmadinejad shaking hands with the detainees who were dressed in business suits the british government said it welcomed the news and was awaiting word on the "methods and timing" of the release a breakthrough appeared close in recent days irans top envoy ali larijani had said tehran wanted to reach a diplomatic resolution to the impasse amid reports that direct talks had taken place between him and representatives from prime minister tony blairs office further an iranian diplomat who had been held captive in iraq since early this year was released yesterday and irans state news agencies reported today that iranian representatives would be permitted to meet with five iranian men who were arrested in irbil iraq by american forces late last year the men were accused of providing supplies to iraqi militias both london and washington insisted that the developments in iraq were happening independently of talks on the captured sailors however and mr ahmadinejad said that there was no link between the developments energy markets heaved a great sigh of relief crude oil futures had soared amid the standoff as traders feared that tehran might decide
