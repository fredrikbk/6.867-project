monteverdi meets vinoly as ulysses returns home il ritorno dulisse in patria chicago opera theater tomorrow and saturday la donna del lago new york city opera tomorrow and saturday chicago chicago opera theater is carving out an interesting niche that distinguishes it from the larger lyric opera of chicago it performs in a smaller house the new harris theater for music and dance in millennium park and leans toward offbeat repertoire this spring for example cot is completing its cycle of the three surviving monteverdi operas with "il ritorno dulisse in patria" its using an orchestra of six of them continuo players something the lyric could never do in its enormous theater the production has one big name the music loving architect rafael vinoly better known for such buildings as the kimmel center in philadelphia and the recently opened business school at the university of chicago designed the set both set and orchestra were central to the character of the production which adeptly fused a modern sensibility with historical understanding for this tale of ulysses returning to his desolate wife penelope after years of war and wandering mr vinoly created an architectural microcosm of greece his arrangement of white blocks set in the middle of the stage provided a flexible multilevel playing space that with the colorful evocative lighting of aaron black suggested the harsh sun drenched land surrounded by water as well as a shepherds pasture and the dwellings of the gods who dictate the fates of mortals the blocks even opened up to offer tantalizing glimpses of red interiors its the rare unit set that works so well the hard edges of the set made for a piquant contrast with the sound contours of the plucked and bowed instruments in the pit this opera is all about the musical shaping of the text centered vocal lines and jane glover conducting from one of the two harpsichords sensitively accompanied the singers capturing the subtle passions of the score the singers were stylistically in synch with the instruments tenor mark le brocq was an imposing ulisse mezzo marie lenormand was capable but needed a bit more emotional depth for penelope "ulisse" is a great showcase for singers in featured roles and the cot boasted several to watch mezzo fiona murphy as a persuasive minerva tenor nicholas phan as a youthful brash telemaco and the powerful bass paul corona as tempo and antinoo one of penelopes suitors diane pauluss unobtrusive direction used the set well i particularly liked the debate between giove jason collins on the top level and nettuno darren k stokes in green full body makeup rising out of the sea floor beyond the set candice donnellys costumes followed a quasi classical greek drapery motif for the women the mens outfits with their pajama pants and gold chains were a bit too far removed from ancient ithaca new york the new york city opera new yorks "second" opera company has more in common with its larger wealthier competitor the metropolitan a sizable budget and season and a big house to fill than cot does with its hometown rival it is always searching for a niche and though it has an illustrious history it is rather in the artistic doldrums at the moment if the shockingly inert new production of rossinis "la donna del lago" that had its premiere on march represents city opera these days then it is definitely time for gerard mortier to take over the reins in case you missed the news mr mortier the impresario and provocateur who has been shaking up opera houses in europe for the past three decades becomes artistic director of city opera in at the moment no one appears to be minding the store rossinis serious operas can be splendid blood curdling stuff and "la donna del lago" which is based on sir walter scotts "the lady of the lake" and features a young lady courted by three suitors two rebel highland chieftains king james of scotland in disguise and some stirring tunes should have been no exception but director chas rader shieber and designer david zinn supplied a cheap looking dismally gray un romantic set peppered it with noisy snow and peopled it with automatons wearing dark colors and earth tones direction what there was of it was by the numbers the womens chorus when it wasnt moving its ladderback chairs around looked like a severe presbyterian sewing circle the mens chorus resembled a monty python spoof of gilbert and sullivan soldiers stiffly clasping bayonets the two principal singers soprano alexandrina pendatchanska as elena the lady of the title and tenor barry banks as uberto who is really king james proved their mettle in this florid and very high at least for the tenor repertoire three years ago delivering knockout performances in city operas "ermione " this time they seemed unenergetic and plodding a condition that appeared to emanate from the pit where george manahan was leading a leaden performance without a hint of sparkle or drama perhaps as a result laura vlasak nolen a potent mezzo soprano giving her all in the trouser part of malcolm elenas true love sounded duller than she should have tenor robert mcpherson making his company debut as rodrigo the highland chieftain whom elenas father daniel mobbs wants her to marry sounded strangled in the murderously high vocal extensions of the role the one bright moment was the trio in which rodrigo and uberto fight with swords so what was the point of those guns and elena tries to stop them fight director rod kinter actually got some action going onstage the singers began relating to each other and the music had some zip this was exciting but lamentably very brief when it was over everyone went back to sleep ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
