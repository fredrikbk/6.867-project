the charity gap as americans prepare their tax returns many will be toting up their tax deductible donations whether it is support for a church or hospital or their alma mater they have every reason to feel good about what theyre doing but there is a surprising disconnect between americans philanthropic aspirations and their charitable giving the vast majority of givers believe the bulk of their donations help those less fortunate than themselves in fact less than one third of the money individuals gave to nonprofits in went to help the economically disadvantaged according to a new study commissioned by google org the philanthropic arm of google of the &# billion in donations less than &# billion explicitly targeted those in need the analysis carried out by the center on philanthropy at indiana university concluded that only of donations provide food shelter or other basic necessities at most an additional is directed to the poor either providing other direct benefits such as medical treatment and scholarships or through initiatives creating opportunity and empowerment such as literacy and job training programs its just not true in other words that the major beneficiaries of charity and philanthropy are the disadvantaged the "charity gap" is even wider among the affluent wealthy individuals claim according to a bank of america study that their giving is driven by a "feeling that those who have more should give to those with less " but people who earn more than &# million per year give only of their donations for basic needs and an additional to other programs geared toward the poor these numbers matter overall donations by individuals are more than four times that of foundation and corporate philanthropic efforts combined and they matter most among the wealthiest since fewer than families contribute more than of all donations while more research is necessary to understand this charity gap several explanations seem likely first it is certainly easier to give and harder to say no to those in your own community or among your circle of friends neighbors deliver invitations to school auctions classmates call for university capital campaigns the homeless shelter in the inner city offers neither the peer pressure of a familiar face nor the opportunity for ones friends to see ones generosity giving to organizations close to home also offers more comfort that funds will be used effectively a second reason may be that donors do not fully understand where their contributions go for people with annual incomes below &# religious giving dominates comprising two thirds of all donations while the church food drive may be in donors minds as they reach into their pockets less than cents of every dollar given to religious organizations funds programs for the economically disadvantaged for the wealthiest americans education and health care comprise the majority of donations yet in education fewer than nine cents per dollar pays for scholarships in health only cents per dollar funds programs targeted to the needy of course philanthropic giving not targeted to the disadvantaged nevertheless supports important causes education health the arts and valuable public goods such programs benefit everyone rich and poor though to substantially differing degrees but because they are broad based such efforts are far from the most effective method of addressing critical issues for those most in need the "charity gap" becomes more acute as the scale goes global the most generous estimate shows that only of u s individual donations supports international causes of any kind though many organizations including global giving and technoserve demonstrate that small amounts of money can make an enormous difference in the lives of individuals and communities in poor countries the worlds poorest are virtually ignored by the philanthropic giving of citizens of the worlds wealthiest nation as americans consider their s this year they need to ask if there is a disconnect between their desires and their actions many will find perhaps to their surprise that what they want to do is not in deed what theyre doing if so they should start looking deeper into how their donations benefit those whose economic fortunes are dramatically different from their own ms sandberg is vice president of global online sales &amp operations at google inc and a board member of google org see related letters "letters to the editor converting donations and good intentions into meaningful charity" wsj april
