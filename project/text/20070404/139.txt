tax report fraud alleged at jackson hewitt sites the u s government alleging "pervasive fraud " is trying to shut down many jackson hewitt tax service sites in georgia illinois michigan and north carolina the governments charges contained in lawsuits filed in federal district courts may spark greater interest within congress to expand regulation of paid preparers more than of taxpayers paid someone to do their returns last year up from in the mid s senate finance committee chairman max baucus said yesterday that the finance committee "was already going to return to the issue of regulating paid preparers this year and this news from the irs underscores the need for closer oversight " the montana democrat also said the government "owes it to all the honest taxpayers out there to build in safeguards that prevent fraud and encourage trustworthy service " concern about the quality of work by some paid preparers mounted last year after a congressional investigative agency found key errors even cheating by workers at a few major tax preparation firms those firms werent identified some lawmakers want to require paid preparers to meet basic training and competency standards they also want to make it easier for the internal revenue service to punish offenders but irs commissioner mark everson has expressed concerns about the additional burden this would place on the agency yesterday the justice department said it filed civil injunction suits against five corporations that operate jackson hewitt franchises and people who manage or work there the corporations allegedly operate more than jackson hewitt stores in the chicago atlanta detroit and raleigh durham n c areas the government said according to the government farrukh sohail of atlanta wholly or partly owns each of the five corporations which prepared and filed more than federal returns last year the government said mr sohail and other defendants "created and fostered a business environment" at the franchises in which "fraudulent tax return preparation is encouraged and flourishes " the lawsuits allege a wide range of fraud such as filing returns claiming refunds based on phony wage forms using fabricated businesses and business expenses on returns to claim bogus deductions and fraud related to the earned income tax credit designed for the working poor the suits allege more than &# million in combined losses to the treasury the government seeks court orders barring the franchises and other defendants from preparing returns for others jackson hewitt officials couldnt be reached to comment a lawyer for mr sohail said any abuses at the franchises were isolated events and that anyone caught in a criminal act has been fired he wouldnt talk specifically about who had been dismissed but said several of those named in a complaint filed in illinois were no longer with the company "we think weve done a good job " he said "it is not in our benefit to file false tax returns " the complaints are intended in part to reassure americans that "those who arent complying with the law arent getting away with it " a justice department official said an irs official emphasized that the complaints refer only to the entities charged referring to the five corporations that hold the franchises involved he said it would "be wrong to infer anything about the overall corporate entity " the problem for taxpayers involved in this situation is that now the irs is on to them and taxes penalties and interest will be owed said irs commissioner everson the majority of taxpayers involved had modest income mr everson said he urged taxpayers knowing or suspecting something was wrong with their returns to "get right with the system" as soon as possible that means filing amended returns on form x for past years and filing an accurate return this year he said mr sohails lawyer said his client plans to work with the irs to resolve the issue "we hope to improve our business organization from this " he said the lawsuits involved only the jackson hewitt franchises and not any of the other major tax preparers jackson hewitt is the second largest tax return preparation firm in the u s yesterday shares of jackson hewitt fell &# or to &# in new york stock exchange trading early this year the irs cautioned taxpayers to be careful when hiring someone to prepare their returns before you hire someone look into that persons credentials including educational background and whether they have had any specialized tax training beware of anyone who promises to get a bigger refund for you than anyone else avoid those who say their tax preparation fee will be a percentage of the amount of the refund also beware of a preparer who wont sign your return upper income taxpayers with complex returns should consider "enrolled agents " accountants or other professionals with special expertise enrolled agents are licensed to represent taxpayers before the irs jackson hewitt tax service isnt related in any way to liberty tax service which is based in virginia beach va and headed by john hewitt mr hewitt was the chief executive of jackson hewitt before it was sold in beware of bogus emails

raid your assets "dont be fooled by these shameless scam artists " the irss mr everson said "the irs doesnt send unsolicited email" or ask for detailed personal and financial information if you get a questionable email claiming to come from the irs relay it to phishing irs gov or call the irs says briefs the irs has received about million individual income tax returns as of march thats up from a
