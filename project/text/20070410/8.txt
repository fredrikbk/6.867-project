apache sees profit in discards petroleum firm squeezes output from fields missed left by rivals while many u s energy exploration companies are tripping over each other to invest in exotic new sources of natural gas apache corp is staking its future on the industrys castoffs apache squeezes the last drops out of old oil and gas fields left behind by other companies looking for the next big find this makes it different from competitors that have chosen to focus on what is known as unconventional gas big deposits trapped in tricky technically difficult places to tap as the traditional big finds become scarce the strategy has contributed to a more than doubling of its annual net earnings since though profit at apache and many of its peers declined last year as natural gas prices fell and prices for oil field equipment and services surged "we know who we are and we try to stay with what we know " said chief executive g steven farris speaking from apaches glass and steel headquarters in houston companies like apache will become increasingly important to world energy need in a time of tight supplies and increasing dependence on reserves in remote or politically difficult places apaches strategy carries risks managing older fields can be a technical challenge its operations in places like the hurricane prone gulf of mexico can be less dependable than unconventional projects which can result in hefty tallies of supplies for future production once tapped as a result its shares have trailed those of many peers apache has spent more than &# billion over the past year to increase its acreage in texass permian basin and the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico well plumbed regions other companies are abandoning the investments include a &# billion deal mr farris closed late last month with anadarko petroleum corp to buy oil and gas fields in the permian basin and as many of its comparably sized peers venture successfully into the deepwater gulf of mexico making substantial oil finds that have boosted their market value apache has shunned those more glamorous plays instead it is staying in the boring but profitable shallow end of the gulf where it now books of its reserves the company also has been building its international portfolio buying existing production in canada and the united kingdom for instance in apache bought the british north seas forties field one of the richest oil finds ever from bp plc discovered in the field reached its peak of barrels of oil equivalent a day in over the next years output dwindled to fewer than barrels a day for bp the once giant forties had become but a sliver of its output of barrels a day in the north sea and more than million barrels a day globally but for apache it represented a sizable increase to its reserves and production the company struck a deal to buy the field for &# million it then spent an additional &# million through the end of in new cranes pumps and other equipment to update bps former facilities and drill new wells by the end of that year apache had cut operating costs in half and raised production to up to barrels per day generating &# billion in revenue last year revenue from forties was &# billion and cash margins had risen to &# per barrel from &# per barrel in early apache sees its exploitation of old fields in north america as a source of steady cash to fund its search for oil abroad albeit with the same strategy of looking at fields that have been discarded or overlooked however abroad where there are more untapped oil and gas reserves than in the u s the company has also focused on exploring and developing new fields in recent years apache has expanded its operations to explore for oil in australia argentina and egypt its production outside of north america has grown to of its total output compared with years ago "it continues to stand out as a leader despite not being the company thats in vogue " says ellen hannan managing director at bear stearns apaches approach hasnt won it many admirers among investors enamored with the more exciting new discoveries in unconventional gas fields unlocking gas trapped in coal shale and sand is an expensive undertaking requiring companies to drill thousands of wells per field but companies can tell investors they have an inventory of "proved" gas reserves that will take years to develop boosting market confidence in their long term value devon energy corp has a share price earnings ratio which indicates investors confidence in the companys growth prospects of eog resources ratio is and southwestern energy co s is a whopping apache meanwhile has a p e ratio of "if you have unconventional plays you have a drilling inventory that extends for years and its easy for an investor to see where youre going " explained jason gammel senior vice president for oil and gas at prudential equity group "thats just not as apparent with apache " apaches net income has grown to &# billion or &# a share last year from &# billion or &# a share in the companys stock has risen to &# yesterday in new york stock exchange p m composite trading from &# in the past three years though that still lagged behind eog whose shares have more than tripled during the period analysts say that apache makes more money from its investments than competitors between and apache had a full cycle return on investment of compared with devons and eogs according to calculations by bear stearns the return is computed by dividing the average cash margin per barrel by the average cost of finding and developing per barrel and measures the efficiency of a companys investment over time that says mr farris is the real key to securing a solid future in oil and gas exploration as the industry gets older there will only be more mature fields which are tricky and costly to exploit with several decades of experience in aging fields under its belt apache will be in better shape to tackle them than others "what we do for a living is really the format of the future because the real answer is going to be getting more out of what youve got " says mr farris
