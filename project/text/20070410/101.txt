the daily fix a rollins prediction looks empty as phillies collapse against mets online edition in january jimmy rollins of the philadelphia phillies offered new york and philadelphia columnists the equivalent of a full employment act declaring that the phillies who finished games behind the new york mets were the team to beat in the nl east the two teams met yesterday for the mets home owner during which mr rollins hit into a double play with the bases loaded booted a potential double play grounder with the bases loaded and wound up with met fans mockingly chanting his name as the mets game back from a deficit to mash the phillies new york is now the phils are mr rollins to his credit is standing by his scouting report and said the crowd was "great they are fans theyre supposed to get on the other players and try to get under your skin " "if you havent really arrived until they notice you in new york then jimmy rollins made his official major league debut yesterday " bob ford writes in the philadelphia inquirer " jim my roll ins jim my roll ins came the mocking singsong from the stands at shea stadium the fans added a verb occasionally just for effect but it wasnt all that necessary fifty thousand people chanting your name is testament enough " mr ford spends some time dissecting the decisions made by embattled manager charlie manuel before returning to mr rollins and his prediction "if rollins is right about the phillies now would be the time to start indicating that " he writes "the bullpen does not have the managers confidence obviously and the offense is still unreliable in crucial situations the phillies own fans are on the verge of mutiny what jimmy rollins liked yesterday was that a stadium full of hostile fans knew his name if the team keeps going as it is hell get to experience that every night in philadelphia too " at least the phillies got to play the cleveland indians last played a week ago all four games scheduled against the seattle mariners in the ms only scheduled trip to cleveland were snowed out the good news the indians will get to play their home opener tonight against the whatever angels of whatever the bad news jacobs field still looks like antarctica so theyll be playing their home opener in milwaukee "for the indians season to take a stranger twist they would have to return from the next three home games in milwaukee to a weekend forecast of a locust plague friday a midge blackout saturday and a sky full of flying nuns sunday " writes bud shaw in the cleveland plain dealer adding that "baseball ignored an inconvenient truth its not exactly the one al gore turned into a movie about global warming it snows here in april sometimes freakishly freezing rain is even more common and when games get postponed against a team that isnt coming back until good luck with that " in chicago the cubs frigid home opener was wrecked by the houston astros leaving the cubs and their massive payroll at in the sun times chris le duca says its the fault of dusty baker the cubs manager in wha no really "a week into the season we still are trying to get to know the new look cubs now run by lou piniella but one troubling trend is starting to emerge " mr le duca writes "late inning relievers bob howry and left hander scott eyre two bright spots during a forgettable dont look nearly as trustworthy late in games and it summons memories of baker overusing his two reliable relievers down the stretch of a lost season howry a former closer for the white sox in appeared in a career high games last season that seemed like an awful lot for a year old who has shoulder and elbow operations on his medical chart as for eyre during august and september when a decision already had been made about bakers dismissal the lefty made appearances and compiled an era he clearly was running out of gas but baker kept running him out there presumably to salvage his managerial record and now howry and eyre seem to be paying the price and raising concerns " one of the most interesting new blogs of isnt the work of a sportswriter stats guy or a wild eyed fan its pitches written by the boston red soxsssss curt schilling take for instance mr schillings monday entry dissecting his sunday start against the texas rangers a win for boston and mr schilling it chronicles the pitchers work against the rangers lineup pitch by pitch and its fascinating for at least two reasons for openers its another example of the awesome recall baseballs top players have of individuals pitches in an at bat reflecting a focus that even the most dedicated fans can only imagine maybe mr schilling writes his blog entries rewinding and advancing video of his starts but it sure doesnt read that way secondly its an interesting reminder of just how often things go wrong even for the best pitchers pitches that hang or miss their targets badly and it helps that mr schillings superb at explaining his craft as in this dissection of "pitching to contact" and his splitter "the split is a pitch i have never ever tried to throw for a strike it gets swung at because it spends of the time in the strike zone and when thrown right is a ball when it reaches the plate ive always thrown a very high percentage of strikes but i would bet that a very large portion of those strikes are balls made strikes by contact or swings and misses it goes back to a philosophy i tried hard to learn and pitch by which is this the key to pitching is being able to throw a ball when they are swinging and a strike when they are taking the key to that is being able to know when those two will happen " ready for some playoff hockey the battle lines are set in the nhl the east will feature the buffalo sabres against the new york islanders the new jersey devils

eight series see links to the right once you click through meanwhile the fix casts its eye its four eyes on two coaches in newsday mark herrmann writes that the islanders showed their respect for coach ted nolan not by what they did after a shootout win against the devils but by what they didnt do "instead of jumping immediately onto the ice which is what hockey players do when they are on the bench and something remarkable happens they stood right where they were " mr herrmann writes "they all had to congratulate coach ted nolan that was unexpected nolan said yesterday unexpected definitely not undeserved " if the ducks want to find their coach hes easy to find by his own admission randy carlyle is loud he was as a player and he remains that way now that hes in street clothes "carlyles overriding belief is that the world would be a more efficient place if we didnt have to guess what our colleagues and relatives were thinking " the orange county registers mark whicker writes "he contributes mightily toward that effort teammates who would slacken got the same sulfuric treatment that delinquent ducks do now reporters who float idle questions in carlyles face find them spiked toward their feet once you get used to it its not a bad way to live " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
