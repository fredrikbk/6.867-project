politics &amp economics congress follows email trail white house faces queries over use of private accounts washington the widespread use of private email accounts by some top white house officials is sparking a congressional probe into the practice and whether it violates a post nixon law requiring that white house deliberations be documented a top democratic lawmaker says outside email accounts were used in an attempt to avoid scrutiny the white house says their purpose was to avoid using government resources for political activities although they were used to discuss the firing of u s attorneys last year scott jennings an aide in the white house political affairs office used an account he had set up at the republican national committee instead of his official white house account to help plan the firings of eight u s attorneys who had run afoul of the administration a copy of that email among others has surfaced in the subsequent flap over those firings in january white house officials used another rnc email account to send bush appointees a powerpoint presentation on democrats they were targeting for defeat in the elections the presentation "is a close hold and were not supposed to be emailing it around " an official wrote in the email susan ralston until recently presidential adviser karl roves assistant at the white house appears to have used at least four outside email accounts a "gwb" domain account a "georgewbush com" account and an "rnchq org" account all run by the rnc plus an aol account she once emailed two associates of lobbyist jack abramoff "i now have an rnc blackberry which you can use to e mail me at any time no security issues like my wh email " now democratic lawmakers and other critics of the administration want to know more about the bush white houses policy on using outside accounts some officials relied on laptop computers and portable email devices provided by the rnc to keep political nongovernment activities separate from official government activities rep henry waxman d calif chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform has requested documents and other data from the white house and the rnc as part of a congressional investigation into the use of outside accounts in at least some cases it appears that "white house officials were using the nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications " mr waxman said in a letter to the rnc the proliferation of outside email accounts for white house officials in some ways reflects a problem that many other employers also face how to keep track of employees electronic messages as strict new record retention policies become commonplace organizations can install software to track employees use of personal email accounts on a work device like a company laptop or blackberry but such software isnt widely deployed employers also can easily search for and find private emails stored on company owned devices but outside email accounts can foster a false sense of security among users even when rules governing how work related documents are tracked still apply under the presidential records act the white house must ensure that decisions and deliberations are "adequately documented" and that the resulting records are preserved for posterity critics of the administration are questioning whether administration officials use of outside email accounts violates this law officials used outside accounts because "they dont want anyone ever to be able to come back and see what was going on behind the scenes " said melanie sloan executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington a watchdog group white house officials dispute the criticisms saying the purpose of the rnc accounts has been to avoid running afoul of another federal law the hatch act it prohibits many federal officials from engaging in political activity on government time or with government resources "these accounts are for political purposes and theyre for staff who might regularly interface with political organizations" such as the rnc said white house spokesman scott stanzel "its entirely appropriate for them to have these " the presidential records act has a specific exception for purely political matters that dont relate to official duties the scrutiny follows several recent investigations that have disclosed use of alternative email accounts including the current uproar over the fired u s attorneys a house probe into the powerpoint presentation on the targeted democratic lawmakers and the abramoff investigation mr abramoff who is now in prison was at the center of a congressional corruption scandal that contributed to republicans defeat in the elections the white house provided the emails to congress which made them public the official white house email system uses the domain "who eop gov" for white house executive office of the president with some variations many of the unofficial domains at the center of the controversy trace back to different political campaigns the presidential campaign left a legacy of "georgewbush com" accounts for example the "rnchq org" accounts were created for white house officials who spend a lot of time talking to rnc headquarters the clinton administration generally barred the use of outside email accounts by white house officials according to its internal policy manuals it did allow the democratic national committee to install computer equipment inside the white house for political emails and related work but not government work said ms sloan and others the outside accounts used by bush administration officials tend to be maintained on computers based off white house premises such as at rnc headquarters critics also allege that bush white house officials have been using outside accounts to conduct what amounts to government business "replacement of u s attorneys would be a traditional function of the white house " said ms sloan "its pretty clear thats a presidential function so its not a hatch act function its not political " "at the end of the day it looks like they were trying to avoid the records act by operating official business off the official systems " said john podesta who worked in the white house for the entire clinton presidency including a stint as chief of staff in his letter to the rnc mr waxman cited an email in which an abramoff associate said a white house official had warned him not to send requests for help through the official system because "to put this stuff in writing in their e mail system might actually limit what they can do to help us " democrats said such emails should be going through the official white house system so they can be archived in compliance with the law the white house and rnc said the rnc is preserving the emails generated by white house officials on the rncs computers and that they are exempt from the rncs normal policy of erasing emails after days enforcing the law might be difficult when congress adopted the presidential records act it didnt give any agency much authority to police the white houses handling of official records a federal appeals court in held that the courts dont have the ability to enforce the law either congress also has had trouble obtaining many internal records from the political parties in the past that means that the white house and its republican allies likely have wide latitude when it comes to protecting records kept outside the white house computer system vauhini vara
