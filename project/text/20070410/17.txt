blood strains amgens star fades amid safety questions biotech firm confronts big company woes scrutiny in congress thousand oaks calif as the year began amgen inc s chief executive kevin sharer boasted his biotechnology company had just finished "one of our very very best years ever " the worlds largest biotech company by sales enjoyed a market capitalization above &# billion higher than many big pharmaceutical companies sales were rising at a double digit clip but today amgen and mr sharer are on the defensive safety questions have emerged on two of its biggest drugs which treat anemia in cancer and kidney failure patients a black box warning placed march on the labels of those and other anemia drugs urges doctors to use the smallest possible dose of the drugs amgen stock has plunged wiping out roughly &# billion in market value since its week high in october amgen has arrived as a big pharmaceutical company and now confronts some of the same problems as pfizer inc or merck &amp co among them heavy reliance on a few blockbusters an uncertain pipeline of new drugs despite heavy research spending questions about safety and marketing and recently the prospect of competition from generics makers that adds up to a crunch for mr sharer a year old former lieutenant commander on navy nuclear submarines the chief executive who collected a &# million compensation package last year acknowledges financial "head winds" but says "in a &# billion company its something we can handle " for the short term his strategy is to shore up the anemia drugs by touting their nearly year track record he notes that more than studies show the anemia drugs are safe when used according to the label by the end of or so amgen hopes to start selling an osteoporosis drug denosumab which mr sharer hopes will be a "smash launch " the two anemia drugs epogen and aranesp account for almost half of amgens sales sales of aranesp the newer of the two grew at a pace in the fourth quarter driving the companys overall sales growth of the drugs are approved to boost hemoglobin levels and prevent kidney and cancer patients from needing a blood transfusion to keep those numbers going up amgen hoped to expand use of the drugs by studying them in new situations or different kinds of patients it borrowed a page from big drug companies which have increasingly looked to such "line extensions" over the past decade to prop up revenues between new products but the move backfired when one of the amgen studies and other studies with different sponsors uncovered safety issues these prompted the food and drug administration to call for the black box warning amgen started selling epogen in like other biotechnology drugs it is a protein created via the genetic engineering of living cells that makes it different from the traditional chemical drugs such as tylenol or prozac sold by big pharmaceutical companies biotechnology drugs usually command higher prices per dose and most dont face generic competition although congress is considering laws to change that the protein in epogen nourishes growth of oxygen carrying red blood cells the problem is getting the dose right with too little anemic patients may end up needing a transfusion anyway with too much the blood turns viscous forming clots that cause strokes or heart attacks the fda approved label on both epogen and aranesp a similar drug introduced in calls for doses to boost the level of hemoglobin to to grams per deciliter of blood hemoglobin is the protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body researchers have tested higher hemoglobin targets amgen and johnson &amp johnson which makes similar anemia drugs have sponsored some of the studies last november a study of chronic kidney patients published in the new england journal of medicine found higher risks of heart attack stroke and death in patients dosed with j&amp js anemia drug to reach a hemoglobin target of or higher then on jan amgen reported a setback in cancer even as it announced surging profits the companys drug aranesp is approved to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients amgen sponsored a study hoping to broaden the label to include anemia caused by cancer itself but these very sick patients no longer getting chemotherapy or radiation had just as many transfusions and died more often when treated with aranesp compared with those who received a placebo the trials failure did more than knock out a potential market doctors were already prescribing aranesp "off label" for the unapproved cancer use bringing amgen &# million a year in sales according to the company much of that off label prescribing is likely to cease caught off guardin february amgen got caught off guard again when the cancer letter an oncology publication spotlighted another negative study this time the findings came from independent researchers in the danish head and neck cancer group the group quietly reported in december on its web site that it had stopped a study of aranesp with radiation in head and neck cancer after more localized cancer recurrences and slightly more deaths occurred in the group treated with the amgen drug amgen says it quickly alerted the fda and european regulators to the danish study halt when it happened but the company delayed making any public statement until feb when the cancer letter article prompted a late afternoon conference call the stock slid and management apologized canceling his plans to lead an amgen bicycling event mr sharer remained at the companys thousand oaks headquarters to lead the companys response amgen huddled with its sales force and emphasized to doctors and analysts that the bad news from the studies only affected off label uses amgen now faces a securities and exchange commission inquiry into its handling of news of the danish trial halt amgen has characterized the informal inquiry as routine when there is a significant stock movement the company has explained that it didnt run the trial or have the full data amgen also said it asked for the data at least three times but the danish researchers refused to share it a representative of the danish group declined to comment prodded by analysts about tardy disclosure mr sharer agreed the company should have informed the public earlier "perfection says we should have done that we didnt we will going forward " he said in the feb call wall street analysts say sales of epogen and aranesp fell faster in the first two months of this year than they expected joel sendek of lazard capital markets says ims health data for the first two months of show a decline in aranesp sales relative to the comparable period in the previous quarter he calls it "the first sequential decline in sales in a couple years " ims health declined to comment analysts at friedman billings ramsey &amp co expect that u s sales of the two drugs will actually decline slightly this year while other analysts predict decelerating growth another shoe is set to drop when amgen reports soon on a study called some scientists have theorized that drugs such as aranesp would help tumors grow faster by interacting with a hypothesized receptor on cancer cells amgen rebutted this with its own studies the company originally thought the opposite might be true that aranesps oxygen boosting power could help chemotherapy and radiation kill cancer now it is no longer talking about a result that will help sales mr sharer says if the study simply shows a neutral effect on tumors "that would be good " in the study some small cell lung cancer patients on chemotherapy will receive aranesp up to a hemoglobin target of biggest customerby far the biggest customer for epogen is the federal government its also a big buyer of aranesp thats because most kidney failure patients on dialysis are treated under the federal medicare program the emerging safety problems have perked up ears in congress legislators were already worried that financial incentives may lead doctors to overprescribe the oxygen boosting drugs sometimes referred to as epo for those on dialysis a year of epogen for a patient on dialysis costs about &# at wholesale according to amgen dialysis centers which remove patients blood purge it of toxins and reinfuse it with medicines count on epo for a big chunk of their profits they buy the drugs at one price and receive a higher reimbursement from medicare pocketing the difference on the dialysis treatment itself medicares reimbursement may barely cover staff and equipment costs executives have said at a december hearing of the house ways and means committee the committees then chairman noted federal data showing that an estimated of dialysis patients treated with epo have hemoglobin levels above the target of the committee asked the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms to design a pilot reimbursement plan eliminating separate payment for epo drugs instead it wants epo bundled with other dialysis services something the dialysis industry resists in a statement last friday rep pete stark a california democrat who is chairman of the ways and means health subcommittee cited the black box warning placed on epogen and related drugs in march in light of that he said "cms must immediately rethink its payment policy and remove any incentives to use epo at dangerous levels " he added "if cms fails to act congress will have no other choice than to step in and protect dialysis patients from providers and drug companies who are more worried about profits than patient safety " in interviews over the past two months mr sharer and research chief roger perlmutter have repeatedly stated that amgen puts patients safety first helen torley amgens vice president for the kidney business says that while amgens supply contracts with dialysis providers are confidential "were confident these contracts dont encourage overutilization " one of the largest dialysis providers is davita inc with patients at dialysis centers davita chief executive kent thiry acknowledges epo is a big money maker accounting for to of revenues but he says that doesnt affect patient care "physicians make the prescribing decisions not davita " he says amgens advertising is another source of controversy advertising is supposed to follow a drugs label and the main benefit of aranesp and epogen described on the label is the ability to prevent the need for transfusions on the day the black box warning was announced mr sharer the amgen ceo said "we have not promoted quality of life whats on the label is avoidance of transfusion were sensitive about promoting what is on the label " but amgen later had to backtrack on mr sharers statement in fact some of its advertising to doctors touts purported benefits for patients such as enhanced energy an epogen ad that ran in in a kidney journal advised doctors to "elevate their lives " citing improved energy and quality of life for patients when their hemoglobin hits to "we do retain claims around energy and quality of life " explains dr torley the vice president of amgens kidney business amgen says it has done its own studies in these areas "were engaging with fda on those claims weve never done direct to consumer ads but with epogen we do talk to doctors about improving quality of life and function including sex lives " dr torley says patients fearssome patients say they fear the warnings could go too far "i dont want to go backwards " says year old lori hartwell of glendale calif she founded the renal support network supported by amgen and roche holding ag a transplant patient whose kidneys were destroyed by severe infection at age she says she received units of blood in the pre epo era "its horrible to feel anemic " mrs hartwell says "it changes when your hemoglobin goes up you feel better you have more energy you breathe better i can walk and have a conversation at the same time " still critics in congress and scientific circles note dialysis patient hemoglobin levels have steadily risen over the years they blame medicares policy of allowing hemoglobin to rise as high as before a federally mandated dose reduction and payment cuts kick in federal officials say the rules are set to allow for variable patient responses and lowering the ceiling could lead to undertreatment barry straube the chief medical officer at the centers for medicare and medicaid services is a practicing kidney doctor he believes ideal hemoglobin lies between and and adds "were hoping our payment policy will reduce the number of people above " dr straube says his office is "struggling" to keep its judgments free of conflicts of interest even as amgen supports many specialists in the field amgen is a major supporter of the national kidney foundation which has supported more aggressive hemoglobin targets the foundation received &# million from amgen and &# million from j&amp j in the most recent year for which data was available amgen has also supported some doctors who sit on the foundation committee that sets treatment goals the foundation may release new hemoglobin guidelines this week kerry willis the foundations senior vice president for scientific activities says it ensures sound medical judgments by disclosing financial relationships insulating scientists from funders and seeking reviews from independent experts next month amgen faces more scrutiny as the fdas oncology drug advisory committee meets to weigh risks and benefits of the anemia drug class during a recent interview in his sunny art filled executive suite mr sharer said the company is responding to the challenges with what he called a "science based" message about the drugs safety when used as their labels direct he recently affirmed he is standing by amgens robust growth targets for this year the company expects revenue to rise to between &# billion and &# billion from &# billion in while earnings per share are projected to rise to between &# and &# from &# "we think in we can maneuver through this " mr sharer said but challenges loom including the possibility that congress will make it easier for generics companies to create "biosimilars" or knockoffs of epogen and other long selling biotech drugs roche plans to introduce in the u s a new anemia drug cera which is the focus of a patent suit by amgen despite the hopes for the osteoporosis drug the delivery of new drugs and profits from amgens pipeline is uncertain even after it spent nearly &# billion last year on research and development amgens founding ceo george rathmann is now a dialysis patient who takes epo he notes his successor faces challenges he never did "its hard after youve made it " he says "because you could lose it "
