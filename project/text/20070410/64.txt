missed messages on benefits of menopause hormones do menopause hormones protect a womans heart its a question most doctors stopped asking nearly five years ago when the first results of the womens health initiative study showed a higher risk of heart problems among older hormone users now it may be time to start asking it again a re analysis of the whi data published last week has raised that question and new ones about the potentially protective effects of hormones on younger women who use them at the beginning of menopause researchers last week emphasized that the new analysis showed only that menopause hormones were safe for younger women to use to treat menopause symptoms and that hormones shouldnt be used for any protective benefits whats so surprising about the new analysis is that it signals that hormones could in fact be a powerful weapon in womens health the most notable finding in the study younger women who used hormones had a statistically significant lower risk of dying during the study than nonhormone users other data suggest younger hormone users had a lower heart attack risk although the data failed to reach statistical significance older women who started hormones years past menopause had a higher risk of heart attack of particular frustration to some hormone experts is the confusion about the benefits and risks for women who have undergone hysterectomy and use only estrogen consider this in the latest whi analysis to year old women who used estrogen showed benefit in every single risk category they had fewer heart attacks per women two fewer strokes and fewer deaths the original whi report showed that among women who consistently took their study pills estrogen only users had a lower risk of breast cancer than women in the placebo group during the seven year study there are also concerns that the evidence on the safety of hormones to treat menopause symptoms wont get translated into clinical practice the data offer the most powerful reassurance yet that for newly menopausal women experiencing hot flashes vaginal dryness sleep problems and other symptoms hormones are a safe option but right now many women are advised not to use hormones doctors are even prescribing less studied drug treatments such as antidepressants to relieve hot flashes "these data are the most compelling evidence to date that timing matters " says joann manson a harvard professor and whi researcher "but many women are suffering with these symptoms and not seeking treatment for hormone therapy and many doctors refuse to prescribe it " elizabeth lee vliet a womens health physician with practices in tucson and dallas said she is frustrated that women remain so confused about hormones she cited recent data from a major french study showing women who use skin patches or gels are at far lower risk for blood clots the most common health problem associated with hormone use "i just get extraordinarily frustrated because i watch womens lives being destroyed by not having good information " says dr vliet to be sure most doctors say more research is needed to fully understand the data particularly the lower mortality risk and higher stroke risk and the data are a little more confusing for women who still have a uterus and take a combination of estrogen and progestin per recently menopausal women this group had four fewer heart attacks and seven fewer deaths but nine more strokes the whi also has shown that among women who had never used hormones before the risk of breast cancer increased among estrogen and progestin users that means a year old woman with an average risk of breast cancer over the next years would see her risk increase to with hormones meanwhile the privately funded kronos early estrogen prevention study is studying hormone use by recently menopausal women for information go to www keepstudy org email healthjournal wsj com by the numbers some key hormone facts in the womens health initiative  drop in mortality among hormone users to  decline in breast cancer for those using estrogen only  increased breast cancer risk for new estrogen progestin users source jama
