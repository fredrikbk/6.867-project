the middle seat wooing international flights airports compete for the best routes lax vs sfo long lines sometimes snake around the lobby of the international terminal at los angeles international airport huge baggage screening machines from the federal transportation security administration clutter of the floor space some of the ticket counters signs dont work because the manufacturer went out of business in contrast the check in area of san franciscos international terminal has twice as much space for half as many travelers and no tsa machines police officers patrol on bicycle the lobby is clean spacious and sunlit and the biggest difference san francisco is gaining airline flights and los angeles is not since international seats are up in san francisco but down in los angeles according to consulting firm sh&amp e inc san francisco and several other cities including new york dallas and vancouver built or expanded international terminals some were worrisomely empty when they opened just as terrorist attacks and the sars epidemic crimped international travel but now with international traffic growing and new planes like the airbus a and boeing on the horizon those investments are paying off for cities and for travelers the new terminals offer more restaurants easier check in and better security they have shopping areas and a few even have museum display areas some let you make flight connections without going through security screening again that all appeals to airlines too ual corp s united airlines shifted some of its asian flights out of los angeles and built up san francisco last week qantas airways dropped eight of its weekly flights into lax and moved them to san francisco korean airlines added a flight from seoul directly to las vegas flying over los angeles this summer air new zealand will resume flying from auckland to vancouver which last month opened a four gate expansion of its international terminal previously the airline flew that route with a stop in los angeles "carriers are very very frustrated" with los angeles said frank clark executive director of laxtec corp an association of airlines that provides ground support at lax the stakes are high for cities international passengers spend about twice as much as domestic travelers and international airline service is one important competitive benchmark for cities competing for corporate relocations but landing them has gotten more competitive because airlines have more options now long range jets have made it easier to expand service by flying over big hubs and offering direct service to more cities boeings scheduled to go into service next year and the airbus a with its first delivery planned late this year will both expand international air service airports are competing to get the new planes first san francisco already has six gates capable of handling the a for example los angeles hopes to have two by the end of this year lax the nations second largest gateway for international passengers behind new yorks kennedy airport has spent years debating what to do with its aging international terminal the city recently broke ground on a &# million renovation of the tom bradley international terminal built before the olympics the renovation includes a new baggage screening facility to move that process out of the lobby plus new signs two executive lounges elevators escalators and moving walkways but it wont add any new capacity for the airlines currently crammed into the gate bradley terminal now the city is pondering whether to build additional gates on the backside of the terminal where passengers load onto buses that drive out to airplanes parked in a remote area or construct a new international terminal on the west side of the airport closer to the pacific ocean a new terminal would require years of environmental study and negotiation with neighborhoods it would require pushing a freeway closer to a neighborhood and building a mile underground people mover to connect travelers to domestic flights but it would let lax start over with a new terminal international airlines "overwhelmingly" prefer to build gates on the back side of the existing terminal since that idea has already been approved in the citys airport master plan and could be done faster and cheaper says mr clark their representative the city says it is studying several options and hasnt made a decision yet asked at the renovations ground breaking ceremony about competition from san francisco and other airports mayor antonio villaraigosa responded "let the games begin i say make no mistake when were finished with this modernization project this is going to be a world class facility " but the games actually began long ago san francisco opened its new &# billion terminal in december the building twice the size of laxs facility has plenty of unused capacity so san francisco is offering a one year discount on landing fees to airlines that launch flights to new international cities sfo will never overtake lax as the largest gateway on the west coast because the city of los angeles is much larger than the city of san francisco says john l martin san franciscos airport director "but were going to try to get all we can " he said the new terminal was a financial drag on the airport when it opened nine months before the sept terrorist attacks when airline service declined the airport had to push charges to airlines up to pay its bills and sfo had some of the highest airport rates in the world in cost cutting and other changes led the airport to cut charges to airlines by and it now costs airlines on average &# a passenger to use the airport at lax it costs about &# per passenger but that will increase sharply with the renovation san franciscos lower fees have attracted low cost airlines and the international terminal has opened up gates southwest airlines is returning to the airport this fall after suspending service in jetblue airways will begin service to sfo on may using gates at the new international terminal even still the shiny new terminal cant solve many of the problems of air travel esa santamaki recently arrived in san francisco upset and unimpressed by the buildings handsome gray floors and white steel supports "my luggage was left behind at heathrow " he shrugged
