saudi arabia confronts change pressure points host of conflicting forces has saudis on a tightrope regime spurs dialogue as way to contain risk of religious extremism last in a series riyadh saudi arabia in a modest liberalization move here last year the government decreed women henceforth would be allowed to work in stores that sell lingerie the religious establishment loudly objected saying this could result in women working in proximity to men to keep the peace the government postponed its order indefinitely but it also issued a royal decree saying that women should be encouraged to work in all fields and government ministries should create separate female areas to serve women in the meantime saudi women continue to buy intimate apparel across a counter from a male stranger its a vivid example of the paradoxes that arise in saudi arabia today as the ruling al saud family struggles to balance sharply conflicting pressures in order to retain its hold on power a month spent traveling about the kingdom and talking with hundreds of saudis reveals the tightrope the royal regime must walk it also finds significant if uneven economic progress a political system still under the tight control of the ruling al saud family and a society that is inexorably changing in part at the behest of the royal family and in larger part for reasons beyond its control if much of the educated saudi elite for the past quarter century can be said to have lived ostrich like with heads in the sand in recent years theyve been nervously raising their heads and worrying whether the regime can control the forces around them from radical islam to unemployed youth to growing pressures for liberalization the government cant afford to appear either so reactionary that it alienates a frustrated middle class or so liberal that it offends powerful religious purists the result is endless compromises to balance competing pressures the pressures on the regime today are all around from urban sentiment for modernization to high youth unemployment to the internet to militant islam no less threatening are external forces sectarian violence in iraq an ambitious and muscular iran and a dimming faith in the kingdoms historic protector the u s one effect of this anxiety is a very visible military and police presence not just along the saudi iraq border but in the traffic choked streets of this capital city saudi stability is a matter of great importance to the wider world as well as to the region the kingdom home to about a quarter of the worlds oil reserves stands as a western ally in the midst of a volatile area roiled by ideology and wars it is also the land from which of the sept hijackers sprang the issue of religion is by far the most potentially disruptive "the main threat to saudi arabia isnt military but religious " says a prominent graduate of riyadhs imam muhammad university "if we do not deal with extremism we will pay a terrible price in years the government will face its own weapons turned against it because extremists are infiltrating not just education but the military " a young imam from a large riyadh mosque illustrates this mindset "we are waiting for the time to attack " the imam says in the course of a long interview "youth feel happy when the taliban takes a town or when a helicopter comes down killing americans in iraq it is a very dangerous situation for the u s in the whole muslim world " he hints that its dangerous for the saudi government too "our government is afraid of the united states for political and material reasons so it wont declare jihad " the imam says "muslims have a right to self defense so we dont need to wait for the government to declare jihad " saudi arabia faces these pervasive national anxieties even though it is once again rolling in oil wealth in the years since an economic crunch in the s when low oil prices and high military spending drove national debt sky high saudi arabia has seen its oil revenue surge to more than &# billion last year from &# billion in the wealth is far from evenly spread and that yields another pressure point pockets of stark poverty are visible in southern riyadh and rural areas more than of the saudi population is under years of age and many young saudis lacking the skills or work ethic cant find jobs in the private sector as the population soars the government is no longer in a position to offer sinecures to baby boomers but saudi men conditioned by three decades of oil state largess frequently refuse to take menial jobs the result is high unemployment for men and for women with a total unemployment rate of according to abdulwahed al humaid deputy minister of planning and development in the ministry of labor all these problems are the royal familys to address political power remains in the hands of a small circle of senior royals supported by a handful of technocrats all led but not fully controlled by king abdullah who assumed leadership when his brother king fahd died in august after a decadelong illness an appointed body of men and now six female advisers called the majlis al shura meets weekly to discuss issues but lacks power to decide them the regime rules more with velvet glove than iron hand in an example of artful saudi balance when a terrorist is executed the government to avoid alienating the mans family makes a show of regarding his relatives too as victims of the terrorist a senior prince calls on the family to offer condolences and sometimes compensation while brooking no threat to its dominance the government has opened a public dialogue in a strategy to blunt extremist currents the dialogue involves nationally televised discussions of sensitive issues ranging from religious extremism to the role of women to how to deal respectfully with others in this sunni muslim dominated land "others" means shiites in addition to jews and christians saudis say the octogenarian king abdullah genuinely seeks to move the realm toward more religious tolerance and integration with the rest of the world believing this is the way to preserve al saud leadership the regime is aware that many saudis resent the religious establishments sway over their daily lives the royal family also knows that among islamic fundamentalists not all continue to support the tradition of obeying the secular rulers the familys program is to bolster its traditional religious base while encouraging tolerant voices in the hope that the disparate forces together can contain extremism as often is the case with such balancing no one is entirely happy with the result islam and the saud family have worked hand in hand since when muhammad ibn saud and a deeply conservative cleric muhammad ibn abd al wahhab made a pact it left politics and the military to the sauds and religion to imam ibn abd al wahhab and together they conquered arabia for allah their direct descendents continue that pact today religion remains a pervasive fact of life from the five daily calls to prayer to public segregation of the sexes to a ban on using toothpaste during the ramadan fast in the way u s newspapers spotlight sports scores saudi arabias display prayer schedules which vary slightly from city to city and day to day because theyre set by the position of the moon religious police patrol public places chastising transgressors such as unmarried men and women speaking together though religion long was centralized under a grand mufti appointed by the king education and the internet have fractured the religious discourse in a generation the kingdom has gone from a largely illiterate land to one with hundreds of thousands of university graduates many of whom chafe under the conservative cultural traditions perpetuated in the name of religion saudi rulers faced islamic extremism in when radicals seized the holy mosque in mecca accusing the royal family of being corrupt and beholden to the west nearly simultaneous was ayatollah khomeinis shiite revolution in nearby iran later in the s a saudi religious movement called sahwa "awakening" challenged the wahhabi religious orthodoxy that muslims must obey the king along with god and the prophet muhammad most of the sahwis were imprisoned or co opted but in facing all these militant threats the regime also reacted by kowtowing to the religious establishment giving it more money and control over peoples lives that policy of appeasement finally failed visibly with new terror attacks inside the kingdom of them from through jarred by these attacks the government ever since has encouraged a more tolerant reading of the quran and of cultural traditions textbooks are under review schoolteachers are being re educated to encourage them to teach tolerance some imams have been retrained and some have been fired most in saudi arabia who will agree to discuss religion at all insist on anonymity a monthlong effort to interview the minister of religious affairs resulted in promises but no meeting the shock of terrorism at home has led the government to foster debate about the previously taboo subject of religious extremism one result is the televised dialogues which feature diverse participants men and women selected by the government saudis tend to be very private people but these dialogues can produce all the drama of an oprah winfrey confessional with startling candor among the participants many saudis believe the government promotes this frank dialogue to illustrate both to the religious establishment and to the citizenry how deeply divided the country is on many issues that way each will understand why the government cant provide more of what it wants neither more religious rigor nor more modernization indeed little concrete action has resulted from the dialogues prompting a growing cynicism about them others claim the government just focuses debate on social and cultural reforms to avoid discussion of political change they recall a liberal reform movement in called the "riyadh spring " which abruptly ended when the government jailed activists including those calling for a constitutional monarchy like that in jordan or kuwait balancing pressures from religious conservatives is something at which the royal family has long been expert the story is told about king abdul aziz who founded the current saudi state beginning with his conquest of riyadh in that a religious man told the king his garment called a thobe was too long a floor length thobe forces the wearer to stand erect to avoid tripping that to the devout means the man looks haughty instead of humble the king cleverly handed the cleric a pair of scissors and told him to cut the garment to whatever length he preferred after he left the kings tent abdul aziz told aides never to let that cleric into his presence again saudi newspapers many of which are owned by members of the royal family today feature articles on topics that saudis wouldnt even discuss privately a quarter century ago one recently showed photos of the scarred backs of high school teachers in yanbu whod been beaten by students unhappy with their grades another told of a joy rider sentenced to death for killing three boys during a car stunt popular with idle youths gaining high speed and jerking on the hand brake to put the car into a skid in part to help re educate youth who were reared on fundamentalist teachings over the past quarter century the government turns a blind eye to satellite television though it remains illegal the walls of high rise apartment buildings are pocked with small round satellite dishes that bring channels with everything from prayer to politics to further promote tolerance the government launched a new tv channel in that features female anchors who not only interview men but do so with their faces uncovered in a curious blend of islam and the west little boys and girls are shown singing "we will all go to mecca on the hajj" to the tune of "shell be coming round the mountain " the result of the increased openness and public dialogue says mishary al nuaim vice dean of the faculty of law at king saud university in riyadh "tension remains but you now have a plurality of views expressed the change has allowed diversity to be visible and legitimate " tawfiq al saif an author and member of the shiite minority says that when he was in school sunni religion teachers taught as required that shiites were infidels but didnt take it seriously then in the s his son was taught that shiites not only were infidels but must be converted "now students are taught to coexist with jews and christians " mr al saif says commenting on how much the official line has changed indeed ordinary saudis almost uniformly voice the current government line that true muslims revere all of gods prophets including moses abraham and jesus not that their attitudes are within anyones control in the age of the internet and satellite tv "i am caught in the middle " says a father of three in jidda "i cant be like my father nor like my sons my dad made me pray five times a day my son refuses even to go to mosque " this father maintains that liberalization will continue in saudi arabia and that extremism is on the decline "forty percent of the young people just want to have fun listen to music race cars and chase girls " he says prince sultan bin fahd a son of the late king fahd and president of the youth welfare organization volunteers in an interview that drugs are a growing problem among youth the governor of the province of hail prince saud bin abdul mohsin shares the concern "we have to create a fun culture " prince saud says "our young people wont listen to sermons all day but we have to create a culture other than mcdonalds for them " he has launched an annual car rally in hail that attracted viewers this year the government has also formed a commission for tourism headed by prince sultan bin salman a prominent young royal who joined american astronauts on a space flight in religious strictures however dont make saudi tourism an easy sell the holy cities of mecca and medina are off limits to non muslims some new hotels have health clubs and swimming pools but dont let women use them the attitudes of two saudis the young riyadh imam and mr al saif well illustrate the divergent pressures the regime must balance the imam a man in his s with six children wears the uncut beard and shortened thobe of the religious community "the pressure is growing" for saudis to assert themselves on behalf of other muslims he says "suppose at home in the u s thieves were coming you call the police but they are corrupt you have a relative down the road so you call him " in a like manner he says "arabic regimes are corrupted and cant fight the u s so arab people have to help their brothers i tell you the u s could not stand one day in iraq if the saudi rulers called for jihad there " as for american ideals the imam is dismissive "your leaders want to bring your freedom to islamic society " he says "we dont want freedom the difference between muslims and the west is we are controlled by gods laws which dont change for years your laws change with your leaders " what the al saif family whose son recently studied in the united kingdom expects from the government is very different and changing through the generations "my father wanted only freedom to practice his religion " mr al saif says "i want religious freedom and political rights and my son wants the kind of life he has lived as a student in britain "
