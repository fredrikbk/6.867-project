finding a cure paying to keep your drug trial alive with supply low researcher turns to patients for money a very vulnerable time first in a series last may lee hollett received an unsettling letter he had been taking an experimental drug as part of a clinical trial for patients with a fatal degenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als but the trials supply of the drug was running low the letter warned and there was no money to buy more could mr hollett send a check "ive kind of accepted that i have a terminal disease " says mr hollett a human resources executive "but my wife has high hopes that ill live long enough to see a cure " and though the drug hadnt stopped the relentless progression of the disease he is now in a wheelchair mr hollett believes it has helped him maintain critical lung capacity so mr hollett donated &# his former employer kicked in an additional &# as he wrote out his check he says it was "in the back of my mind that the drug could run out" if he didnt contribute thats not the way clinical trials usually work typically patients main concern is simply getting accepted into a trial once they are enrolled the drug is usually supplied by the manufacturer other funding would come from nonprofits drug companies research centers or government agencies patients themselves may contribute to organizations that support cutting edge research but they dont usually expect to help pay for the very trial they are participating in the fact that mr holletts trial turned to such unusual fund raising tactics underscores a great challenge in the world of rare diseases where few treatment options may exist big pharmaceutical makers see little financial benefit in drugs for diseases such as als with only around new cases each year so doctors and patients must often find creative solutions to get research off the ground and keep it going the letter sent to als patients punctuated a long series of financial struggles for the als studies run by james p bennett jr director of the center for the study of neurodegenerative diseases at the university of virginia and the physician sponsor of the drug research program it has been extremely difficult to turn to his patients for money says dr bennett who divested himself of any financial interest in the drug but facing severe financial shortfalls and a dwindling supply of medication he felt he had nowhere left to turn "which is the more cruel scenario " dr bennett says he asked himself from the beginning to never start the trial or to "be open with the patients and the als community that i had limited funding " however seeking funds directly from patients also raises a number of ethical and economic questions questions that any research effort considering such a solution would have to face it means soliciting patients at a very vulnerable time when they may be desperate for hope with als for instance there is no cure the disease attacks the nerves that control movement and usually leads to death within five years already struggling to pay for aspects of their own care patients could quickly find themselves tapped out there is also less accountability for how money is spent when it is donated directly to a study rather than through a grant giving nonprofit and while dr bennett has no financial interest in his als drug investigators in other trials may financially benefit from their research role causing potential conflicts of interest response to dr bennetts solicitation of patients has been mixed with some embracing the opportunity to propel the research and others questioning whether its appropriate for researchers and patients to have such direct financial ties in the end only a handful of patients directly contributed and no patients have been denied the drug if they were unable to contribute but some have expressed fear and frustration over the looming threat that the drug could disappear dan brock director of the division of medical ethics at harvard medical school says he wouldnt want to see this adopted as a fund raising model for trials "these people are being asked to contribute to something" that they are not in a position to objectively judge says dr brock the other piece he adds is the relationship the patients have with dr bennett patients may feel "beholden" to him because they are benefiting from his research however dr brock also notes that no one is being coerced to contribute to the trial no one is being excluded if they cannot contribute and dr bennett has taken steps to avoid any personal financial benefit "the patients have faith in this guy " he says dr bennett age began studying the drug called r + pramipexole in the late s and became convinced that it might help prevent nerve cells from dying he wanted to test it particularly in als also known as lou gehrigs disease and his initial expectation was that a pharmaceutical maker would take the drug into trials when he failed to interest any companies he decided to move forward on his own with the first of what would be a series of small trials using money left over from another study he hired a company to manufacture the drug and in enrolled people als patients plus three of their spouses in a small safety study he also divested himself that year of any financial stake in the drug patent which is held by the university knowing that funds were limited and that he might have to seek donors "i was concerned about the issue of whether it might appear that i was going to get any personal profit out of it " he says dr bennett says in such a small group of patients it wasnt possible to prove conclusively that the drug affected the progression of the disease but around half of the people who took it said their muscle function improved and that they were able to do things that they hadnt been able to perform in months such as walking upstairs speaking and typing he says in early dr bennetts work came to a halt the university turned down his request to treat patients for another eight weeks and the company making the drug went out of business when he finally found a new manufacturer completed additional animal studies and got permission from the university to start a new trial in summer his money was gone dr bennett says he had applied to government and private sources for funding but was turned down dr bennett says he made it clear to patients from the outset that not only were they being asked to take "a brand new drug never given to people before" but that without a company backing his trial the resources might run out still it wasnt easy to turn to patients for money he didnt send out any written pleas at that time but in conversations he was open with patients about the need for new funds no one he assured them would be turned away if they couldnt help financially contribute to the trial and the drug continued to be given free to all participants bev nicola was one of the original als patients taking the drug "it had a noticeable effect on her " says her husband eli nicola "she was able to go up the steps one step at a time as opposed to pulling each leg up " mr nicola says he and his wife donated &# of their own money to help and helped drum up outside contributions as well in the course of a few months pleas from mrs nicola raised &# through fund raisers and donations in fall dr bennett was able to resume the drug for mrs nicola and the other patients mrs nicola died last august at age three years after diagnosis but her husband says he doesnt regret the money and effort they put in "the doctor said he had to raise money somehow and bev put everything in her soul into it " says mr nicola dr bennett also started a new study of r + pramipexole which included lee hollett of ashland va mr hollett had heard about mrs nicolas fund raising efforts and had already written a &# check to help buy the drug before joining the new trial mr hollett says many aspects of his disease have continued to progress even while on the drug his speech is slower and occasionally slurred and he is now in a wheelchair but he says he has benefited in other ways "most folks with als die when their lung capacity goes way down " says mr hollett age "and mine has held steady for over a year now " thats why mr hollett was so worried when he received the letter in may from dr bennett saying the research had once again run into financial trouble "i must continually solicit support in order to have a secure drug supply for the near future " dr bennett wrote in the letter to mr hollett and other previous donors including patients "necessity forces me to keep knocking on your door " mr hollett did contribute at that time but the financial woes were still not over just a few months later in september dr bennett sent out an email addressed to the patients in the drug trials as well as others who had contributed reporting on the results of the latest study ten patients in a new third trial were taking milligrams a day dr bennett reported that so far there had been no adverse side effects from a statistical perspective it was still not clear whether the drug was altering the disease course but "the data we do have is encouraging " he wrote then the bad news a gram batch of the drug cost &# and at the present consumption rates the drug supply would last around months dr bennett reported dr bennett said that the als association a nonprofit had given him a three year &# a year grant to help pay for some of the research but that still left the question of how to pay for the drug itself "i am open to suggestions " he wrote henry gardner an als patient who has been driving once a month to charlottesville from his home in bristol tenn in order to get the drug said the email disturbed him mr gardner had been working as a heavy equipment salesman when he was diagnosed with als in and had to retire because he could no longer operate the equipment that he was selling his wife still worked but money was tight "i cant financially contribute to the trial " says mr gardner who felt the burden of paying for the drug should fall on the university itself "its not the place of the patients" to help financially he says mr gardner continues to take the drug and says the muscle twitching that he had been experiencing has stopped but he worries that the drug might not always be available dr bennetts email stirred controversy in the wider als community as well "patients should be a last resort" for funding for trials says jerry dawson president of the als associations jim "catfish" hunter chapter in raleigh n c who got the email "als is an expensive disease and for them to give their resources to fund research which is not cheap can impact their ability to take care of their own needs " patients often require costly home care or medical equipment that may not be covered by insurance mr dawson says he has helped raise &# for the trial and says he has been impressed with the patient testimonials about the drug but he feels that "anyone that funds research ought to know what they are funding and have regular updates " so he emailed dr bennett asking for a detailed financial accounting dr bennett complied mr dawson says the report indicated that through october dr bennett had received &# to pay for the trial and the research and had spent &# through june dr bennett estimates that of the patients who have taken the drug so far roughly either gave money to buy the drug or reached out to friends and families to donate after the september email mr hollett says he approached cindy reynolds director of development for neurosciences at the university and offered to write a letter to the previous donors to the trial about the need for more funding ms reynolds said she turned mr hollett down "we didnt think it was appropriate to have a patient in the trial soliciting other people " she says she did however send an official letter from the university to former donors the letter has so far netted an additional &# from individuals right now the financial crisis dr bennett described in his september email has been forestalled a large individual donor provided enough money to ensure the drug supply will last until september says dr bennett also in april a small pittsburgh based biotech knopp neurosciences inc acquired the license for the drug from the university and is raising money for clinical trials for r + pramipexole as part of the licensing agreement the company agreed to give dr bennetts lab &# to further his research michael bozik president and ceo of knopp says the company has already provided &# of the &# "we feel a real ethical commitment to support the patients that jim has treated " says dr bozik knopp has raised &# million to develop the drug including clinical trials and has commitments for follow up funding totaling &# million people who have had previous exposure to the drug will be excluded from those trials which is standard practice so people in dr bennetts previous and current studies wont be eligible dr bennett says that until the drug actually has fda approval and knopp is able to make the drug widely available he feels obliged to keep going with his own studies he estimated that he needs to raise &# to &# a year so far every time dr bennett has run out of money patients or donors have paid the bill it had been moving to see "the degree to which people will dip into their pockets " dr bennett says "but one has to be a realist and understand that it cant go on forever like this "
