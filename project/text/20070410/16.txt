computer rooms feel the heat it managers find novel ways to cool powerful servers companies and institutions are exploiting the new power of video fancy web graphics and expanded data storage and they also are finding an old problem has come back the servers that do those tasks are getting too hot to handle for some computer rooms todays powerful computers may be more cost effective and typically dont take up any more space than the machines they replace but they produce far more heat since the average power per watt in data centers a measure of how much heat computers generate has in some cases quadrupled to more than from about industry officials said the result can be a power outage in these data rooms and a scramble by information technology managers to cope many it managers prefer to keep the temperature in their computer rooms in the s and they are battling the heat with both traditional and novel approaches ranging from bigger facilities with more air conditioning to on board liquid coolers and floor tiles equipped with fans the pomona valley hospital medical center in pomona calif had packed so many servers in a computer room that temperatures soared to almost degrees some of the computers started malfunctioning and in one case several servers failed altogether said kent hoyos chief information officer for the bed hospital the hospitals technicians worked frantically to get more cooling into the square foot room but they still couldnt get temperatures down much "we were just on the edge all the time " said mr hoyos the hospital has solved its problem by spending about &# to install a network of overhead air conditioners many other businesses and institutions face a similar predicament a review of data centers by the uptime institute a think tank in santa fe n m found that most of the centers couldnt cool their computer equipment moreover the review found of the server "racks" or panels of servers were receiving air hotter than they were specified to handle in order to remain reliable "this is hitting businesses like a ton of bricks " said william clifford chief executive officer of aperture an industry consulting firm in stamford conn if a heat problem persists or worsens a business ultimately may have to build a new facility stand alone data centers can cost upward of &# million managers of a computer center for the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo have been adding more air conditioning units to attack their heat problem typically the units are mounted against walls so the cool air can fan out across the room but after adding five big air conditioners to an existing seven the managers at the u s government facility said design issues of the building and other factors make it so they wont be able to keep the square foot room cool enough much longer without expanding to a new site computer managers are turning to a range of other ways to cool the hotter new machines one solution is to pipe cooling liquid directly on top of the microprocessor which generates much of the heat a liquid cooling product called spraycool made by isr inc of liberty lake wash costs about &# per rack of servers other businesses deploy cabinet size air conditioners that can be rolled right next to a row of computer racks providing better cooling than wall air conditioners officials of apc mge west kingston r i said demand has been running so brisk for its line of inrow rack coolers that sales in tripled from with sales on track to more than double again this year the unit of frances schneider electric sa doesnt disclose sales figures another vendor emerson network power of st louis reports sales of its liebert xd products smaller air conditioners that fit on top of server racks and are connected with pipes containing waterless refrigerant doubled in from the year before the unit of emerson electric co also declined to cite specific numbers one of the customers for the emerson product was the pomona hospital another was us internet corp a small internet service provider in minneapolis that by was experiencing daily breakdowns of its servers and storage drives due to temperatures soaring above degrees in one of the companys data centers in minnesota officials there said "our issue was we were frying our computers " said travis carter co founder and chief technology officer of the company "quite frankly we were dead in the water " us internet has since installed a network of the liebert xd air conditioners to help bring down room temperatures in the center to degrees breakdowns are now a rarity some tech vendors are looking to the floor for answers degree controls inc of milford n h sells floor mounted tiles for &# each that are outfitted with powerful fans that direct cool air onto the servers it can cost as much as &# to configure a computer room floor but people who have used the tiles say they have helped officials of navisite inc a provider of computer room facilities for corporations said they can handle heating loads up to watts a square foot in places where the tiles have been installed advanced software also is being deployed to attack the problem hewlett packard co in november announced an energy management system called dynamic smart cooling that is designed to help deliver cool air where it is most needed in the computer room then there are truly low tech approaches at the data center world show in las vegas last month attendees crowded around a booth that featured sections of foam to plug holes and openings that let cool air seep out in computer rooms sections of the material by aclok inc salt lake city sell for &# corrections &amp amplifications navisite inc is a provider of computer room facilities for corporations an article tuesday on heating problems in computer rooms incorrectly identified the company as navisite inc also since the average power in data centers has in some cases quadrupled to more than watts per square foot from about the article also incorrectly referred to that as an increase in the average power per watt wsj april
