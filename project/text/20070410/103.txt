the grand canyons skywalk draws an edgy response grand canyon west ariz its easy to see why this sonoran patch of land sitting on the lip of the grand canyon has never flourished unless youre a coyote or a scorpion its literally in the middle of nowhere but the once nomadic hualapai who settled here about and now number about half of whom are chronically unemployed are hoping that their newest attraction skywalk will change all that opened to much acclaim in late march the horseshoe shaped glass bottom platform extends feet from the rim and is suspended feet above the canyon floor before it opened the reservation averaged about visitors a day most taking helicopter tours and float trips through the grand canyon "we estimated that the skywalk would double the number of visitors " said operations manager robert bravo jr "but the number has quadrupled to about " as a result mr bravo will double his work force to about most of them hualapai skywalk which exceeded its &# million budget is just the first phase of a five part master plan currently the tribe is working on a &# million runway expansion mostly funded by the faa that will allow it to handle small commercial jets there also are plans for a new visitors center hotel restaurant and upscale casino "table games no slots " mr bravo said of course an undertaking of this magnitude has its critics including some hualapai "this should never have been done " said tribe member leatrice walema she and others say eagle point the site of skywalk is "sacred ground " environmentalists dont much like it either "the eiffel tower is an architectural wonder " kieran suckling of the center for bio diversity told cnn "but do i want the eiffel tower on the edge of the grand canyon no " "i think its a real travesty " robert arnberger superintendent of grand canyon national park from to told the washington post "it desecrates the very place the hualapai hold so dear " really if it averages visitors a day skywalk would draw tourists a year if thats desecration then what are the four million tourists doing who visit grand canyon national park every year the hualapi would argue that the whole canyon is sacred not just the land they have chris mcdaid a cultural anthropologist who has worked on reservations in the southwest finds the criticism from outside the tribe a bit ironic "three hundred years of indian government relations have been all about trying to make the indians more like the white man " he said "now that theyre doing that we dont like it " indeed mr bravo is quick to note that the hualapai are developing only about acres of their acre reservation and just a sliver of their miles of riverfront furthermore the trip here offers ample evidence of the economic challenges the hualapai face skywalk is a solid three hours southeast of las vegas mostly on rural two lane roads through long forgotten towns like dolan springs home of the wishing well saloon a vfw and little else along the way you pass more abandoned trailers and some that should be than you can count their dusty lots are adorned with rusted pickup trucks caved in sheds and enough broken fence line to keep an army of ranch hands busy for decades about of the last miles are over bone jarring dirt roads the trip here from points south through peach springs home to about hualapai includes about a mile stretch of suspension rattling washboard roads the arduous trek didnt seem to be keeping people away the first week skywalk was open the parking lot was jammed with tour buses from las vegas and tourists from as far away as england and japan some were overjoyed others were terrified some of the shock was over the admission price while widely advertised as &# the real cost is &# yes it costs &# to walk on skywalk but you first need to pay &# to get on the reservation a woman in line in front of me calmly ordered four tickets for her family when the cashier gave her the total she shrieked "excuse me " visitors park their cars at the tiny airport here and then take hualapai operated tour buses onto the reservation in addition to skywalk theres an interpretive center and other observation points the price of admission includes lunch and a trip to the nearby hualapai ranch an old west town complete with stables a jail and a wild west show for an additional fee guests can also rent horses or take a wagon ride but the main attraction is clearly skywalk the wait to get on it was a merciful minutes and during that time in line i met roger rawstron a year old ex pat brit now living in green valley ariz and his sister anne sturzaker who came all the way from manchester england to experience skywalk "ive been watching this for over a year on the internet " she said "my friends all think im mad because its made of glass " before we could venture forth we had to surrender most of our belongings thats because myriad cameras purses and other items had already been dropped over the side after donning slip on booties so as not to scratch skywalks surface there we were staring down at the canyon floor below while i was a bit unnerved by the surreal experience of standing on the platform suspended over the canyon i had no qualms about the structural integrity of skywalk it was built to support tons and withstand mph winds and a magnitude earthquake but others werent so sure a japanese woman clung nervously to the rail while a hispanic woman couldnt get off the platform quick enough one teenage girl never even got on skywalk she took one look over the canyon rim and went screaming back to terra firma so was it worth the long bumpy trip to the reservation and the &# in admission fees not to mention the continuing debate its creation has stirred over native american rights economic improvement the environment and all the rest well for me skywalk was a bit anticlimactic it wasnt suspended over the colorado river but a side canyon and it didnt extend out as far as id expected yes you had the feeling of being suspended in midair but once your brain realized you werent in danger it was sort of ho hum "i think its a bit of a rip off " mrs sturzaker said i have to imagine that many people felt that way the first day that disneyland opened not all the rides were running it still smelled of fresh paint ill be curious to come back here in a few years and see if skywalk turns out to be the economic engine that the hualapai are betting it will be mr yost is a writer in lake elmo minn
