taking the work out of networking some suggestions q my boss wants me to do more networking any advice a for some people networking is almost as important as breathing the more events they attend and the more people they meet the happier they are for others its as painful as pulling toenails but networking neednt be painful and its something that builds on itself "meeting people and building relationships is the key to being successful in any business " says m todd dean an angel investor in seattle thats because business functions through personal connections whether its filling a job opening or finding a vendor people tend to call people they know "you need to be viewed as someone who adds value and you do that by networking and letting people know what you do " says steve mcallister a director of sales development at software maker autodesk inc you should take part in company sports events or volunteer activities these are no pressure ways to meet other professionals later you can follow up with them and ask for introductions to the people they know chatting with vendors consultants and professionals in your industry allows you to tap into the external business grapevine offer assistance and learn about new business opportunities as a networker focus on being helpful to others start asking people to call you if they need something and be ready to assist try to make deposits in a "favor bank" that you may be able to withdraw from at some point though not necessarily from the people you helped use the internet as much as possible to make connections business networking groups such as linkedin com exist solely to connect people and my best tip make friends with people who are networking geniuses they will connect you with the people in their networks such referrals will immediately break the ice for you and save time and trouble
