lets have real debates not empty pre packaged political shows in regard to norman ornsteins "moderation in excess " editorial page april about the barry goldwater john f kennedy agreement to campaign together in a proposal that was dropped after jfks assassination the strength of this great nation is rooted in the two party system each led by a patriot who wants nothing but the best for america the many candidates vying to be president now have an opportunity to embrace the goldwater kennedy formula and commit to campaign together with their counterpart if nominated a good place to begin is for the candidates to campaign together in the primaries sheenu srinivasan glastonbury conn mr ornstein inaccurately writes that the commission on presidential debates "does a wonderful professional job organizing" the debates while accurately noting that the way in which debates are structured stifles rather than encourages the sort of informative debates that were part of the history of elections in the united states i dont believe we can describe the cpd as wonderful or professional it works with the campaigns of the two major parties to limit public access and input as well as to exclude any participation by third party candidates regardless of their access on the ballots in all states just looking over the "memorandum of understanding" from the presidential election confirms this for instance during the "townhall" debate in october the audience was pre selected based upon their leanings toward one of the two candidates their questions were submitted in advance and they had no possibility of follow up or clarification it is clear that if we really wish to restore the publics confidence in the debates and in the way we pick our presidents we need to begin at a minimum with creating a debating system whereby the candidates respond to the concerns of the public and not to questions either pre selected by a moderator or asked by reporters in the presidential primaries deliberative forums were held in which citizens engaged other citizens on the major concerns facing them after which the candidates were invited to address these concerns the difference the deliberative forums produced substantive concerns facing americans versus questions about process favored by the reporters clarifying for the cpd that if it wishes to describe itself as a "nonpartisan" rather than a "bipartisan" commission on presidential debates then it should open up the process to at least third party candidates who appear on the ballot of a majority of the states allowing other parties to join the debate will force the major party candidates to talk about more than just the "wedge" issues that are designed to attract only that narrow niche audience so common to our recent elections debates continue to be a vital part of presidential elections even those canned debates we are accustomed to in america it would do all of us a lot of good if we could help the commission on presidential debates to rediscover precisely what the definition of a debate is because it is clear that what we have been getting is far from it christopher s kelley ph d visiting assistant professor department of political science miami university oxford ohio mr ornstein is correct that the current presidential debates are little more than pre packaged answers to intensively studied questions however he misses a key point the cpd bills itself as a "nonprofit nonpartisan corporation to sponsor and produce debates for the united states presidential and vice presidential candidates " contrary to its mission this organization thwarted numerous attempts by both the libertarian and green parties to participate in the presidential debates each of these parties worked tirelessly to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars and collect millions of signatures nationwide in their efforts to obtain ballot access in all states both of these parties ran credible candidates that the general public should have been able to at least hear giving voters the opportunity to determine whether they agree with their approaches or not if we are going to have a discussion about presidential debates in this country lets start by allowing all parties who are on the ballot to participate equally in the debates dave webber jupiter fla see related letter "letters to the editor lets dump the debates" wsj april
