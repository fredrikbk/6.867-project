a cultural conversation with brian dennehey he has great stories to tell and a lot of great memories new york an avid theatergoer recently showed up at the lyceum theatre to preview the current revival of "inherit the wind " jerome lawrence and robert e lees sturdy take on the scopes "monkey trial" pitting evolutionists against bible literalists shed seen the version with george c scott as the wily henry drummond a character modeled on clarence darrow and brian dennehy as the bloviating bible thumping matthew harrison brady read william jennings bryan and she was eager to watch mr dennehy take on christopher plummer in this new production opening thursday shed never miss dennehy in anything she said firmly ticking off her presence in the audience for his tony winning performance as willy loman in "death of a salesman" and his tony scoring turn as james tyrone in "long days journey into night " but that wasnt brian dennehy with george c scott at all her companion interrupted it was charles durning "durning i get paul sorvino i get " said mr dennehy relaxing in his dressing room an hour before curtain time and laughing good naturedly at yet another story of mistaken idolatry "that doesnt bother me as i always say if they get the name on the check right thats the important thing " mr dennehy is one of the last of a generation of rough hewn actors among them scott and jason robards who made significant contributions and very attractive money in hollywood mr dennehys film credits include " " "presumed innocent " "cocoon" and "gorky park" but who made their greatest mark on the stage men of rabelaisian appetites theyd take their curtain call then until last call be in residence at the nearest bar "we got out of the theater and it was like getting out of school " recalled mr dennehy whos called a big bear of a man almost as frequently as katie couric is called perky "wed go to gallaghers or jimmy rays and george scott would be there punching somebody and jason would be throwing up against the wall " back then mr plummer may well have been on the next stool "chris and i are former bad boys with the booze and so forth " mr dennehy said "were now the most boring of dedicated people but we have a lot of great stories to tell and a lot of great memories " credit mr plummer with mr dennehys appearance in "inherit the wind " "i wanted to work with chris " he said simply "for an actor like myself whos been around for a while he represents the tradition the fraternity of richardson and olivier and gielgud i have to pinch myself every once in a while on stage its chris plummer saying that line to me and im giving one right back to him that aspect has been a real joy " now if only he had better ammo "im not crazy about the role of brady " confessed mr dennehy tugging at the brim of his baseball cap "its an interesting problem for an actor when you get to a certain place you say i want to do this i want to do that brady is not one of those parts because hes essentially a set up character but when i started working i realized there were some possibilities i had to explore there was a hell of a lot i had to figure out how to play "your job as an actor when youre doing a part like this " he continued "is to do the job the playwrights intended you to do but also to try to some extent to rescue the character " if a role isnt scary mr dennehy isnt interested that pretty well sums up his credo yet brady doesnt seem remotely like the challenge of loman or tyrone or hickey in "the iceman cometh " a part mr dennehy played to great acclaim at chicagos goodman theatre in "but this is fearsome in another way " he said of "inherit the wind " "because unlike willy or james or hickey which are these huge obvious mountains that you have to try to climb playing brady is like rock climbing you can sure as s fall off and have your ass kicked you can make the mistake of not doing the work not trying to find bradys humanity not trying to find what it is that motivates him " mr dennehy lets just say is a talker a question about the current relevance of "inherit the wind" he suggests a parallel with the raging debate about stem cell research sets off a protracted monologue about mccarthyism blacklisting china in the korean war the iron curtain and the aclu but he is also a thinker and a voracious reader he just digested several books about miles davis on his dressing room table is claire tomalins biography of samuel pepys and her new book about thomas hardy is next on the list his background study for "inherit the wind" included transcripts of the original trial as well as edward larsons "summer for the gods the scopes trial and americas continuing debate over science and religion " "theres a very short list of fantastic lions for the stage and brian is on it " said doug hughes the director of "inherit the wind " "he brings sorrow and pain and joy and complexity to a role that in lesser hands would have been simplistic and one dimensional his brady is not dismisssable " one of three boys mr dennehy grew up in mineola n y got a degree in history from columbia university and served with the marines in vietnam excellent preparation he claimed for his chosen career married at age to his first wife judith and very rapidly the father of three daughters mr dennehy drove a truck and a cab worked as a bartender and motel clerk to support his family while trying to make it in the theater "i remember my father saying to me what are you doing driving a cab and going to your stupid auditions and i said i want to be an actor and he said why the hell would you want to be an actor because i think it would make me happy " "what the hell has that got to do with anything " was the disgusted response from dad a reporter for the associated press mr dennehy had his first broad based success in the movie "semi tough " thereafter shuttling between theater feature film and television collecting a golden globe award and five emmy nominations along the way recent credits include an appearance on "law and order svu" and in showtimes "our fathers " which coincidentally also starred mr plummer for years mr dennehys standard line was that he was at the nether reaches of a casting list topped by jack nicholson gene hackman and robert duvall no quarrel from him he insisted about the pecking order "what nicholson does nobody else can do " he said "and hackman is if anything even more distinctive "i think i got a hell of a lot more out of the movie business than i ever deserved for most of us its a fashion business youre in fashion then youre out of fashion but when i needed the money movies and television were there so i could put the kids through college and help them with houses and apartments and failed marriages and successful marriages " added mr dennehy whos been married for almost years to his second wife jennifer they have two school age children through it all theater has remained his native habitat "chris said to me the other day youre a stage animal and thats a good way of putting it i react like an animal i latch on to certain things like an animal i think like an animal i prowl like an animal " hes on the prowl for a shot at falstaff and lear as well as a commercial production of "endgame " "the scottish king got away " he said referring to "macbeth " "i took a few whacks at him but im too old now i missed that one and others but ive got no regrets "ive had a hell of a ride and worked with great people and i still do " he said "i can remember my old man asking me that question or years ago why do you want to be an actor because it would make me happy and thats pretty much the way its worked out " ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
