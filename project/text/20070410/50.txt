improving the average of the average investor the little book of common sense investing by john c bogle wiley pages &# readers of the little book big profits series of concise investment guides must be thoroughly confused the first guide joel greenblatts "the little book that beats the market " tells readers that there is a simple "magic formula" that enables ordinary investors to beat both the market and professional investment managers by a wide margin if you buy stocks with low price earnings multiples and high returns on invested capital mr greenblatt argues profits will be automatic in the second book in the series "the little book of value investing " christopher h browne presents a more complicated set of rules in a chapter titled "send your stocks to the mayo clinic " mr browne presents a point checklist to examine a companys suitability for investment two of his rules "buy stocks like steaks " i e when they are on sale and have fallen in price and "examine what the insiders are doing " now comes john c bogle in the third little book who says that all of this is nonsense the surest way to gain above average returns is through a low cost low turnover index fund that simply buys and holds essentially all the stocks traded in the market well let me set the journals readers straight mr bogle is right if you want one simple little book to tell you how to invest "the little book of common sense investing" is the one to get for the financial junkies who have read earlier bogle books and op ed pieces or seen him on the lecture circuit and on tv there will be little new here but for everyone else a short book has the advantage of offering mr bogles excellent advice in a concise and accessible manner throughout mr bogle invokes other experts to corroborate the points he makes "if you dont believe me " he tells us time and again then "take it from" a series of investment icons ranging from the "father" of value investing benjamin graham to investment luminaries like david swenson and warren buffett chapter "the grand illusion " is especially valuable while the market as a whole has produced a generous return over the long pull mr bogle notes the average investor makes substantially less the average investor tends to buy into the market at bull market peaks when everybody else is optimistic and to sell at market bottoms when everyone thinks the sky is falling the average investor also buys the wrong types of equity mutual funds in early during the height of the dot com craze investors piled into high tech funds and sold their value funds the tech funds collapsed and the value funds turned out to be the star performers of the early s when you then add the high fees and turnover costs of actively managed mutual funds and substantial tax penalties if the funds are held in taxable accounts it is easy to see the "grand illusion" that mr bogle is referring to the average investor earns substantially less than the market return mr bogle shows you how to avoid the psychological biases that bedevil ordinary investors and how to obtain your fair share of stock market returns my only quibble is that mr bogle takes an overly negative position on exchange trade funds etfs index funds that trade as stocks continuously during the day he objects that they are designed for trading rather than investing and that their proliferation into a myriad of industry sectors and regions of the world is the antithesis of broad based buy and hold index investing he worries that investors will do themselves great harm by attempting to time the market and to concentrate their portfolios in the "hottest" market sectors to be sure etfs can be misused and some have high expense ratios mr bogle is right that picking the right sectors and exactly the right time to buy and sell is a losers game but etfs allow investors to diversify their investments by for example easily accessing real estate markets as well as underrepresented sectors of the economy such as emerging market stocks and commodity producers etfs are also inherently more tax efficient than indexed mutual funds and can be run at lower costs within a mutual fund investors who believe that they can time markets make transactions and create trading costs that hurt long term investors within an etf commissions are paid by the etfs particular buyers and sellers such transactions do not affect the fund itself to the extent that the etf sells any securities it can eliminate their low tax basis stock without incurring any tax liability for the holders of the etf stock sales by etfs are not considered taxable events at vanguard mr bogle created the first index fund the index fund in and for this he deserves enormous credit and the thanks of countless investors vanguard now offers an etf share class of that fund market timers can buy and sell the etf share class without creating costs for long term shareholders of the mutual fund moreover when sales of stocks are made for the etf shares vanguard can purge the fund of its low basis stocks mr bogle complains in "common sense investing" that etfs are inimical to the basic purpose of indexing he laments "what have they done to my song ma theyve turned it upside down " in certain respects though the etf class of indexed shares has made his song even better mr malkiel a longtime director of the vanguard group is the author of "a random walk down wall street" norton ninth edition
