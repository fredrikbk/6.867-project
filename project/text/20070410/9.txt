big deals yes theyre possible even without buyout clubs private equity firms tap insiders for funds kkrs &# billion solo are private equity firms quitting their club memberships not long ago kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co s &# billion deal last week for payments processor first data corp would have been far too big for just one private equity firm to swallow but kkr isnt turning to other private equity firms to help write the check instead it is turning to its existing fund investors private equity firms increasingly are expecting their so called limited partners to write ever bigger checks as co investors separate from their original fund investments freeing the private equity firms from relying on each other in "club deals" to get larger acquisitions done "there will be fewer clubs and when there are club deals there will be fewer members " says jonathan colby a managing director at carlyle group "we can all reach for larger deals as a result " the increasing reliance on fund investors comes several months after the justice department began an inquiry into whether the team bids of private equity firms are improper there are a lot of advantages of the turn toward these new nonclub arrangements the use of investors as partners adds to the clout of private equity firms because they can do bigger deals without having to share either governance or glory with rival funds "to sell down to investors instead of each other is the best of all possible worlds " says jonathan weiss managing director and head of the financial sponsors group at wachovia securities in new york the practice also reduces the private equity firms risk since they use less of their own capital many funds have limits on how large a check they can write typically not more than of the total value of an investment fund can go to any single investment another benefit of co investors as opposed to club deals it becomes easier to get additional equity financing from investment banks to fund ever larger deals banks are more willing to help private equity firms get such solo deals done by providing not only the debt but also some of the equity to the buyers on a short term basis with the expectation that the banks own money will quickly be replaced by money from the private equity firms own investors co investors eventually can account for one half to two thirds of the equity portion of a deal in addition at a time when the easy credit boom looks long in the tooth and the u s economy is losing steam such co investment enables private equity firms to put less debt on the companies they acquire this rainy day money is key for private equity firms as ever bigger deals are sought indeed the willingness to offer such co investment opportunities is an important part of the way the giant private equity firms raise money these days private equity firms share their information on potential deals with their investors and arrange management meetings so they can get to know a target company often the private equity firms themselves get valuable information in exchange at one point carlyle dropped a deal it was considering when one of its investors told carlyle staffers they already had passed on the deal earlier at a far lower price to be sure there is a potential downside to all this some of the more ambitious co investors have become so experienced in assessing deals that they are beginning to behave like the private equity firms themselves and the more they make contributions as co investors the less generous the amount they are likely to sign up for as limited partners in future fund raisings nevertheless letting investors become equal partners is a way for private equity firms to let those investors know how treasured they are just as those investors are feeling threatened by the private equity firms embrace of the public markets whether in taking the management company public as blackstone group plans to do or in selling an investment vehicle to public investors as kkr did in europe last year core investors in kkr funds such as the pension funds of state employees in washington or oregon welcome the opportunity to invest alongside kkr in a deal like first data because they dont have to pay expensive fees on the additional investment in some club deals in the recent past investors in funds have found themselves paying fees to multiple funds as part of an acquisition or paying fees on both sides of a deal when funds sell portfolio companies to each other getting such investors to make additional independent investments in specific deals isnt new but its use has increased in the deal heavy environment kkr had its investors taking direct stakes in its &# billion acquisition of philips electronics nvs semiconductor business last year similarly when blackstone put together its winning &# billion bid for freescale semiconductor in september it turned to its own investors as well as private equity friends at carlyle permira holdings ltd and texas pacific group now tpg to get the deal done private equity firm clayton dubilier &amp rice inc led the buyout of hertz for &# billion which included nearly &# billion of assumed debt as a relatively small firm it could never have hoped to have swallowed such a large corporate target without help not only from carlyle and merrill lynch &amp co but also from its own investors these limited partner investments can add up to big money some invest as much as &# million a deal potential co investors include some big public pension funds in the u s europe and canada as well as endowments and charities such as britains wellcome trust and governmental investment arms of dubai and singapore last year oregon state treasury teamed up with washington state investment board to create a &# million fund purely for co investment opportunities says jay fewel senior equities investment officer oregon state treasury which manages more than &# billion they have closed on six or seven deals so far and have signed agreements to participate in three others that havent yet been funded "of course the co investments are only as good as the underlying investments " mr fewel says "but without question its a very attractive way to augment returns " tennille tracy contributed to this article
