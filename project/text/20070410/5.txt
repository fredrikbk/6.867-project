named former warner music group corp executive gerolamo caccia dominioni as its new chief executive succeeding silvano cassano who spearheaded the supply chain overhaul introduced in through a benetton spokesman mr caccia dominioni declined requests for an interview still the logistical makeover points to a deep shift in the benetton clans thinking a brand that once set trends must now follow them "in the past it was easier to do the collections because there was tranquility " mr scognamiglio says "now the tranquility is gone there is just the rush you have to score that goal " many fashion players have eschewed this approach focusing on product design and marketing rather than speedy turnaround times to drive sales gap inc blames its two year sales slump partly on attempts to streamline the way it buys fabrics for its gap old navy and banana republic brands the move was aimed at centralizing fabric purchases across the different brands and reducing the number of suppliers

supply chain that was state of the art for its time the company ran circles around its rivals by building factories in countries with low wage costs it dyed its sweaters in the final step of the manufacturing process this allowed it to produce more pieces in colors that consumers were buying reducing inventory and avoiding markdowns in the mid s the company had gross profit margins of more than by the end of decade however benettons edge had eroded as fast fashion competitors came onto the scene rivals like zara and h&amp m emerged with even leaner operations capable of replenishing
