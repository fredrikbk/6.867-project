new medical device ads old concerns can a knee implant be sold this way and should it be pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars on television ads every year not knowing for sure how many new prescriptions the spots generate now a new frontier is opening in health care advertising that may be even trickier to evaluate ads for medical devices and procedures a raft of ads for everything from hip replacements to radioactive seeds to treat prostate cancer has hit the airwaves over the past couple of years as companies tap the aging population to boost sales and like most commercials the ads dont pull any punches a spot that launched in january for medtronics implantable defibrillator used to revive someone whos suffered cardiac arrest promises a longer life for patients "if youve had a heart attack or have heart failure inside this little device you just might find more kisses snow more football wins " or theres zimmer holdings ad for its knee replacement "gender solutions knee " designed specifically for women the ad tells viewers they will be "amazed at what a difference a knee replacement can make " more device ads are coming say ad executives "i think its going to definitely grow " says michael guarini president of wpp groups ogilvy healthworld who notes that the device market is becoming increasingly competitive to be sure ad spending on medical devices isnt likely to become quite as significant as the money poured into pharmaceutical drugs which more than doubled to &# billion last year from according to tns media intelligence the device market is worth about &# billion in sales right now estimates milton hsu a medical devices industry analyst for bear stearns compared with &# billion for pharmaceuticals tns doesnt break out spending by medical device makers most tv ads for medical devices air in the so called spot market in limited regions of the country rather than on national networks where airtime is more costly just as the explosion in drug ads over the past decade prompted questions about the effectiveness and appropriateness of heavy marketing similar doubts exist about medical device advertising as is the case with prescription drugs patients cant buy devices on their own they need a doctor and in the case of medical devices a surgeon retains control over the process which makes consumer advertising an even trickier proposition critics have blamed heavy drug advertising for creating demand for drugs that arent necessarily needed ads for mercks vioxx were blamed for fueling widespread use of the drug which was later withdrawn because of safety issues some predict similar issues with medical devices "there are obviously going to be critics about whether or not you are selling to the wrong customer " says bear stearns mr hsu some companies that have tried consumer advertising say they are more interested in raising awareness of medical conditions and asking consumers to seek out information than they are in hyping their brand "unlike some of the drug advertising that makes the patient call the doctor and demand the drug this is more about call the doctor talk about the terms and options and theres a product out there but were not the only product " says christine jacobs president and chief executive of theragenics which makes theraseed seed implants used in a procedure to help treat prostate cancer the bigger question may be simply whether consumer ads are worth their cost many medical device makers are yet to be convinced judging by a recent survey by cutting edge information a durham n c research consultant to drug and device companies it found that makers ranked direct to consumer campaigns as less effective than marketing to doctors through physician conferences calls by sales representatives and medical publications still medtronics campaign shows that device makers are getting past their doubts the minneapolis based company has launched its biggest consumer ad campaign ever behind its defibrillator it says its too early to gauge the results of the ads which it notes are just one part of a bigger campaign that also involves training and educational outreach to doctors many of the companies tie tv ads into broader efforts involving public relations and marketing to medical professionals zimmer for instance talked to surgeons well in advance of the ads release says sheryl conley zimmers chief marketing officer prior to running the ads zimmer issued news releases and made surgeons and testimonials from patients available to the media including daytime talk shows zimmer will spend about &# million on direct to consumer advertising between the fall of and the end of the first half of those companies that do tv advertising watch the results closely digene which makes a test for detecting human papillomavirus linked to cervical cancer uses spot tv ads but monitors the number of its tests ordered in a market after its ads run says joe slattery digenes chief financial officer "analysts watch us and watch our spending and you have to show return right away to the people who support you " says pam rasmussen who oversees consumer marketing for digene theragenics has had mixed results with its tv ads in it struck a sponsorship deal with professional bull riders part of an effort to reach men living in middle america says ms jacobs the companys chief executive local tv ads ran in markets where pbr events were held and featured some of the bull riders she says after switching to sponsoring bass fishing competitions broadcast on espn in theragenics has now shifted back to the bull riders she says and has winnowed its consumer marketing budget to &# million from &# million partly the result of targeting its ads more finely "im going to go direct to consumers as long as i can afford it and it still does get us results " says ms jacobs
