energy rise in electronic trading adds uncertainty to oil shift leaves traders looking for answers when prices jump oil markets were rocked by a massive almost instant surge in after hours electronic trading one day last month when prices for closely watched futures contracts jumped and just as quickly gave most of that back while prices have had bigger moves than the march &# a barrel run up this spike stands out because it was unclear at the time what drove it two weeks later it is still unclear what is clear is that a rapid shift in the bulk of crude trading from the raucous trading floor of the new york mercantile exchange to anonymous computer screens is making it harder to nail down the cause of price moves the oil futures market once moved based on the actions of a clubby group of floor traders closely watching each others actions but electronic trading has played an increasing role during the three year run up in oil prices eclipsing the traditional floor traders "one of the things that has been lost is the color and some of the information that the floor provides " said andy lebow a senior vice president at brokerage man financial in new york for example on the floor traders can get a sense of whether it is actual oil users like refiners or airlines or financial speculators that are doing the buying or selling "now if people ask whats going on you can say well i see numbers flashing on the computer but unless its my customers driving it i cant tell " he added oils three year surge and increasing daily price movements have drawn hedge funds pension funds and other financial buyers who prefer the ease and anonymity of electronic markets over the long term electronic trading offers many benefits including greater investor access and a broader market and its rising use in oil markets mirrors a longtime world wide trend but because those behind the trades are far away and largely unseen by market watchers the reasons behind their moves can be hard to determine the flood in electronic crude volume has already made spikes in crude much quicker often with little supply and demand factors appearing to drive the moves that adds further unpredictability to a tight market already susceptible to global disruptions and political blowups the march spike in crude prices from &# a barrel to more than &# in just seven minutes and then back to &# in an additional five was initially attributed to unfounded speculation of armed conflict involving iran but it now seems more likely that a smaller sudden jump triggered other preset orders and led to a cascading effect with more traders getting in as prices rose the cause of that initial jump whether it was a deliberate order or a mistake is still unclear the initial jump "triggered more orders already set into the system and with prices rising people thought somebody must know something " tom bentz an analyst and broker at bnp paribas futures in new york who was watching the screen at the time said the day after the spike "the more prices rose the more it seemed somebody knew something " the sheer volume of trade on the new york exchange and its location in the worlds largest oil consuming nation makes it one of the worlds most closely watched oil barometers the demise in the floors share of trading began in september when after hours electronic trading of crude futures was expanded to include the floor trading session since then electronic crude trading volume has jumped from less than of nymex activity to in march the catalyst for nymexs members to allow others access to their profitable crude futures trading was the success of intercontinentalexchange the electronic energy market the exchange launched a cash settled copy of nymexs benchmark u s light sweet crude oil futures in february and with that added to its european brent crude contract quickly captured more than half of the worlds crude oil futures trading in response nymex in april signed a year agreement to trade its products on the chicago mercantile exchanges globex electronic trading system replacing an electronic system it had been using since since nymex opened itself to the screen last september it has regained its mantle as the leading crude futures exchange though ices volumes remain strong screen trading like floor trading is regulated by the u s commodity futures trading commission nymex members who own shares in the market have reaped benefits from rising volumes but many floor workers have found themselves looking for work outside the trading pits "on the human side it might be a bad scenario" with many clerks and brokers out of a job said tony rosado who has moved from working on the nymex floor to an electronic brokerage iag energy brokers in fort lauderdale fla since the rise of screen trading "but on a global side its probably positive i would say a good portion of traders overall are happy " in march floor trading accounted for of total nymex volume with average daily trading slipping to about contracts from more than in through august but a visit to the pits still reveals a hive of activity if a little more subdued and those still working there say the benefits of going through the floor are still there said michael cambria who works on the floor at nymex with pndr energy group "when i heard the spike to &# could have been started by somebodys mistake to me well that was just welcome to the world of electronic trading "
