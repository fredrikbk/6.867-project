times in the s freight railroads took advantage of the industrys partial deregulation in to streamline their tracks labor forces and costs in the past few years a vastly consolidated rail industry has begun to reap the benefits of a surge in freight traffic which has used up capacity on some of the railroads busiest routes and given the industry unprecedented power to raise rates trucking companies which had been drawing away freight from the rails have run into rising fuel prices which affect trucks more than trains their productivity also has been constrained because of a limited number of drivers in addition globalization and longer supply chains are favoring railroads which are moving large volumes of imported goods to consumer markets from u s ports "its clearly going to be a royalty income stream on globalization " says thomas russo partner and portfolio manager at investment advisor gardner russo &amp gardner where he manages about &# billion berkshire is his biggest position bnsf whose rail system blankets two thirds of the u s has spent aggressively to upgrade its los angeles to chicago route and also encouraged development of large warehouse complexes next to its tracks
