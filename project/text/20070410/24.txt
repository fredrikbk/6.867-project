doctors assail unitedhealths threat of fines a new unitedhealth group inc policy that threatens to fine doctors for referring patients to out of network laboratories for tests is mushrooming into a bitter dispute between the health insurance giant and many of the physicians in its networks nationwide most health plans are designed so their members pay more when they go to an out of network doctor or take a nonpreferred medication but the financial sanctions which unitedhealth has yet to impose mark the first time a physician could be fined by a health insurer if he or she directs a patient to seek out of network care or testing the american medical association says the threats stem from a year deal that unitedhealth struck late last year with laboratory corp of america holdings to become its national in network laboratory with million health plan members and growing unitedhealth has been using its heft more and more in recent years to negotiate cut rate fees with doctors drug makers and other suppliers in the same vein it signed on lab corp after its longtime lab partner quest diagnostics inc said it couldnt accept new terms that unitedhealth wanted and dropped out of contract negotiations to squeeze as much savings as possible out of the lab corp deal unitedhealth sent a not so friendly reminder to doctors to play along if doctors consistently failed to refer patients to lab corp or other local in network lab facilities as of march unitedhealth said it reserved the right to fine them &# cut their fees or oust them from the network the strategy threatens to backfire a backlash brewing among physicians and regulators is creating a public relations mess as the company continues to struggle to recover from a stock options backdating scandal it also comes on top of a series of rancorous contract negotiations with doctors and hospitals in california colorado and other parts of the country "this is beyond punitive its abusive " says ted mazer an ear nose and throat doctor in san diego "and it makes you wonder whats next " the ama and a number of state medical societies have demanded that unitedhealth rescind the policy in new jersey the health insurer temporarily suspended the threat of sanctions after the state department of banking and insurance said it had concerns about their legality connecticuts attorney general richard blumenthal says he may ask unitedhealth to rescind the policy there as well "we havent made a formal demand but my hope is the company will do the right thing and stop this policy " he says unitedhealth defends the threats as a last resort measure to protect its health plan members from paying high out of network prices for lab work in some cases it says patients are being billed more than seven times more for tests by an out of network quest lab than what they would pay in network the insurer also wants to direct tests to lab corp to streamline analysis of lab data and for such efforts as tracking whether patients are meeting blood pressure or cholesterol targets the insurer says it has no plans to fine doctors in cases where patients decide on their own to go to an out of network lab "but we have a responsibility to members to act on their behalf" if a doctor is repeatedly sending patients to out of network labs says tyler mason a unitedhealth spokesman he adds that though the insurer expects to apply the sanctions only "sparingly" and after talking with the doctor "we need to have that recourse " many doctors complain that the threat has disrupted patient care especially in markets where quest labs dominate such as new york some lab companies blood and tissue tests for example differ in the methodology used to determine reference ranges for whats considered a normal result that includes lab corp and quests tests to track the level of t helper lymphocytes cells that produce antibodies and indicate immune system strength in patients infected with hiv the virus that causes aids jeff gumprecht a manhattan infectious disease specialist accustomed to sending unitedhealth patients to quest says he began referring many of them to lab corp for blood work after getting letters from the insurer because of different methodologies used by the two companies their results differed in this case making lab corp s counts look lower than those reported by quest although it turned out that nothing was amiss dr gumprecht had to repeat many of the tests to ensure that something else wasnt at play "how is that saving anyone money " he asks "meanwhile i have to explain to an anxious patient why the results are suddenly different " he now sends a lot of patients to lab corp but still refers some to quest quest says it has appealed the way unitedhealth has processed claims on behalf of some patients arguing the insurer is requiring them to pay too great a share of the cost for using quest labs in some instances quest has put off billing patients until the cases have been resolved meanwhile some doctors and their medical societies contend that the unitedhealth sanctions beyond affecting patient care would violate the health plans that unitedhealth administers while hmo style plans can restrict members from going to physicians or labs outside their networks unitedhealths policy extends to the preferred provider organizations or ppo plans that most insured people have these allow members the choice to go out of network as long as they pay a bigger share of the cost but unitedhealths mr mason says the insurers contracts with doctors have always required that they follow its referral protocols not all doctors are upset the american academy of family physicians wrote a letter of concern to unitedhealth in february but it told members that the health insurer had eased its worries after clarifying that it would not punish doctors for patients decisions and only apply the sanctions in rare cases where a doctor repeatedly defied the policy "this doesnt look as bad as it originally did " says bruce bagley the academys medical director for quality and improvement dr bagley also serves on a physician advisory committee for unitedhealth still many allergists say quest is the only national commercial lab in addition to some smaller regional labs that provides whats widely considered the gold standard blood test to detect food and other allergies "now either a patient doesnt get the best test or i could get fined " says ivor emanuel a san francisco allergist who adds hell still refer patients to the quest test if he believes its in their best interest lab corp says it provides a similar allergy blood test and one of the broadest ranges of allergen tests available
