wmd in iraq it barely gets a headline these days but terrorists are continuing to use chemical weapons in iraq or what was once called a weapon of mass destruction in this case the weapon is a truck full of explosives and chlorine which a suicide bomber drives into some public place for maximum terror impact on friday in ramadi a driver who was heading toward an iraqi police checkpoint came under fire and veered into a residential area slamming into an apartment complex for workers from a nearby glass and ceramics factory accounts differed on the toll of victims but u s military officials reported dead and wounded this was the sixth such attack using chlorine gas since january and the deadliest so far chlorine is a choking agent first used as a weapon in world war i it burns the skin lungs and eyes and causes coughing tearing and in the worst cases destruction of lung tissue there is no antidote the chemical is used in water purification plants and insurgents in anbar province have been raiding water plants and chlorine truck deliveries in jordan syria and iraq to use in the bombings this is another illustration of how our enemies in iraq reveal themselves in plain sight even if many prefer not to see many of the same human rights activists who urged the west to act against saddam husseins use of poison gas against the kurds now keep silent as chemicals are used by the terrorists who want to restore baathist rule in baghdad theres not much doubt that the terrorists would employ far more destructive wmd if they could if they prevail using such tactics in iraq their method and damage will spread
