home &amp family best of the juggle excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog what happens to routines when families ditch tv tuning out tv free for one week working parents typically complain that they want more time to read rest and talk with their spouse some juggle readers proposed a solution give up watching television readers said that living without television frees up many hours it "is life changing " wrote one i decided to shut off the set for one week first we experienced signs of withdrawal on the first night a wednesday when my husband was out of town the house seemed eerily quiet by sunday my husband was back and pacing the kitchen "were supposed to sit down and talk " i said "weve been talking all day " he protested still by the end of the week i found that we did talk a lot more we even sat down and scheduled our vacations for the year i also went to bed earlier and read a bit more the downside i missed the date like feeling of tv nights with my husband and learned that the tube can be good company when hes out of town now the question is can we keep tv to a bare minimum without unplugging entirely readers say "my family has been tv free for years were busy with exercise playing music photography reading writing cooking yard work etc " "i dont have time to zone out in front of the tv but the few shows i do watch help to take my mind off the daily grind and give me something to look forward to on certain days tivo allows me to watch what i want when i want so timing is not too much of an issue " the feminine "mistake" a new book by leslie bennetts "the feminine mistake " looks at the financial risks women take when they abandon their careers to stay home most stay at home wives are likely to face major hardships as a result of divorce widowhood or a spouses unemployment or illness ms bennetts recently wrote in the news and opinion site the huffington post over time she says "women who abandon their careers and become financially dependent on their husbands often look back on that decision as the biggest mistake of their lives even women in stable enduring marriages " mothers what do you think if you stayed in the work force how big a motivator was financial stability and independence if not are you concerned about future finances and have you made contingency plans readers say "financial independence is a big part of why i work and i will counsel my daughter to take it into consideration as well my father made my sister and i promise to live alone and support ourselves before we ever married just so we would know we could i think thats the best advice he ever gave me " "i became a full time stay at home mother years ago and i cant believe that this remains such a heated topic of course all women stay at home mothers or those working outside the home need to do financial and life planning " were you baby dissed keeping up with friends often falls by the wayside for working parents after we posted about ways to stay in touch a reader weighed in on the other side she said that many of her friends have started families and once the baby comes she stops hearing from them in an email she wrote "these same friends can take picture after picture of their child and post them daily on their blogs but cannot find the five minutes it takes to return an occasional phone call or email " another reader said "i have three close friends who are not married it is hard to identify with their latest breakup when i was up all night with a sick toddler " a few readers offered a compromise be open to spending time with the parents and the kid is that a realistic solution readers say "it is hard to get excited about social time when the only topic of conversation is the baby try to mix it up a little and youll find your friends more responsive " "i was one of those parents to be who swore that i would not become a housebound friendless bore with a million baby pictures and no other topics of conversation well so much for those plans the fact is that i am booked solid from a m when kids get up to p m when parents are finally fed every day " when no doesnt mean no is it harder for working parents to discipline their kids based on my own experience with my two year old i find that developing and sticking to rules with three caregivers in play me my husband and our nanny can be a challenge and i admit that after a long day at work im not as steadfast about saying no sometimes its just easier to haul out the cheerios that shes demanding for dinner than coax her to eat her broccoli disciplining and boundary setting with a toddler takes patience and consistency under any circumstance all three of us are clear with her about certain things that trigger a time out hitting coloring on the wall throwing food but sometimes i wonder if id have more fortitude to say no if i were less tired from working or if our evening hours werent so limited or do all parents whether they work outside the home or not simply have to pick their battles how do you make sure your childs discipline is adequate and consistent readers say "i feel like this one will be an ongoing struggle for years to come and we dont even have the nanny child care facility to add into the equation " although i think consistency is important for the big things hitting writing on the walls i have noticed that my school age kids have never had a problem understanding that mom and dad are different on the smaller stuff and that we have different breaking points " dream job vs reality check should parents teach kids to follow their professional dreams no matter what or should they encourage kids to be financially realistic one reader recently remarked that she gave up her career as an english professor to go to law school she says she wishes somebody had sat her down when she was to tell her how difficult a non lucrative career choice would be another reader says "i was shocked how poorly my education prepared me for the real world " should parents warn their children about financial juggles even if it means discouraging something their child is passionate about how much say should parents have when it comes to kids career choices readers say "as long as my son demonstrates that he knows the consequences and risks of the path hes taking id encourage him " "i wish someone had sat me down when i was and told me that the bachelor of fine arts degree i was pursuing would basically get me nowhere fast " write thejuggle wsj com
