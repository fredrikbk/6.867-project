the coming plague bad policies deliver their disasters when overtaken by events a peace in our time narcotic stupefied democracies for years while hitler seized power and built panzers we are now four decades into another self induced daze that will end in another great spasm of death when jonas salk announced his polio vaccine in humanitys century long war against germs seemed all but over public sanitation had driven them out of the water supply vaccines and antibiotics had then chased them out of the lungs fluids and intestines of the public itself "the time has come to close the book on infectious disease " our surgeon general would announce in "we have basically wiped out infection in the united states " viewed in that context the fda amendments that president kennedy signed into law in to regulate drugs in the peaceful germ free future seemed to make good scientific sense cholera had indeed given way to cigarettes and cholesterol the diseases of the future would be choreographed by lifestyle and genes not germs the drugs of the future would target cancer arthritis and other problems rooted in human chemistry the new killers would creep up rather predictably and evenly on adults not children widely prescribed pill a day treatments might easily cause more harm than good just months earlier a horrified world had discovered that one drug of the future thalidomide relieved morning sickness and helped people fall asleep but it also halted the growth of a babys limbs in the womb before thalidomide when microbes were still the enemy drugs got the benefit of the doubt after the unknown cure was officially more dangerous than the known disease and thus going forward all new medicines would have to be examined very closely there was no need to rush medicine didnt need texas ranger drugs any more the stunningly fast violent and random bandits of disease smallpox cholera tuberculosis typhoid and the rest were history but they werent germs are always future always reinventing themselves in their ingeniously stupid and methodically random way they have also contrived of late to get human sociopaths to add thought and order to the reinventing when they get lucky we wont be ready for all practical purposes getting ready was outlawed in scientists can now see a lot of bad germ chemistry coming over the horizon because they understand how genes mix match and change drug companies are extremely good at concocting me too variations on basic chemical themes drugs mutate to evade patents just as germs mutate to evade drugs cut loose these skills would give us in depth protection against the real threat not yesterdays germs but tomorrows but "safe" and "effective " the two key standards in the drug law have intelligible meaning only with a germ to fight and infected patients in which to fight it the fda positively requires real live germs to supply the patients that can supply fda caliber evidence that the drug safely kills real germs in real patients the agency also needs political support which requires a germ fearing culture but when a good vaccine wipes out the disease that it targets the disease can easily end up eclipsed by the vaccines side effects however rare or even imaginary tort law compounds the problem in a california court discovered that every vaccine is sold with an implied guarantee of safety and sound design another stew of words that have meaning only in context to give jurors that context to give them a good sense of perspective an antibiotic needs what it eliminates cankers pustules sputum fevers diarrhea dementia and emaciation in the years since grand new principles of freedom privacy and personal autonomy have emerged to protect septic suicide and homicide an infectious lifestyle once a crime is now a constitutional right the bag lady sleeps next to the sewer the mainliner shares needles in the abandoned row house prisons tattoo parlors foul locker rooms drug dens brothels bathhouses and other sepulchers of freedom now incubate drug resistant strains of tuberculosis staph bacteria gonorrhea and syphilis those germs are now drifting into rundown urban hospitals whose emergency rooms often provide primary care to the septic underclass to crown it all government procurement and insurance programs establish de facto price caps and neuter patents on almost all important germ fighting drugs after the anthrax attacks federal authorities scrambled to stockpile cipro demanded an excellent price and made clear they would breach bayers patents on the antibiotic if push came to shove the canadian government initiated its price negotiations by announcing it would ignore bayers patents and order a million tablets of a generic version of the drug from another company just two years earlier it was the pentagon that had pressed bayer to get the antibiotic officially approved for the treatment of inhalational anthrax with the anthrax attacks in mind congress did pass the bioshield law the measure to simplify only a bit rescinds the fda amendments completely but only when the pentagon says it needs the drug and accepts full responsibility for prescribing it to whoever needs it in uniform or out the development composition performance manufacture price and marketing of germ killing drugs are now controlled as tightly as shoulder mount missiles the manufacturers operate like big defense contractors mirror images of the insurers regulatory agencies and tort litigation machines that they answer to and as a result the germ side of the pharmaceutical industry has lost its dynamism flexibility resilience and reserve capacity the whole edifice leans sharply toward the past insurers favor yesterdays drugs because the patents have expired fda licensing gives the licensed status quo a decade long lead at the very minimum over anything now emerging from the lab germs no longer need to be smarter than our scientists just faster than our lawyers public authorities are ponderous rigid and slow the new germs are nimble flexible and fast drug regulators are paralyzed by the knowledge that error is politically lethal the new germs make genetic error constant mutation the key to their survival germs use pigs bacteria and each other as genetic mixing bowls they discover ways as one strain of hiv has apparently now done to use our drugs as food and they celebrate our constitution people as negligent with pills as they are with germs have already helped spawn drug resistant forms of tuberculosis by taking enough medicine to kill weaker strains while leaving hardy mutants alive to take over the business hiv patients who dont strictly follow the complex unpleasant drug regimen used to suppress the virus become human petri dishes in which microbes multiply and evolve to resist the fistfuls of antibiotics prescribed as a last resort pentagon scale government has trouble enough dealing with car bombers government contractors will never be agile enough to keep up with germs what we need is a robust flexible innovative diverse and fragmented portfolio of drug companies sinking a lot of new capital into highly speculative ventures almost all of which will lose money with just one or two ending up waved through by regulators eagerly paid for by insurers vindicated every time by judges and juries lauded in the mass media and so spectacularly profitable for investors that they crowd in to fund more it is hard to see how we will get there without a revival of our germ fearing culture and it may well take a horrible germ to revive it how horrible what might it look like ponder this question what would a watchmaker have done not a blind one but one with keen eyes and an excellent loupe if called upon to design a microbe that would thrive among people so fortified by so many vaccines and armed with such a potent array of antibiotics that their surgeon general black umbrella in hand had actually signed the articles of surrender on behalf of all the germs nature got there without the loupe it cooked up an all purpose anti vaccine so tiny and gentle that it spread unnoticed for decades and so innocuous that it never quite gets around to killing you at all it leaves that to the old guard the bacteria protozoa and viruses that invade when your immune system shuts down and feast on your brain lungs blood liver heart bone marrow guts skin and the surface of your eyes in its final stages aids is truly horrible when a watchmaker has been pulling such stunts for four billion years it is reckless to suppose that hiv was its last or worst when sociopaths are most certainly now scheming to add malignant human vision to the random walk it is criminally irresponsible for people in authority to assume anything but the opposite hiv has been detected in human plasma collected from a patient who died in we would be far safer today if the people preparing to rewrite the drug laws as he lay dying had been more frightened of viruses they could scarcely imagine than of thalidomide tragically visible though it was mr huber is a fellow of the manhattan institute this op ed is adapted
