politics &amp economics u s leaves door to china ajar wto complaint has narrow focus on media room for negotiation washington in the bush administrations "good cop bad cop" approach to trade relations with the chinese government yesterday was a "bad cop" day as expected the government said it would file a pair of cases in the world trade organization against china aimed at piracy and counterfeiting of u s intellectual property u s trade representative susan schwab said piracy and counterfeiting is "unacceptably high" and action was needed to prevent further losses to u s companies and workers she also said however the u s would "remain open at any time to a comprehensive settlement" during the wto arbitration process one wto case accuses china of lax enforcement of copyright violations the other challenges barriers to the sale of u s produced movies music and books a complaint that focuses on chinas practice of requiring government middlemen to import such materials which officials there say is necessary to ensure its censor process the u s move which sets off a lengthy process that could take years to resolve was narrowly focused on media and books several u s industries including pharmaceuticals and auto parts have pressed similar piracy complaints against china but they arent covered in the action for the wto the complaints break new ground at least in one regard previous cases have focused on regulatory reform but no country has tried to use the wto as a forum to discuss enforcement efforts which are hard to measure the merits of the cases remain to be determined but their intended effect may be to give washington more leverage in trade negotiations with the chinese treasury secretary henry paulson is set to continue president bushs economic dialogue with high ranking chinese officials next month the move was hailed on capitol hill where lawmakers have long pressed the administration to get tough on beijing on a range of issues "litigation isnt always the answer but when informal negotiations dont work we need to stand up for ourselves " said sen chuck grassley r iowa senior republican on the senate finance committee which has oversight on trade issues the move against china comes at a time when the bush administration is pushing hard to win approval in congress of a series of regional free trade agreements as well as renewed authority to negotiate a global trade agreement approval of all the trade initiatives are in doubt since democrats who are more skeptical of the gains of free trade won a majority in both houses of congress last year "this administration has ignored chinas trade violations over the past six years at the expense of u s businesses and workers " said sen sherrod brown d ohio "while this is a step in the right direction the timing of the presidents action is certainly suspicious given that his blanket authority to make trade deals is about to expire " the u s has tried less adversarial approaches to encouraging chinese reform with some success some u s pharmaceutical companies have in the past helped chinese police identify factories engaged in counterfeiting and the u s chamber of commerce recently hosted an international conference on intellectual property reform in beijing in the past cases taking a harder line have lacked an important component witnesses willing to testify their products are being counterfeited now the movie and music industries are stepping forward mitch bainwol chairman of the recording industry association of america said the group welcomed the administrations decision to file the wto cases "the theft of music is pervasive in china and takes place virtually without meaningful consequence " he said but other industries that depend on intellectual property enforcement arent certain litigation helps much pharmaceutical companies for instance worry that acknowledging there is widespread counterfeiting and illegal distribution of their products would damage their credibility and that of their brands they also are concerned beijing may strike back by shutting down market access to u s firms "the widespread fear is that if you bring litigation against china your companies will lose money lose contracts and investment will be slow to come " said gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a private nonprofit research institution bruce orwall and andrew batson contributed to this article
