not even politicians can out campaign office grandstanders ed jackson could write a handbook on self promotion based on his observations over his career it would include small tactics such as taking copious notes during management meetings to appear diligent "make sure you use a pencil so the scribble is more audible " says the marketing consultant and it would include larger tactical maneuvers such as moving on to another job or project before a failure surfaces "isnt that exactly what politicians do " he asks most of his advice for getting ahead would involve actions in public forums meetings emails and teleconferences copy the boss liberally for example and email only late in the evening to suggest you havent left work yet he says during meetings ask questions after your bosss presentation that reinforce the stated position such as "wouldnt you agree that " and always pose questions at the end of a colleagues argument that suggest hes somewhat daft "youre saying what exactly " at least in presidential campaigns there are primaries polls and pundits that soon silence the grandstanding of all but one no such luck in the workplace when colleagues stump for higher office every meeting is their town hall every email is a debate and every teleconference is an opportunity for attack ads whats worse you cant change the channel and theres no little red light bulb to signify someones time is up hey theres an idea "theres a vehicle to shut them up in politics " says mark aldrich a professor "but in many situations there isnt an up or down vote in the office they can be around for a very long time politicking " self promoters are the genus that includes subspecies like workplace saboteurs authority posers and squeaky wheels but by virtue of being public such glory casting also involves the theft of time from others these horn tooters give conference calls email threads and meetings a bad name even though meetings dont torment people gasbags do some of the office campaign tactics prof aldrich has witnessed wrap a self serving argument in the flag of the highest moral principle such as something good for the business or play the ventriloquists dummy by touting the bosss agenda at a meeting even before the boss does the manager will invariably say "what a great idea " says prof aldrich "its the punch and judy show " another tactic speak first and often in meetings says greg milano a sales and marketing veteran of years and act like the boss you arent yet one colleague he remembers would often distribute minutes of meetings that werent his make the first toasts at parties he didnt host and grill people with questions only he felt he was entitled to ask "it became such an annoyance that people started to refer to that behavior by his name " says mr milano another common tactic insurance executive ken stewart has observed is to go on the attack "dont raise the bridge lower the water " he says he went so far as to transfer out of one dysfunctional department because meetings proved to be a crowded field of contenders variously undermining each other and swooning at the sound of their own voices scott stafford a former legislative assistant had a colleague who engaged in dirty tricks he would steal informational faxes memos and mail in an attempt to demonstrate publicly his mastery of everyone elses issues "theres probably a plus for the campaign that goes negative " says mr stafford "it works " one of dick nicholsons former co workers angling for a prestigious post got the promotion after a campaign swing through the company vice presidents church which he began attending regularly in various meetings including conference calls hed sit shaking his head at his opponents comments "those are the kids when we were in elementary school we wanted to beat up " says mr nicholson grandstanders typically secure managerial approval in inverse proportion to colleagues admiration sour grapes aside colleagues tend to loathe the very person the boss likes and for the same reason modesty deficit robert cialdini professor of psychology at arizona state university explains that two of the main dimensions on which people are judged are likeability and competence modesty about workplace abilities works only when the audience already knows someones credentials which co workers likely do but modesty can backfire with anyone especially the boss who doesnt know "if the audience doesnt know your level of credentials and you under represent them they believe you " he says on the other hand prof cialdinis research shows that self aggrandizers bug colleagues more than superiors because likeability may make you popular but it isnt the main criterion of management "the manager is looking for evidence of competence " he says susan credle an advertising executive sees something commendable about artful self promoters "if they do it in a smart way then im really impressed " she says still she concedes just as in politics such campaigns "unfortunately can get you high up enough to be at a level where you can bother a lot of people " email me at jared sandberg wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to wsj com
