the game gaming the game how street plays the league tables the face of wall street changed back on july the first time this newspaper published rankings of investment banks merger advising and underwriting prowess these league tables as they later became known treated banking as if it were a perpetual pennant race a welcome jolt for an industry that for decades had avoided competing twenty five years later the league tables have become a beloved institution for journalists and bankers hoping to extract both meaning and bonuses from the frenzy of street life but the real meaning might be a farce the tables have become home to the most petty and wheedling impulses of the industrys most respected institutions which are rabid about staying high in the rankings if you want to understand the street at its absurd best watch men in rolexes grub for credit for deals they barely worked on for clients who probably wont pay them two advisers lehman brothers holdings and centerview partners were originally named for helping altria group spin off kraft foods for &# billion in january in the next few weeks a whole new cast materialized to claim credit j p morgan chase credit suisse group citigroup and deutsche bank were first goldman sachs group popped up too with morgan stanley trundling on later it all may seem like a silly game until you realize the grubfests have the effect of trivializing the very advice for which investment banks are charging millions of dollars "clients laugh about league tables " says herald l ritch formerly mergers chief at donaldson lufkin &amp jenrette and now president of sagent advisors "everyone comes in and says theyre no in the world in everything its a stupid way to run a business and because it makes a bunch of grown ups look silly to their clients its not helpful " a virtual napoleonic code of league table rules have piled on through the years the rules generally allow investment banks to claim credit for a transaction no matter how slight their role may be they measure primacy by the dollar volume of transactions which means that a nonpaying role on a &# billion blockbuster appears to count for more than a hard won profitable mandate on an obscure &# million deal consider citigroups last ditch plan to win credit for a &# billion norwegian oil deal at the end of the new york bank was brought in for a fairness opinion on the day it was announced timing that suggests a less than essential role thomson financial one of the official scorekeepers denied citigroups request while rival tabulator dealogic granted it thomsons decision cost citigroup the overall crown for advising on european deals last year it would have been a hollow victory perhaps but one widely repeated by the media the wall street journal included this isnt to pick on citigroup every investment bank on wall street has its own "league table trades " which is slang for wheedling credit for a deal but not much else credit typically comes by being named in a press release or when desperate producing a letter from a client showing a banks role often these letters are backdated and the roles dont involve an actual fee in one instance says thomson an unnamed bank submitted an entirely fabricated bond deal on behalf of a foreign country such maneuvers seem outrageous but can be expected given an eroding culture that thinks nothing of backdating engagement letters and touting phantom mandates this cynical world has produced contrition up and down the street but no one is about to pull out of the hustle each investment bank employs what are affectionately known as "deal monkeys " whose job it is to improve a banks standing this devolution began in when an outfit named securities data co began centralizing underwriting and merger information which were previously hand printed on ledgers known as spread sheets league tables for stock or bond underwriting were easier to keep as banks roles were part of actual securities filings merger tables however were far more inscrutable the lists became an invaluable reference there was another purpose too says michael danziger sdcs former president "it was a deal pitching tool " he says "they wanted independent confirmation of their wonderfulness " it wasnt long before rankings of top deal makers began to appear which ignited a primal yearn for recognition in a business populated by the prideful "we knew that we had created a monster when sometimes peoples bonuses were based on the publicly printed rankings " mr danziger says thomson which subsumed sdc and dealogic have tried their best to evolve their rules over time and even thomson acknowledged its concerns about league table gamesmanship to clients last year thomsons peter marney stresses that the rules are "completely transparent and open to a very high degree of self policing " still it is about time the farce came to an end most banks are publicly traded and disclose their revenue figures although they report broad numbers that make it difficult to pick apart merger and acquisition advisory revenue there should be a way of standardizing these public figures another solution encourage greater disclosure of adviser fees in securities filings which are harder to game than news releases league table reform is trivial compared to say fighting global warming that doesnt mean the street
