dr waxmans drug lab congress is rumbling to life on pharmaceutical prices and the cause du jour is biotechnology medicine both chambers are considering legislation that would allow for the manufacture of lower cost "generic" copies of biopharmaceuticals proponents of the plan speak a language of easy certainties but the issues and potential consequences are vastly more complex biopharmaceuticals or biologics are proteins made by splicing genetic material into living cell cultures many biologics are breakthrough therapies from avastin which chokes off the blood supply to cancerous tumors to cerezyme which treats the rare genetic disorder gauchers disease these drugs are expensive some can run to thousands of dollars a year according to ims health the total cost reached &# billion in some of u s drug spending that figure is expected to rise to &# billion by california representative henry waxman has introduced the access to life saving medicine act because he claims all this is "too expensive " the reference point is the law mr waxman co authored in allowing the food and drug administration to approve cheaper generic versions of conventional drugs once the patents on the originals expire when the hatch waxman act went into effect however biologics were barely on the medical horizon the new bill also sponsored by senators hillary clinton and chuck schumer would establish a similar regulatory chute for approving "biogenerics " but this is an attempt to fit a new problem into a framework for which it wasnt designed the pharmaceuticals currently covered under hatch waxman are "small molecule" drugs made through distinct and replicable chemical syntheses simple tests can show that a generic is chemically identical to the original the same cant be said for biologics because they are made from living cells a generic will not be biochemically identical to the original for this reason "biogenerics" are called "follow on biologics" by the fda the fdas european counterpart calls them "biosimilars " the long protein chains in biologics are less well understood than traditional drug molecules protein folding glycosation or impurities introduce variation sometimes with adverse side effects in the late s johnson &amp johnson sold a licensed version of amgens dialysis drug epogen called eprex in europe several hundred patients developed a serious immune reaction called pure red call aplasia due to a minor change in the manufacturing process follow on versions of some of the most basic biologics like human insulin and human growth hormone are either on market or undergoing fda review as the science becomes more sophisticated the same will be possible for more complex biologics right now it isnt nevertheless the waxman legislation would establish "interchangeability " or therapeutic equivalence as the fda standard a prescription for expensive avastin say could be filled by a cheaper generic product even though the two might function differently in the body the legislation also enforces an abbreviated fda review process circumventing the multiyear clinical trials and postmarket studies required of the original drugs it even restricts the fdas authority to require postmarket tests in effect assuming into the process facts not in evidence while some of the concerns about the potential side effects of biosimilars may be overstated doctors and patients ought to have access to the clinical data that would allow them to evaluate for themselves the risk reward trade offs in that regard it would be useful to ease the fdas onerous safety and efficacy regulations but mr waxmans proposal to do so selectively only in the case of biosimilars suggests other motives the animus at work here seems to be to tilt advantages away from bio pharma toward the generics mr waxmans bill would weaken intellectual property protections such as clinical trial data exclusivity and also establish compulsory licensing further it offers incentives for generics to work around the many patents that cover complex biologics before they expire even the eu provides more stringent patent guarantees for biosimilars the high prices of biologics reflect the difficulty and expertise required to develop these medicines it should be possible to preserve incentives to innovate while advancing legitimate public health goals like increased access and generics can play a useful role in spurring the reformulation of existing medicines in more efficacious ways the challenge is to strike a balance between access and innovation which mr waxman and his allies fail to do the real costs of this agenda might well be fewer new biological therapies see related letters "letters to the editor biologics lawmakers may find that science is a law unto itself" wsj april
