cutting a deal with the irs has grown increasingly taxing negotiating with the internal revenue service to reduce your tax bill has never been easy and lately it has gotten even harder as the irs increasingly focuses on collecting more of the taxes it is owed options that allow taxpayers to write off or substantially pare their tax bills have become a harder row to hoe tax practitioners say that makes those sales pitches promising you will pay "pennies on the dollar" of your tax bill questionable at best however taxpayers with legitimate hardships who can prove their willingness to work with tax collectors still have a shot at winning some reprieve under the irs "offer in compromise" program or by agreeing to an installment payment plan because of tax law changes that went into effect last year some taxpayers who might have applied for the offer in compromise program in the past are unlikely to do so now tax experts said one reason a upfront payment of the lump sum settlement you propose to pay that may be a substantial barrier for taxpayers who are struggling to pay anything at all plus that deposit is nonrefundable if your offer is rejected by the irs and the payment is applied to your tax bill the payment and &# application fee are waived for taxpayers who meet certain low income limits also some tax practitioners note that it is simply harder to get irs approval these days david levine an enrolled agent with d m l consulting in reno nev says that over the past years about of his offer in compromise applications on behalf of clients were approved by the irs but that approval rate has dropped in recent months "i wouldnt make an offer if i didnt think it would be approved now im down in the bracket and im using the same diligence " he says enrolled agents are tax preparers who are authorized to represent taxpayers to the irs the offer in compromise program can be misunderstood "ive had doctors walk in with millions of dollars of assets in real estate who want an offer in compromise because theyre having a bad year i have to explain to them no way " says jayme gallenson an enrolled agent with h&amp r block inc in corte madera calif if people have the assets or the ability to work to pay their tax bills they are normally going to be held to it he says the requirements are a bit easier to meet for the irss installment program tax experts say if you owe less than &# and can pay the full amount over time the irs routinely accepts installment agreements mr gallenson says but for installment payments on a tax bill larger than &# the irs will want to see detailed information about your finances via form a whats more recent legislation has prompted the irs to approve partial payment installment agreements "the notion being that if the taxpayer is down on their luck and can afford to pay &# a month its better to get the &# a month than to get nothing " says frank degen an enrolled agent on new yorks long island of course installment payments arent exactly free there is an application fee &# to &# plus interest and possible penalties the penalties stop at of the tax liability but interest keeps running "theres no free ride " mr degen says no matter what your ability to pay is it is important to file on time as the failure to file penalty is a month while the failure to pay penalty is a month that is if you dont file you will pay a month plus interest if you file but fail to pay you will pay a month plus interest also tax practitioners say that if you cant pay the best thing is to notify the irs right away if you owe less than &# and start making payments right away there is a good chance the irs will accept your installment agreement terms
