world of hurt time waster real time map monitors disasters across the globe online edition alertmap is a real time display of the catastrophic accidents violent weather and epidemic outbreaks unfolding across the globe its a serious service staffed by serious people dedicated to the idea that accurate information can prevent and mitigate disasters for the rest of us people more likely to be victims in waiting than future first responders alertmap makes for perfect disaster rubbernecking the ultimate goal of alertmap which is run by a budapest based nongovernmental organization is crisis omniscience "to monitor and document all the events on the earth which may cause disaster or emergency " according to the groups mission statement to that end alertmap tracks some online sources around the clock creating what they believe is the worlds most comprehensive and accurate emergency resource visitors to alertmaps web site see a planet literally plagued by emergencies most of the screen is dedicated to a simple world map littered with bright colorful icons each one represents a different man made tragedy or natural disaster from bee attacks to volcanic eruptions the service tracks more than different types of disasters in all its not unusual to see or more continuing situations marked on the map beyond these disaster icons the map is unadorned there are no political boundaries or country names that omission was intentional according to alertmap project manager robert rafael "we dont differentiate by political or ethnic basis " he says clicking a calamity icon reveals detailed data on the location severity and latest status as the emergency unfolds and more information becomes available these subpages of information are updated the breadth of emergencies covered can be breath taking on tuesday the map showed patients were poisoned after eating the porridge at a hospital in harbin china and tourists were trapped by landslide in a remote part of india a small team of emergency preparedness professionals maintains the map around the clock while performing other responsibilities for their work with the ngo "we are always trying to look for information that is confirmed either by an authority or an official competent organization " says mr rafael "we do not take information from blogs or other unconfirmed reports " alertmap is funded and staffed by the hungarian national association of radio distress signaling and infocommunications a nonprofit group where mr rafael serves as deputy secretary general the group works with and receives funding from some of hungarys government agencies and the european union for which it performs various emergency related services mr rafaels group known by its hungarian initials rsoe provides emergency updates to the countrys ministry of foreign affairs to warn tourists of trouble spots abroad his organization also has the obscure but vital responsibility of coordinating navigation on the danube river and lake balapom the largest lake in europe monitoring alertmap offers a window into human vulnerability local emergencies that hardly register as a blip to those outside of the affected communities can be found everywhere and not just in the far flung corners of the developing world on march for instance ohio was alive with emergencies a radioactive ingot went missing from a uranium enrichment plant near piketon a tornado struck elyria township miles west of cleveland and severe winds whipped through zanesville the tamer disasters of the day chronicled by alertmap at a wedding celebration in india a buildings rooftop railing collapsed killing seven and injuring more than alertmap codes this as a "technological disaster " according to the report cited by the map the railings collapsed beneath a large crowd of women who had gathered to sing traditional hindu wedding songs meanwhile hundreds of camels described as "mad with thirst" rampaged through an australian town destroying toilets and air conditioners in their search for water an explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in china left six people dead including a year old man who just happened to be passing by meanwhile the u s had several nuclear related emergencies in march alone on top of ohios missing ingot there were two separate emergencies at tennessees y nuclear weapons plant and a leak at the pilgrim power plant in massachusetts along with three additional incidents flagged by alertmap the first week of april brought two more u s based "nuclear events " to use the maps preferred term according to an archive search clicking on any of one of these disasters will launch an interactive google map of the affected area here alertmap reveals its identity as a "mashup " these web applications part of the web landscape blend information from multiple online sources google like other online enterprises publishes some of its source code so that outsiders can create hybrid programs that rely on its data hundreds of mashups like alertmap use google maps to display all sorts of information from new york city coffee shops to crime scenes in chicago the earliest version of alertmap appeared in january as a way for zsolt boeszoermenyi mr rafaels colleague to organize climate change data he had been collecting since the mid s an english language version was launched in the aftermath of the indian ocean tsunami which killed hundreds of thousands and focused world wide attention on emergency preparedness disaster data come from sources around the world and in some cases information from highly trusted groups is automatically fed into alertmap data from these groups which include the u s geological survey earthquakes the world health organization epidemics and the international volcano research centre eruptions is added to the map within five minutes of its release mr rafael says "but for smaller events such as animal attacks " he adds "we will insert it manually " defining an emergency is one the thornier issues facing the alertmap team and its not surprising to find that the definition varies widely depending on the situation for car accidents for instance there must be at least casualties to make it on the map according to the groups policy but any airplane ship or railway related emergency even when no one is injured is included despite a wide array of information alertmap is far from comprehensive a few terror attacks have been logged including a baghdad chlorine gas bombing from february but an archive search for terrorism reveals only results since and only three of these events are from iraq confirming reports of violence from war zones like iraq or even an animal attack in africa is time consuming mr rafael points out alertmap lacks the funding and staff to spot and verify every reported disaster let alone the countless cases that go unreported or underreported operating expenses for the map which draws about visitors a day run between and euros a month mr rafael says and as of now his ngo is financing the map without any supporting grants or outside funding in the future after the map interface undergoes planned improvements rsoe hopes to attract other governments and emergency service agencies as fee paying subscribers for a premium version still it proves surprisingly difficult to find a hypothetical disaster that mr rafael and his colleagues have overlooked are they ready for an apocalypse from outer space "our asteroid information is coming from nasa " mr rafael reports but dont expect asteroid forecasts on alertmap unlike severe storm and earthquake warnings which are displayed on the map other disasters for which warnings are issued like asteroids or terror attacks will appear only after the fact "there is a policy not to create fear " mr rafael says write to aaron rutkoff at aaron rutkoff wsj com
