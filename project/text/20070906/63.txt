lets not play the deadly deterrent game linton brooks "bombs away for good " editorial page aug is asking all the wrong questions when it comes to the "reliable replacement warhead" program why isnt he asking "will building new nuclear weapons make other states such as iran more or less likely to pursue a nuclear weapons program of their own " or what about "in a world where we face no superpower threat is it really necessary to keep thousands of nuclear weapons deployed around the world ready to launch at a moments notice " article vi of the non proliferation treaty npt calls for the u s and other nuclear weapon states to "pursue negotiations in good faith on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control " such negotiations have not happened in the years since the npt came into effect building thousands of new nuclear weapons under the reliable replacement warhead program will not bring us closer to the ultimate goal of the npt rather it will perpetuate life under the shadow of nuclear destruction for decades to come rick wayman santa barbara calif mr brooks reminds us that questions about the u s nuclear arsenal remain first priority concerns he asks the pertinent question "should the u s even have a nuclear deterrent " but his answer is weak he cites history and rests his case readers should agree with him only if we also agree that north korea should have a nuclear deterrent and iran and brazil and egypt and malaysia thats how the deterrent game is played in the u s signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty article vi of the npt recognizes that rules of proliferation are quite simple if anyone has nuclear weapons everyone can have them if we dont want others to have them we have to give up ours thats why we promised to disarm back in to argue now that we need an enduring stockpile either to support the reliable replacement warhead rrw the nnsas current darling or the ongoing stockpile life extension work in oak ridge tenn which is upgrading our current arsenal one warhead at a time is to stand arrogantly and wrongheaded in the face of reality the only path to safety as former secretaries of state henry kissinger and george shultz former sen sam nunn and former secretary of defense william perry noted in the journal last january is the path to disarmament and an enduring stockpile wont get us there nothing else mr brooks can say will overcome that simple fact and his arguments in favor of the rrw even lack the virtue of being supported by facts "whole classes of u s weapons have been eliminated " he says what he doesnt add is but only when they were deemed no longer useful or were replaced by alternative weapons "the number of nuclear weapons dismantled this year will increase by over last year " he says neglecting to mention that we have a year backlog of bombs awaiting dismantlement and capacity issues at the y plant in oak ridge and safety concerns at pantex limited the number of bombs dismantled in "were reducing the deployed stockpile to by " he says failing to point out this falls short of the commitments of the moscow treaty is the low end of the treatys goal and the missiles being withdrawn from the field are not scheduled for dismantlement they are merely being shelved in a strategic reserve so fellow readers make no mistake if congress funds the rrw it is funding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction agree with linton brooks at your peril literally ralph hutchison knoxville tenn
