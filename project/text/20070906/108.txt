the daily fix roddick plays his best tennis but federer swats him aside online edition roger federers odds of winning a u s open title got a bit better while the u s s got a bit longer last nights quarterfinal matches at arthur ashe stadium were very nearly americas last stand in flushing on the mens side andy roddick squared off against federer otherwise known as the worlds greatest player and so good the fix drops the "mr " before his name on the womens side venus williams faced jelena jankovic the no player in the world of the two mr roddick faced the greater challenge mr roddick and federer had played times prior to last nights match and times federer walked away the winner and that just begins to describe what mr roddick what was up against as the los angeles timess bill dwyre writes of federer "he is ranked no and that doesnt quite capture the gap between him and the rest of male humanity especially on any court surface that isnt clay " the outcome proved the same mr roddick who fell to federer in the finals last year lost yet that hardly tells the story of the match mr roddick played almost flawless tennis in a quarterfinal match that could have been the final time and again he smashed his serve at federer producing aces and not one double fault the boston globes john powers writes "andy roddick did everything he could against the defending champion last night bashing mile an hour serves and running around the court like a rabid retriever yet in the end he went down and out " though mr roddick was left shaking his head at times and failed to win a set he pushed federer last night more than he did in last years u s open final or this years australian open semifinal as the new york timess liz robbins writes of mr roddick "this time when roddick walked off the united states open court that radiated pure electricity he said he had no more questions about himself or about federer " with mr roddick now a spectator ms williams is the lone american left in another thrilling match which set the stage for the roddick federer masterpiece ms williams pulled out a victory over ms jankovic the boston globes bud collins had nothing but praise for ms jankovic this morning "if the smile of helen of troy launched a thousand ships and the smile of mona lisa lured millions of louvre goers then the smile of jelena jankovic won countless admirers last night " he writes "in whats known as the heat of battle jankovic the belle of belgrade fought one of the greatest of all tennis players to a standstill for nearly hours " as the toronto stars rosie dimanno writes ms williams who hasnt made the semis at the u s open in five years "ascended" last night "not lofty and ethereal as shed been through the earlier rounds but scratching and clawing before rocketing through a third set tiebreak under the klieg lights at arthur ashe stadium " the victory gives ms williams a berth in the semifinals where she will meet justine henin the no player in the world and the woman who knocked ms williamss sister serena out of the tournament on tuesday ms williams is lifetime against ms henin but that is all distant history the two have not faced each other since the australian open final peyton manning got the proverbial monkey off his back last winter finally winning a super bowl championship that doesnt mean the pressure is off as the indianapolis colts prepare to kick off the nfl season against the new orleans saints tonight the question is whether the colts can do what only the new england patriots and denver broncos have done in the past decade and repeat as league champions "one super bowl victory " writes bob kravitz of the indianapolis star "yeah that was great enjoyed the party showed off that giant diamond and sapphire ring had a civic hangover that lasted months but now its over and its time for the indianapolis colts the most consistently successful nfl franchise this side of you know who to move beyond that solitary super bowl victory and establish something even greater " the new orleans saints will be trying to repeat the magic of last season when they advanced to the nfc championship game the key to the season as it was last season will be saints quarterback drew brees whom the saints signed prior to the season mr brees as mike triplett of the new orleans times picayune points out is trying to do his best impression of manning whom he has known for almost a decade mr brees threw for passing yards which helped him bump "manning off the first team all pro roster for the first time in four years " the impression doesnt just end on the field "off the field they are two of the most involved athletes in all of sports manning was named the nfls man of the year for brees received the same honor a year later " mr triplett writes yet if either team wants to take home the vince lombardi trophy this year the road may well go through new england and the patriots who went on a spending spree this offseason netting tom brady the best collection of wide receivers he has ever had as the boston globes christopher l gasper points out mr brady is the winningest quarterback in the super bowl era but has never had a hall of famer on the receiving end of his passes "who is the best receiver tom terrific has ever had troy brown who may be canonized in these parts and rightfully so but canton recognition seems like a long shot " mr gasper writes with october less than a month away major league baseballs pennant races are in full gear and fans in chicago milwaukee san diego and arizona are sweating as the san diego padres and arizona diamondbacks squared off in phoenix with the nl west up for grabs "managerial acumen " was and will continue to be the key to a postseason berth writes paola boivin of the arizona republic "chase field morphed into an oversized chessboard wednesday night with bob melvin and bud black playing the roles of bobby fischer and garry kasparov " ms boivin continues san diego manager bud black made the first move deciding to start jake peavy on short rest something the pitcher has done only once in his six year career the move didnt pay off "the arizona diamondbacks sank their fangs into jake peavy last night dealing the padres their most jarring defeat of the season " writes tom krasovic of the san diego tribune mr peavy gave up eight runs and didnt make it out of the fifth as the diamondbacks handed the padres a loss meanwhile the chicago cubs held on to their half game lead over the milwaukee brewers with an victory over the los angeles dodgers ted lilly who is quickly becoming the cubs ace with carlos zambrano struggling allowed two runs in innings but if the cubs are to hold on to their lead they will need their starting pitching to step up "because in baseball like advertising its the pitching stupid " writes the chicago sun timess gordon wittenmyer seattle times columnist jerry brewer has a great story about david kopay from to mr kopay played in the nfl in he became the first openly gay current or former american professional athlete in team sports now he is pledging &# million to the university of washingtons q center a haven for people of all sexual orientations making the donation remarkable is this "kopay isnt one of those athletes with an extra &# million resting in his sofa cushions either he says he never made more than &# a season during his nine year nfl career he played without signing bonuses without guaranteed money " yet as mr kopay tells mr brewer "hell yeah its a lot of money to me i struggled and i suffered while in college because it was a different time but it was a wonderful time too if i had not gone through some of that stuff i wouldnt be who i am now i owe the university everything and i think a lot of people feel that way " maybe more people shouldnt listen to their doctors that at least is the apparent lesson of lauren jacksons season after a season during which the seattle storm star was plagued by stress fractures in her left leg ms jackson claimed her second wnba mvp yesterday yet it had little to do with the advice of her doctors who prescribed offseason rest ms jackson instead toured the world playing basketball she helped the australian team defeat the u s at the world championships she played professionally in south korea and then she joined teammate sue bird to play for spartak moscow and as a result of all that basketball ms jackson "kicked off one of the best seasons in league history " writes the seattle post intelligencers darren fessenden "the six time all star became the second player to lead the wnba in scoring ppg and rebounding rpg she also finished second in blocks bpg had a league high double doubles and tied a league record with points in a game " tip of the fix cap to readers don hartline found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the
