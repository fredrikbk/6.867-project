pikes pique fishermans foe smithfield maine were up in maine and out on north pond this summer bringing in the big ones best summer i can remember in years for bass fishing championship six five and four pound small and large mouth taking such lures as plastic worms crayfish and lizards and then fighting like the devil wouldnt have it when hooked jumping and flapping clear out of the water tail dancing across the surface and then diving deep jumping again and swimming in circles until nearly exhausted and then continuing to fight once theyre in the boat such champions are then weighed and the angler is photographed holding each prize tightly by the fishs bone and gristle lower jaw with thumb and forefinger he or she then grips the big guy under his belly and releases him into the water slowly to fight another day couldnt ask for more in the way of small adventures in angling except well there is this other fish that inhabits the deep water of north pond and that of the other lakes in the belgrade lakes chain it is a fish that many of us here long to catch and mount as a trophy it fights in a manner very different from the bass and is seldom accorded gentle treatment for it is of gruesome and cunning aspect and it eats bass which is simply unacceptable so when caught it is never photographed and petted back into the water it is the northern pike a long fast torpedo shaped voracious predator with rows of sharp teeth in addition to bass itll eat anything available perch sunfish ducklings muskrats frogs leeches even other pike according to the august issue of northwoods sporting journal maines current record pike was a pound ounce bruiser caught in in great pond our large neighboring lake and the fictional "golden pond " however a sporting web site www landbigfish com claims that the pike record is right here on north pond a pound ounce hulk caught in i had two more near adventures with pikes two weeks ago when i was casting over shoals with "good structure" rocks weeds sharp drop off using a senko plastic worm on very light six pound line on a whippy little six foot rod each time something impressively large took the worm and i jerked up the rod to "set the hook " then began reeling but there was no thrilling leap from the water by a thrashing bass no diving and running in circles just an ominous weight uh oh pike it reels in with all the action of a bucket of mud which makes it even scarier because the angler doesnt see the monster until it surfaces next to the boat my rod is almost bent double and im reeling in hard hoping it doesnt snap when i suddenly fall backward into the boat looking up at a dangling clean cut line which the pike scissored with his sharky teeth fours years ago as i was passing the time of day with a maine guide waiting his turn at a boat landing i told him i had hooked a pike the day before but couldnt get him in the boat he laughed and said dont feel bad pikes are very difficult to land unless youre aware of their tactics he said he bet he could tell me what happened even before i described it here is a paraphrase of what he said if a pike is hooked firmly it will stop fighting and tearing its insides to pieces and just come on up from the grassy depths that are its usual habitat to have a look at what it is dealing with once the pike surfaces the inexperienced fisherman is amazed to see the huge fish roll over on its side by the boat and float inert while staring up balefully at the angler with one big dark eye the excited guy in the boat believing he has a trophy for his camp wall maybe thinks what a big wimp whats the big deal about landing a pike then he grabs his net with one hand while keeping the rod up and the line tight with the other what the pike has been doing cunning remember is working the line back to the corner of his mouth in a startling second he shoots away severing the line and taking it and the lure into the deep i was impressed "yeah thats exactly what happened " i said "he also snapped my rod in the bargain " the guide smiled and said "well theres always the next time " last year i was in a three man boat fishing "sunfish shoal " a deep area of north pond of big rocks and a forest of grass just the sort of gloomy environment favored by pikes which can sit perfectly still their olive and yellow colored bodies camouflaged in the weeds or under a rock waiting to strike their prey with a darting ambush a pike grabbing everything that day took each of our lures in turn cutting the lines "hey ive got a big " "whoah something huge just " "big one guys big one forget it " i told my father in law frank spencer about our experience and he was alarmed about a marauder at one of our favorite fishing holes so the next day he went out with heavy tackle and a deep diving repala lure and caught the pike he said the thing flopped around the boat snapping at everything including him so he dispatched it with an oar handle to the head after my close encounters this summer i heard some pike stories up at the general store in the hamlet of smithfield the most disconcerting was one fishermans description of a hooked pike leaping from the water and snapping his way right up the guys line to the rod i was advised by some of the experienced guys there and by camp neighbors who also fish for pike through the ice in winter that i should use a seven foot rod rigged with pound line and a steel leader thus informed i felt a duty to get rigged up and go for pike especially after i heard the fears that they are getting too numerous and diminishing some popular fish such as the yellow perch which are favored locally for delicious fry ups there havent been the usual big schools of perch which give trollers the chance to bring in dozens on a couple of sweeps across the lake in our camp i found an l l bean seven foot rod and a reel with pound line that i hadnt used in years and i had plenty of old repala crank bait lures aha i thought the deep waters call i motored out in franks bass boat to a buoy in the middle of the lake marking some of north ponds biggest underwater rocks it was at this place that i had hooked the huge pike in as i drifted over the enormous rocks the tops of which were only inches below the surface and began casting i noticed my daughter adelaide and her friend leah just putting out from the beach at sunset camps in their foot sailboat it seemed to me as i focused in on them with my binoculars that they were having trouble against the wind and were falling back time for a rescue i started up the horse johnson and throttled forward toward nowhere i was stuck on a rock for minutes as i intermittently sent a roaring full throttle blast through the motor i couldnt budge the hull off the rock i cut the motor and contemplated my situation last year i dropped an outboard motor into the lake this year i was absurdly stuck on a rock in the middle of the lake my cellphone was in the boat but no one was in our camp adelaide was in the sailboat my wife kay and daughter elizabeth were on a college tour in massachusetts franks camp is next door but i didnt know his number nor anyone elses number nearby so i called kay while she was on a highway in another state and asked her to call frank next door to gather a rescue party when she and elizabeth stopped laughing they put through the message franks neighbors untied their boat and sallied forth all was resolved ill spare you and me the embarrassing details i think im going to get a reputation around this lake mr crabb is the journals letters editor
