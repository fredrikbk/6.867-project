home &amp family cranky consumer how to dump a cellphone contract we try to unload our plan online a &# carrot special to the wsj cellphone carriers dont seem to take chances with customer loyalty consumers who end a contract early typically incur a penalty of &# or more fortunately web based services now make it easier to unload a cellphone contract without taking a hit termination fees are a contentious issue particularly for cellphone users who want to leave their carriers for lower price plans or better coverage consumer groups have filed lawsuits challenging the fees while legislators in many states are considering measures to protect customers a proposed new jersey bill for example would allow consumers to cancel their contracts without penalty within the first days or if rates increase but some consumers are now avoiding early termination fees by relying on a common loophole in many cellphone contracts that allows transferring the remaining term to a third party whom the carrier approves through a credit check to test the feasibility of finding takers for a cellphone contract we hawked our phone and remaining verizon wireless contract term months on several web sites including two that specifically help users sell their contracts celltradeusa com and cellswapper com our offer included a free used samsung flip phone with features such as a camera and music player we paid &# for the device as part of a two year contract we threw in two chargers worth &# and offered a free month of service &# verizons early termination fee is &# finding volunteers to assume our contract was surprisingly easy we were out of it within five days advertising our phone on multiple sites certainly helped to maximize our chances but we did have to sweeten the deal and offer cash in some cases to drum up interest there was a significant downside too we couldnt keep our phone number since it transferred with the contract also the deal required several calls to our provider our recipient cooperated with verizons process for assuming the contract but the situation could have dragged on if he had stalled also the transfer process can vary among carriers creating additional steps we delivered the phone to our recipient in the next town saving shipping expenses auctioning our cellphone package for a penny on ebay seemed like a good idea but the web sites system prevented us from listing a used cellphone with a contract we learned that only authorized resellers of cellphone services can sell contracts on ebay even though transferring our existing contract to a winning bidder would be legal we posted our offer on craigslist www craigslist org where other users were trying to dump their contracts a person responded on the same day but then didnt reply to our messages the craigslist posting is still online and just one other person contacted us four weeks later our listing was free on celltradeusa com we created a profile that included a photo of our phone and calling plan details we didnt hear from anyone for three days so we upped the ante from a free month of service to &# cash six days later we learned someone was interested we paid a one time &# fee to access responses to our offer a small price we thought when compared with the &# termination fee users who advertise shorter contracts ranging from nine to months are generally more successful at finding a match according to eric wurtenberg chief executive of celltradeusa free listings are also available at cellswapper com but an &# service fee applies to proceed with a transfer to a web site user who is interested in the plan we upgraded our listing to the power poster feature after several days of inactivity it cost &# but heightened our visibility as a featured placement on the plans page upgrading also eliminated the &# service fee to access messages we increased our generosity to &# cash again instead of the month of service a buyer contacted us after eight days but wanted us to swap phones and plans with him a second buyer contacted us but we couldnt access her message using our mac and safari browser cellswapper com chief executive adam korbl said the company is experiencing some difficulties with mac users and is working toward a resolution our phone and contract were gone however by the time we heard from anyone through celltradeusa com and cellswapper com we met our match and two other possibilities almost instantly through the freecycle network www freecycle org an organization of thousands of local groups whose members exchange items at no cost in an effort to reduce waste we were concerned that our offer may bend the organizations rules which prohibit selling items but we reasoned that the phone chargers and month of service were free and that members could benefit from a short term cellphone contract our local moderator first said that we were ultimately asking for money we disagreed noting the contract would exist between the recipient and the cellphone company not us she allowed us to proceed a spokeswoman for the freecycle network says that members frequently give away cellphones but ours was the first situation she knew of involving a contract freecycle is mainly concerned that items be free and legal she said but local moderators interpret the national policies to best fit their group we called verizon after striking our deal to conclude the transfer our recipient then called to switch the account and authorize a credit check were ahead by &# after paying one month of service hes content with a cool phone that didnt cost a dime what a deal company web site cellswapper com www cellswapper com price free listing available with photo but &# service fee applies to proceed with transfer or pay &# for "power poster" which includes featured placement and waives the service fee our experience waited eight days for first query from buyer who wanted to swap phones and plans nine days for buyer interested in our offer without swapping but we had already transferred our phone comment we tried the free listing first for three days with no interest from users then we upgraded to "power poster" and increased our offer to include &# cash instead of a free month of service we couldnt access messages about our phone because of compatibility problems between the site and macs the company is addressing the problem says the chief executive company web site celltradeusa com www celltradeusa com price listing is free and includes photo featured placement opportunities on home page rotate among all users a &# fee applies to access messages from buyers our experience nine days one query we had already transferred our phone comment the site was easy to use and we liked the idea of a rotating featured placement that didnt cost anything it was a no risk opportunity since we didnt pay a dime until we heard from a buyer we upped our offer after three days to include &# cash instead of a free month of service company web site craigslist www craigslist org price free includes photo our experience one day one query the potential buyer must have reconsidered and did not reply to our messages we heard from someone else a month later comment we advertised under "for sale" in the "electronics" category the best fit a few other users were trying to unload their contracts on the site company web site the freecycle network www freecycle org price free we could upload a photo to our local groups yahoo groups page but did not our experience one day three queries we received two more queries a few days later comment users responded almost instantly we ultimately transferred the contract to the first person who replied
