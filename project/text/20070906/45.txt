extreme lengths why hemlines are plunging fashion week designers shun leggy lines for long skirts tired of looking like a child the fashion pendulum is swinging to extremes these days pants which were super skinny just this summer are flaring out to sail like widths this fall tent like trapeze dresses are giving way to close cut pencil skirts and now most dramatically hemlines are dropping one of the biggest themes emerging this week at new york fashion shows which are displaying styles for next spring is much longer dresses and skirts many extending to midcalf or even the ankles today badgley mischka and bill blass are scheduled to present long dresses and skirts for the spring in the following week labels including michael kors donna karan peter som nanette lepore and tracy reese are planning to show longer pieces many of which are flowing dresses meant to be worn during the day the longer looks are a big departure from the micro mini shifts and short youthful baby doll dresses that have dominated stores and runways for several seasons just this spring thigh skimming looks reminiscent of the mod s were the big trend that retailers and designers were pushing designers who pooh pooh the old stock market adage that falling hemlines presage a falling market say its only natural for the fashion pendulum to swing toward a new shape as the industry seeks to capture shoppers interest fashion has been careening from one extreme to another particularly quickly these days amid speedier clothing production and broader consumer interest in frequent updates "i think women have just said basta enough im tired of looking like a child " says mr kors who now finds longer lengths more sophisticated "theres something elegant about the new lengths without looking old fashioned " indeed skirts had gotten so short they couldnt really get any higher "when hemlines have gone as far as they can in one direction all they can do is go in the other direction " says valerie steele director of the museum at the fashion institute of technology in new york such dramatic changes drive consumers to stores says marshal cohen chief research analyst with npd group a market research firm based in port washington n y mr cohen predicts that springs new hemlines coupled with the fashion industrys overall move toward more mature formal looks could result in an increase in womens apparel retail sales next year mr cohen forecasts a rise in womenswear sales for of course designers are showing skirts in less extreme lengths too aiming to appeal to a range of customers "designers do not dictate length anymore as they once did " says carolina herrera who is maintaining skirts of several lengths in her collection bcbg showed some short skirts this season even though those skirts overall length was longer hitting slightly below the knee designers say the longer looks are a nod to the s when casual maxi and midi dresses were slightly hippie inspired the look back then often was fitted at the bust or torso with the skirt falling from the waist to the ankle or midcalf at the time the long skirts prompted protests from some consumers who complained about the loss of femininity associated with the covered up looks in time magazine ran a piece that included a comment on how the midis made "women look like tea cosies " designers say todays longer styles are more fitted around the torso and more revealing using softer fabrics that better display womens curves the new pieces are often sleeveless so they show off the arms mark badgley co designer of badgley mischka says the long day dresses he and partner james mischka are showing today "feel different and new the proportion got so short for such a long time " tracy reese is showing ankle length silk slip dresses that are designed to be casual day dresses or for wearing to the office with a cardigan thrown over and nanette lepore is showing culotte dresses and skirts that end at the midcalf the new length "feels glamorous " ms lepore says one drawback for consumers these dresses can sometimes cost more due to the amount of fabric used isabel toledo creative director of anne klein who is doing some frida kahlo inspired bohemian dresses for spring estimates that she uses five yards of fabric for ankle length dresses about double the amount she uses for skirts that end at the knee or higher a long dress could retail for about more than a short one in the same fabric she believes another disadvantage the possibility of warm weather "in spring im ready to wear something short i like something that shows my legs " says kara aubuchon a law student who lives in boston who adds that she associates ankle length dresses with "tripping " still some consumers are eager for longer lengths "im tired of seeing peoples behinds " says marianne soohoo a manhattan attorney "covering up is sometimes good " indeed max azria who designs the bcbg line says women generally feel more comfortable in longer hem lengths "during uncertain times whether personal or economic women are looking for comfort " he says "for most women this means longer pieces rather than the micro mini " some retailers already are predicting the long look will sell well ken downing fashion director and senior vice president at neiman marcus says long "patio dresses" will work well for outdoor entertaining during the summer fashionable young women have already begun wearing the new lengths "it feels fresh and chic because its a total about face in fashion " he says as for the superstition about the stock market this summers drops in value notwithstanding most in the fashion industry dont see any correlation ms steele the fashion historian says she researched the theory about years ago and found that in some cases the hemline shift actually happened seasons if not years before significant shifts in the stock market in the s for example hemlines started heading south a few years before she notes "its a total myth " she says donna karan has another theory "were not following the stock market they are following us "
