boeings faces less room for error dreamliner flight tests pushed back by months sticking to delivery date boeing co s insistence that it will deliver the first dreamliner in may as promised despite manufacturing problems that have delayed the airplanes flight testing by as much as four months puts the credibility of company officials at stake at a crucial phase of the jets launch boeing executives acknowledged yesterday that the delays had eaten into the time buffer boeing had budgeted for unexpected problems they said a newly revised schedule that calls for the first flight to occur between mid november and mid december should still allow boeing to meet its original schedule the flight was originally scheduled for august "the real issue is if we have some discovery in flight test " said mike bair the boeing vice president in charge of the development program "were rapidly running out of time to be able to deal with anything big " boeing is seeking to avoid a major slip in the s production schedule a development that could saddle it with significant costs and wreak havoc on the plans of airlines and its other customers the current snags are a far cry from the troubles airbus experienced with its a which fell two years behind schedule went well over budget and led to the ouster of executives at airbus and parent european aeronautic defence &amp space co but they illustrate the pressure boeing faces to keep its new plane on schedule shares in boeing were down eight cents at &# yesterday in p m new york stock exchange composite trading boeing has booked orders for the twin engine jetliner from customers making it the chicago aerospace companys most successful new airplane program boeing has promised that the airplane made largely of carbon plastic composites will be cheaper to operate and a third cheaper to maintain than other airplanes its size to meet the demand for the plane boeing has promised to deliver of them by the end of making any slip in the planes development potentially significant the waiting line for the plane is so long that new customers are being told they cant get delivery slots until late boeing said it is having trouble getting enough permanent fasteners to hold the first airplane together the job became more complicated in recent weeks because some of its suppliers were in such a hurry to assemble parts in time for the july unveiling of the first dreamliner that they didnt properly document their work at the same time honeywell international inc is scrambling to complete hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code that will run the airplanes flight controls a task that mr bair said both honeywell and boeing underestimated boeing commercial airplanes chief executive scott carson who joined mr bair in a regularly scheduled quarterly conference call with reporters yesterday said the delays shouldnt affect boeings financial projections even if the first deliveries slip by as much as three months boeing has shared an unusual amount of detail about the program throughout its four year development this detail has allowed analysts and others to track the program to the point that boeing has had little room to conceal problems that would otherwise be considered insignificant mr carson said yesterday that boeing believes "the whole issue of transparency is key" to the companys ability to maintain the confidence of investors and customers after the conference call most analysts generally expressed confidence that boeing officials had the issue under control although they agreed that the company has little margin for error "any more delays in the program will almost certainly delay the first delivery " said jb groh aerospace and defense analyst for d a davidson &amp co in a research note in recent months boeing has set aside nearly &# billion in additional research and development money to help cover increasing costs associated with the delays mr bair said the "hard part" of inventing new materials has gone well but the program has been tripped up by basic problems such as a lack of titanium fasteners to hold the various parts together when boeing unveiled the first dreamliner on july it was held together by thousands of temporary fasteners and was scarcely more than the outer shell of an airliner as soon as the gala celebration was over boeing rolled the plane back into the cavernous factory and removed its engines tail and the leading edges of its wings to begin the task of replacing fasteners and installing key components such as the flight deck and wiring to help ease the possibility of similar problems caused by incomplete assemblies coming from suppliers boeing has delayed the shipment of subsequent airplanes in order to give suppliers time to install items such as wiring and subsystems if the system works as planned when these parts arrive at boeings final assembly plant in everett wash they will be ready to snap together mr bair said boeing says it believes it will be able to have six airplanes available to complete the required flight testing by early next year to make up for lost time the company plans to fly each airplane as much as hours a month compared with hours a month on previous programs such as the boeing "were essentially going to be running an airline" around the clock until the testing is complete mr bair said
