a visit with peter jackson at weta his wonder factory wellington new zealand this fall peter jackson will be in pennsylvania directing "the lovely bones " his screen version of the haunting alice sebold novel that inhabits both heaven and earth for now though hes still working on preparations for the film at weta his production facility in the modest wellington suburb of miramar on a new zealand winters day of brisk breezes and heavenly sunshine i visited him at weta which was named after a giant insect endemic to this country and has been fed by giant revenues from "the lord of the rings " id been told by his people that it was to be a social visit freely translated that meant he didnt want to sit still for yet another interview or profile and understandably so translating more freely i took it to mean he also didnt want to discuss his legal disputes with new line the hollywood studio that produced the "lord of the rings" trilogy all of that was fine with me since i had no agenda apart from hearing what the reigning master of fantasy might have to say about the movie business and its foreseeable future maybe even its unforeseeable future and getting some idea of the scope of weta which has become a one of a kind cauldron of creativity as well as raw computing power id been told by other people that mr jackson was sociable and a gracious host so he proved to be as he greeted me in a quietly sumptuous office where lunch had been set out in front of a fire in a mission style fireplace he expressed concern about my state of body i was hobbling in the realm of the hobbits because id injured my leg the night before though not about my state of mind despite my mixed review of his "king kong " he spoke with easy enthusiasm of movies hed loved the original "king kong " of course the spectacular that had famously inspired him at the age of to be a filmmaker but also s hitchcock films including "vertigo " "rear window" and the color remake of "the man who knew too much " we bonded with our boundless admiration for buster keaton during a vacation drive up the coast from los angeles to washington state mr jackson reminisced hed taken his family on a detour to visit a shrine the inland oregon town where keaton had filmed "the general " when i asked him how he directed actors he replied with disarming candor "i was terrified at first i assumed that other people film school graduates and the like knew things i didnt but i dont tell the actors how to act only what their part of the whole is at a specific moment " he went beyond that though at one point in "the lord of the rings" when he was directing a scene with ian mckellen as the wizard gandalf "i wasnt making myself clear so he finally said why dont you show me what you want act it yourself " and how was the directors performance mr jackson deflected the question with a cheerful shrug his story was only about sir ians good humor and serene self confidence most actors wont countenance a director giving them a hint of a line reading let alone showing them how to act a scene every production facility has its screening rooms but weta has something special a theater that mr jackson designed to evoke the movie palaces of his childhood hacienda decor stars on the ceiling statues of women in the style of hearsts san simeon it isnt grandiose as if decreed by a latter day kubla khan but quite cozy the statuary notwithstanding a pleasure dome built by a man who retains and on a global scale shares his sense of wonder that sense seems to be the uncommon currency of all the enterprises that carry the weta name at weta workshop where the creatures miniatures chain mail and weaponry in "the lord of the rings" were designed and created mr jacksons longtime friend and one of his business partners richard taylor showed me some of the stunning and stunningly expensive collectible figures his shop was turning out he spoke of the need for a moral component in entertainment at a time when satellite tv was commercializing whole nations he mentioned a childrens tv series in production and a new venture that manufactures chain mail for world wide sale mr taylor also talked touchingly of having been a sculptor working in margarine at the time in the late s when he and peter jackson first collaborated on mr jacksons gross out puppet film "meet the feebles " at weta digital i was given a brain tingling tutorial by joe letteri the american wizard who shared an oscar for the special effects in "king kong " i thought i understood at least the rudiments of the process until i saw what went into for example the digital re creation of manhattan in the s computer programs based on historical information built whole neighborhoods of brownstone houses digital artifacts with artificial intelligence filled the streets with pedestrians and with cars that react to other cars and pedestrians according to the rules of the road in mr jacksons breakthrough feature the "heavenly creatures " a butterfly effect was achieved with a single rented workstation now the cost of running and cooling wetas thousands of processors may soon exceed the cost of buying them these days many studio films cluttered with cheesy computer generated images suggest that an obsession with digital effects will be the monster that devours the movie medium mr jackson is optimistic on this count and with reason he and his collaborators like their soul mates at pixar use computers to serve art not degrade it and he sees the studios functioning more and more as banks while becoming less and less central to the filmmaking process indeed his own facility has become such a world class attraction that no less a filmmaker than james cameron whose d spectacular "avatar" is currently shooting in los angeles will soon move his production miles south to a huge sound stage a few blocks from weta digital which will be supervising the effects in referring to "avatar " mr jackson used the term "stereo " rather than " d " when i realized that he didnt mean the sound track i joked that the next step in d projection might be banishing those familiar glasses by providing moviegoers with eye surgery it was no laughing matter for him he spoke with fascination of military experiments that involve projecting laser images directly on the retina but thats the thing about talking with peter jackson even in the course of a social visit you get the feeling anything is possible in motion pictures and that his part of the movies future is in good hands mr morgenstern is
