looking for gold in them thar trees investors rush into almonds but will they stick around as prices slip costs rise greg hostetler is a real estate developer who builds subdivisions in californias central valley but the past few years hes gone nuts to be precise mr hostetler has been building a sideline in almonds spending &# million to buy and plant acres of trees since this year he plans to shell out at least another &# million to plant an additional acres "the almond market is looking a lot better than the housing market right now " he says mr hostetler isnt the only newcomer jumping into californias almond game where orchards now stretch down the central valley from red bluff in the north to bakersfield in the south in the past few years doctors lawyers pension fund managers and pro football hall of famers among others have all snapped up farmland in the state to plant almonds as world wide demand for the nut has grown by between and and despite some concerns on the horizon many of the newer growers remain optimistic "everyone knows that almonds are a great investment " says monterey calif restaurateur dominic mercurio who has teamed with football commentator john madden to purchase nearly acres of almond orchards spending more than &# million since they bought their first acres in the late s mr mercurio says he and the former oakland raiders coach intend to buy at least another acres in the next few years while some investors have been lured to almonds because of agricultural tax breaks the recent rush has mainly been spurred by a boom in demand partly fueled by high protein diets such as atkins and south beach the industry has also assiduously marketed the cousin of the peach and the plum touting it as filling high in antioxidants that fight colon cancer and good for the heart the upshot between and the industry says annual consumption of almonds in the u s grew by more than a quarter exceeding a pound per person thats good news for californias agricultural sector since more than of the worlds almonds are grown in the state flourishing in the central valleys fertile soil and a climate similar to the mediterranean where almond trees have thrived for centuries the nut is the states biggest agricultural export ahead of wine strawberries and cotton worth more than &# billion a year overall california has acres of almonds now up from acres in according to the u s department of agriculture the department forecasts a record billion pound almond crop for up from but many of the people jumping into almonds are doing so even as prices for the nut have been sliding in farmers received &# to &# per pound of almonds now about a third of the way through the almond harvest farmers are getting &# to &# per pound in a classic agricultural cycle high crop prices resulted in a rush to plant trees leading to a market glut of nuts meanwhile almond production costs have also risen especially for the bees that pollinate the flowers and the diesel oil that fuels the machines that shake the nuts from the trees sweep them from the ground and truck them to market recent salmonella worries have also led to new rules for pasteurizing almonds with either heat or chemicals adding additional expenses for growers and processors "a lot of people are jumping on the tree nut bandwagon " says mike iliff senior appraiser for fresno madera farm credit an agricultural lender "theyll plant and grow and keep doing it until they drop the price down and satiate the market you can always depend on agriculture to stab itself in the foot " all of this has roused the ire of some longtime almond farmers who say the newcomers are driving up land values and driving down nut prices second generation farmer stuart woolf who farms in fresno and madera county says the ranch adjoining his acres is up for sale at "an inflated price " the per acre price for almond orchards in in madera county was &# to &# up from &# to &# in according to the american society of farm managers and rural appraisers though mr woolf would like to own the neighboring property himself he says "some doctor who knows nothing about farming is likely going to buy it " that makes him worry that almonds have become more about land speculation than agriculture he calls people like him who know the farming business and want to invest for the long haul "patient money " these days he says he sees a lot of "impatient money" in almonds hartley spycher planted his first almond trees in now has acres of the nuts in turlock calif and is planting additional acres this year he is less concerned about land than he is about water worrying that as more people punch wells into the ground to irrigate their orchards water will become scarce still he says its a free market "if i was years old id be more worried " says the year old almonds first landed in california with franciscan monks in the mid s aboard spanish ships bound for missions along the coast serious cultivation didnt begin until the s when pioneers planted hardier varieties deep in the states interior particularly in the central valley since the nut has had its own marketing arm called the california almond board almond farmers fund the group through a mandatory fee in the mid s the board launched international marketing efforts to increase international sales funded scientific research and succeeded in getting the food and drug administration to certify almonds as "heart healthy " at the oscars and other celebrity events the board even arranged to have the nuts tucked into vip goodie bags that rising profile of almonds helped attract the newcomers including silicon valley developer and lawyer john vidovich mr vidovich who started getting into almonds in has since become one of the states larger growers with acres of the nuts "the world needs more almonds " he says "almonds help sell other products like cereal and chocolate " mr hostetler the central valley real estate developer who is now planting more almond orchards says his &# million investment in the nut so far is "a little better than break even " but hell know more after this years harvest ends next month mr hostetler who still spends three quarters of his time in the property business says he isnt worried about the huge quantity of almonds slated to fall from the trees this season or the thousands of acres being planted with new trees this year when he drives his pickup truck out between the dusty rows of trees he says he sees nothing but bounty and profit on the horizon "almonds are like las vegas " says mr hostetler who eats almonds everyday and keeps a stash in his office "it keeps growing people keep thinking its gotten too big but still there arent enough rooms "
