do it all banks big test universal model so far weathers credit crunch remains controversial leaders of the nations biggest banks often boast that bulk and breadth are best they say their far reaching collection of businesses will insulate their profits from upheaval in financial markets better than other financial companies now those assertions are being tested at citigroup inc j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp the three biggest banks as measured by assets and market value are certainly hurting from the credit crunch that is roiling wall street that is especially true at citigroup and j p morgan which earn a large percentage of their revenue and profit from traditional wall street businesses like investment banking and debt underwriting but these so called universal banks which support massive balance sheets are also well positioned to withstand wall streets unrest for now with more than &# trillion in assets citigroup raked in &# billion in revenue last year thats more than twice the &# billion recorded by goldman sachs group inc with a far smaller &# billion in assets on its balance sheet furthermore the universal banks are still pumping out profits from operations that so far havent been hurt much by the two bugaboos of the current markets the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the lack of liquidity in debt markets these businesses include plain vanilla branch banking commercial lending to mid sized companies and credit cards "these banks rarely hit on all eight cylinders at the same time but they can make a pretty good profit on hitting on six out of the eight " says robert maneri a portfolio manager at keycorps victory capital management in cleveland those other cylinders will be particularly important to citigroup and j p morgan which are likely to be hit hard by a slowdown in the leveraged buyout boom that has fueled financial industry profits in addition to advising private equity clients in these deals the banks are among the top arrangers and packagers of loans that finance the deals if investors wont buy the loans the banks will find themselves sitting on loans that they had intended to resell still investors have been favoring these three banks over their wall street brethren whose smaller balance sheets and narrower business focus leave them fewer places to turn the three universal banks outperformed the bulk of the investment banks last month when investors began to flee the debt markets bank of america shares have risen from the end of july through yesterday and j p morgan shares rose citigroup which has been pressured by restless investors for much of the year fell that compares with a decline in the dj wilshire investment services index that index includes many wall street firms it was a tough period for the likes of goldman sachs lehman brothers holdings and bear stearns the big banks are also sporting a higher price to earnings ratio than the traditional wall street firms with citigroup trading at times projected per share earnings for j p morgan trades at times and bank of america trades at times goldman fetches a multiple of lehman has a multiple of and bear stearns has a multiple of concerned that the wall street turmoil would batter the brokerages richard bove an analyst at punk ziegel &amp co slapped a "sell" rating on bear stearns morgan stanley goldman lehman and merrill lynch in july although he also cut citigroup j p morgan and bank of america to "hold" from "buy " he remains optimistic that their commercial lending and branch banking operations can protect them from the wall street instability "the fact is that those other sources of cash flow are staggering in size and allow the banks to lose huge amounts of money in all sorts of other areas " he said todays universal bank a combination of investment banking with traditional lending operations has evolved since sanford weill created citigroup in the late s in the past few years the big banks have worked to fine tune the model both citigroup and j p morgan have sold their insurance businesses after determining that bank customers didnt want to buy policies in their neighborhood branch citigroup jettisoned its asset management business a few years ago and has bulked up its hedge fund business with the acquisition of old lane partners lp yesterday citigroup said it was essentially shutting its tribeca hedge fund and returning &# million to investors as it focuses on the larger old lane the bank said the move wasnt tied to tribecas performance j p morgan bulked up its consumer businesses in by acquiring bank one corp and bank of america has been expanding its wall street businesses but still primarily remains focused on the main street businesses of branch banking and credit cards meanwhile other financial firms are also starting to diversify once solely a credit card company capital one financial corp now offers other kinds of loans and has been working to establish a retail banking business the universal bank model remains controversial among shareholders earlier this year a number of shareholders suggested that citigroup might be better off breaking into pieces an idea that has been vehemently opposed by charles prince the banks chairman and chief executive james dimon the ceo of j p morgan frequently entertains questions from investors and analysts about whether the banks six businesses all fit together he says they do "you only find out if these models are any good when they are stress tested " says mr bove who is a fan of the financial conglomerate most recently the big banks have started to demonstrate that their diversified business models can give them flexibility to be opportunistic when their rivals are focused on managing their smaller balance sheets bank of america last month swooped in to invest &# billion into countrywide financial corp and citigroup last week scooped up pieces of foundering subprime mortgage company acc capital holdings for an undisclosed price
