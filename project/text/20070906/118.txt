the thompson effect fred thompson is scheduled today to make official whats long been obvious hes seeking the republican nomination for president his entry brings adrenaline and new competition to the race and our guess is that the ultimate nominee will be better for it the two republican front runners rudy giuliani and mitt romney have their strengths but no one in the field has emerged as a dominant candidate mr giuliani in particular has been impressive on the big issues including the war on terror and the economy he understands the consequences of premature withdrawal of u s forces from iraq to help sustain economic growth hes proposed lowering marginal tax rates and eliminating the death tax still many cultural conservatives remain skeptical of mr giulianis liberal record on gun control gay rights and abortion youtube videos of the former new york mayor in drag dont help mr thompson clearly has an opening here if he can seize it for starters hes a southern conservative in a party dominated by southern conservatives as a senator from tennessee he gained beltway experience hes got natural charisma and in standing up forcefully for scooter libby earlier this year he showed political courage in the early s mr thompson served as a u s attorney and watergate investigator and since leaving politics hes enjoyed a successful acting career which is to say that the latest addition to the gop field can plausibly present himself as an outsider at a time when the rank and file are unhappy with beltway republicans the biggest question he has to answer is why president thompson so far he hasnt provided one other than hes none of the other candidates but voters will want more than that and it would behoove mr thompson to think big in terms of campaign themes mr giuliani is not only mr but also the mayor who cleaned up a supposedly "ungovernable" city and is tough enough to take on our enemies abroad mr romney is the manager who built a company saved the olympics and can bring the same skills to washington mr thompson meanwhile has said he wants to fix a federal government "that cant seem to get the most basic responsibilities right for its citizens " true but folksy populism by itself wont be enough hell have to get more specific and that should include coming clean about his past differences with conservatives on campaign finance and tort reform the romney lesson is that trying to be all things to all republicans opens you to the charge that you lack guiding principles the rationale for a thompson candidacy may still be a work in progress but that doesnt mean his entry wont have some immediate impact theres a reason mr giuliani has welcomed him to the race with open arms while mr romney nervously joked with reporters that it would be better if mr thompson waited a few more months to declare mr thompson probably steals more of mr romneys thunder initially if only because the formers movie and television roles have made him more recognizable unlike rudy giuliani mitt romney is still introducing himself to voters a recent cbs news poll found that two thirds of gop primary voters had yet to form an opinion of the former massachusetts governor mr thompsons presence will make it that much harder for mr romney to distinguish himself as the new kid on the campaign trail press coverage of the thompson candidacy will be voluminous but media interest wont last any longer than voter interest if mr thompson doesnt use it to put forward some intriguing ideas and then show that he can defend them with conviction mr thompson will also have to demonstrate in short order that his fund raising abilities can compete with mr giulianis extensive network and mr romneys deep pockets with the public in a sour mood republicans arent likely to win unless they make the election about big themes and issues they need a reform agenda and if fred thompson doesnt stand for something beyond his persona as a television da and pickup truck populist hes not likely to go the distance see related letters "letters to the editor tonight with fred and jay" wsj september
