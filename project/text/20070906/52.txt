greeks skeptical of pension solution athens greece needs to radically restructure its pension system if it hopes to preserve its recent economic vitality but few people expect those steps to happen even though both major political parties are promising change greeces pension spending as a percentage of gross domestic product is already among the highest in the european union and is projected to experience by far the largest increase between now and of any developed country in europe the huge bill is due to a cocktail of policies that encourage early retirement and offer generous benefits while the overall system is inefficient and contributions are often evaded a committee of government appointed experts is expected to recommend sweeping changes to these practices when it announces its findings in december following general elections this month their proposals are likely to include merging the dozens of small pension funds and encouraging people to retire later than the current average retirement age of says nikos analytis chairman of the committee that will make the recommendations but few people expect the next government whoever is elected to have the political will to tackle the problem head on and implement the changes the committee will propose "political will matters more than anything else perhaps even more so than our proposals " mr analytis said in an interview "the regulatory changes in recent years were all in the right direction but were not complete we did not have the courage or political will " other european countries struggle with similar problems in italy for example the government of prime minister romano prodi has failed to get its fractious center left coalition partners to agree to changes designed to ease the governments fiscal burden and credit rating agencies say that failure could blow out the italian governments debt to unsustainable levels but greeces problems are even more severe it already has the second highest level of national debt relative to gdp in the eu after italy and its demographic structure is a ticking time bomb according to the european commission by the eu will have on average only two persons of working age for each citizen aged and older instead of four currently in greece however "in years for every pensioner there will be one worker " mr analytis says as a result the organization for economic cooperation and development predicts that greece will spend an additional of its gdp on pensions by compared with an increase of for the eu the longstanding eu member countries economists say without wide ranging overhauls greeces long term fiscal sustainability may be at risk and the country once again could start running excessive budget deficits as it did for much of the last decade only this year was the country able to exit eu special budgetary supervision after cutting its budget deficit to of gross domestic product from of gdp in since its election in march the ruling new democracy party has built its record on years of economic restructuring prime minister costas karamanlis said on aug that pension overhauls would be a priority for his government in a second term the main opposition socialist party is also promising to strengthen the social security system and boost social spending socialist leader george papandreou said friday he wouldnt raise the retirement age or cut pension benefits but will instead strengthen incentives to stay at work if elected next month but experts like george pagoulatos associate professor of politics at the athens university of economics and business say neither proposal is strong enough to make a serious dent in greeces looming pension crisis
