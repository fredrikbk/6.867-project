wonder land the toxic tower arguments have finally broken out over whether the clock has run on commemorating the events of september with year no arriving next tuesday on one side is the view that some in the "victim community" have turned it into the day that can never go away at the center of that argument are questions about the status in our culture of emotions and grief their status is very large the cost of the unbuilt memorial at the world trade center site is about &# million how can that be a large part of the answer may be discovered in the story of the old deutsche bank building which burned on aug killing two new york city firemen as is its wont new york has put most of its effort into trying to pin the blame on someone three fire department officials have been "reassigned " the demolition contractors have been teed up including a familiar big apple whiff of "mob ties " that the citizens of new york would default to suspicions of lax oversight at this high mute hulk is not surprising like the hole at ground zero it has been a six year memorial to inaction for years black mesh fabric hung down its stories the top stories seem to have gone away by magic so small are the signs of human movement around the building the building however is not inert the former deutsche bank building now officially liberty street is almost literally a beehive of activity operating under a deconstruction implementation plan mandated in by the u s environmental protection agency libertys interior has been transformed into arguably the most elaborate "abatement and deconstruction" project in the history of demolition once it was decided that the building had been irretrievably poisoned by dust from the collapse across the street of the world trade center towers in it entered a netherworld of fear defined by some familiar words asbestos dioxin pcbs the deconstruction is mostly an afterthought to neutralizing public anxieties and probably class action lawsuits indeed the detail and meticulousness of the clean up is the primary reason that since the workers inside wearing spaceman suits have dismantled only floors with the projected cost rising to an estimated &# million up from &# million this buildings problems arent malfeasance theyre hyper feasance normally the bureaucracy and politics of this morass would grind on the meter running as taxpayers foot the astronomical bill except that the story line changed dramatically on aug the drama of this ground zero building in flames on a beautiful saturday afternoon in manhattan and the tragedy of two firefighters dying inside a useless building has now created a rare opportunity to challenge the bureaucratic status quo this is the moment to ask is liberty street as dirty toxic and unsafe six years later as it was in the months after september and if it isnt why are we wasting so much money and now putting lives at risk to rid ground zero of this appalling reminder of that day the person who first sent the fires aftermath in the direction of answers to these questions was mayor mike bloomberg at his news conference on the fire he said "high rise fires almost always burn up not down as this one did we suspect that the effects of the negative air pressure system put in place as part of the containment operation pulled the fire down several floors quickly putting the base of operations on the th floor at great risk and clearly sealing stairwells gave firefighters few escape routes " negative air sealed stairwells the epa approved implementation plan of september mandated these measures and much much more such as daily decontamination chambers for the workers and the reason for it all ultimately comes down to one word asbestos the argument then and now made by epa and embraced by local community groups osha two new york city and one state regulatory agencies is that the building was adjacent to ground zero had a gash stores high and so was saturated with ground zeros toxic clouds no doubt this is true or was as part of the demolition plan the lower manhattan development corporation lmdc is obliged to monitor the air inside the building on the ground and on nearby buildings these monitoring stations take readings every hour seven days a week the results are published daily on the lmdc web site the samples measure the presence in the air of the following toxins asbestos polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins respirable particulate crystalline silica dioxins furans polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and the following metals antimony barium beryllium cadmium chromium copper lead mercury gaseous and particulate bound manganese nickel and zinc anything evil missing in that list test results effectively zero from april until now the monitoring stations have picked up virtually no measurements that exceed levels set by epa for any of these substances the cost of these tests is several hundred thousand dollars a month what this suggests is that the ambient air in and around this building is clean many other damaged buildings nearby were similarly penetrated by these clouds and theyre inhabited now so why not ratchet back the regulations to permit a more normal abatement and get this killer building out of sight in manhattan the reasons why not add up to a case study in the routine paralysis we have imposed on ourselves even as we claim to be living in a modern society as litigation and publicity inflamed public fear of asbestos and other "toxic" chemicals the relevance of science fell "air quality" has little to do with hourly measurements below scientifically safe limits the standard now is the air quality in the garden of eden one can overvalue rationality but eliminate it altogether and what fills the vacuum is expediency and for regulators and politicians expediency translates into spend the money i suspect that gov eliot spitzer who has actually walked through and seen the interior of liberty street and mayor bloomberg both know they are being taken for a &# million ride by this six year demolition job but this is new york it wouldnt be the first time
