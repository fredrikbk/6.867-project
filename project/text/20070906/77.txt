mood swing deals boom fizzles as cheap credit fades wall street mulls end of golden m&amp a era opening for foreigners the global mergers and acquisition boom that began in the greatest deal frenzy in history is winding down this summers crisis of confidence has choked off the easy credit that fueled buyouts for years abruptly altering the psychology of the deal market through june m&amp a activity as measured by total transaction values had been running at its highest annual rate ever and was on pace to generate the deepest pool of investment banking fees but within weeks the market began to run out of steam in august there were about &# billion worth of deals around the globe according to market research firm dealogic the lowest monthly total since july and a far cry from the &# billion figure struck in april and the &# billion in july "the m&amp a business has always been cyclical and a downturn is inevitable " says robert kindler vice chairman of morgan stanley while m&amp a isnt going away he says "i would not be surprised if deal volume is down to next year " the turnabout was clear on tuesday the morning after the labor day weekend typically features a wave of merger announcements this year there were no notable headlines save for a &# billion bid by wireless provider metropcs communications inc for leap wireless international inc which may or may not be consummated as one banker put it the market has gone "dead dead dead " mergers and acquisitions of course are not about to cease altogether what bankers expect is a shift to more traditional stock swap mergers between companies that see compelling reasons for joining forces still the last couple of weeks have chipped away at the confidence of a market accustomed to believing that just about any deal was in the realm of the possible wall street deal makers now say the pace size and audacity of deals struck over the past three years is unlikely to return for months maybe not for years thats likely to hit wall streeters where it hurts most annual bonuses are expected to shrink this year and layoffs are not out of the question the change is likely to reverberate well beyond wall street companies across the nation will have fewer options to buy other companies to sell themselves even to complete deals they have already struck its become nearly impossible to finance a private equity transaction of over &# billion says steven rattner head of dlj merchant banking a private equity fund the last deals boom which ended in was propelled by a rising stock market especially in the technology sector that enabled companies to use their inflated stock as currency to make bold bids for corporate icons the pinnacle of that boom was america onlines acquisition of time warner the latest boom which stretched from the end of to the middle of this summer is looking to wall streeters like the richest era since the rise of the modern deal making industry in the s from to date about &# trillion worth of deals were struck according dealogic that exceeds the total during the technology boom years of to when adjusted for inflation &# trillion of deals were struck inflation adjusted totals for the s deals boom were far lower in the most recent cycle cash rather than stock played a bigger part in the average deal what fueled it was cheaply priced credit bank loans and high yield bonds were readily available the biggest beneficiaries were private equity funds which took advantage of low interest rates and lax terms from lenders to make acquisitions more cheaply and with lower risks than corporations could in leveraged buyouts accounted for only &# of every &# spent on deals in the u s this year through july they accounted for &# of every &# earlier this year investors were suggesting huge companies such as home depot inc then worth about &# billion as candidates for leveraged buyouts "i would call it a very unusual confluence of cheap debt huge pools of money to invest and asset prices that became unattractive to most companies " says marc granetz co head of investment banking for credit suisse in new york the credit market trouble "means we arent likely to see large or very levered private equity deals for some time " already the effects are being felt in the marketplace in june shoe retailer finish line inc said it planned to pony up just &# million in cash to fund its &# billion purchase of fellow retailer genesco inc at the time credit was plentiful enough that putting down so little cash seemed acceptable to the company and its primary lender ubs ag but now that credit markets have tightened the deal isnt as easy to pull off last thursday after genesco reported weak results finish line said it was reconsidering its options when small canadian steelmaker stelco inc weighed its sale options earlier this summer a number of private equity buyers circled the company says one person familiar with the auction after the credit market turmoil hit the private equity buyers went away that paved the way for last months announcement of a &# billion acquisition by u s steel corp until the credit squeeze eases it will be difficult to fund new leveraged buyouts and even when credit markets recover private equity firms may have less flexibility and leverage over the banks that lavished financing on them during the past two years thats likely to limit options in corporate boardrooms boards had come to rely on buyout firms to supply an easy "exit" when business conditions turn bad that option will now be less available at least not at prices theyve come to expect "by definition the guaranteed minimum bid is going to be lower " says gordon dyal global head of m&amp a at goldman sachs assets and companies for which there is no corporate buyer "wont be put up for sale" until credit conditions improve he adds for companies already under private equity control which tend to carry lots of debt higher interest rates and tighter credit could make it harder to turn a profit which could lead to layoffs and cost cutting few on wall street expect a quick rebound in the credit markets but deals arent likely to dry up altogether bankers says three factors could sustain deal flow new nontraditional m&amp a players so called strategic deals between companies swapping stock and the overall health of the economy which is critical to deal making nevertheless deal volumes are unlikely to return to their mid levels the bankers say the slowdown may open a window of opportunity for new buyers in distant markets that are emerging as m&amp a powerhouses as western companies get cheaper buyers from oil rich arab nations china and india may see it as a good time to spend existing cash reserves the government investment arms in kuwait saudi arabia dubai abu dhabi and qatar combined hold an estimated &# trillion these entities arent as dependent on debt financing as are private equity firms and corporate buyers over the past few weeks these buyers have shown their strength dubai based concerns are pursuing the leading swedish stock exchange and have agreed to purchase new york department store barneys nearly of the mgm casino empire and a &# billion u s aviation services company russian natural resource firms indian technology companies and latin american conglomerates flush with cash have also emerged as bidders for u s companies but there are limits to what this pool of capital can buy in the u s limitations that are largely political congress interceded for example when a dubai based company moved to take operational control of u s ports back in ultimately scuttling the proposed deal with private equity firms on the sidelines the coast will be clear for u s corporations to pursue stock swap deals that have strategic merit thats particularly true in industries that havent experienced a big wave of buyouts such as technology and health care on tuesday metropcs made a &# billion all stock bid for leap wireless although metropcs chairman and chief executive roger linquist said it was unclear when the credit squeeze would end he shrugged it off now was the time to strike he said because radio spectrum used in his business is set to be auctioned in the months ahead "the timing seems to make sense to us and weve got the currency to do the transaction " he said prior to the credit market turmoil private equity firms often came out on top when bidding against strategic buyers in june telecommunications equipment company avaya inc agreed to be sold to two private equity firms for &# billion according to corporate filings a strategic bidder made an offer of the same size but half of it was in stock avayas board eventually chose the sale to private equity firms silver lake partners and tpg capital in part because it preferred cash over stock the bush administration has shown itself to be open to big mergers between companies in the same industry deals that might not have passed antitrust muster in the past it allowed the merger of the two largest u s hog producers for instance and permitted a series of consolidations in the telecommunications sector there is concern in the m&amp a marketplace that a new administration might take a different approach to such deals and that time is running out to announce mergers prior to the election in addition stock deals require market stability because swings in stock prices make it hard to value transactions more such deals tend to be struck in rising markets while the current stock market is not terrible the volatility over the summer could slow stock swap transactions for a while "we were at all time record highs" in m&amp a activity says paul parker head of u s m&amp a for lehman brothers holdings inc "even if it fell back a year or two in volume levels its still incredibly high relative to market levels " "its the end of the cycle " he says "we dont go through eras as much as we go through cycles "
