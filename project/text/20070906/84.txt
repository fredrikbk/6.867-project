politics &amp economics enter thompson stage right ex senator focuses on conservative image in white house bid fred thompson formally launches his white house bid today focusing less on what he wants to do than on what he will try to represent a deep voiced conservative who instills confidence and looks more like a president than the other eight candidates in short hes trying to become the conservative version of democratic candidate sen barack obama who has talked dismissively of policy plans and focused his campaign on "hope" and "change" and getting past the partisan divisions that have wracked washington for decades mr thompsons first campaign television ad scheduled for broadcast last night in the middle of yet another republican debate he was skipping centered on the slogan "security unity prosperity " the former tennessee senators midnight webcast announcement speech sounded at times straight out of the obama script ending by saying the countrys "problems will be dealt with when our leaders come together as adults and honestly seek solutions that extend past the next election cycle " but skeptics wonder as they have about the illinois democratic senator whether mr thompsons feel good sentiments will be enough because he waited longer than his rivals to enter the race mr thompsons presidential kickoff has attracted greater scrutiny than it might have a few months ago "it has to be a good speech that lays out what hes going to do as president and why people should vote for him it has to lay out what his priorities are actually going to be " said david winston a republican pollster not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns mr thompson kicks off the nonvirtual part of his presidential campaign today in des moines with a five day trip that winds through the early caucus and primary states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina he isnt expected to lay out specific policy goals instead he will introduce himself to the republican party base as a nonthreatening ronald reagan like champion of conservative values a person who can unite the party and generate grass roots excitement and draw money from suddenly tightfisted republican donors geographically mr thompsons greatest strength is likely to be the south since he is the only top tier candidate from the region that could help in south carolina and florida which have january votes mr thompsons entertainment industry connections could give him an edge in california the biggest delegate prize among the large group of states voting feb mr thompsons new campaign manager bill lacy who helped run his come from behind senate bid in brings a special expertise to navigating the complicated early january iowa caucus he is a veteran of the and presidential campaigns of former kansas sen bob dole who focused heavily on that farm state in his bids and won it both times mr thompsons tennessee roots have already helped in early fund raising as he has tapped into a large number of the states republican donors early financial reports showed much of his money coming from tennessee even before his formal announcement mr thompson had risen to second in many national polls of republican voters just behind former new york mayor rudy giuliani and rival campaigns see him as a serious threat "thompson has the potential to be the real deal " says rich bond a former chairman of the republican national committee who is supporting arizona sen john mccains presidential bid for mr thompson to succeed he must do three things mr bond says "raise money by the truckload present himself as the alternative to the front runner and play error free ball " for conservatives unsatisfied with the other candidates mr thompson represents perhaps the last best hope for something different despite nagging concerns about his late starting campaign already rocked by heavy personnel turnover his age his health he suffers from a form of lymphoma now in remission and his platform vague mr thompsons presidential ambitions appear to have been aided by his celebrity despite sporadic public appearances that have disappointed some republicans hoping he might show a little more hustle at the iowa state fair last month for example mr thompson raised some eyebrows by showing up in gucci loafers and riding around in a golf cart in new hampshire the influential union leader conservative newspaper publicly warned mr thompson that he would be seen as snubbing the state if he got into the race but didnt attend last nights debate mr thompson avoided the issue by launching his campaign today but his decision to run ads during the debate televised by fox news ran the risk of offending some new hampshire voters mr thompsons chaotic campaign which has churned through several aides in the past few months has also not turned in the sort of fund raising performance he will need to compete with deep pocket candidates like former massachusetts gov mitt romney who has already given his own campaign &# million in june mr thompsons campaign hit a setback when it reported raising just &# million significantly lower than the &# million goal his team had set yet mr thompson has shown signs of being far savvier about how the internet is changing presidential politics than some of his republican rivals which could aid in his fund raising efforts he has been a frequent contributor to conservative internet sites for months has already hired a full internet team including a staffer devoted to blog outreach and will launch his campaign today with a minute video on his web site imwithfred com several democratic candidates including new york sen hillary clinton mr obama and new mexico gov bill richardson also launched their campaigns on the internet but the republican candidates have opted for more traditional kickoffs supporters argue that the former tennessee senator didnt get into the race too late his rivals got into the race too early "an actor has a sense of when to step on stage and when not to " says rep zack wamp a tennessee congressman who helped convince mr thompson to run "in this day and age it doesnt hurt when youre a celebrity people know him and its gonna help he transcends our party " mr wamp says corrections &amp amplifications tennessee rep zach wamps first name was misspelled as zack in a politics &amp economics article yesterday on fred thompsons bid to become president wsj sept
