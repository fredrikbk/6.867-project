says beth osthimer policy director for neighborhood legal services of los angeles then they often have to wait several months before they can reapply hiring a lawyer can help ensure an accurate filing but two years ago following changes in bankruptcy laws prices increased in los angeles for example lawyer fees are as high as &# per application up from around &# plus bankruptcy lawyers may have an
