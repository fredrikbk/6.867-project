should electricity ever be de regulated jerry taylor and peter van doren "short circuited " editorial page aug wrongly attribute the failure of electric deregulation to "the legal separation of generation from transmission" that would otherwise be vertically integrated "under a single corporate umbrella " they do this by ironically claiming that "a totally free electricity market" would be "a world of deregulated vertically integrated firms" where "both firms and consumers would likely prefer long term contracts an arrangement that meets consumers interest in price protection and firms interest in cost recovery" and where "both producers and consumers would almost certainly resist spot market relationships" that the authors correctly criticize as "encouraged" by deregulation "rules " with a straight face they say this will happen just because under the "the market power of incumbent electricity providers" resulting from vertical integration "electricity consumers would be vulnerable to economic extortion" thats a caricature usually made by enemies of markets the need for price protection or cost recovery arose because as the authors say "under deregulation generators receive revenues based on the price charged by the most expensive generator whose output is necessary to meet demand in each hour " in other words market rules supported by a curious economic dogma unique to electricity have prompted too much use of spot markets where electricity is purchased that way each hour for the hour in competition against robust forward and futures markets where electricity is purchased under contract over much longer periods but messrs taylor and van doren ironically defend that curious dogma by insisting that the "while some may find such pricing to be odd it is found in all commodity markets " they contrast this to "the old regulatory regime" where "if generators costs differed they received differing revenues prices were then established by a weighted average of all producer costs " but both the authors and deregulatory officials have failed to understand that futures and forward markets actually conduct such price averaging over long periods of time vs at any given hour in time consequently the development of futures and forward markets for electricity has been neglected unlike for natural gas thats what has short circuited electric deregulation ending vertical integration had nothing to do with it robert blohm hamilton n j mr blohm is a member of the north american electric reliability council the authors outline several reasons deregulation of electricity has failed but leave hanging the question whether we should "truly deregulate" or "re regulate " true deregulation would result in deregulated monopolies the worst of all worlds for good reasons including skyrocketing prices states that deregulated are now re regulating and states that never deregulated arent going there marilyn showalter executive director power in the public interest olympia wash
