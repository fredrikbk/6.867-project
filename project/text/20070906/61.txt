intel alters chip line before amd launch intel corp overhauled its high end line of chips for server systems just ahead of the most important product launch in years for advanced micro devices inc the new models in intels xeon line are aimed at servers containing four or more microprocessors one of amds strongest niches like some existing intel products the latest xeons package two chips that each have the core circuitry of two microprocessors by contrast rival amd on monday is announcing a "quad core" version of its opteron line code named barcelona that has four calculating engines on one piece of silicon as they have in the past the two companies each cited conflicting test data pointing to the superior computing performance and low power consumption of their respective products another point of contention is whether amd whose first version of barcelona operates at a slower speed than originally expected will be able to make versions with the speeds that computer makers want in a timely fashion "there is a question about what is available at what time " said james mouton a senior vice president at hewlett packard co which yesterday began selling servers based on intels new chip and also intends to use amds barcelona but randy allen corporate vice president and general manager of amds server and workstation division said it began manufacturing and shipping the chip to computer makers in august he said systems using barcelona should be available this month and the company will boost production of faster models "we expect to be able to fulfill the demand " he said intel of santa clara calif fell behind amds performance from to but counterattacked a year ago with a microprocessor design it has gradually deployed across a range of products its new model formally called xeon and previously code named tigerton extends that design to servers that can use four or more chips tom kilroy an intel vice president who jointly runs the companys digital enterprise group said systems based on the chip are ideal for running jobs like large databases and business programs such as those sold by sap ag the company also has another weapon to counter barcelona in the fourth quarter a chip called penryn that uses a new manufacturing process to improve the performance of its existing design "we feel very comfortable and confident " mr kilroy said the xeon models range in price from &# to &# based on factors such as operating frequency and power consumption
