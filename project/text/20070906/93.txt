seagate to offer encrypted drives product has special chips to make data unreadable if a desktop pc is stolen disk drive makers have long bragged about the amount of data they can store now they are racing to protect that information too seagate technology of scotts valley calif today is introducing drives for desktop personal computers that use special chips to encrypt information to make it unreadable if a computer equipped with the devices falls into the wrong hands companies more commonly rely on software to encrypt data government agencies have long preferred hardware to carry out data scrambling chores because it is harder to attack by unscrupulous programmers seagate isnt alone rivals such as hitachi ltd and fujitsu ltd have announced drives with various forms of encryption microsoft corp also is promoting a feature called bitlocker in some versions of its windows operating system that can encrypt drives while some pc users encrypt their email to safeguard the contents against interception the moves reflect a widening recognition that data are often exposed to greater risk when they are at rest in a computer particularly when a laptop goes missing consequently the first encrypted drives were targeted at portable pcs with the new product it calls barracuda fde however seagate is extending the capability to drives for desktop systems responding to concerns that those machines also can be stolen the product with a capacity of as much as a trillion bytes uses the same strength of encryption used by government agencies said marc jourlait a seagate vice president of global marketing seagate chief executive officer bill watkins has been pointing out the link between encryption and drive technology in discussions with u s policy makers in washington he said most of seagates competition already is in asia western digital corp is the other major remaining u s drive maker and sees risks to national security if a chinese company were to purchase a u s company to secure a domestic drive supplier seagate said it hasnt been approached by a foreign suitor but mr watkins suggested that u s officials might get worried if government information were held in an encrypted drive designed outside the u s "what is going to happen as people think about the technology and who holds the key to this " he asked another advantage of chip based encryption seagate said comes when a computer is transferred to another user ordinarily disks must be overwritten as many as seven times to ensure data cant be retrieved when data are encrypted however a company can destroy the password needed to decode the data and then reformat the drive a much faster process said mr jourlait jon oltsik an analyst at enterprise strategy group predicted that seagate and other suppliers will eventually make chip based encryption a standard feature in most of their products saving the labor of installing software for that function seagate expects the barracuda fde drive to go on sale in the fourth quarter pricing hasnt been disclosed the company today is announcing other products that include maxtor branded drives that offer a weaker form of chip based encryption as well as encryption software those drives also come with a feature called safetydrill that can revive a pc if the operating system has crashed or become corrupted
