new t mobile phones use wi fi networks that save on minutes critics of the current u s wireless phone system have long advocated for a single phone that could make calls over a variety of wireless networks without requiring users to jump through hoops well one of the american phone carriers t mobile usa has taken a step toward that ideal its offering inexpensive phones that can make voice calls over either the companys regular cell network or almost any wi fi wireless network including those inside your homes open password free networks outside your home and t mobiles system of u s wi fi hot spots in places like starbucks shops these phones can switch seamlessly between wi fi and t mobiles regular cellphone network even in the middle of a call without dropping it so you can just keep talking as you move in and out of wi fi range for instance you can start a phone call at work over wi fi then get in a cab and the call will automatically switch to the t mobile cellular network the process also works in reverse even better calls conducted over wi fi or calls that merely begin on wi fi and then switch to the cellphone network in the middle arent counted against your monthly allotment of minutes no matter how long they use the cellphone network alas it works the other way as well calls begun on the cellphone network do consume minutes even if they switch in the middle to wi fi other cellphones have this built in wi fi including apples famed iphone but in these phones the wi fi is intended primarily for data use internet or email not voice calls ive been testing t mobiles new system called hotspot home with a &# nokia flip phone and it works pretty well i was able to start or finish calls at my home with my existing wi fi setup and use an optional wireless router t mobile offers the system also worked in several starbucks in different cities and in several commercial locations with open wi fi service in general my test calls switched seamlessly between the wi fi and cellphone networks and call quality was good but in a couple of cases the calls broke up or were dropped of course this cool new setup isnt free hotspot home is an add on feature to a regular t mobile calling plan through sept it costs &# a month for a single line and &# for a family plan that covers up to five lines if you sign up by then you keep those introductory rates ever after as of sept the monthly fees increase to &# for a solo line and &# for the family plan these are flat fees that dont vary by how much calling you do there are downsides the only phones available now the nokia and a samsung are very basic &# ones with a two year contract however t mobile expects to offer more phones in a few weeks it will sell a modified version of a sophisticated smart phone the company refuses to identify the phone but web rumor sites suggest its a new version of the blackberry curve with wi fi built in another downside the first two phones dont work with wi fi networks that require log in screens other than t mobiles so you cant use other providers networks in hotels airports and similar places the phones lack decent web browsers and t mobile has automated access only to its own hot spots future smart phones with better web browsers should overcome this limitation but you might have to pay usage fees to the owners of non t mobile networks also the phones dont automatically connect to newly encountered wi fi networks so it takes time to go through the steps necessary to set up the new networks they do automatically connect to networks used before that youve saved also making calls over wi fi takes more battery life talk time on these first phones using the power hungry technology is only two thirds what it is on a regular cell network finally the flat rate fee for unlimited wi fi calls covers calls only to u s phones and doesnt work from t mobile hot spots overseas still if you have lousy cellphone coverage at home or your office or tend to use a lot of monthly minutes and you have access to wi fi the new hotspot home could be a promising option email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
