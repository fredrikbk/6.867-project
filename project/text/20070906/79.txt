new way to count listeners shakes up radio arbitrons electronic meters beat diaries for accuracy philly stations cut ad rates philadelphia radio listeners started hearing less marc anthony and more modest mouse in may when wrff flipped to alternative rock from a spanish language format called rumba the clear channel communications inc station made the change after a new electronic method of measuring radio audiences showed rock music is more popular in philadelphia than older diary based measurements had indicated the switch shows how much power the new ratings system may have to shake up radio for years arbitron inc has measured radio ratings based on paper diaries filled out by listeners but its now in the early stages of moving to a new electronic system called the portable people meter already in use in philadelphia and houston the system will be rolled out more widely soon the people meter a pager sized device that automatically registers what radio station survey participants are listening to is already yielding more specific and in some cases surprising data the results from the first two markets indicate that people flip among stations more frequently than they say that men listen to significantly more radio than women and that employed people listen a lot more than people who dont work while the diary system pointed to some of these findings it typically missed how broad they are in the markets that have switched to the electronic ratings rock and classic rock rank higher than before while hip hop and other urban music generally dont stack up as well perhaps most important radio stations typically pull in a bigger audience than they thought but that audience spends less time listening to them new york will begin using the electronic measurements in october followed by los angeles and chicago early next year by the end of the system is expected to be in use in all of the top markets arbitron cites several reasons for the differences in the two systems findings first the sample size used for the people meter dwarfs that used for the diaries in philadelphia about people reported results during any given day under the diary system compared with a goal of about for the people meter the company also says people who record in diaries tend to report their habitual behavior listing shows they often listen to for example rather than their actual behavior thus a diary participant who said he or she listened to rush limbaugh every day might now be found by the people meter to change stations more than the diary showed another insight is the role that appealing to employed people who tend to listen to a lot of radio while commuting or on the job can play in boosting a stations ratings in philadelphia and houston where men make up a sizable majority of the work force in key age groups rock stations are ranked higher than they were using the diary system that situation wont necessarily be replicated in cities where women make up a bigger chunk of the work force though "were going to see very different results based on the makeup of the market " says arbitrons john snyder vice president for people meter implementation some groups arent tracking well under the people meter particularly younger people who often forget to carry it and because african americans tend to listen to more radio than most other groups and because more listening hours lead to more rounding up in the diaries the more accurate people meters are hitting the rankings of some urban stations the national association of black owned broadcasters is putting pressure on arbitron to improve the measurement of young urban listeners arbitron says its working with the group to address the issue noting that finding enough young listeners was also a challenge with the diaries the situation isnt unlike what happened when nielsen introduced its own people meter to measure local television viewing a few years ago the nielsen and arbitron devices work very differently despite the shared name television companies such as news corp s fox were incensed that the rankings for some of their minority oriented shows had declined lower radio ratings are already hitting stations in their pocketbooks mary meder president of advertising buyer harmelin media inc in bala cynwyd pa says some stations have already been forced to cut rates because of their decline in the rankings some radio advertisers are holding back from buying more ads in philadelphia until they see what happens with rates in the new york market when the people meter rolls out there but ms meder says that many stations will ultimately be able to raise rates simply because advertisers trust the electronic ratings far more than the diary based ones "we think its a positive thing for radio in the long run " she says ms meder saw a similar pattern play out in rates when nielsen started measuring the philadelphia television market electronically in "radio is now on the same level playing field as top tv stations and the philadelphia inquirer " says john fullam philadelphia market manager for greater media inc his classic rock station wmgk rose to no among year olds when the people meter was used up from no "its really given us an opportunity to go visit with some advertisers weve not been doing business with before " he says some events may end up commanding considerably higher rates than they do now for example while the diary system showed that cbs corp s wpht am won more listeners during baseball season when it aired phillies games it seems to have underreported the spike the diaries showed the station had an average of weekly listeners during baseball season the people meter shows the number is closer to the meter also shows a level of detail the diaries couldnt match such as the fact that daytime games get about more radio listeners than nighttime ones when fans typically prefer to watch them on television potentially these tidbits could affect rates for advertising spots for phillies games the spots are mostly sold by the team which doesnt yet subscribe to arbitron data rob macpherson director of corporate partnerships for the phillies says rates have moved higher already but it is more a function of the teams strong season than results for the people meter the team is working on cutting a deal with arbitron so it can tout the data to prospective advertisers in time for next years season previously "the emotionalism is what drove advertisers to the game broadcasts " says mason meyer manager of custom research at arbitron "now you have the information "
