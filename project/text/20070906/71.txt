mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q on two different new computers ive created word files and theyre automatically saved with the extension " docx " what is that when i send these files via email no one can open them can you shed some light a in the version of microsoft office for windows which you appear to have on your two new pcs microsoft introduced new default file formats whose extensions end in the letter "x" the one for word is "docx " for excel its "xlsx" and for powerpoint its "pptx " you are using word and all of your files are thus automatically being saved in the "docx" format your correspondents cant open these files because they are using older versions of office that dont recognize the new formats microsoft has made available a free auto conversion patch for the older windows office versions but most people dont have this patch it can be found at microsoft com downloads under "microsoft office compatibility pack for word excel and powerpoint file formats " theres also a kludgy free stand alone converter from microsoft for the mac versions of word and powerpoint available at microsoft com mac under the name "microsoft office open xml file format converter for mac " unless you can persuade all of your correspondents to install these workarounds i suggest you change a setting in word so that henceforth all of your files will be saved in the traditional "doc" format that familiar format isnt only compatible with older versions of microsoft office but with many other programs on both windows and the macintosh to make the change first click on the round "office button" at the top left of word then at the lower right of the window that appears click on "word options " in the next screen that comes up click on "save" in the column at the left in the panel that appears at the right youll notice an option called "save files in this format " with a drop down list of choices next to it display the list of choices by clicking on the arrow and select "word document doc " then click ok at the bottom of the window microsoft warns that some new features in word wont translate into the old format but i believe that this will prove irrelevant in of cases and is outweighed in any case by the incompatibility you have run into q how can i transfer all my outlook contacts from a windows pc to a macintosh contacts program a there are a number of methods you can use a pda or smart phone that can synchronize the contacts with a mac after having first synchronized with outlook on your pc or you can use a &# program called om which is specifically designed to move outlook data to a variety of mac programs it can be downloaded at littlemachines com or you could get apple to do it the company offers a basic file transfer for free if you buy the mac from an apple retail store but if you want apple to move outlook contacts in just the way you want you may have to purchase the companys &# a year procare service which comes with a more complete transfer service q i recently replaced an old windows xp computer that was running very slowly i want to continue to use it as the computer for our young kids and i was thinking that if i format the hard drive and reinstall xp which i bought to upgrade the machine a while back it will probably improve its performance do you agree and can i reinstall my copy of xp when i have already "activated" the software when i originally installed it a i do agree that the computer will likely run faster after you wipe the hard drive and reinstall windows that is the usual outcome and it should be possible to use it legally as long as you havent made any major changes to the hardware since microsofts activation system typically allows windows to be reinstalled on the same machine if activation fails you can call microsoft and explain that its the same machine and the company says it will usually ok activation in such cases you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online for free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
