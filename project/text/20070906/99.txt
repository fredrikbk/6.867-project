seeking a niche companies try new web to tv technologies like many chinese immigrants to the u s yan chen uses the internet to watch chinese tv programs but unlike many she watches them on her television not her computer screen ms chen an accountant in west new york n j who moved to the u s four years ago subscribes to kylintv one of a new breed of companies trying to build businesses by sending movies tv shows and videos available on the internet directly to television sets for &# a month she gets chinese tv channels which are piped to her tv through a special set top box that connects to her broadband cable "i used to buy dvds when i was visiting home " says ms chen "now i can watch live chinese tv programs sitting in my living room " the technology company behind kylintv is neulion inc a plainview n y start up that sells a new streaming video technology it enables kylintv and other companies to deliver programming via the internet to the tv sets of small but passionate audiences for topics such as cuban baseball religious programming and television shows in africa since videos showed up on the internet in the late s technology companies have looked for ways to turn the web into a new form of distribution for conventional television allowing programmers to pipe movies and tv shows directly to consumers without having to go through cable or satellite tv middlemen most attempts at doing this have fizzled proving unable to compete with traditional television programming but interest is still rising as the quality and quantity of internet video grows some companies are rolling out products they hope will overcome consumers resistance to multiplying set top boxes and complicated connections sony corp this year began shipping bravia televisions that can be fitted with &# plug in modules that grab select content off the internet apple inc introduced apple tv a device that wirelessly connects itunes music and movies from a computer to a television hewlett packard co recently began selling its second generation of "media smart" televisions with built in software to pull videos music and photos off computers the two largest manufacturers of set top boxes for cable and telephone operators motorola inc and cisco systems inc s scientific atlanta division are working on a new generation of boxes that will do double duty taking content off the web and from traditional sources but many technology companies have found delivering quality pictures to tv sets via the internet isnt necessarily a formula for success "theres been so much road kill trying to make the tv behave like the pc " says ashwin navin president of san francisco based bittorrent inc which provides software used in sharing videos on the web kylintv founded by charles wang and charles dolan uses a technology that can deliver programs in a stream over slow household bandwidths rather than as a download "were delivering a television experience over the public internet "

the company based in islandia n y accused mr wang of participating in fraudulent accounting during the s and s he denies the charges kylintvs technology comes from neulion which is financially backed by mr wang and run by his wife nancy li cas former chief technology officer ms li left ca in the wake of a power struggle in and founded neulion around that time mr wang decided to invest in an internet video technology being developed by four students at peking university it allowed video files to be transmitted at lower bandwidths without sacrificing picture quality seeking a use for it mr wang looked up mr dolan his longtime friend and neighbor in oyster bay n y who is also the chairman and founder of cablevision systems corp after seeing a demonstration mr dolan agreed to invest in kylintv the first company to use neulions technology mr dolan declined to comment through a spokesman messrs dolan and wang decided kylintv would provide chinese programming mr wang and ms li natives of china and taiwan respectively knew there was demand among the four million chinese living in north america "our parents used to complain there were no good chinese programs to watch " ms li says obtaining rights to chinese tv wasnt easy but things improved after kylintv hired a chinese company run media inc to act as an intermediary in kylintv was able to sign contracts with more than two dozen chinese channels neulions strategy is to spread the cost of the technology among the niche programmers that use it that cuts the cost for neulions customers so they dont need many subscribers to make a profit kylintv whose around subscribers pay an average of &# a month will break even once it hits subscribers says chris wagner a neulion executive vice president "its a lot cheaper than starting your own cable company " he says kylintv plans to start selling advertising toward the end of the year some television service companies now use neulions technology including africast global media inc showing tv from africa abs cbn global ltd showing tv from the philippines and schorr partners which has acquired the rights to cuban baseball games one of neulions latest deals was with dominion video satellite inc which for a decade has sold a christian oriented satellite tv service that about households pay &# a month to receive later this year dominion will begin transmitting to tv sets over the internet instead using neulion boxes neulion markets its technology at cable and satellite tv trade shows it also identifies owners of niche content like ethnic tv or sports that have small but avid followings "we send them a box " mr wagner says "all they need is an internet connection and they can hook it up in their office thats how it starts we have tests going in italy turkey all over the place " the company recently announced a deal with the national hockey league but the nhl is using neulion technology to make its games and other content available only on the web league officials say they dont want to antagonize cable and satellite tv companies that pay to broadcast hockey games and dont want the competition
