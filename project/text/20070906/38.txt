download this youtube phenom has a big secret singer marie digby isnt quite what she appears make people like me a year old singer and guitarist named marie digby has been hailed as proof that the internet is transforming the world of entertainment what her legions of fans dont realize however is that ms digbys career demonstrates something else that traditional media conglomerates are going to new lengths to take advantage of the internets ability to generate word of mouth buzz ms digbys simple homemade music videos of her performing popular songs have been viewed more than million times on youtube her acoustic guitar rendition of the r&amp b hit "umbrella" has been featured on mtvs program "the hills" and is played regularly on radio stations in los angeles sacramento and portland ore capping the frenzy a press release last week from walt disney co s hollywood records label declared "breakthrough youtube phenomenon marie digby signs with hollywood records " what the release failed to mention is that hollywood records signed ms digby in months before she became a youtube phenomenon hollywood records helped devise her internet strategy consulted with her on the type of songs she chose to post and distributed a high quality studio recording of "umbrella" to itunes and radio stations in an aug blog posting on her myspace page ms digby wrote "i never in a million years thought that doing my little video of umbrella in my living room would lead to this tv shows itunes etc " ms digbys myspace and youtube pages dont mention hollywood records until last week a box marked "type of label" on her myspace music page said "none " after inquiries from the wall street journal the entry was changed to "major " though the label still is not named the artist and her label say theres nothing untoward about the campaign in interviews ms digby and executives at the company describe her three month string of successes as part of a lengthy process of laying the groundwork for the upcoming release of her debut album ms digby says she doesnt mention her record label on her web sites because "i didnt feel like it was something that was going to make people like me " ms digby certainly isnt the first professional to feign amateur status on youtube last year "lonelygirl" was revealed to be a year old actress working with filmmakers represented by the creative artists agency the fact that a big company supported ms digbys ruse reflects how dearly media giants want in on the viral revolution thats changing how young consumers learn about new entertainment even if it means a tiny bit of sleight of hand it also reflects how difficult it is for new recording artists to get noticed now that young fans are paying more attention to web sites such as google inc s youtube and news corp s myspace than to traditional media like commercial radio "there are significant challenges in breaking new artists now but there are also amazing opportunities " says ken bunt hollywood records senior vice president for marketing who helped devise ms digbys campaign "people get so mired in the difficulties they dont say what opportunities does online present this is a great example of an opportunity " though all involved say that hollywood records role in her online rise has been limited label executives say they did nothing to discourage ms digby from conveying the impression that she had stumbled into the spotlight ms digby says she chose the songs hollywood records bought the apple inc laptop computer and software that ms digby who lives with her parents in los angeless upscale brentwood neighborhood used to post her youtube videos her version of "umbrella" that is being sold at apples itunes store is a high quality studio recording made in june by hollywood records which also made it available to radio stations ms digby whose exotic looks reflect her japanese and irish heritage began writing songs as a high school student and set off in search of a music career during her freshman year at the university of california berkeley she says she found herself flying back to los angeles almost every week to play solo gigs at open microphone nights at clubs at age she left berkeley and concentrated full time on music while ms digby won regular bookings at nightclubs things didnt begin to click until a chance encounter with barry krost a music manager whose past clients have included cat stevens he took her on as a client and in early secured her a publishing deal with rondor music a publisher that is part of vivendi sas universal music group in late ron moss rondors executive vice president connected ms digby to a hollywood records executive named allison hamamura who was immediately taken with the singer before the year was out hollywood records had signed ms digby since then the label has worked with the singer on her debut album of original songs the album was produced by tom rothrock who also recorded a recent hit record by british singer james blunt once the album was completed late last year ms digby and her label began looking for ways to gain visibility "i was coming out of nowhere " ms digby says "i wanted to find a way to get some exposure " thats when the idea of posting simple videos of cover songs came up "no ones going to be searching for marie digby because no one knows who she is " mr bunt the hollywood records senior vice president reasoned so she posted covers of hits by nelly furtado and maroon among others so that users searching for those artists songs would stumble on hers instead her version of rihannas "umbrella" proved a nearly instant hit as ms digbys star rose other media outlets played along when los angeles adult contemporary station kysr fm which calls itself "star " interviewed ms digby in july she and the disc jockey discussed her surprising success "we kind of found her on youtube " the dj known as valentine said playing the lucky nobody ms digby said "im usually the listener calling in you know just hoping that im going to be the one to get that last ticket to the star lounge with pop star john mayer " the stations programming executives now acknowledge they had booked ms digbys appearance through hollywood records and were soon collaborating with the label to sell "umbrella" as a single on itunes "we did discover this artist through youtube " says kysr program director charese fruge the dj couldnt be reached for comment "i dont think we need a television show to find talent in america " crowed nbc late night talk show host carson daly introducing a performance by ms digby last month "we have the internet " mr dalys music booker diana miller says she booked the singer through hollywood records public relations department at the shows taping ms digby gave a backstage interview that was posted online by nbc "i just did this youtube video two months ago and never ever imagined that it would actually get me on tv or radio or anything like that " she said "i just did it in my living room and it blew up first on youtube and then i guess it got to star and then carson daly found me so thats why im here " most of ms digbys new fans seem pleased to believe that they discovered an underground sensation a youtube user posting a message in response to a cover of linkin parks "what ive done" wrote "you truely have talent get urself out there if u really wanted im positive u could land some sick record deals id buy a cd sure " at a concert last week at a los angeles nightclub called the hotel cafe ms digby played to a sold out crowd of young fans even with the clubs handful of tables reserved for hollywood records executives and their guests ms digby continued to play the ingenue introducing "umbrella " ms digby told the audience "i just turned on my little imovie and here i am "
