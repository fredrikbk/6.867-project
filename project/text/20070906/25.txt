counterinsurgency comeback events have vindicated the claims of those who argued that president bushs "surge" strategy in iraq could work security the sine qua non for ultimate success has improved this is especially true in anbar and other sunni dominated provinces where the sunni sheiks who may have previously supported al qaeda have concluded that the americans are now the "strongest tribe" in the region and have turned against their erstwhile allies this is an important development of course success also depends on the actions of the u s congress and the behavior of the iraqi government but the military element is important advocates of the surge argued that militarily success would depend less on the number of u s troops in iraq than on how they were used under gen david petraeus they have been used correctly to conduct effective counterinsurgency operations what perhaps is not fully appreciated is the significant cultural change that his approach represents some years ago the late carl builder of rand wrote a book called "the masks of war " in which he demonstrated the importance of the organizational cultures of the various military services his point was that each service possesses a preferred way of fighting that is not easily changed since the s the culture of the u s army has emphasized "big wars " but this has not always been the case throughout the th century the u s army was a constabulary force that with the exception of the mexican and civil wars specialized in irregular warfare most of this constabulary work was domestic the indian wars representing the most important case but the u s army also successfully executed constabulary operations in the philippines after the spanish american war which involved both nation building and counterinsurgency the seeds of a conceptual transformation of the army were sown after the civil war by emory upton an innovative officer with an outstanding civil war record graduating from west point in he was a brevet brigadier general by the end of the war he later became a protege of william tecumseh sherman and when sherman became general in chief of the army he sent upton around the world as a military observer upton believed the constabulary focus was outdated he was especially impressed by prussias ability to conduct war against the armies of other military powers and its emphasis on professionalism certainly prussias overwhelming successes against denmark austria and france in the wars of german unification made the prussian army the new exemplar of military excellence in europe upon his return to the u s upton proposed a number of radical reforms including abandoning the citizen soldier model and relying on professional soldiers reducing civilian interference in military affairs and abandoning the emphasis on the constabulary operations in favor of preparing for a conflict with a potential foreign enemy given the tenor of the time all of his proposals were rejected in ill health upton resigned from the army and in committed suicide but the triumph in the u s of progressivism a political program that placed a great deal of reliance on scientific expertise and professionalism the closing of the western frontier and the problems associated with mobilizing for and fighting the spanish american war made uptons proposed reforms more attractive especially to the armys officer corps in secretary of war elihu root published uptons "military policy of the united states " while many of uptons more radical proposals remained unacceptable to republican america the idea of reorienting the army away from constabulary duties to a mission focused on defeating the conventional forces of other states caught on while the army returned to constabulary duties after world war i uptons spirit now permeated the professional army culture world war ii vindicated uptons vision and his view continued to govern u s army thinking throughout the cold war it is still dominant in the army today with the possible exception of its small and elite special forces the american army that entered iraq in was still emory uptons army but gen petraeuss strategic adjustment suggests that the army might be undergoing a significant cultural change focused as it has been on state versus state warfare uptons army has not cared much for counterinsurgency this is illustrated by vietnam especially during the tenure of gen william westmoreland as commander of u s troops from to westmorelands operational strategy emphasized the attrition of the forces of the peoples army of vietnam pavn forces in a "war of the big battalions" multi battalion and sometimes even multi division sweeps intended to find and destroy the enemy with superior firepower in so doing he emphasized the destruction of enemy forces instead of controlling key areas in order to protect the south vietnamese population unfortunately such search and destroy operations were often unsuccessful since the enemy could usually avoid battle unless it was advantageous for him to accept it but they were costly both to the american soldiers who conducted them and the vietnamese civilians who were in the area in addition gen westmoreland ignored the insurgency and pushed the south vietnamese aside the marine approach in vietnam was different it was based on the corps experiences stabilizing governments and combating guerrilla forces in the caribbean during the early th century this experience was distilled in marine corps schools lectures beginning in and was the basis of the "small wars manual" published in this approach comprised three elements pacifying the coastal areas in which of the people lived degrading the ability of the north vietnamese to fight by cutting off supplies before they left northern ports of entry and engaging pavn and viet cong main force units on terms favorable to american forces gen westmoreland focused on the third element at the expense of the other two westmoreland was critical of the marine corps approach which unlike his own took counterinsurgency seriously he believed as he wrote in his memoir that the marines "should have been trying to find the enemys main forces and bring them to battle thereby putting them on the run and reducing the threat they posed to the population " when gen creighton abrams replaced gen westmoreland as overall u s commander shortly after the tet offensive he adopted a new approach one similar to that of the marines that came close to winning the war he emphasized protection of the south vietnamese population by controlling key areas rather than the destruction of enemy forces per se he then concentrated on attacking the enemys pre positioned supplies which disrupted pavn offensive timetables and bought more time for vietnamization finally rather than ignoring the insurgency and pushing the south vietnamese aside as gen westmoreland had done gen abrams followed a policy of "one war " integrating all aspects of the struggle against the communists but despite an improved security situation from to congress ended support for south vietnam saigon fell and the army badly hurt by the war concluded that it should avoid such irregular conflicts in the future in the s the army discarded what doctrine for small wars and counterinsurgency it had developed in vietnam choosing to focus on big wars but iraq proves that we dont always get to fight the wars we want while the army must continue to plan to fight conventional wars given the likelihood that future adversaries will seek to avoid our conventional advantage it must be able to fight irregular wars as well gen petraeuss success in iraq so far indicates that the army has begun the necessary transformation let us hope that the army will internalize these lessons something emory uptons army has not done in the past mr owens is professor of national security affairs at the naval war college in newport rhode island he is writing a history of american civil military relations
