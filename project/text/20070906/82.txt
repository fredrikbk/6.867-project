pentagon updates iraq operations budget washington the pentagon is updating its budget for operations in iraq next year anticipating a partial drawdown of u s forces there even as billions of dollars would go to buy heavily armored vehicles to protect the troops who remain the new funding request wont be completed until after the iraq commander gen david petraeus reports to congress next week on the situation in iraq but the numbers shed light on the cost and personnel pressures facing him as well as pentagon decision makers the services are asking for more than &# billion on top of the &# billion already requested by the white house for military operations in both iraq and afghanistan in the new fiscal year which begins oct the army which submitted new requests of about &# billion would receive the greatest share to help sustain current troop levels and operations through at least the end of the calendar year but the cost calculations assume that the brigade force level in iraq wont be maintained through calendar and that a drawdown of about troops will begin by next spring the working assumption is that the five brigades added this year as part of president bushs "surge" strategy wont be replaced as they finish their month deployments beginning around march "people here are prepared to fall on their swords" rather than require that tours be extended to or months to maintain the current force level of about troops said one pentagon official "any discussion of changes in troop levels is premature " lt col todd vician a pentagon spokesman said in an email note responding to questions about the budget request but gen petraeus himself has suggested he is open to some reduction in private discussions this summer he signaled that he hoped to draw down troop levels next spring and in an abc news interview tuesday he said "the surge will run its course there are limits to what our military can provide " at the same time the draft request would greatly speed funding for armored vehicles to protect troops from mines and roadside ambushes an additional &# billion request is being considered on top of recent appropriations and budget amendments totaling nearly &# billion for and the numbers underscore the pressure to pump up procurement of the heavily armored mrap mine resistant ambush protected vehicles but the huge costs worry many in congress "people say what is happening here " said sen daniel inouye d hawaii who oversees the senate defense appropriations panel more broadly the new war funding request will pose a major challenge for democrats as they wrestle with president bush on two fronts this fall iraq policy and domestic spending mr bush has leveled multiple veto threats vowing to roll back &# billion added by democrats to annual spending bills but given the much larger costs of the war the democratic leadership hopes some deal can be reached congress is likely to test mr bushs resolve by sending him a series of packages combining three or four bills at a time for example a popular veterans health care bill slated to clear the senate is a likely engine to pull several others and there is strong pressure to do the same with a &# billion pentagon bill covering core defense operations separate from wars overseas the house largely sidestepped the iraq debate when it approved its version of the pentagon budget bill before the august recess mr inouye hopes to do the same in the senate though he said he may add &# billion in mrap funds to ease passage but there seems little hope of a final budget deal before thanksgiving and much of the government will have to operate after oct under a stopgap funding resolution a big question for democrats will be whether they can agree to attach a "bridge fund" of sorts to cover war costs as they debate the presidents new request in the same period but both mr inouye and rep john murtha d pa who will manage the war request in the house have signaled that any new funding for is likely to be approved in three to four month increments to keep the pressure on the administration for a change in policy
