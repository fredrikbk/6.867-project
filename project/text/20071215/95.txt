store and immediately understand where they belong " says mr beccari "he doesnt like to look for things he wants to make a choice rapidly not take half an hour " in the retail business the area just to the right of a store entrance is prime real estate because most shoppers regardless of their gender turn right when they walk in a store says britt beemer chairman of americas research group a consumer behavior research and strategic marketing firm in charleston s c following this logic harry winston says it is prominently displaying its new mens jewelry collection in that spot tiffanys expanded mens jewelry line can be found just to the right of the entrance to its new wall street store placing mens goods in this prime location is especially important for stores trying to appeal to men because they tend to be more purposeful shoppers than women says mr beemer hermes is changing the way it groups mens products in its stores putting all of the items together rather than separating some by category so mens watches on display for instance would no longer be mixed with womens watches the brands still face some high hurdles ed repansky who works in advertising in baltimore says he isnt interested in checking out the mens selection at louis vuitton he associates the label "with a girl wanting a louis vuitton bag "
