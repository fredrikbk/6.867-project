olympics two million people are expected to visit china countless more watching the competition on television may begin entertaining thoughts of visiting the middle kingdom several travel books have arrived that might serve as useful primers "the seventy wonders of china" thames &amp hudson pages &# tries mightily to cover the sprawling country deploying contributors to explore a wide sampling of chinas history culture and even wildlife editor jonathan fenby has divided the book into seven sections including "natural wonders" the gobi desert the yellow river "monuments &amp buildings" buddhist cliff carvings the ming tombs northwest of beijing and "people &amp life " in this last section the category "food &amp alcoholic drinks" might not exactly rival the forbidden city for wondrousness its comparatively xiao chi or little eats but its savory all the same with so much ground to cover in "the seventy wonders of china " each entry is discussed in a strictly introductory way even the great wall is afforded only five pages anyone wanting to learn more about that particular wonder would be well advised to consult "the great wall from beginning to end" sterling pages &# michael yamashita spent a year traveling along and photographing the series of walls across miles that together constitute the great wall he provides an entertaining travelogue supplemented by william lindesays historical notes sprinkled throughout the book mr yamashitas journey begins in the east on the yalu the river that forms the border between china and north korea there he sees chinese tourists walking along the so called "bridge to nowhere " stopping just short of the north korean border to take pictures "some paying extra to dress up in north korean army uniforms and hold toy guns " from there he travels west to shanhaiguan where he listens to a choral group whose singing he reckons "was certainly improved by the walls acoustics " and so on the trip continues through beijing "the tourist wall" the mountains north of the city "the wild wall" and beyond along the way he meets peasants and nomads an opera troupe fashionable chinese at a ski lodge and western expats having a wine tasting party on the great wall of course plenty of would be visitors to china are holding off because of the countrys human rights record particularly its treatment of tibet in that case the armchair travel offered by "across the tibetan plateau" norton pages &# might be in order the tibet autonomous region as this part of china is known is called the "roof of the world" for good reason it is ringed by the himalayan kunlun and kailas mountain ranges the high plateau they abut roughly the size of western europe has an average altitude of more than feet it is a breathtaking place as we see in photographs of deer and elk and other wildlife set against gorgeous countryside carpeted with acres of flowers authors robert l fleming jr dorje tsering and liu wulin emphasize how fragile life is in this mountainous setting and they stir a deep respect for the hardy people who live there other notable travel books find plenty of interest outside china of course long before walt disney imagined his entertainment parks the danes built a acre complex of fanciful architecture band stands mechanical rides and other attractions "tivoli gardens" abrams pages &# is photographer harry bensons tribute to the still going strong facility that opened in copenhagen in mr benson first visited tivoli gardens in he was the official photographer of the beatles then in denmark on tour and he went to the park with george harrison mr benson returned with his camera years later and came away with more than color photographs though the park as been modernized over the years it clearly retains much of its th century charm and escapist fun with marching bands roller coasters whirling rides and gaudy lights set among buildings with onion domes and parasol roofs for those who prefer their exoticism without a trace of cotton candy theres "wild borneo" mit press pages &# by nick garbutt and j cede prudente the worlds third largest island is a sort of biodiversity theme park in the south china sea it has more than species of flowering plants with species of orchids alone and more than varieties of mammals and kinds of birds borneo also has three rulers its administration is divided between brunei indonesia and malaysia the books text is informative without bogging down in technical detail but it is the photographs that entrance from the menacing orb web spiders black with a splat of yellow on their backs to the islands pygmy elephants messrs garbutt and prudente show us a land that fully lives up to its description by charles darwin as "one great wild untidy luxuriant hothouse made by nature herself " california might seem sometimes like one wild untidy luxuriant hot tub made by paris hilton herself but joan tapper and photographer nik wheeler show convincing evidence to the contrary in "the most beautiful villages and towns of california" thames &amp hudson pages &# they take us off the beaten path to more than charming places such as carmel by the sea just north of big sur along the central coastline and mendocino in the north the handsome photography is complemented by a text with plenty of stories to tell like the origins of mendocino in a shipwreck in a clipper called the frolic sank with its load of trade goods near point cabrillo the crew escaped in small boats making their way down to san francisco where a businessman learning about the wreck sent out a scout to see whether the goods could be salvaged the scout reported that the wreck was lost but that the redwood timbered land nearby was ideal for a sawmill and so began what is today a charming seaside town one that retains so much of the new england character brought to it by early settlers that hollywood has used it as a stand in for maine sometimes whether with books or movies you can travel a long way without straying far from home architecture &amp design by lisa rossi unlike frank gehry whose buildings undulate buckle and swirl richard meier favors architecture with firm shapes and strong lines he is perhaps best known for the sprawling multi level getty center in los angeles and the austere high museum in atlanta but he has a soft spot for designing homes as well or so we learn in "richard meier houses and apartments" rizzoli international publications pages &# which includes alongside its photographs discerning essays by paul goldberger and joseph giovannini mr meiers first residential endeavor was the lambert house a one level wooden rectangular structure sitting on stilts atop a dune on new yorks fire island one is immediately struck by the interplay between the building and its natural surroundings as if the house were a shy tall bird pausing on the shore to look out on the ocean a flip of the page reveals this interplay to be a key feature of other meier residences the douglas house with its mondrian like facade of varying window sizes is perched high in the evergreens above lake michigan competing with the trees for attention the expansive rectangular neugebauer house in naples fla has a peaked roof and floor to ceiling windows inviting a lush green nature in from all sides no less stunning is the charles street penthouse located at the top of a glass grid like tower in greenwich village in this square foot apartment instead of a tropical landscape the hudson river and new york citys skyline are present in every room eye popping homes of a more eclectic sort abound in "vogue living houses gardens people" knopf pages &# in this lavish tome were given a glance into palatial residences most of which were featured in vogue or vogue living magazines in the past years as diana vreeland vogues editor in the s once said "few things are more fascinating than the opportunity to see how other people live during their private hours" especially one might add when those people have limitless budgets among the interiors on display is that of fashion designer lisa perry whose mod fifth avenue penthouse apartment designed by architect david piscuskas features a living room with a roy lichtenstein painting and "a vast chain link of white leather sectional sofas " karl lagerfeld by contrast seems to prefer a gilded versailles look we visit madonna and guy ritchie at ashcombe their verdant estate complete with a celtic burial ground in wiltshire england as it happens the photographer and costume designer cecil beaton once called the place home cecil beatons work can be found in "the golden age of couture paris and london " edited by claire wilcox v&amp a publications pages &# a fascinating account of the history of couture from its genesis in parisian dressmaking workshops to its transformation in the mid th century into a vast commercial industry as we see beaton was the curator for a exhibit at the victoria &amp albert museum in london that showcased a collection of couture dresses that he hand picked from the closets of contemporary high society ladies princess lee radziwill is noted to have remarked that after beaton paid a visit she had nothing left to wear coutures artistic essence clothes as works of art comes across vividly in this beautiful book of course design is not confined to how people live or what they wear in "graphic design a new history" yale pages &# stephen j eskilson reminds us that design has a great deal do with with what we see on the printed page or these days on the computer screen he scrupulously tells the history of graphic design beginning with the printing of the gutenberg bible to todays digital design it yourself pages on social networking web sites what makes this history "new" is the authors focus on the role that technology has played for better and worse in the evolution of design style he describes for instance the busy machinery of the early industrial revolution as well as the arts and crafts movement of the late th century whose leading figures rejected mass production in favor of the individually designed handcrafted object we see as well how the poster having worked hard to earn status as an art form before world war i was for a time downgraded to a war time recruiting tool and instrument of propaganda it would rise again of course another genre that has moved between utility and fine art is the handmade bed covering the items on display in "american quilts &amp coverlets in the metropolitan museum of art" metropolitan museum of art and mq publications pages &# date from the early th century to the late th offering extraordinary craftsmanship and all sorts of delightful conceits one of the most impressive pieces is adeline harris searss autograph quilt which flaunts tumbling blocks bearing the authentic autographs on white silk of illustrious figures of the time abraham lincoln among them such homespun items became quaint relics as the country moved into the th century and began enjoying commercially manufactured goods the strangely appealing designs of retail stores are featured in "shop america midcentury storefront design " edited by jim heimann taschen pages &# retro storefronts futuristic streamlined chrome facades and glass plate windows all tried to make a shopper out of every passerby finally for a much broader survey of architectural beauty you can do no better than isabel kuhls " buildings you should know" prestel pages &# it begins with the great pyramid of giza in egypt and ends with the national stadium in beijing an amazing circular construction of interwoven steel well be seeing more of it during the olympics
