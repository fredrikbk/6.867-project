rice prices are steaming with many implications developing world is vulnerable to expected food cost inflation hedge funds get into the act nontraditional players such as hedge funds are now trading in rice according to fred seamon associate director of commodity research at the cbot and new exchange traded investment products aimed at individual investors are also being rolled out the global commodities boom that has lifted prices of everything from gasoline to gold is now elevating rice a staple food for half of the world to its highest level in nearly years rices surge has complex consequences for the global economy used in everything from sushi to burritos to rice krispies the ubiquitous grain is suffering poor harvests and tight supplies in some of the biggest rice exporting and rice consuming nations just as demand grows in places like india and the philippines the higher price is a boon for some farmers and investors but at the same time it is expected to contribute to a protracted bout of food price inflation for the foreseeable future which could widen the rift between the worlds haves and have nots "at the end of the day the fight will be between the industrialized world and the developing world " says michael lewis managing director at deutsche bank a particular humanitarian concern is that the worlds poorest consumers many dependent on rice often have little or no voice "when they suffer food shortages they starve in silence " says joachim von braun director general at the international food policy research institute soaring prices are drawing myriad investors into the market on the chicago board of trade the number of bets outstanding on rice futures contracts recently reached a high a basic sign that more traders see a chance to make money on rising prices nontraditional players such as hedge funds are now trading in rice according to fred seamon associate director of commodity research at the cbot and new exchange traded investment products aimed at individual investors are also being rolled out two months ago jim rogers founder of the rogers international commodities index launched the rogers agricultural exchange traded note while prices for other commodities like oil have been flirting with records in recent months in inflation adjusted terms agriculture commodities still have room to rise before reaching that point for example the price of wheat will have to increase by before it reaches its record high in real terms according to mr lewis at deutsche bank as rice prices rise food aid for developing countries is becoming scarcer and the international price for broken rice an affordable grade favored in many african countries has increased since last year according to the united nations food and agriculture organization on the cbot friday rice futures contracts settled at &# per pounds down cents that is up from &# a year ago and just shy of the previous record price of &# set in january when rice was traded at the mid america exchange while prices like these arent at record levels in inflation adjusted terms they nevertheless threaten to exacerbate poverty in large areas of the world one risk is that in some cases rising prices lead to food shortages and social unrest indeed in november a riot that broke out in senegal was in part attributed to higher prices for rice a staple there protesters throwing rocks and burning tires were met with police firing tear gas the story of rice echoes that of nearly all commodities whether petroleum copper or wheat prices for many commodities are surging thanks to booming demand from emerging economies like china it is having broad ripple effects steel prices make it costlier to construct buildings the rising cost of oil helps to drive up the cost of world shipping rates rising oil prices also make it costlier to grow and ship rice and other grains which in turn drives up food prices agricultural commodities of course tend to have a more direct human impact than say oil or steel grains have been trading at or near historic highs partly because of a combination of growing demand for biofuels such as ethanol made from grain as well as a rising global population which means more mouths to feed in the developing world in addition the weaker dollar has helped to boost global rice prices as most rice is traded in dollars in thailand the worlds largest rice exporter the price of long grain rice has increased nearly since last year according to nathan childs senior economist at the department of agriculture all these factors have depleted global grain stocks to levels not seen in decades wheat stocks are at their lowest level in years rice stocks are at year lows complicating matters historically rice has been a thinly traded market only about of global rice production is traded on the world market according to mr childs this means that in the event of a supply shock rice importers have to scour the globe for available supplies driving up the price even further for comparison about of other grains like wheat and corn are traded globally increased demand and tightening supplies are likely to persist the agriculture department estimates that food prices will increase about this year over last compared with a annual increase last year in the developing world food prices have increased about over last year according to the international monetary fund higher food costs tend to hit people in poor countries harder than those in developed countries as households in developing countries spend a larger percentage of their income on food in the u s food makes up about of the overall consumer price index basket compared with as much as in some emerging economies according to a report by deutsche bank for countries that rely on donations or aid to feed the hungry higher prices can mean less food at the united nations world food program rice is the third most frequently purchased commodity and it supplies more than of caloric intake in poor countries like cambodia "if prices go up well be getting less of that particular commodity " says wfp spokeswoman jennifer parmelee she says the price of procuring food has increased over the past five years since global rice consumption has increased while production increased about as supplies run short the risk for the world market is that big rice exporters start keeping the food for themselves rather than selling it on the market further driving up prices in july vietnam the worlds second largest rice exporter after thailand said it would restrict rice exports in order to meet domestic needs first india another large exporter announced similar export restrictions in october the u s accounts for only about to of global rice production but it is the fourth largest exporter behind thailand vietnam and india this year u s rice acreage was smaller than last year because of strong prices for competing crops like corn and soybeans however the crop is estimated to be bigger because of higher yields u s exports are expected to be nearly higher than last year
