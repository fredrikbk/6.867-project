one of the most popular videogames on the internet right now is about as low tech as a high school social studies quiz the free game traveler iq challenge has become an unlikely hit by getting players

gimmick in june by travelpod a travel web site owned by expedia traveler iq now has more than four million people a month who play it on sites across the internet including facebooks popular social network traveler iq is part of a wave of whats known in the industry as "casual" games low budget easy to play titles like card games and puzzles that lack the visual flare of slick new products for the xbox and other game consoles traveler iq is also tapping into a renewed interest in geography stimulated by new technologies like gps satellite based navigation devices and google earth a program from google that lets users browse a three dimensional model of the planet "im addicted " says john riccitiello chief executive of videogame publisher electronic arts of redwood city calif mr riccitiello says his overall traveler iq ranking got as high as th in the world at one time but his standing dropped as more people began playing the game sinking to th "once something gets really popular you realize what a dolt you are " says mr riccitiello who travels about miles a year traveler iq challenge was inspired by games played by luc levesque a canadian programmer and traveler who founded travelpod when he was on train trips across turkey and driving for days to reach remote salt flats in bolivia mr levesque years old would randomly name a country and one of his travel companions would attempt to name another country or capital city that starts with the third letter of the previous countrys name the idea for an online geography game occurred to mr levesque in may

two programmers created the game for travelpod in just under three weeks for an amount mr levesque wont disclose but which is likely less than &# at standard salaries for engineers the game was designed to funnel users to travelpod com an ad supported web site that lets travelers set up blogs chronicling their trips "weve seen huge increases in registrations and traffic " says mr levesque who adds that the ottawa ontario company could eventually put ads directly inside the game more than million people have installed the game on their web pages on facebook most of the players of the game now come through other sites that have the program on their pages including the cbs show "the amazing race " traveler iq starts out asking users to locate some of the better known cities and attractions in the world like london giving users a limit of about seconds to pinpoint them on a map the locations quickly get harder with cities like ashkabat turkmenistan the game tells users how close in kilometers they got to the actual locations and scores them accordingly with more points awarded for shorter distances andrew bridges an attorney at a san francisco law firm who has traveled extensively around the world the game is one of a number of new technologies that help stimulate his interest in distant locales for fun he says hell see how fast he can manually zoom in to find a monument like the acropolis in athens using google earth jerome dobson a geographer at the university of kansas in lawrence who doesnt play the game says new technological applications like traveler iq are helping to revive geography after a decades long decline in the teaching the subject in u s schools issues like climate change globalization and the war in iraq are also encouraging interest in far flung places mr dobson also the president of the american geographical society an association of geographers and geography enthusiasts says writer ambrose bierce said around the time of world war i that "war is gods way of teaching americans geography &amp nbsp " still studies suggest theres a ways to go before the public improves its grasp of geography a survey from early last year sponsored by the national geographic society found that only half of young american adults ages to could locate new york state on a map six out of couldnt find iraq on a map of the middle east travel iq provides its own report card of sorts on geographical skills among those who use the game on facebook tata consultancy services a technology consulting firm based in india had the lowest average traveler iq among workplaces at least until the rankings were updated during the middle of this week mike mccabe a spokesman for tata consultancy services in the u s in an email called the findings

priorities at tata than geography
