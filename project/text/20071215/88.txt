weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece a nutcracker like no other mark morriss hard nut abounds in witty snowy delights unlike numerous ballet choreographers including the great george balanchine whose "nutcracker" for new york city ballet launched the work as holiday fare nationwide the modern dance choreographer chose to work with tchaikovskys music precisely as written besides some sketchy notations of the choreographic patterning from russia all that remains of ivanovs waltz are a few s photographs of corps de ballet women in white dresses arrayed with pompoms and some enthusiastic accounts of his choreography the hard nut" is mark morriss visually and dramatically eccentric take on "the nutcracker " the now almost impossibly popular score that tchaikovsky composed for its premiere as a ballet in russia unlike numerous ballet choreographers including the great george balanchine whose "nutcracker" for new york city ballet launched the work as holiday fare nationwide the modern dance choreographer chose to work with tchaikovskys music precisely as written the result is a two act dance of wit and rich inventiveness that can be seen this christmas season both on stage his company is presenting it in berkeley calif through dec and on a recently released dvd nonesuch of a performance mr morriss ingenious creativity is at peak display in "the hard nut"s masterly "waltz of the snowflakes " tchaikovsky and his collaborators primarily the russian imperial ballets marius petipa planned a second theatrical tableau to end the first act of "nutcracker " after the preceding scenes which occur in the confines of the characters home a new scene takes the action to a "fir forest" and into the works first big formal dance "the waltz of the snowflakes " originally choreographed by lev ivanov besides some sketchy notations of the choreographic patterning from russia all that remains of ivanovs waltz are a few s photographs of corps de ballet women in white dresses arrayed with pompoms and some enthusiastic accounts of his choreography britains royal ballet staging "after lev ivanov" by peter wright also available on dvd makes some attempt to reclaim this choreography but at least on video it ends up looking thin of step and weak in impact enter mr morris with his decidedly personal point of view as tchaikovskys sweeping and exciting "waltz of the snowflakes" climaxes part one of "the hard nut " the sight of mr morriss grand display of playfully forceful dancing for his cast of prompts thoughts of "let it snow let it snow let it snow " you wont actually hear that sammy cahn and jule styne tune in "the hard nut " but youll feel its snow filled refrains mr morriss grand group number in "the hard nut" is framed within adrianne lobels inky darkness outlined by sharp white pin stripe edges and backed by a speckled expanse that suggests both the chill of a nighttime snowfall and the decorative pattern of guinea hen feathers the filmed version isnt lighted enough to reveal this background clearly on the dvd mr morris discusses using male and female dancers in his waltz in contrast to the more traditional all female ensembles linked to this music as representative of "nature " which to him "means everyone " theres also a more practical side to his scheme especially given the costuming martin pakledinazs frozen custard like headwear bolero tops and short gathered tutu skirts all in blacks and whites for both men and women mr morriss unisex ensemble of men and women offers him a larger dancing unit than the female contingent of his company could onto his white on black field mr morris sets forth his group dance at first two dancers one man and one woman gambol out on the tips of their black pointe shoes tchaikovskys trilling flutes and strings spur them through their actions as lighted and caught on film their sparkly costuming keeps throwing off brilliant highlights like so many stars of bethlehem eventually these two dancers toss a handful of paper snow into the farthest wing this triggers a bigger return of confetti like snow from offstage and the dance and its theatrical momentum are off and running from here the numbers grow with barefoot dancers joining the ranks of those on pointe each dancer defining the lines circle groupings and clusters of mr morriss kaleidoscopic patterns accents the choreographic moves by releasing handful after handful of paper snow the powdery white flecks eventually make the black stage look snow slicked all the while you feel the waltzs pulse and pull which builds and grows as it seems only a tchaikovsky waltz can ms lobels clever design scheme gets more elaborate as the almost frenzied pace rushes toward its conclusion on the cue of harp glissandi both delicate and stinging out from the base of the edges that give the stage its tunnel like depth little "banks" of snow appear in the form of sharp white mounds the "snowflake" dancers might now be so many crystals of hoarfrost clinging to window panes two dancers poised together signal the onset of the waltzs almost wild finale by throwing with starburst effect handfuls of snow on an otherwise empty stage this cues a swirl of madly crisscrossing travels for all the dancers who charge through skittering steps that lead into booming jumps all made more legible by the flinging of the paper snow think of spider man releasing showers of sugar rather than threads of webbing when tchaikovskys cascading cymbal crashes crescendo into more and more streams of "snow " the marvels of this ebullient activity climb higher and higher how one wonders does this repeated release of confetti never wear out its welcome but provide more and more surprise and delight and why has no one else in more than years of "nutcracker" stagings not thought to employ this simple childlike effect i know the answer theres only one mark morris and his is the only "waltz of the snowflakes" that could prompt such questions and such unbounded smiling admiration mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
