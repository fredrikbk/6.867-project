to come across an ink stained monolith with the power to make or break a campaign a democratic presidential endorsement from the des moines register is imminent probably coming sunday or a week hence though its circulation is only about half the of the s the register remains the only statewide newspaper in iowa and a political powerhouse with its tradition of liberalism it is particularly influential among democrats the newspapers editorial board which makes the endorsements operates separately from the newsroom even david yepsen the registers esteemed political columnist claims not to know what will happen in a town that consumes political information like popcorn this is the best kept secret around those sifting for clues make hay out of the fact that sen hillary clintons camp publicly feted the papers editorial staff at a local eatery recently and that sen joseph biden of delaware was called in twice for interviews david axelrod chief strategist for the campaign of sen barack obama sat in for his candidates interview with the board a week or so ago "it went well or at least i think it did " he said "theyre absolutely inscrutable " political operatives credit the

delegates for south africas ruling party the african national congress are likely to choose jacob zuma this coming week as the partys new leader but it wont come without a fight mr zuma the partys deputy president is facing off against his bitter rival south african president thabo mbeki the anc is the only major political party in south africa so whoever wins the party vote is almost guaranteed victory in the presidential elections mr mbeki cant run for president since he has already served two terms but should he continue as party boss that likely would give him enough power to nominate his successor sixteen years after the official end of apartheid south africa is struggling with corruption and deep racial divisions yet it is on the verge of a bright economic future from rich mineral reserves and relatively vibrant financial markets two years ago few predicted mr zuma would be in line for the presidency he had been sacked as south africas deputy president for his role in a corruption scandal and he was charged with raping a young woman though he was acquitted in that case last month a court cleared the way for prosecutors to bring new charges against mr zuma in the corruption case he has denied wrongdoing mr zuma remains the top choice for five out of nine provinces as well as the anc youth league and the womens league the partys final decision will be announced thursday while seen as pro business mr mbeki has crushed dissent in his government lashed out at the press and cast doubts about the threat of hiv aids in a country where an estimated five million people are afflicted with the disease mr zuma is seen as a consensus builder he plays up his impoverished background and is backed by the communist party and the million strong trade federation which was alienated by the mbeki regime the possibility of a zuma presidency initially alarmed foreign investors and the black south african elite but lately mr zuma has scrambled to reassure them that his economic strategy wouldnt stray too far left some anc members talked of nominating a viable third candidate but the effort didnt come to fruition
