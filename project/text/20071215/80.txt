using heart stopping amounts of butter not too mention artery clogging delicacies like foie gras and chocolate truffles american adults buy a meal or snack from a restaurant times a week on average according to the national restaurant association so we have ceded control of a significant part of our diets to professional cooks who have no incentive to whip up healthy meals in modest amounts they want to appease your piggish appetite so they send out gargantuan pieces of meat with several garnishes but dont they care if you keel over from fat induced diabetes or coronary disease before you can make another reservation to satisfy our curiosity we turned to two of our favorite bicoastal superchefs mario "molto mario" batali and thomas keller the two men operate with opposite images molto mario is the falstaffian redhead known to millions from his earthy television performances he is short and not quite fat and his menus at their best rely on hearty heritage recipes that remain hearty even after a batali makeover mr keller is tall thin untheatrical and preoccupied with the cooks alchemical ability to transform food and turn it into visual art without ever losing fundamental tastes for their happy customers these two radically different personalities offer radically different dining experiences a mood of unbuttoned indulgence at babbo as compared with an apollonian serenity at the french laundry a typical batali dish looks big and bold mr keller insists on a multicourse tasting menu with far more complex and intricate preparation applied to a succession of smaller dishes so its hard to compare the two restaurants offerings nutritionally on a dish by dish basis but for a general idea we picked a main course from each restaurant and then analyzed published recipes for the dishes for mr batali we chose his pork loin alla porchetta with "mirto " a myrtle spiked roulade of sausage stuffed butterflied pork loin mr kellers breast of veal with yellow corn polenta cakes glazed vegetables and sweet garlic was the dish he cooked at home for his staff a week before the french laundry opened in both recipes are just feasible for the home cook down to earth but with extra spins that send them into a higher orbit than a regular pork loin the elegant rolling and stuffing plus the myrtle or veal breast the cutting of the elegantly braised veal into circles to stack with the polenta circles we took the ingredient lists of both recipes and ran them through the sieve of the usda nutritional database to get a rough idea of calorie count since both chefs advise you to skim off excess fat these estimates are undoubtedly higher than a full scale laboratory analysis would have given but they are still lower than plenty of fast food meals a single portion of the babbo pork loin totaled calories in our estimate thats only calories more than a big mac and way lower than the calories you ingest with a double quarter pounder with cheese mr kellers veal breast and polenta clocked in higher than either mcdonalds item at calories though it still comes in below a double quarter pounder with large fries calories although mcdonalds officially pays attention to dietary issues and publishes lavishly documented charts of the nutritional content of its foods neither babbo nor the french laundry officially count calories indeed mr keller himself slim pounds for his height " believes diet is beside the point at his kind of restaurant "i dont really think about calories per se is about celebration indulgence like christmas " he told me at babbo mr batali says "we dont count calories per se portion size is the best way we dont use butter and keep olive oil to a minimum but if we think an ingredient will add something to a dish and give it something people wont find elsewhere were not going to hesitate using it regardless of calories " you wont drop any pounds eating at babbo or the french laundry but they are turning out world beating food thats actually less caloric on balance than the undistinguished fast food that people consume like foie gras ducks
