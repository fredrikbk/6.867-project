our misplaced yuan worries if correcting chinas imbalance were sought by increasing gross domestic investment to match domestic savings rampant inflation above the present annual rate already twice that of a year ago could result because soaring demand for materials plant and equipment would in the near term sharply boost their prices its conventional wisdom that bipartisanship results in improved public policy that this is not so is strikingly illustrated by a bill supported by democratic chairmen and ranking republican members of the relevant committees in the senate and house that would punish china for its "misaligned" currency the yuan its mistaken premise is that this misalignment threatens our prosperity by causing americas large current account deficits with china in chinas current account surplus the sum of its trade surplus and net receipts from foreign assets and foreign remittances will be nearly of its gdp or about &# billion two thirds of this represents a bilateral surplus with the u s the u s global current account deficit in will be about &# billion nearly of the u s gdp thus chinas bilateral current account surplus with the u s is one quarter of the global u s deficit in the yuan was worth u s cents it is currently worth cents many believe that if the yuans exchange value were to increase further perhaps to cents or cents the bilateral imbalance between the two countries would be substantially reduced if not eliminated chinas exports to the u s would thereby become more expensive in u s dollars and would therefore decrease while chinas imports from the u s would become less expensive in chinese yuan and therefore would increase if china fails to make this currency adjustment the pending legislation in congress would impose a tax on imports from china to offset the putative currency undervaluation this reasoning though plausible is wrong a countrys global current account deficit depends on the excess of its gross domestic investment over gross domestic savings gross savings in the u s are about of gdp largely consisting of corporate depreciation allowances and retained corporate earnings on the other hand gross domestic investment is of gdp the difference between the two comprises the u s current account deficit chinas current account surplus is the mirror image of the u s imbalance gross investment in china is above of its gdp but its savings are even higher above while the appreciation of the yuan might initially raise u s exports to china and lower chinas exports to the u s these effects would be small and transitory as long as the imbalances between savings and investment in the two economies persist japan and germany two countries with perennial current account surpluses illustrate the point while japans yen has appreciated against the dollar in the past several years its current account surplus is largely unchanged because japans domestic savings have continued to exceed its domestic investment the euro has appreciated relative to the dollar yet germany maintains a large global current account surplus thats because the german economy maintains an excess of savings over investment the economies of most other eurozone countries show a savings shortfall and continue to incur current account deficits in both germany and japan the excess of domestic savings over domestic investment persists and hence their current account surpluses persist notwithstanding their currencies appreciation to reduce the bilateral imbalances between china and the u s requires more carefully crafted policies than revaluation of the yuan else the results could be perverse if correcting chinas imbalance were sought by increasing gross domestic investment to match domestic savings rampant inflation above the present annual rate already twice that of a year ago could result because soaring demand for materials plant and equipment would in the near term sharply boost their prices this is a sequence china is already experiencing if correcting the u s imbalance were sought by lowering investment to a level closer to the u s current savings rate a serious recession would likely result effective remedial policies for china lie in raising domestic consumption reducing domestic savings by or of gdp through such measures as wider dissemination of credit and debit cards and other consumer credit instruments remedial policies for the u s lie in raising current savings by or of u s gdp through curbing government spending instituting personal retirement accounts to supplement the defined benefits of social security establishing a graduated consumption tax or a combination of these measures in the u s such measures have been advocated by some members of both parties but more important than their potential bipartisan support they would warrant nonpartisan support because unlike currency realignment they would actually address the underlying sources of the u s and chinese imbalances mr wolf holds the corporate chair in international economics at the rand corporation and is a senior research fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution
