weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes some collectors of french wines around here are now suggesting the california vineyards are reengineering their wines to have a shorter cellar life to capitalize on selling into the market that wants to consume wines sooner the right holiday red q i plan to buy a bottle of wine as a christmas gift for my daughter in law but since i do not drink wine have no idea what to buy she prefers red wine and i would like your suggestion on what to buy that goes with steak id like to stay within the &# &# range bobbie allison orange park fla every christmas after we were married johns father who also lived in the jacksonville area and also didnt drink gave us a bottle of wine for the holidays it was an odd sweet wine called montonico from san martin vineyards long after we moved onto finer wines we cherished that bottle every year because johns father cared enough about our wine passion to venture into a very unfamiliar wine store and buy it our point is that its the thought that counts many people will be giving wine as presents and trust us if you put care and thought into the gift the bottle will be perfect no matter what but here are some specific ideas because were suggesting these for a broad range of people who might or might not be experimental when it comes to wine these are safe suggestions for wines that we think just about anyone would like wed urge you to visit a good wine store to look for these because you might not find them everywhere for a steak worthy red in the &# to &# price range wed suggest a ribera del duero from spain we found these wines quite consistent in a tasting this year and they are more widely available than ever from california a cabernet sauvignon from chateau st jean sterling or rodney strong would be a good choice for another yummy red thats great with a variety of foods from salmon to duck look for a pinot noir from oregon its always a great gift because many people still havent tried one and theyre quite something they are available at all price ranges in whites a sauvignon blanc from new zealand cant miss and if you go up a few dollars you can really impress your giftee with a bottle of cloudy bay beware that this will probably come with a screw cap white bordeaux is a great choice because its one of the worlds more elegant wines but not widely known among many good names to look for are chateaux bouscaut carbonnieux la louviere and olivier if you are most comfortable sticking with americas favorite wine chardonnay from california simi "reserve " robert mondavi "napa valley" or joseph phelps would be good bets rush to judgment q some collectors of french wines around here are now suggesting the california vineyards are reengineering their wines to have a shorter cellar life to capitalize on selling into the market that wants to consume wines sooner is this true barrett burns greenwich conn some francophiles have always sniffed that california wines wouldnt age well they said this with special passion whenever california wines beat french wines in a tasting as in "of course the american wines taste better now thats because theyre meant to drink young and our wines need age to show their best " it is true though that wines all over the world not just in california but in france and italy and elsewhere are being made to be more approachable in their youth by changing grape blends or the kind of oak barrels for instance because most people dont want to wait years to fully enjoy them this has been a matter of great debate and concern in the wine world for some years now because while we believe that wine is meant to drink not hoard there is something very special about a wine that gets better and better with age like many wine lovers we actually enjoyed waiting for our barolos and bordeaux for instance there are traditionalists just about everywhere including california who still build wines to last for people with cellars and patience a good wine merchant should be able to point some out to you melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com
