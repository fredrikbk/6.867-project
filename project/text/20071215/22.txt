s investors yet as an asset class it has become a haven of stability rather than volatility over the past few years emerging markets have outperformed their peers in corporate debt and u s treasurys in a year when a global credit crisis pummeled many assets in what is considered the industrialized world emerging markets debt has even outperformed the standard &amp poors stock index so far this
