anguish he once called a collector of tango records looking for a bogus recording titled "how deep can the ravine be if the frog climbs it at a trot " neither the collector nor his wife who also came to the phone could place the song buenos aires last month people turned out at a nightclub to celebrate julio de rizios st birthday mr de rizio himself provided the entertainment using a telephone hooked up to the audio system he dialed a convenience store and in a tone that was civility itself inquired about closing time "im asking because im going to rob you at a m " he told the startled clerk mr de rizio then made harassing calls to a middle aged comic book collector and to a fellow who was offering his services as pop vocalist he got him to belt out a few bars badly off key finally he called a handyman who had advertised that he would take care of "everything your husband doesnt have time to fix " mr de rizio went off on a bawdy riff about not having time to satisfy his wife he asked the flustered handyman whether he could fix that mr de rizio known by his stage name dr tangalanga has won fame and fans throughout latin america for making prank phone calls his devotees call him "the telephone avenger" for the verbal pummeling he inflicts on inept or unscrupulous service providers quack healers tarot card charlatans butchers with heavy thumbs and builders who misfire their caulk guns but no argentine telephone owner is safe not even the medical student who had obtained some skeletal remains from a cemetery tangalanga called her and told her that the bones were those of his cousin "couldnt you put him back together so i could bring him some flowers " he asked mr de rizio who labored anonymously for decades as an account executive at colgate palmolive co in argentina made his first comic calls in the early s to cheer up a friend who was dying he started working the phones in earnest some years later when he himself was bedridden with hepatitis homemade tapes of the calls began circulating informally around buenos aires creating a sizable fan base eventually he was signed by a publisher and record companies which collected his oeuvre in three books and cassettes or cds he has performed in mexico chile and uruguay in recent years and still works private parties in argentina mr de rizios deadpan delivery and gravitas prompt victims to take him seriously never mind the nonsense he spouts posing as a reporter for the mythical peruvian magazine angustia or anguish he once called a collector of tango records looking for a bogus recording titled "how deep can the ravine be if the frog climbs it at a trot " neither the collector nor his wife who also came to the phone could place the song they promised to take it up with other tango buffs though "yes " mr de rizio said "all of them will have to come together and asphyxiate themselves " "of course of course " replied the collectors wife mr de rizios best pranks border on the surreal he once asked a wig repair specialist to make a house call because his wifes hairpiece had burst into flames while she was wearing it a prominent argentine philosopher alejandro rozitchner wrote that tangalanga is "an artist" and likened him to "the boy who satisfies himself participating in the world of grown ups acting out the role of one of them " an argentine rock star sampled tangalanga on an album and a cabinet minister had him tape a message for his answering machine when not performing mr de rizio isnt anything like the profane and politically incorrect tangalanga for many years he spent two or three days a week as a volunteer visiting people in hospitals mr de rizio has been married for years to the girl who grew up next door to him in buenos aires he credits the telephone tricks with keeping him healthy and lucid after all these years throughout the world prank calls have an extensive comic pedigree from steve allen on the original "tonight show" in the s to bart simpson today the telephone hoax has been a durable source of laughs mr de rizio enlivens his jokes with an earthy buenos aires argot called lunfardo which was born in the immigrant underworld in the late th century and became the language of tango even when he has taken his act abroad mr de rizio has often found himself dialing back to buenos aires to find comic foils argentines have no peers in their irascibility and the language they use to express it he says when tangalanga made a nuisance call to a buenos aires woman who sold statues used in the santeria religion she spent nine minutes cursing him she insulted his mother and his sister and then she insulted his mothers sister when he called back she cussed him out for another minutes later he and the woman became friends and she appeared as a guest at one of his shows but some people never get over their anger at being the butt of tangalangas jokes a couple of years ago mr de rizio had a pair of off duty police officers accompany him to a performance because he had been threatened by a man whose yoga instructor wife had fallen for a tangalanga prank concerns about reprisals are the reason mr de rizio assumed the tangalanga alias and performs with his face concealed behind a baseball cap and a fake beard in defense of what he does mr de rizio notes that his calls provide comic relief to thousands of fans ex president carlos menem said tangalanga tapes were one of the things that helped him cope with his grief after his son died in a helicopter crash in mr de rizio has taken aim at some prominent targets including another ex president fernando de la rua he called mr de la rua pretending to offer legal services and gave him a spurious return phone number with digits rather than the customary eight why so many numbers asked the ex president "divided by two " dr tangalanga replied "ah " mr de la rua said among his other distinctions mr de rizio has probably left some of the most baffling phone messages ever to find their way onto post it notes he told one message taker to look for him on " cochabamba st second floor fourth corridor row on the shady side " besides working wedding or anniversary parties mr de rizio now usually confines himself to one big live show a year for his birthday last month carlos marcarian a year old dental assistant rode the early morning ferry from his home in uruguay to see his idol in action "it is amazing that a man his age can think so fast " he says most audience members were in their twenties or thirties and many sported tattoos and piercings during the birthday show mr de rizio was assisted by his friend and manager roberto fasano who provided numbers of prospective victims culled from the classifieds or suggested by fans its a risky brand of comedy though some would be targets a singer who claimed to be a dead ringer for joe cocker and a wart removal specialist werent home when he rang up and when mr de rizio phoned a restaurant the manager started laughing uncontrollably and replied "si tangalanga " one downside of tangalangas fame is that about one in three people he calls now recognizes him still there are more hits than misses the biggest laughs came during mr de rizios conversation with a magician calling himself alex white an anglicized version of his real name alejandro blanco tangalanga said he wanted to hire him to saw mrs tangalanga in half only he didnt want any magic tricks "youve got to kill her well " tangalanga said there was a pause and then a palpable quiver of concern in the magicians voice "you seem like you need another type of service " he said
