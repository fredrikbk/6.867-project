a citi that gets no sleep bank must move fast to shore up capital after more downgrades the banks leverage ratio a measure of tier capital to average total consolidated assets and an indicator of a banks ability to absorb losses is showing greater stress citigroup inc seems like it is caught in a never ending game of whack a mole the second the bank knocks down one problem another pops up on friday moodys investors service downgraded citigroups long term ratings saying it expects continued losses related to mortgages and other complex securities the action came a day after citigroup resolved longstanding questions about troubled off balance sheet vehicles it sponsors the downgrade shows that chief executive vikram pandit who started his new position tuesday has little room to maneuver he will have to quickly shore up the banks capital or the money it sets aside to ensure it can withstand losses and make good on its obligations the downgrade was an incremental lowering of citigroups ratings while it didnt signal any immediate crisis it showed the increasing strain the banks finances face from mounting losses springing from the housing downturn and ensuing credit crunch the danger is that every time mr pandit fixes one problem the banks balance sheet could spring another leak citigroup could quickly find itself in a capital squeeze additional losses eat into capital even as downgrades of its assets force the bank to set aside more money to meet regulatory requirements this pressure could push mr pandit to cut the banks generous dividend the &# a share annual payout costs the bank &# billion a year money which could go a long way towards shoring up capital citigroups stock friday fell cents or to &# just above its five year low the shares yield slightly less than a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment in recent weeks citigroup has pledged to uphold the dividend however unlike earlier announcements in which it pledged to support the dividend citigroups statement thursday on its off balance sheet vehicles known as structured investment vehicles or sivs contained no mention of the payout generally investors hate a dividend cut but at this point they might not howl too loudly if it happens "so be it " said wendell perkins chief investment officer and portfolio manager at optique capital management inc which owns citigroup stock in fact a dividend cut could boost the stock because investors may believe the bank is finally pulling out of its tailspin he added whether citigroup can avoid such drastic action depends on how much money it will have to raise in coming months to rebuild its capital cushion cibc analyst meredith whitney estimates the bank will need to raise &# billion and will have little choice but to cut the dividend and do even more she and other analysts expect citigroup will have to raise additional capital from investors beyond the &# billion in convertible bonds it recently sold to abu dhabis investment arm and sell assets the banks weakness is reflected in its tier ratio which measures a banks ability to absorb losses and meet obligations by comparing tangible equity to assets graded by the amount of risk they carry that key metric dropped to at the end of september while that is above the level regulators require for a bank to be deemed "well capitalized " it is below citigroups own internal target of and the ratios at other major banks citigroup says it wants to rebuild that ratio by the middle of next year but some analysts think it is likely to keep sliding in the fourth quarter possibly to below but the tier ratio may actually be a bright spot for citigroup the banks leverage ratio a measure of tier capital to average total consolidated assets and an indicator of a banks ability to absorb losses is showing greater stress at the end of september this ratio was banks must typically maintain at least a leverage ratio although citigroup received a waiver and must stay above if citigroups ratio falls below that lower bar the bank could have problems with regulators "citigroup has the lowest leverage ratio of any large bank " said christopher whalen a managing director at institutional risk analytics but because default rates on some kinds of loans at citigroup tend to be higher than at peers "they arguably need more capital than banks of equal size " he added and things may get worse before they get better in cutting citigroups ratings friday moodys said it expects the bank to face significant charges in because of its holdings of mortgage related securities sean jones the moodys analyst who follows citigroup said he expects the bank to face write downs on its collateralized debt obligation assets that exceed the &# billion to &# billion loss the bank already has forecast on this debt for the fourth quarter moodys also warned that the bank could face further downgrades if it doesnt quickly get its problems in hand if that happened citigroup could face higher borrowing costs and its traders could be forced to put up additional capital when doing business with other firms said edward grebeck who runs financial advisory firm tempus advisors beyond losses the banks capital ratios could come under pressure because of outstanding pledges to loan money to companies and other institutions citigroup faces "the risk of further involuntary asset growth" as companies tap existing credit lines said john mcdonald an analyst at banc of america securities that could tie up more of the banks balance sheet making it difficult for it to increases lending and profit finally citigroup could see capital ratios weaken further as credit ratings firms downgrade debt that it is holding such as residential mortgage backed securities that is because banks have to set aside capital based on the risk level of an asset which is determined by its ratings "as so many assets have been downgraded by the rating agencies in this past fourth quarter more assets on bank balance sheets require greater amounts of capital " cibcs ms whitney said in a report friday for citigroup "this is particularly challenging as it has a precariously low capital base going into the fourth quarter " that could also spell trouble in terms of the &# billion in siv assets citigroup is bringing onto its books should those get downgraded a change in the siv assets risk weighting "could translate into yet another capital challenge " ms whitneys report said
