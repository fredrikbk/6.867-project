weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations the pulpit and the potemkin village mike huckabee is in the lead due it appears to voter approval of the depth and sincerity of his religious beliefs as lived out in his ministry as an ordained southern baptist is a sense in iowa now that faith has been heightened as a determining factor in how to vote that such things as executive ability professional history temperament character political philosophy and professed stands are secondary tertiary what is happening in iowa is no longer boring but big and may prove huge the republican race looks at the moment to be determined primarily by one thing the question of religious faith in my lifetime faith has been a significant issue in presidential politics but not the sole determinative one is that changing if it is it is not progress mike huckabee is in the lead due it appears to voter approval of the depth and sincerity of his religious beliefs as lived out in his ministry as an ordained southern baptist he flashes "christian leader" over his picture in commercials he asserts his faith is "mainstream" his surrogates speak of mormonism as "strange" and "definitely a factor " mr huckabee said this summer that a candidates faith is "subject to question " "part of the game " he tells the new york times that he doesnt know a lot about mitt romneys faith but isnt it the one in which jesus and the devil are brothers this made me miss the old days of gore vidals "the best man " in which a candidate started a whispering campaign that his opponents wife was a thespian mr huckabee has of course announced that he apologizes to mr romney which allowed him to elaborate on his graciousness and keep the story alive he should have looked abashed instead he betrayed the purring pleasure of "a christian with four aces " in mark twains words christian conservatives have been rising most recently for years in national politics since they helped elect jimmy carter they care about the religious faith of their leaders and their interest is legitimate faith is a shaping force lincoln got grilled on it but there is a sense in iowa now that faith has been heightened as a determining factor in how to vote that such things as executive ability professional history temperament character political philosophy and professed stands are secondary tertiary but they are not and cannot be they are central things seem to be getting out of kilter with the emphasis shifting too far the great question does it make mr huckabee does it seal his rise that he has acted in such a manner or does it damage him republicans on the ground in iowa and elsewhere will decide that and in the deciding they may be deciding more than one mans future they may be deciding if republicans are becoming a different kind of party i wonder if our old friend ronald reagan could rise in this party this environment not a regular churchgoer said he experienced god riding his horse at the ranch divorced relaxed about the faiths of his friends and aides or about its absence he was a believing christian but he spent his adulthood in relativist hollywood and had a father who belonged to what some saw and even see as the catholic cult im just not sure hed be pure enough to make it in this party im not sure hed be considered good enough the thought occurs that hillary clintons entire campaign is and always was a potemkin village a giant head fake a haughty facade hollow at the core that she is disorganized on the ground in iowa taken aback by a challenge to her invincibility that she doesnt actually have an a team that her advisers have always been chosen more for proven loyalty than talent that her supporters dont feel deep affection for her that shes scrambling chaotically to catch up with surrogates saying scuzzy things about barack obama and drug use and her following up with apologies that will as always keep the story alive that her guru pollster the almost universally disliked mark penn has according to newsday become the focus of charges that he has "mistakenly run clinton as a de facto incumbent" and that the top officials on the campaign have never had a real understanding of iowa this is true of mrs clinton and her iowa campaign they thought it was a queenly procession not a brawl now theyre reduced to spinning the idea that expectations are on mr obama that hed better win big or its a loss theyve been reduced too to worrying about the weather if theres a blizzard on caucus day her supporters who skew old may not turn out the defining picture of the caucuses may end up being a year old woman being dragged kicking and screaming from her home by young volunteers in a tinted window suv this is still an amazing thing to see it is a delight of democracy that now and then assumptions are confounded that all the conventional wisdom of the past year is compressed and about to blow it takes a potemkin village a thought on the presence of bill clinton he is showing up all over in iowa and new hampshire speaking shaking hands drawing crowds but when he speaks he has a tendency to speak about himself its all always me me me in his gigantic bullying neediness still hes there and hes a draw and the plan was that his presence would boost his wifes fortunes the way it was supposed to work the logic was this people miss bill they miss the s they miss the pre world so theyll love seeing him back in the white house so theyll vote for hillary because shell bring him "two for the price of one " it appears not to be working might it be that they dont miss bill as much as everyone thought that they dont actually want bill back in the white house maybe but maybe its this maybe theyd love to have him back in the white house maybe they just dont want him to bring her maybe they miss the cuckoos nest and theyd love having jack nicholsons mcmurphy running through the halls maybe they just dont miss nurse ratched does she have to come it is clear in iowa that immigration is the great issue that wont go away members of the american elite including u s senators continue to do damage to the public debate on immigration they do not view it as a crucial question of americas continuance they view it as an onerous issue that might upset their personal plans an issue dominated by pro immigration groups and power centers on the one hand and the pesky american people with their limited and quasi racist concerns on the other because politicians see immigration as just another issue in "the game " they feel compelled to speak of it not with honest indifference but with hot words and images with a lack of sympathy this is in contrast to normal americans who do not use hot words and just want the problem handled and the rule of law returned to the borders politicians that is distort the debate not because they care so much but because they care so little hillary clinton is not up at night worrying about the national security implications of open borders in the age of terror shes up at night worrying about whether to use mr obamas position on drivers licenses for illegals against him in ads or push polls a real and felt concern among the candidates about immigration is a rare thing and people can tell they can tell with both parties this is the real source of bitterness in this debate its not regnant racism its knowing the political class is incapable of caring and so repairing
