the weekend interview with john mccain of pork and patriotism every time i called over to the white house and said look youve got to veto these bills the answer was well lose the majority well lose this election well lose the speaker john mccain sits across the table from the editorial board of the wall street journal fielding questions on everything from taxes to torture to terror hes asked what surprised him the most about the behavior house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid with regard to iraq his answer "their lack of patriotism" is of the characteristically impolitic kind that often defines his personality over the course of a minute conversation its on display time and again for a candidate who was mostly written off by the media only six months ago the senior senator from arizona seems remarkably confident of his primary chances at mr mccain is easily the oldest man running for president but the tired sluggish former front runner you may have read about was nowhere in evidence when the senator came to the journals offices yesterday in his place was a combative and yes straight talking candidate with no qualms about rising to a challenge or speaking his mind in short he looks once again like the spry year old who nearly knocked off front runner george w bush eight years ago when asked whether he would tag hillary clinton as well with a "lack of patriotism " mr mccain does dial it down a notch "maybe lack of patriotism is too harsh " he allows "putting political ambitions ahead of the national interest may be a more subtle way" of putting it he then adds with a chuckle "and we all know how subtle i am " just how subtle comes across in expanding on mrs clintons stance on the war and on the surge "she had that very clever line i dont know who wrote it for her that youd have to suspend disbelief in order to believe that the surge is working well youd have to suspend disbelief that its not now " and then as if confronting her in a presidential debate he addresses the absent senator from new york directly "do you still stand by that statement senator clinton do you still believe youd have to suspend disbelief to believe that this surge is working " mr mccain is almost as scathing about his own partys behavior in power as he is about congresss current leaders of the republican congressional majority that was voted out in he says "we let spending get out of control and we would have won the elections if we had restrained spending our base didnt desert us because of the war in iraq our base deserted us because of the bridge to nowhere ill take you to a town hall tomorrow and ill say bridge to nowhere and everyone in that room will know what im talking about that bridge is more famous than the brooklyn bridge " that version of the events of november is not universally shared even within the gop but it does serve mr mccains interests pretty well he has been one of the most prominent and unapologetic supporters of the war in iraq even though he at times disagreed with the administration about tactics and strategy and he voted against the bush tax cuts even though he admits that they helped the economy in the midst of a recession "we all know that they helped without a doubt without the slightest doubt absolutely " even so he defends his opposition to them on the grounds he told us that congress couldnt get spending under control "i opposed the tax cuts because there was no spending restraint if wed enacted spending restraints wed be talking about more tax cuts today and to the everlasting shame and embarrassment of the republican party and this administration we went on a spending spree and we didnt pay for it and every time i called over to the white house and said look youve got to veto these bills the answer was well lose the majority well lose this election well lose the speaker well you know what happened " the words "i told you so" dont quite pass his lips but his sense of vindication is plain enough as for the tax cuts themselves he now pledges that he would fight to make them permanent "i will not agree to any tax increase " he says and then once more for emphasis "i will not agree to any tax increase " his combativeness is on display again when the subject of interrogation techniques is raised its a subject on which the journals editorial board has been critical of mr mccain in the past does he assert he is asked that techniques such as waterboarding never produce reliable information he turns it back on the questioner "i do assert that americas moral image in the world is badly damaged when it comes out that we torture people i do assert that were going to win this battle against al qaeda on ideological grounds " then he adds "so my assertion is that its fascinating its fascinating that those who have served in the military particularly in positions of responsibility almost all of them say dont do it those who have never served those who have never heard a shot fired in anger and never will say lets torture the hell out of them lets take them to the rack lets do what the spanish inquisition invented " that last is a caricature and given the jab at "those who have never served " it might even come across as a mean spirited one but mr mccain manages to put it across without any evident derision in his demeanor or voice on the contrary it is said almost amiably likewise when hes asked what he thinks about the state department he delivers the jab with a smile "sometimes you have a little personal bias when you find out that they nearly rebelled when the secretary of state said all of them had to go serve in iraq i mean please please " he continues "i think we ought to have a state department that understands that service to the country is what theyre all about and if that means going into countries where there may be some danger in serving then by god thats the place they should want to go first " it helps to have volunteered for service in vietnam if one wants to say that kind of thing he doesnt pull any punches with the cia either asking whether it has become a "rogue agency" when queried about the intelligence communitys handling of the national intelligence estimate on iran on the nie he adds "i want to know why in the world we should have any relaxation with regards to iran just because they have had a pause in the quickest part of the program to build a nuclear weapon meanwhile the enrichment goes on and theyre still exporting the explosive devices theyre still supporting hamas and hezbollah theyre still dedicated to the extinction of israel whats the change " as for direct talks between president bush and iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad mr mccain is once again scathing "that is the most overrated thing in the world we know whos going to profit from that who gains in stature from face to face meetings that is the ultimate question if they want to negotiate" an open question it would seem in mr mccains eyes "we can find lots of ways to negotiate but say we have to have face to face come on come on thats just foolishness and i would not do one thing that would enhance the prestige of the president of iran " in iraq meantime mr mccain sees events at long last moving in the right direction "i think this is a seminal moment in american history i really do because weve got a long way to go al qaeda is on the run but theyre not defeated ok "and weve got really a long way to go but im telling you if we could keep going like this for another nine months to a year or so and get the maliki government to start functioning effectively and a lot of things are happening by the way that are not at the highest level i think youre going to see things happen in the rest of the middle east "the syrians sent someone to annapolis for the israeli palestinian peace talks thats good news the iranians may be cutting back on the explosive devices pakistan musharraf is acting as we wanted him to " in his view these are all connected and all related in turn to the reversal of fortunes in iraq since the surge began "and im convinced that if we can continue this success youre going to see a change in the middle east plus some progress on the israeli palestinian issue if we fail were not going to be in the neighborhood and its every nation and every group for themselves " of course mr mccain will have to resign himself to being right but ignored unless he can actually win and while he may once have been seen as what he calls "the designated successor" to the republican nomination hes now a distinct underdog so he places a lot of emphasis on what he calls the "volatility" of the current race "we all know that if i sat here two weeks ago and i said by the way huckabee is ahead in iowa and south carolina youd just have said yeah right " he goes on "i think youre going to see a lot of ups and downs sixty percent say theyre undecided " he also sees hope ironically in the despondency of the gop faithful "our base is dispirited im telling you our base is dispirited were going to have to rev up our base were going to have to promise them were going to stop this spending were going to have to promise them that well get trust and confidence back with them " the senator says he doesnt worry too much about the electoral tactics but he does know what lies ahead "weve got to win new hampshire " he says or at least exceed expectations there "and then i think we can do well in south carolina in south carolina weve got the base this time the attorney general the speaker of the house lindsay graham most of the base " whether thats true or not mr mccain still trails by points on average in south carolina but assuming he can do well there "then i think were obviously very much in the game what happens to huckabee what happens to rudy what happens to romney all this stuff is in such flux now that its very difficult to predict and so were not paying a lot of attention obviously " still hes paying some attention apparently overall the impression mr mccain gives is that he is enjoying this campaign tremendously asked whether he thinks hes running a better campaign since his financing fell off a cliff along with his poll ratings he shoots back with a laugh "do you think i could have run a worse campaign before my finances went south " he blames his fall from front runner status on his leadership on immigration reform and says "if i lose this election it will be on the immigration issue theres no question in my mind " but as with the other issues he discussed in our meeting he doesnt give the impression that he regrets his stand for one minute mr carney is a member of the journals editorial board
