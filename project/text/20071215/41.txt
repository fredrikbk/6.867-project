medicine for big pharmas anemic condition a number of medicines previously granted marketing approval in europe have received "approvable " instead of approval letters from the fda meaning that additional data is required before the drug can be marketed the journal accurately describes the drug industrys malaise "big pharma faces grim prognosis " page one dec but it isnt so much that "the industrys science engine has stalled" but that government regulators have slammed on the brakes over the past decade or so the food and drug administration has become more progressively risk averse and defensive in its decision making regulators have been encouraged to promote greater drug safety but seldom have been called to account for the unnecessary suffering and deaths of patients who dont get the new drugs they need in a timely way this asymmetry will be further worsened by amendments to the food drug and cosmetic act that president bush signed in september the bill raises the punitive tax or "user fees " on drug companies and provides regulators with additional sticks with which to flog drug developers in the guise of enhancing "drug safety " what we need are strategies to make regulators more efficient effective and smart the fda keeps raising the bar for approval especially for innovative high tech products moving the goal posts in the middle of the game such as increasing the number of patients who must be tested before approval is particularly vexing for drug developers in addition a number of medicines previously granted marketing approval in europe have received "approvable " instead of approval letters from the fda meaning that additional data is required before the drug can be marketed as to the statement by the fdas spokesman that "the threshold for what we consider to be a safe effective drug hasnt changed " he needs a whopping dose of something that will improve his reality testing henry i miller m d the hoover institution stanford calif dr miller was an official at the fda from to frankly i am tired of hearing big pharma complain there may be a crisis looming but it is largely a self made crisis and not even close to the one faced by patients who havent been able to afford their medicines in recent years big pharma has consistently outperformed many fortune companies in profitability a cost largely shouldered by the health care consumer and u s taxpayer the top tier companies while commanding about two thirds of the market have produced the minority of innovative drugs in the past decade the brunt of their fda applications and approvals have been for "me too" drugs furthermore they have successfully avoided expiration of their patents by what could best be described as legal tricks yes their r&amp d costs have risen and drug trials now have to be larger but their marketing budgets have risen even more cutting back on consumer advertising as well as payments and "gifts" to physicians would free up billions of dollars putting that toward lowering drug costs and investing in r&amp d will produce results for patients and likely for shareholders too benjamin schaefer m d bangor maine as a former salesman for glaxosmithkline i can tell you that the prognosis has been grim for several years the primary method of drug development was based on finding receptors that created responses and those receptors were discovered years ago check the recent new drug applications filed with the fda many have xl xr cd or some other nomenclature that implies a slight change in the molecule or else its a combination of two already existing products the future lies with the biotech industry but it will create a different pharmaceutical marketplace as biotech makes further advances it will work on narrower niches the days of blockbusters like lipitor are over since biotech suggests a more targeted and narrower approach the main difference will be seen in the size of pharmaceutical sales forces they will get smaller and that is already happening that sound you hear is the sigh of relief from americas physicians scott lindholm davenport iowa
