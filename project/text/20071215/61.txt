syrias remote control hajj made a name for himself earlier this year by routing fatah al islam a sunni terrorist group that had been hiding out in the palestinian refugee camp of nahr al bared up the coast from beirut wednesdays car bombing of lebanese general francois hajj is being treated as something of a murder mystery because unlike lebanons other recent assassination victims the general was not an overt foe of syria yet the method of his killing along with the political benefits that accrue from his death hardly rule out a damascene hand hajj made a name for himself earlier this year by routing fatah al islam a sunni terrorist group that had been hiding out in the palestinian refugee camp of nahr al bared up the coast from beirut this has led to speculation that hajj was killed by that group to avenge its defeat while that may be true whats more significant is that fatah al islam is widely suspected of being controlled and aided by damascus the sophistication of the bomb that killed hajj a remote control device similar to the one that killed anti syrian figures gebran tueni walid eido and antoine ghanem underscores that suspicion no less important is that in targeting hajj who had reportedly been tipped to become the next chief of staff a message has been sent that the lebanese military is now fair game the current chief of staff general michel suleiman is the nominee to be lebanons president and damascus is ambivalent about his candidacy murdering hajj is a signal to general suleiman and other officers not to chart too independent a course from syria all this should alarm the bush administration which was instrumental in evicting syria from lebanon in instead it has been helping to rehabilitate bashar assads regime secretary of state condoleezza rice made a point of meeting one on one with her syrian counterpart at a regional meeting on iraq in may syrias state run news agency condemned the hajj assassination via an unnamed government official but the syrians also condemned the murder with a remote control bomb of rafik hariri in a u n probe into that murder has found overwhelming evidence of syrian complicity the difference this time is that state department spokesman sean mccormack praised syria for its condemnation calling it "positive if continued over time " maybe secretary rice believes she can get the syrians to play nice on iraq and israel while thwarting their ambitions in lebanon for their part the syrians tend to view such american entreaties as signs of weakness on tuesday syrian vice president farouq sharaa remarked that "no one in lebanon even with foreign support can win the battle against syria " the next day hajj was dead which if nothing else was a perfect illustration of mr sharaas point
