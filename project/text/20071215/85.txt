weekend journal holiday gift picks morgenstern on movies xmas with extras some classics return in time for the holidays with special dvd sets paramount pictures not to be bested in the two disc collection competition has repackaged john woos crazily intricate "face off " a thriller about mortal enemies an odious terrorist played initially by nicolas cage and an obsessive fbi agent played initially by john travolta who appropriate each others faces in the course of a final confrontation sometime in the foreseeable future well be downloading our movies from the ether i mean the web and there wont be any dvds i hope that day doesnt dawn too soon dvds lend movies substance rather than reducing them to will o the wisp data streams i like the tedious ritual of slitting the cellophane slicing the seal and finally opening the box to extricate the shining disk just as i liked and miss the substantiality of the cds and their inserts and notes that now fly directly from an online store to the innards of my computer these five new or newish dvds or sets of dvds are well worth extricating and watching the first words out of woody allens mouth on the first page of eric laxs new book of conversations with the filmmaker have to do with the films of ingmar bergman woody says hes depressed "i saw the seventh seal yesterday and cries and whispers today i see his films and wonder what im doing " in the context of his long standing almost long kneeling worship of the great swedish director who died earlier this year its clear that woody is depressed not because the films are depressing though theyre hardly light operetta but because he thinks his own work will never measure up to them thats a story for another day one that involves the relative worth of comedy and tragedy for today its worth noting that ingmar bergmans legacy is readily available on dvd and that one good collection to start with is criterions box set "ingmar bergman four masterworks " "the seventh seal" is among them along with "the virgin spring" and bergmans first popular success "wild strawberries " the leavening is provided by my favorite of the four "smiles of a summer night " its an elegy to evanescent love paramount pictures not to be bested in the two disc collection competition has repackaged john woos crazily intricate "face off " a thriller about mortal enemies an odious terrorist played initially by nicolas cage and an obsessive fbi agent played initially by john travolta who appropriate each others faces in the course of a final confrontation when the film was released in i called it a "gorgeously shot repetitively violent occasionally repellent sometimes silly and consistently trashy fantasy " it remains all of the above but now it has been augmented by a making of documentary an alternate ending and seven deleted scenes one of the instructional pleasures of these box sets is seeing that deleted scenes were almost invariably wisely deleted for lots of people and filmmakers who learned to love movies in the late s and early s those years cleave into b b and a b before seeing "breathless" and after it jean luc godards one of a kind gangster film which was released in taught us a new way of seeing life by skipping the transitions and staying with the action and seeing films as a source of pop mythology just waiting to be re processed jean paul belmondos two bit nihilist gangster standing in front of a poster of bogart in "the harder they fall " says feelingfully "bogey " and almost inhales a hollywood essence as bogart regards him in close up for a revolutionary film which it was "breathless" is also a lot of fun and quite breathtakingly beautiful in a new criterion double disc edition the second disc includes an interview with the endlessly knowledgeable pierre rissient who was godards assistant director and godards "charlotte et son jules " a short film starring belmondo its either time to stop calling "blade runner" a cult classic or to acknowledge that ridley scotts film is known by an awfully big and influential cult in the years since it came out "blade runners" setting of a sulfurous los angeles in has come to be a plug in vision for mankinds dysfunctional urban future as an angeleno in the here and now i can tell you that gridlock is already bringing the city down mr scotts absolutely final and positively definitive directors cut played in a few select theaters this fall now it will be available as part of a five disc "ultimate collectors edition" to be released a week before christmas at the time of this writing i have not received the ultimate edition only the four disc penultimate edition just kidding its simply called the "collectors edition" which will be released on the same date but ive looked at the transfer of the film in which deckard a replicant or android played by harrison ford hunts down other replicants whove escaped from off planet slave labor the image quality is vibrant even though im sorry to report that it still hasnt stopped raining in futurist los angeles as for the other four discs im sure theyll prove to be full of more material than any "blade runner" acolyte can absorb in two lifetimes i should add that thanks to the efforts of studio publicists i already have in my hot little hands a preproduction model of the container that the ultimate set will ultimately come in its a plastic replica not replicant of deckards briefcase if you can judge a box set by its box this one will be a keeper almost three decades after the release of francis coppolas "apocalypse now " the documentary about the making of that film "hearts of darkness a filmmakers apocalypse " shares a dvd with a new documentary by the filmmakers wife eleanor coppola on the making of "youth without youth " the more recent work is timely mr coppolas latest film which opens next friday is sometimes enigmatic and a worthy subject of explication but "hearts of darkness " released in is timeless its probably the best film ever made about the filmmaking process in this case a mad epic struggle thats foreshadowed in the beginning when mr coppola speaking at a press conference at the cannes film festival says "my film is not a movie my film is not about vietnam it is vietnam its what it was really like it was crazy and the way we made it was very much like the way the americans were in vietnam we were in the jungle there were too many of us we had access to too much money too much equipment and little by little we went insane " was that insanity personal or general literal or figurative its all documented for our education and delectation
