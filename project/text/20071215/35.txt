justice clinton hillary clintons commanding lead in the polls has diminished and with oprah winfrey stumping for barack obama shes called increasingly on the "star power" of husband bill in any event gov spitzer is already under some considerable pressure to appoint a minority to sen clintons seat and even though mr clinton was described by writer toni morrison as "the first black president " that wont cut it with the practitioners of identity politics hillary clintons commanding lead in the polls has diminished and with oprah winfrey stumping for barack obama shes called increasingly on the "star power" of husband bill but the ubiquitous presence of the former president on the campaign prompts a question what will hillary do with bill if she is elected of course one might say hillary has been wondering what to do with bill for quite some time but mr clintons prominent role in his wifes campaign whether going head to head with oprah for airtime or defending hillary from "swift boat like attacks" from rival democrats has renewed the question what exactly will he be doing on jan several job ideas have already been floated he might be appointed by gov eliot spitzer of new york to serve the remainder of mrs clintons u s senate term while there is precedent for former presidents even a former impeached president andrew johnson returning to the national legislative body few close to former president clinton think being one of would satisfy his boundless persona in any event gov spitzer is already under some considerable pressure to appoint a minority to sen clintons seat and even though mr clinton was described by writer toni morrison as "the first black president " that wont cut it with the practitioners of identity politics mr clinton has also been contemplated for something dubbed "ambassador to the world " but the federal governments anti nepotism law would likely preclude her naming bill to her cabinet the issue of mr clintons potential role has a serious side for democrats already concerned about her persistently high negatives the notion that mr clinton will be a "shadow president " effectively circumventing the constitutional limitations on presidential service presents a campaign opportunity for the gop so if neither a senate nor executive position will do what does work while its probably not something the hillary campaign would want us to contemplate we should remember that there are three branches of government and that it is widely anticipated that there will be one or more vacancies on the supreme court during the next presidential term before dismissing the possibility of justice william jefferson clinton it is worth recalling a bit of history most notably the history of another former president who landed on the supreme court william howard taft taft would come to love his fellow justices and the court so much that he later described them as his ideals "that typify on earth what we shall meet hereafter in heaven under a just god " that seems a little strong for bill clinton but taft and mr clinton are not without their similarities for example both started out in life as law professors taft at the university of cincinnati and mr clinton at the university of arkansas mr clinton also shares with taft a warm gregarious personality that is well received at home and abroad there are also differences taft never had his law license suspended mr clintons suspension for "serious misconduct" formally ended in and taft had extensive judicial service on lower courts before the presidency indeed taft always preferred the judiciary over the executive office assessing his own presidential term as "a very humdrum uninteresting administration" that failed to "attract the attention or enthusiasm of anybody " president clintons service by no ones calculus was uninteresting the attractiveness of the high bench to bill clinton might well increase once he familiarized himself with the details the former president could not help but admire how taft personally mapped out a machiavellian strategy for appointment among other things taft as president deliberately chose appointees of advanced age this was especially true of edward douglass white taft named him chief justice at the age of passing over charles evans hughes a far more logical choice and a vibrant its too much of a stretch to see either of mr clintons appointments in the same light though when hillary would be in the oval office both stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg will be in their s and john paul stevens pushing it would be untrue and insulting to the integrity of all three to think of them as just biding their time but back in it was reasonably clear that justice white was in the words of the historians "keeping the seat warm for taft " while taft did manage to angle the center seat mercifully that would not appear to be in the cards for mr clinton notwithstanding a curious and worrisome summer seizure chief justice john roberts seems young vigorous and at the start of a long tenure so why would bill clinton take the lesser job of associate justice well instead of being one of a he would be one of nine and like the late associate justice william brennan he would have the personality to influence outcomes on the court especially given its currently teetering to composition disproportionately to his single vote moreover his influence on the bench could extend well beyond "the marble palace " taft for instance reshaped the entire federal judiciary for decades to follow would anyone doubt a justice clintons ability and inclination to remake a federal bench in a manner calculated to erase its current edge of reagan and bush appointees or that his influence would be limited to chatting up whomever hillary is thinking of naming as attorney general in short a seat on the supreme court solves sen clintons dilemma of what to do with her husband if she becomes president it keeps bill formally out of the white house and structurally out of the executive branch and lest that dampen mr clintons interest he might be reassured by tafts practice of continuing to advise the president on the substance of legislation and to lobby to sustain various presidential vetoes true some of this activity would be seen as well beyond the precepts of modern judicial ethics but even if justice clinton stayed solely within his judicial role his impact need hardly be minimal during tafts service the court called the shots in government getting its own building and for the first time winning virtually complete control of its own docket how much more opportunity would be knocking for a justice clinton with an iraq induced democrat controlled congress theres no need to take this comparison further at this point former president clinton will no doubt guffaw at the possibility of judicial service but then hasnt he already stated "i will serve in whatever capacity she deems most appropriate" william howard tafts biographer jeffrey b morris writes that no supreme court justice "has proven as audacious in conceiving his role for taft had treated his job as an american lord chancellor managing a system framing legislation and putting it through selecting judges as well as presiding over a court and deciding cases " no justice that is until perhaps justice william jefferson clinton only time will tell mr kmiec assistant attorney general and head of the office of legal counsel to presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush is a professor of constitutional law at pepperdine university and a volunteer legal adviser to gov mitt romney see related letters "letters to the editor mr justice clinton on the supreme court" wsj dec
