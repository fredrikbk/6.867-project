weekend journal leisure &amp arts after the mitchell report a fog of generalities just what is baseballs bud selig really willing and able to do about the doping scandal former sen mitchells plus page document on performance enhancing drugs in baseball months in the making claims that nearly players most notably roger clemens andy pettitte barry bonds gary sheffield and miguel tejada are guilty of using some form of peds after being asked if he regarded the cases against the players in the report as proved and whether the men would be punished mr selig retreated to the explanation that he would deal with those named "on a case by case basis" when and here was the classic fallback of every commissioner since judge kenesaw mountain landis after the trial of the black sox players in "it affects the integrity of the game " george mitchells report said major league baseball commissioner bud selig at a news conference thursday "is a call to action and i will act " former sen mitchells plus page document on performance enhancing drugs in baseball months in the making claims that nearly players most notably roger clemens andy pettitte barry bonds gary sheffield and miguel tejada are guilty of using some form of peds so having pointed to the centerfield fence what exactly does mr selig do now that hes put himself in the batters box beyond his rousing call to action the commissioner has resisted every opportunity to specify what action he intends to take after being asked if he regarded the cases against the players in the report as proved and whether the men would be punished mr selig retreated to the explanation that he would deal with those named "on a case by case basis" when and here was the classic fallback of every commissioner since judge kenesaw mountain landis after the trial of the black sox players in "it affects the integrity of the game " but what does that mean the study was commissioned by mlb meaning the commissioner himself what evidence against any of those named could there possibly be that was not in sen mitchells report is mr selig implying that he will hire more investigators to investigate the investigations of his first investigator as with fog in a stephen king story the deeper one gets into the commissioners stated intentions the vaguer they seem "sen mitchell acknowledges in his report " mr selig told the media "that the ultimate decision on discipline rests with the commissioner and he is correct " sen mitchell who was working for the commissioners office could hardly have said otherwise what this empowers the commissioner to do though is another matter nearly of the named players are retired the most famous being of course mr clemens and mr selig has no power over them at all except perhaps to restrict their future opportunities for employment in mlb when asked about this mr selig was evasive indicating that such decisions "would probably be made by the individual teams " regarding the active players the commissioners powers are more unclear or rather what isnt clear is how many of those players were allegedly guilty of substance abuse before that was the year the basic agreement between mlb and the major league players association that included testing for peds went into effect the agreement is quite specific on the presentation of evidence regarding substance abuse and subsequent punishment since the mitchell report is not a legal document with what new powers is commissioner selig planning to take action and if he isnt claiming to have new powers what was the purpose of sen mitchells report and mlbs response to it if any of the active players named in the report are proved to be in violation of the basic agreement they will be disciplined according to the existing rules and the commissioner has nothing more to say until both sides agree to modify the existing agreement for example on dec kansas city outfielder jose guillen was suspended for the first games of the season for alleged use of peds between and the players association has filed a grievance some time between now and opening day the special arbitrator agreed to by both sides will decide whether the suspension will hold whatever the arbitrator decides the process is cut and dried so it will be for any of the active players mentioned in sen mitchells report and a preliminary look at sen mitchells findings would suggest to even a legal novice that there isnt enough hard evidence to convince any arbitrator of the guilt of any player who hasnt already tested positive as steve phillips the former mets general manager and current espn commentator remarked thursday after sen mitchells news conference "im really surprised that most of the evidence is hearsay " contrary to what hollywood scriptwriters would have us believe hearsay is admissible in court but it doesnt usually carry much weight so much then for mr seligs statement that the "decision on discipline" rests with him from managements perspective the baseball commissioners powers are granted to him by his employers the owners and it isnt likely that any of them are going to be happy with a commissioner who makes arbitrary decisions concerning the owners most valuable property the players from the unions standpoint mr seligs powers are clearly spelled out despite the media storm they sparked neither sen mitchells report nor mr seligs response to it changes the current process for dealing with steroids in baseball except perhaps to damage mlbs always precarious relationship with the players association the union refused to cooperate with sen mitchells investigation for one simple reason it has felt that the commissioners office was trying to impose conditions on its members rather than work with the union to find effective solutions as union head donald fehr indicated at his own news conference later thursday mlbs decision not to show the players association a bound copy of the report until an hour before sen mitchell appeared before the media hardly seems in character with the spirit of let bygones be bygones repeatedly suggested by sen mitchell nor could mr seligs claims that he holds "the ultimate decision on discipline" be reassuring to the union the commissioners expressed aim is to make mlbs drug testing as rigorousness as the international olympic committees but he cant even think about that without the unions cooperation it appears that mlbs real purpose in instigating the report was to convince congress the media and the public that it cares about the growing scandal of steroids in that regard the mitchell report is a great success as to how the report actually will affect the use of peds particularly the looming problem of the as yet undetectable human growth hormones baseball is still caught in a rain delay mr barra writes about sports for the journal
