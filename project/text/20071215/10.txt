climate negotiators approach agreement negotiators at the united nations climate change conference in bali edged toward an agreement early saturday laying the framework for a new international climate agreement that involves the u s but after days of acrimonious talks including a public standoff between the u s and european union questions remain about whether the brief vaguely worded document expected to emerge from the day talks will bring the international community closer to a meaningful strategy for battling climate change to some degree meaningful negotiations on any new climate deal are on hold until the u s presidential election negotiators at the united nations climate change conference in bali edged toward an agreement early saturday laying the framework for a new international climate agreement that involves the u s but after days of acrimonious talks including a public standoff between the u s and european union questions remain about whether the brief vaguely worded document expected to emerge from the day talks will bring the international community closer to a meaningful strategy for battling climate change delegates from roughly nations have been working on a "road map" that lays out a timetable and other parameters for negotiating a global climate change treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol which expires in the bali conference was essentially an icebreaker aimed at launching the two year negotiating process to result in a new agreement for the eu and the developing nations bloc a major aim was to engage the u s the worlds largest carbon emitter in discussions about a future deal progress on that front was mixed a draft agreement reached in the wee hours on saturday called on industrialized nations including the u s to take "actions or commitments" to reduce emissions according to several people involved in the negotiations but the vague language would allow the u s to sidestep the question of whether it will agree to binding emissions cuts as part of a new climate deal wording could still change and ministers were expected to meet later saturday morning for final negotiations but negotiators indicated that some sort of deal was near completion "we see that a bali road map is possible involving the u s " said humberto rosa chief delegate from portugal which holds the rotating presidency of the eu to some degree meaningful negotiations on any new climate deal are on hold until the u s presidential election ministers at the bali meeting were aware that the next administration likely would have different views on the climate change issue "people are turning away from the official delegation and theyre starting to face toward the future " said hans verolme director of the global climate change programme at wwf a global conservation organization mr verolme is representing nongovernmental organizations in the negotiations "they cant afford to wait around for the next u s president " he said delegates were expected to reconvene to finish negotiations early saturday and u n secretary general ban ki moon was expected to return to bali for the final stage of negotiations earlier in the week frustration with u s negotiating tactics burst wide open with european nations threatening to boycott u s sponsored global warming talks in honolulu next month if the u s delegation didnt show more flexibility much of the dispute centered on a proposal backed by the eu and developing nations to include concrete language that would lay out a specific target for emissions reductions under the new treaty the document wording called on developed countries to reduce their emissions by to below levels by the target which is recommended by u n scientists would give nations a clear goal as negotiations continued in past climate talks the u s had deadlocked with china and other developing nations which argue that binding emissions caps could hurt their developing economies developing nations are still a long way from agreeing to mandatory cuts and tensions ran high with the u s but during the bali talks a number of developing nations including china showed hints of new flexibility on the idea of making emissions reductions china for example arrived at the meeting having recently set an aggressive renewable energy target some academics say the lack of concrete targets in the bali draft wont necessarily hinder progress on addressing climate change instead it might give governments more flexibility as negotiations continue one group of academics from the harvard project on international climate agreements has been patrolling the sidelines of the conference urging delegates to think outside the kyoto box "we may want to move forward in a way that is not a replica of kyoto " said joseph aldy of the harvard project one problem mr aldy noted with the kyoto structure is that it creates a simplistic division between developed and developing nations by grouping poor nations like chad with countries like china which is neck and neck with the u s as the worlds largest carbon emitter under kyoto developing nations including china and india arent required to make binding emissions cuts which has undermined the treatys effectiveness yayu yuniar in bali contributed to this article
