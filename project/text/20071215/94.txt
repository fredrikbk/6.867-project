weekend journal sports golf journal golf gift dos and donts try a nice shirt or an amazing trip but skip the &# golf bag feel free to buy clubs for kids or beginners though since they havent yet had time to build the full scale equipment neuroses that avid golfers develop another generally safe golf gift category is books if only because they arent wildly expensive and the recipient can easily store or hide a golf book on a bookshelf read or unread youll probably never know my heart goes out in this difficult holiday season to nongolfers attempting to buy golf gifts for golfers the main thing the givers fail to understand is how simple most golfers needs really are first they want to get better at the game second they want to play more golf third they want to play that golf on the best possible courses ideally with their best golf friends gifts that directly meet these needs such as a years worth of lessons from butch harmon or an all expense paid golf buddy trip to scotland are few and far between not to mention difficult to gift wrap but for nongolfers hoping to avoid giving gifts that trigger the dreaded frozen smile its useful to keep these fundamentals in mind while shopping nowhere in golfs desideratum for instance is there any mention of porcelain golf figurines generally speaking the best golf gifts add style convenience or richness to the primary playing experience one good gift buying strategy is to hunt for slightly more luxurious versions of products the golfer needs and maybe already has but wouldnt upgrade for himself or herself if your golfer frequently plays in chilly or windy conditions for instance he probably owns a windshirt so splurge on a &# model instead of the more ordinary &# one for the extra money youll get a high tech "performance" fabric that doesnt rustle as loudly during the swing and some natty fashion details such as air vents under the arms or a supple fleece lining you could go the same route with high quality golf shoes especially for women players who in general like having more styles in the closet to choose from or more modestly golf balls those that cost &# a dozen work fine for most players but no one will turn up their nose at a box of titleist pro vs suggested retail &# a dozen another possible extravagance is a laser range finder such as the bushnell pinseeker tournament edition &# as with many players i was once skeptical of these anti traditional seeming devices but once i actually used one i realized how much time it saved in pacing off distances from yardage markers and i was sold beware being too extravagant however a new top of the line carry bag or cart bag costing from &# to &# could make a great gift so might a sturdy new golf bag travel cover like the club glove from &# but a &# hand tooled leather golf bag the size of a saturn rocket will only get most players mercilessly teased at their usual saturday morning round the same probably goes for a &# set of gold inlaid couture irons from the japanese club maker honma in all golf gift matters your best resource is likely to be one of your giftees golf pals he or she will know exactly whats worth springing for and whats fluff and will probably also steer you away from the logical seeming notion of buying golf clubs an avid players golf clubs are inseparable from his golf game sets evolve slowly over time and are highly personalized just look at the soleplates on many players clubs patched with lead tape to create just the right swing feel and youll understand drivers and putters in particular are instruments of the psyche as much as they are tools of the trade that said a new driver might just work if you rely on good advice especially from the giftees instructor if he has one the most expensive drivers these days from companies such as taylormade and callaway cost &# to &# or more many players will hesitate to buy such an expensive toy for themselves but will happily accept one from you save the receipt however and dont take the shrink wrap off the clubhead at some shops doing so will instantly reduce the clubs return value by even if it never strikes a ball feel free to buy clubs for kids or beginners though since they havent yet had time to build the full scale equipment neuroses that avid golfers develop another generally safe golf gift category is books if only because they arent wildly expensive and the recipient can easily store or hide a golf book on a bookshelf read or unread youll probably never know golf books come in two categories humongous and those actually meant to be read the former usually filled with lush photographs of exotic courses taken either minutes before sunset or minutes after sunrise are essentially golf pornography for them production value is key a few golf coffee table books are also meant to be read a good example this year being "jack nicklaus simply the best " a compendium of nicklaus lore photos and essays edited by martin davis &# as for smaller books one of my perennial favorites is "the greatest game ever played" by mark frost &# in paperback the movie based on the book doesnt do justice to this stylish re creation of the thrilling u s open as a rule however avoid buying instructional books and also golf training aids as with clubs instruction is an idiosyncratic topic and only the golfer himself knows what he needs certainly there are other categories of golf gifts appropriate for particular golfers golf art or memorabilia for example can make an excellent gift if thoughtfully chosen for a specific place on a specific wall so can be a certificate for a series of golf lessons or a physical golf assessment by a certified golf trainer which for many players would probably result in better scores than any number of lessons booking a three day golf school is another fine idea but the ultimate golf gift in my opinion would be a golf trip to someplace like scotland ireland or bandon dunes in oregon prepaid but not necessarily prearranged several companies such as perrygolf and jerry quinlans celtic golf specialize in customizing golf trips abroad for groups as small as two or four you could accompany your giftee on the trip or in consultation with other friends and spouses send off an entire foursome or eightsome no golfer i know would even think about returning that kind of gift
