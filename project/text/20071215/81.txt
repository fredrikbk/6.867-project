recall that the sophistication of that punch critics particular moment included such things as nehru jackets and winklepicker boots in workers renovating londons dorchester hotel opened a wall in its bar and were surprised to find a metal cocktail shaker standing in a small cavity inside the shaker was a set of five corked phials along with a scroll explaining the contents of the glass tubes cocktails one contained a martini another a manhattan and a third a sidecar drinks nearly as well known today as they were in their prime two others however were concoctions that by the s had disappeared almost entirely the bronx and the white lady both remain obscure even though the latter was the most famous invention of the most famous bartender of the jazz age harry craddock according to an oft told story on jan craddock mixed the last legal cocktail in new york just before midnight and prohibition struck a veteran of such essential big apple watering holes as the hoffman house and the holland house craddock hopped a ship to london where he found work and then fame at the savoy hotels american bar throughout the s and into the s u s newspapers would recount craddocks exploits behind the mahogany in the new york times reported the "exiled bartender" was "ready to come back when wanted with kinds of drinks " a wire story about racy "freak dinners" being thrown by americans in london quoted craddock saying that his countrymen were "still the greatest connoisseurs of cocktails " the audience for these accounts wasnt looking to enjoy drinks vicariously through reports from abroad there was if anything more boozing during prohibition than before it what appealed was the elegance and panache of walking into a swanky hotel for a drink instead of skulking down an alley to slip into a speakeasy craddock cultivated an image of refined professionalism with his tall forehead high collar and starched white jacket he would not have looked out of place as a university chemist this is the craddock who was captured in numerous publicity stills and whom al hirschfeld caricatured in a drawing for londons daily express and his repertoire came to define the modern bartenders skill set his "savoy cocktail book" remains an essential text of the cocktail canon in the dorchester lured craddock from the savoy and built a gorgeous new bar for him to helm to christen it craddock mixed up those five cocktails interring them in the wall as a time capsule of the most popular drinks of the day he was not wrong to include his own invention the white lady made of two parts gin to one part each cointreau and lemon juice "all women like white ladies " wrote romance novelist maysie greig in her "men as her stepping stones " explaining the cocktails appeal to distaff drinkers she said that "they appear mild but theyre potent " and she suggested that this was an aesthetic tendency with wide application for women "she wants a thing to appear mild but it must have a definite kick to it " but the white lady and the whole bright young things aesthetic of london between the wars aged poorly by the mid s punch magazine looked back at those days with bemusement "can anyone remember the terrible taste of gin and cointreau or whether it was a sidecar or a white lady or how excited the papers got when bertie the barman shook up something new and fancy named " then the magazine shifted from bemusement to disdain "is there anything more naive than yesterdays sophistication " true enough but before we write off the white lady as an embarrassment lets recall that the sophistication of that punch critics particular moment included such things as nehru jackets and winklepicker boots the white ladys time is long enough gone that it is no longer a faded fad but a cultural artifact waiting to be rediscovered but can it be revived there are problems with the drink the name doesnt exactly invite men to share an enthusiasm for the cocktail even though its no girly drink and theres the potential that the moniker might be perceived as having racial overtones though it comes from the british phrase for a female ghost but perhaps the most significant difficulty is that punch magazine had a point about the taste of gin and cointreau the white lady may have been a natural variation on the sidecar theme but gin doesnt blend as harmoniously as brandy with cointreau and lemon juice even so there isnt anything wrong with the white lady that a little tweaking cant fix i like what can happen when white rum and gin are put together and so i added some rum to the white lady it was better but still not good enough after a few hours of kitchen sink chemistry experiments i found that the addition of a little bit of simple syrup and orange bitters did the trick it turns out that the menlo club a s san francisco poker palace had a house cocktail of striking similarity to our revised white lady i suggest we adopt the menlo club cocktail as the worthy successor to craddocks original if youd like to visit the original though its again hidden somewhere inside a wall of the dorchester bar a ghost of the days when harry craddock was the "cocktail king " email me at
