love &amp money naughty or nice a child deserves presents whats more she says since the holidays are about love "should i disassociate my feelings about his behavior toward school and just give him" the gifts he wants "should gifts be a tool to reward and punish just like a pay cut or a bonus at work " age here is obviously the complicating factor its the older teens and even grown children who routinely do things that send parents over the edge be it failing out of college for lack of effort choosing to marry against mom and dads better judgment or sneaking out the family car and totaling it with santas arrival looming parents are reminding kids everywhere that the key to holiday fortune is to forsake their usual naughtiness the big guy kids are told is making that list and checking it twice misbehave and you may find a dirty lump of coal waiting in your stocking right like so many kids i heard that threat annually from my grandmother not once though did i ever awake christmas morning to a lump of lignite instead of holiday loot my grannys threat i grew to realize quickly was entirely hollow now i cant imagine that there are too many little kids out there who are so bad that they deserve to have their holiday gifts taken away but what about teens and above is revoking holiday presents a justifiable punishment for their bad behavior or should those presents be off limits when it comes to punishment in other words should your kids ever really find that proverbial coal in their stocking my interest in this subject cropped up recently because of an email i received from a minneapolis friend anne who was beside herself with frustration her son a good student in high school recently failed out of college where anne says he was living as though it were club med she wondered if buying him the present he wants this year would be misread as a sign that she condones his actions "here are some things that go through my mind " she wrote "as i consider birthday and christmas gifts the two dates fall near one another why should i spend any money on him when he has wasted &# in scholarships am i supposed to reward this " in conversation anne explains her frustrations this way "hes not working to make the best of the opportunities he has been given and what am i doing by saying heres another thing that cost me money when you clearly dont value what youre given " but heres where annes torn her son is a great kid she says and they have a wonderful relationship whats more she says since the holidays are about love "should i disassociate my feelings about his behavior toward school and just give him" the gifts he wants "should gifts be a tool to reward and punish just like a pay cut or a bonus at work " age here is obviously the complicating factor if a little kid misbehaves you take away a sleepover or the use of a toy or a play date for a child in his teens and above though you dont have small stuff to use as leverage its only the big stuff that matters at the same time its the older teens and even grown children who routinely do things that send parents over the edge be it failing out of college for lack of effort choosing to marry against mom and dads better judgment or sneaking out the family car and totaling it so is withholding presents an appropriate punishment for such poor behavior "i cant imagine anything my kids could do that would warrant not giving them something for the holidays " says a longtime friend of mine who has a young child as well as two kids recently out of college "the whole idea of christmas is about giving and the lesson youre teaching your kids by taking away presents seems to violate the spirit of christmas that seems counterproductive " still he concedes "its easy for me to take the high road my kids have never come close to doing anything that would warrant such a punishment maybe id feel less generous and more torn if they had " my take on this is colored by the fact that i actually have some experience here i too failed out of college i was working as a free lance photojournalist with a national news agency while attending louisiana state university and i spent far too much time traveling for my job i got ds and fs in my classes including a scuba diving elective my dad was beside himself but he gave me another chance to prove myself and i did re enrolling and earning as and bs the rest of the way he didnt take anything away from me he continued to pay my college costs he continued to send christmas and birthday gifts ultimately the message i got was this people screw up as parents your job is to help them on their way again and you dont punish them by withholding acts of love and kindness thats particularly true during the holidays or birthdays or any moment when gifts are given because even if your kids mess up giving is a show of generosity and love and thats a far more powerful message than withholding a present as an expression of disappointment and punishment anne says she knew what she was going to do the moment she read my email asking what it takes for a kid to find a lump of coal in a christmas stocking "a lump of coal never " she says "when it comes to giving whether time money or stuff its better to have always been generous and be called a chump than withhold and always wonder if you should have instead given "
