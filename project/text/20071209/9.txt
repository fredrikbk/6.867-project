assistance program "and call your doctors before you sign and ask do you work with this plan " an agent also should be willing to show how the plan being recommended stacks up against other offerings when it comes to costs and coverage " if they wont do a comparison for you you shouldnt sign up " says ms hudson consumers should make sure that an agent is licensed according to federal law only state licensed agents are permitted to sell medicare insurance dont provide any personal data especially a social security number until a purchase is certain another basic step collect a business card
