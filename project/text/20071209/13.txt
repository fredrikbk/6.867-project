the fed gets ready to cut rates again martin barnes editor of the bank credit analyst a financial forecasting service figures the federal funds rate would have to drop to to justify such yields "to be bullish on bond yields coming down more youd need to be expecting a recession " mr barnes says in a recession the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation a better measure of the cost of borrowing than the nominal rate typically falls to zero when the federal reserve cuts interest rates its normally good news for the bond market but though the federal reserve is likely to trim its target for short term interest rates from on tuesday the opportunities for additional profits might be slim and risks of a loss high that means if you were hoping to make additional money on your bond investments from further drops in rates the opportunity may have passed investment grade corporate bonds might be a better bet the fed already trimmed rates a half percentage point in september and a quarter point in october at that last meeting fed officials thought they had done enough to see the economy through its current housing induced air pocket and back on the road to recovery by the middle of next year but since then financial markets have become increasingly strained last week the dow jones industrial average rose after a midweek surge countered earlier declines the benchmark year treasury fell points for the week lifting its yield to investors are shunning anything that they fear holds tainted securities linked to subprime mortgages the lack of demand for such securities is rippling back to consumers and businesses in the form of costlier mortgages and corporate loans and banks are more reluctant to lend even to each other the fed is thus likely to cut the target on the federal funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks to and possibly as low as this week just a month ago economists surveyed by the wall street journal thought the funds rate would hit bottom at next june but the worsening picture has led futures markets to price in a funds rate of between and by june and a quarter point lower than that a year from now ordinarily lower short term interest rates cause longer term bond yields to fall and bond prices which move in the opposite direction to rise that could still happen but the upside for treasurys is limited by the fact their prices already reflect so much bad news ten year yields have already fallen to from in june two year yields have fallen even more sharply to from martin barnes editor of the bank credit analyst a financial forecasting service figures the federal funds rate would have to drop to to justify such yields "to be bullish on bond yields coming down more youd need to be expecting a recession " economists put the odds of recession at only one in three if theyre right and the economy proves more resilient than wall streets current gloom implies yields could shoot higher saddling bond holders with subpar returns flight to safety yields are also being held artificially low by a "flight to safety " that means investors are willing to accept far lower returns than the economic outlook ought to dictate because they are so averse to losing any money on riskier bonds a resumption of normal risk appetites could cause an exodus out of treasurys of course with economic growth likely close to zero and possibly negative in the current quarter the odds of a recession are rising if the fed concludes one is likely it is likely to cut rates more aggressively mr barnes says in a recession the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation a better measure of the cost of borrowing than the nominal rate typically falls to zero since underlying inflation is now a little over that implies the fed funds rate would fall as low as to yet even in a recession the upside for treasurys may be limited david ader fixed income strategist at rbs greenwich capital thinks that in a recession the fed funds rate will fall to and the two year treasury yield to but he sees year yields a bit higher than they are today at around treasury yields hit a year low of in but circumstances are different today then the fed worried that deflation or generally falling prices could take hold and cut the funds rate to many economists and some fed officials now think the fed overreacted and those low rates helped create the housing bubble whose bursting is the source of todays crisis that could make the central bank reluctant to go so low again "youd be giving the drugs back to the addict " says thomas joseph marta fixed income strategist at rbc capital markets second that drop in yields was fueled in part by buying related to hedging of portfolios of fixed rate mortgages by mortgage agencies fannie mae and freddie mac today more mortgages carry adjustable rates so the phenomenon is less pronounced mr ader says in addition one major source of demand for treasurys foreign central banks is slackening a bit as they divert some of their massive currency reserves to higher returning alternatives like stocks and mortgage backed securities says amitabh arora global head of interest rate strategy at lehman brothers he sees year yields climbing to between and by the end of next year finally inflation risks are higher than in soaring energy prices could drive overall inflation temporarily over if people begin to act like thats here to stay underlying inflation could ratchet higher as well and the boost to productivity from the maturing technology boom is also fading with slower labor force growth the fed thinks that the economy can now grow only as much as a year without fueling inflation compared with the last decades average growth of email forum sunday wsj com
