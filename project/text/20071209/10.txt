real time from pet to net a kids tv show leaves your columnist pondering a generation of immense change online edition so far and that sound was a father frantically knocking wood my year old son has been merciful in picking favorite tv shows since discovering noggin and discovery kids hes gone from the amiably british "maisy" and " zoo lane" and the placidly classical "little bear" to the pumped up do gooderism of "dora the explorer" and "go diego go " and now best of all to "the magic school bus " while i know the inane but catchy "dora" theme song will surface in my brain without warning for the rest of my life all things considered weve had it good the sleep inducing repetition of "blues clues" never interested joshua to say nothing of the razors on a chalkboard experience of "barney &amp friends " before i became a dad it wasnt diapers or sleeplessness that scared me so much as the idea that i might have to watch barney for the uninitiated "the magic school bus" is a half hour show featuring the voice of lily tomlin as ms frizzle a daffy science teacher with a remarkably capable iguana and a magic bus that can transform a la "fantastic voyage " into a spaceship animal or most any other form required to teach lessons about science "the magic school bus" fascinates joshua and ive heard bits of the science hes absorbed come back to us in the backyard or on walks around our neighborhood thats great except theres one episode that doesnt seem to fit the world joshua will inherit that episode is "the magic school bus gets programmed " which originally aired in november in it ms frizzles kids program a school computer to automate a host of chores from turning on sprinklers to raising the flag when things go wackily awry the kids shrink down and plunge into the computers guts tracing the flow of bits and ultimately learning that a computer only does what its programmer tells it to turns out its been programmed to perform its tasks every minute instead of every day the episodes a descendent of innumerable technology gone amok science fiction stories with the usual plot shortcuts for instance doesnt using a computer to raise a flag require a bit more than an ethernet cable but what really surprised me was that in its treatment of computers "the magic school bus gets programmed" felt like something out of my childhoods not joshuas flash back to the fall of the sixth grade and something new in our classroom it was a commodore pet with a big keyboard below and a little monitor up top and it sat in the front of our classroom like a monolith with we sixth graders the ape men expected to somehow extract lessons from it we learned the anatomy of the computer and then moved on to basic programming a snippet of which will remain stuck in my brain as long as the "dora" theme song check this out for a useful program  print jason is great goto run i also remember though years later i cant recall whether i got this from my teachers my classmates or myself that the message of the fall of was that we had to learn to program posthaste our pet computer was the future and the ability to talk with it was a necessity if we were to navigate the future fail to master basic and you might as well head for the mines as it turned out that commodore computer was the future but not in the way we thought that snippet of basic is all i remember of programming thriving in the digital age no more depends on knowing how to program than being able to drive depends on being able to build a car the idea that some people would specialize in programming with the rest of us using their creations was oddly elusive in even though it was the rule for most of the other technologies that shaped daily life and theres another leap required to connect my sixth grade experience with today the idea that the true value of the computer was its connection to millions of other computers i used a computer through high school and college but it was really just a better typewriter ok a much better typewriter that could also play primitive videogames i didnt take my first tentative steps onto the net until i got an america online account a couple of years after graduating from college to be fair that "magic school bus" episode is years old and years ago the net was only just emerging as a consumer medium hampered by the "last mile" problem limiting most home connections to dial up speeds but the broad outlines of the future were already apparent aol was a household name there were debates over amazon and i made my living working at an online newspaper though look at this ancient article of mine it feels like i should have written this story on deerskin with a stub of charcoal despite being just a decade old the computer episode is as relevant to joshuas life as a episode featuring a computer the size of a room would be "the magic school bus" has passed into the afterlife of syndication but suppose the computer episode were updated for a audience i suspect it would transpose its examination of the innards of a computer to the internet tracing the packets that made up a web request what lesson would be drawn a good one would be the perils of a poorly constructed search query with the miniaturized kids having to pull themselves out of a sea of irrelevant search results out of date web pages and spam blogs joshua wont have to learn programming to succeed but he will have to be savvy about how to word a web search so that he gets what hes actually looking for and hell need horse sense to tell the good results from the bad we all know people who are either bad at constructing web searches miss the cues that a web page is garbage or both and we fret that theyll fall prey to phishers or just miss out on things those paired skills logical searching and horse sense are increasingly necessary for people in every walk of life theyre the st century equivalent of the "fair hand" required of anyone who wrote business correspondence in the th century and therein lies a bit of irony in i thought id have to become a programmer to avoid being left behind in a world ruled by machines in fact the disciplines i needed were already well established the precepts of boolean logic date back to the s and horse sense well its as old as we are how to teach these old skills maybe ms frizzle can help what would you consider must have computer skills of the future what will you teach your kids and what will lose importance as time passes join me and other online journal readers in an ongoing discussion on the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
