journal report philanthropy philanthropys role in disaster relief online edition edward blakely says rebuilding new orleans from hurricane katrina is perhaps "the toughest job in america " running the citys office of recovery management is the latest challenge in dr blakelys long career as an academic and urban disaster recovery planner which has included restoring oakland calif after wildfires in and the loma prieta earthquake of the pre katrina population of new orleans was an estimated after the hurricane struck it shrank to below now there are more than people living in the city among some abandoned homes and a lot of blight dr blakely says in an interview with the wall street journal online he explained how philanthropic foundations are instrumental not only as donors of money but also by providing logistical support expert analysis and human services in new orleans and other cities suffering from natural disasters the wall street journal online what role do philanthropists play in urban redevelopment and at what stages are they crucial edward blakely they help to provide funding that local governments cannot provide otherwise they also provide the essential role of demonstrating the commitment of the broader community to the efforts finally they provide an opportunity for external analysis and critiques of both the plans as they are laid out and the success in reaching set development goals with specific regard to new orleans the foundations provided the seed capital for my recovery office assisted in the identification of consultants and other resources and linked us to other communities with similar issues the katrina index for example is by brookings with funding from the rockefeller foundation and the ford foundation the clinton foundation analyzes green policies and programs policylink a public policy foundation was able to assist us in working with planners from oakland who had experienced a fire and an earthquake wsj com as someone who has been involved in recovery efforts in other post disaster areas what have been the unique challenges in new orleans dr blakely the greatest challenge in new orleans is the fact that as in many cities the community had many issues well before the hurricane housing abandonment schools closed and turned over to the state and public housing closed by the federal government now when you try to put the city back together and you dont have a public school system then thats problematic if you dont have public housing you dont have a place to house these citizens while youre building new housing many people expect the limited federal resources and others to solve all of these problems not just the storm problems we had significant blight before katrina though not quite on the scale of detroit wsj com how can philanthropists help with the longer term needs of communities with damaged housing and blight dr blakely in new orleans we have two problems the storm made property values go down but the cost of rebuilding didnt go down so the loan to value ratio is too low were working with the foundations like freddie mac and ford to create a blight financing program treating the home as it was valued pre katrina we need foundations that are accustomed to giving to think about investing using their endowments and asset portfolios to work with the banks and provide backstopping for home loans that regulators would normally reject because of loan to value ratios then we would work with the neighborhood to come up with funding packages for five neighbors or ten wsj com what national foundations and agencies play a significant role in connecting with individual donors dr blakely our largest supporters have been the ford foundation the rockefeller foundation the bill &amp melinda gates foundation and the clinton foundation wsj com what role have private donations played in the recovery of property and buildings there as compared to federal funding from the federal emergency management agency or the us department of housing and urban development dr blakely the federal agencies provide money for things sidewalks fire hydrants buildings for example foundations provide money for people homeless services mental health counseling housing consultation there is still not enough private support for anti crime programs and youth development wsj com about how much of the philanthropic support to rebuild new orleans comes from in state and how much of it is national dr blakely support for new orleans has come from sources world wide given this along with the fact that most of the foundations providing funding to the office of recovery management are from outside louisiana it is clear that most of our support has come from out of state it is difficult to quantify but the value is certainly in the hundreds of millions of dollars if we include all of the volunteer resources
