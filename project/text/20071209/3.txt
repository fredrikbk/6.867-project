eyes on the road amid slowing sales luxury car makers tout holiday deals lexus leads the way with catchy slogan online edition yes virginia there is a santa claus he wants you to buy a luxury car the year end luxury car sales "events" are starting to kick in to gear i hadnt noticed as ive been watching almost no television since the writers strike took my favorite late night fake news programs off the air but sure enough there on lexuss web site is a version of their latest "december to remember" ad a cuddly one minute drama in which a man standing outside in the snow calls his wife to say he cant pick up their son exasperated she hangs up on him throws on a coat marches outside and finds her hubby and boy posing next to a shiny lexus rx with a huge bow on top "just a little something " he says gosh get me a hankie who needs jimmy stewart this year the advent of the luxury car year end clearance promotion season serves to highlight the auto industrys "two americas" problem for brands such as chevrolet dodge and ford that cater to middle class working people the last several months have been nasty going as last weeks november sales results demonstrated the coming months dont look very promising either detroit brand large pickups and big sport utilities are stacking up like cordwood on dealer lots and factories that make them are preparing to go dark for extra weeks beyond the usual year end holiday shutdown period but so far sales for the strongest luxury brands have held up pretty well despite the mortgage and housing market collapse turmoil at some of wall streets big name banks and gyrating gasoline prices while total light vehicle sales in the u s are down for the year through nov lexus sales are up bmw sales are up mercedes benz sales are ahead and audi is up ford motor co s lincoln brand has had one of the best years in the luxury segment boosting sales by primarily because of the lincoln mkx mid sized crossover which is now its best selling model still lincoln sales are well down from the glory days when it was americas no luxury brand a few luxury brands havent fared so well sales at cadillac acura and volvo are down but some of that reflects dips in demand for aging models and the lag in ramping up new models the redesigned cadillac cts appears to be off to a strong start with demand strong and inventories relatively tight the top luxury brands have no need to go nuts passing around the holiday grog just because the blue collar brands are in a bind "most of the deals we are aware of by the luxury auto makers are less generous than what we have seen in the past " says jesse toprak executive director of industry analysis for edmunds com the car shopping site still there are some packages under the tree particularly for flexible shoppers who are willing to accept last years model with a color scheme or features that arent their first choice so long as the monthly lease payment flies under a certain target data from edmunds com and power information network while hard to compare directly because of different methodologies show the same basic trend that luxury models get a bit less expensive in december last year for example average monthly payments for lexus rxs sold in december fell to &# from &# in october the first month of the new model year according to power information network data overall monthly payments in the rxs segment fell to &# in december from &# in october a bargain minded luxury car buyer sounds like a contradiction in terms but such customers are real and this is their month at meade lexus in suburban detroit for example general manager mike mannone says this month he could put a customer into a three year lease for a lexus rx crossover at around &# a month compared to &# or &# a month during the rest of the year a savings to the customer of about &# over three years depending on how you want to look at it thats enough for that guy in the lexus ad to buy himself a big screen tv for the man cave ho ho ho mercedes benz is cheering dealers with heavy promotion of its "winter event " the daimler ag brands answer to the lexus "december to remember " the redesigned c class is drawing in new customers with its sub &# base price at autonation inc the biggest mercedes retailer in the u s the new c class now accounts for about of total mercedes sales and is pulling customers out of middle brow brands the only complaint from autonation executives is that there arent more c classes available says autonation spokesman marc cannon mercedes is offering bigger discounts from list price on other models including the e sedan which has a &# a month month lease offer or financing this season mr toprak says edmunds has discovered discounts of as much as &# on leftover sl amg models and &# in cash to dealer discounts on sl s however mr toprak says overall mercedes inventories are tight so the big discounts are available on a fairly small quantity of leftover stock bmw ag is starting to promote year end deals on some of its models such as a series sedan for &# a month or a i sedan for &# a month for months youll have to click around on bmws site to find this stuff though unlike lexus and mercedes and some other brands bmw usa isnt trumpeting the holiday offers on its web page surfing other luxury brands web sites its clear that one big source of lexus envy among rival brands besides the fact that lexus is no is that lexus marketing was first to come up with "december to remember" as the slogan for their year closing promotion program the "lincoln mercury wish list event" just doesnt have that same ring ding a ling but perhaps a month &# a month lease deal on a front wheel drive lincoln mkx will overcome that lack of rhyme appeal for some folks the activity in the luxury car market is a nice way for shoppers dealers and car makers to enjoy the days left before christmas today its jingle bells and laughing all the way in your brand new cabriolet come january barring a big shift in expectations for the economy the tune will change anyone want to hear "baby its cold outside " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
