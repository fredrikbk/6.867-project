the daily fix yankees keep winter at bay with a win over cleveland last night the new york yankees were trailing the cleveland indians by three runs roger clemens had walked off the mound after a dismal performance in what could be his final big league appearance and george steinbrenner had popped his head up long enough to threaten joe torres job it looked like a singularly depressing lights out for the yankees with the club on the brink of winter fans of the bronx bombers were left to shake their heads at an astonishing weekend could joe lose his job and a rod become a cub or a dodger or an angel because of a bunch of bugs but then the yankees awoke johnny damon smacked a three run homer and the yanks came roaring back to beat the indians and live another day in the newark star ledger steve politi notes the change of generations in the bronx a crumbling clemens was rescued by philip hughes and joba chamberlain whose combined ages dont equal clemens "in a season when the yankees rediscovered what youth and energy meant for a baseball team that for so long had been too old and bloated a year old kid would have to save them from an ignominious first round sweep " mr politi writes adding "clemens made &# million for six regular season victories and batters yesterday before his body failed him again he was pitching in the major leagues before hughes was born hughes a foot righty from california is the kid with the future one of the biggest prospects in an organization that has finally remembered that building from within is the way that it won four championships from " in the bergen record bob klapisch has some advice for the yankee skipper "torre should call a preemptive news conference resign before steinbrenner boots him and say take that for the years of back stabbing and machiavellian politics take that or maybe torre will choose another two word response for steinbrenners willingness to sabotage the yankees on the eve of their most critical game of the season " the steinbrenner game followed what will always be known as the bug game on friday night mr chamberlain was trying to protect a yanks lead when a cloud of midges arrived off lake erie tormenting the young reliever into walks hit batsmen and wild pitches the indians fausto carmona kept his composure and the indians prevailed in too weird a game to go unchronicled by the fix so heres the new york posts joel sherman "chamberlains biggest opponents last night were pesky and relentless and he also had to deal with the indians " in forcing a game the yankees did what the philadelphia phillies chicago cubs and anaheim angles could not those three teams saw their seasons end over the weekend without a single playoff victory leaving the arizona diamondbacks colorado rockies and boston red sox to wait around for a chance to play again the winners will get more pixels in the days to come so the fix will offer requiems for the departed saturday was an ugly exit for the cubs who didnt even get one pitch of support from the wrigley field faithful rich hills first offering was smacked into the left field bleachers by arizonas chris young the start of a dreary finale "there are all kinds of silences " writes rick morrissey in the chicago tribune "embarrassed silences uncomfortable silences stunned silences there was some of all that at wrigley field on saturday evening but there really is only one kind of booing that would be angry booing as the night wore on and as more and more cubs failed miserably in key situations at the plate the angry booing grew and grew " the phillies capped a thrilling summer by beating the new york mets at the wire but expired saturday as the rockies won in the philadelphia inquirer phil sheridan begins with chase utleys salute to the phils desire to win "even as he said the words this phillies team had ceased to exist " mr sheridan writes "its individual members were walking around the visiting clubhouse at coors field wet haired from the shower and oddly formal in their street clothes they had taken off their uniforms for the last time in some of them will be back in and beyond others will never wear a phillies uniform again this exact mix of men with their talents and shortcomings their personalities and quirks will never play together again " sunday was the end for the injury plagued anaheim angels on the short end of a thrashing by the red sox "the angels quest to win this division series quickly became the equivalent of hunting moby dick with a cane pole " writes mark whicker in the orange county register "it happened when casey kotchman came up sick and when garret anderson having failed to pick up mike lowells second inning double near the left field line had to be removed " at halos heaven meanwhile its morrissey time a college football stunner stanford arrived at top ranked usc as point underdogs coming off two weeks and points surrendered to oregon and ucla and starting a backup qb with three college passes to his name no matter the cardinal prevailed with tavita prichard hitting mark bradford for the game winner with seconds to go "nothing that happens in this college football season should shock us " writes russell levine in the new york sun "not after appalachian state won at michigan not after syracuse and its pop warner offense lit up louisville not south florida in the top not a weekend with five of the top teams in the ap poll losing four of them to unranked opponents yet saturday offered up a jaw dropper big enough to make all those moments take a distant back seat " this mr levin writes "was mike tyson losing to buster douglas in tokyo this was the jets beating the colts in super bowl iii if it wasnt quite the equal of the miracle on ice its only because there were no geo political implications even so in football terms the berlin wall just fell " the green bay packers dreams of an unbeaten season behind a revitalized brett favre evaporated in a stunning second half insurrection by the undermanned chicago bears who walked off winners in the chicago sun times jay mariotti writes that "starting with brian griese apologize people they were smarter and more efficient than the packers who opened the game with several huge offensive gains through massive holes but also gave the bears life with turnover after killer turnover five in all even amid his classic renaissance favre still can be careless reckless and yes plain country dumb " in pittsburgh a matchup of teams was no contest the steelers steamrolled the seattle seahawks "the seahawks couldve left before the game even started and made a stronger impression " fumes jerry brewer in the seattle times "pittsburgh was missing its two finest defensive players and both starting wide receivers but the steelers still forced seattle to waggle through a zilch defeat it was a defeat so bad you must question the seahawks status as contenders " the good feelings came to an abrupt halt for the detroit lions soundly beaten by the washington redskins in the washington post thomas boswell praises the man behind the center "in his th start as the washington redskins quarterback jason campbell showed for the first time that he is capable of the kind of spectacular performance that is essential if a young passer is to become a genuine star " he writes "solid games and promising performances of which campbell has already had plenty arent enough in the nfl sometimes you have to light it up complete almost every pass and lead long drives on a day when many of the best players around you are injured and absent thats what campbell did at fedex field yesterday " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
