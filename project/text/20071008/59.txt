politics &amp economics how one iraqi defeats terror qader works like a cop to bring peace to mosul haunted by hussein ties mosul iraq col saleem qader laughed as the dead mans cellphone began to ring "terrorists " said col qader the top iraqi army intelligence officer here gesturing toward a bullet ridden opel sedan containing the corpses of three sunni extremists who had just tried to kill him "and now other terrorists are calling them on the phone wondering how the attack went i should tell them it didnt go so well " in the battle to stabilize iraq the incident represented more than just the aftermath of another run in with insurgents u s commanders say col qader has helped pacify this once restive city by solving what they say is one of their most vexing problems developing detailed intelligence about insurgent groups like the one that col qader says had employed the three dead men in mosul col qader has addressed the intelligence gap through a combination of old fashioned police work he maintains a network of informants including some inside the militant groups and armed raids that he usually leads himself "qader works like a cop " said capt luke stangland a u s military adviser who works closely with col qader "he understands that the fight here is more police work than it is conventional military intelligence work " u s commanders give col qader much of the credit for a striking improvement in the citys security situation there hasnt been a car bomb or large scale attack here since early may and u s commanders say the number of attacks has dropped to seven or nine a day from to earlier this year fewer than a dozen americans have died in mosul this year a sharp reduction from in much of iraq the u s continues to struggle to understand how the militants work and what attacks they are planning addressing those shortcomings is a central aspect of the bush administrations "surge" strategy of keeping more troops in iraq and is critical to its broader goal of stabilizing the country gen david petraeus the top u s commander in iraq and his senior officers believe that having u s troops live in small outposts in neighborhoods will spur iraqis to come forward with tips about insurgent activity similarly the u s is giving ammunition and money to sunni tribes in anbar region in an effort to persuade them to funnel information to the u s as well as fight the militants on their own but some of the problems in combating militants lie with americas allies in the iraqi government as col qaders story illustrates because col qader a year old kurd toiled loyally in the army of saddam hussein at the time of the former iraqi strongmans brutal anti kurdish campaign known as the "anfal " his job is threatened by his superiors gen babakir al zibari chief of staff for the entire iraqi military and also a kurd has ordered col qaders commanders to replace him said u s officials the commanders have so far refused gen zibari responded by cutting off col qaders salary and delaying the promotions of his commanders these people said col qader spent years in mr husseins army he said the kurdish military tried to recruit him to work against mr hussein but he demurred out of a sense of duty to the iraqi army "i have one ideology if i work with you i stay with you forever " col qader said "i cant work for two sides " that answer has done nothing to assuage some other influential kurds including gen zibari who spent much of his life battling mr hussein and has told u s officials that he sees col qader as a traitor to his people through a spokesman gen zibari declined to comment the return of alumni of the former regime has sparked tensions between u s commanders who need qualified iraqi security personnel and the shiites and kurds running iraqs government who believe that those who served mr hussein should be banned from serving in the new iraq col qader said he is leaning toward retirement "its very painful for your own government to treat you like an enemy " he said sipping sweetened tea in his spartan office "i am risking my life everyday and for what " u s commanders said col qaders departure would significantly weaken their efforts here "hes tough as nails and it would be an enormous blow to the city if he were fired " said col christopher mitchell who advises col qader and his commanders for now col qader battles mosuls insurgents this summer he killed two of the biggest u s and iraqi targets here an al qaeda "emir" known as safi and an alleged car bomb engineer mowafaq yassin yunis the august mission that resulted in mr yuniss death is illustrative of col qaders methods it began when an insurgent who had been funneling information to col qader told him that the elusive mr yunis would be spending the night in his own home col qader and his men searched the house but saw no sign of the insurgent col qader said he climbed onto the roof and noticed that the house seemed bigger from the outside he re examined the interior and discovered a wall in the common room concealed a bunker col qader said his men drilled a hole into the bunker where they found mr yunis hiding and ordered him to surrender mr yunis opened fire when he refused repeated demands to leave the bunker col qader threw in a grenade killing him col qader said he would have preferred to take him alive "he could have given us tons of information " col qader said "from an intelligence point of view killing him was kind of a waste "
