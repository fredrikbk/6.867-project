the evening wrap britains way out online edition amid continuing shiite strife in southern iraq britains plan to withdraw nearly half of its remaining soldiers moves a key area of the country closer to life without coalition troops on monday prime minister gordon brown said that by next spring britain will cut its forces in iraq now massed at an air base outside the countrys oil rich second city of basra to about during a visit to iraq last week the new prime minister said that in a first stage some soldiers would return home before years end and iraqi forces would assume responsibility for security in the province within two months "we plan to move to a second stage of overwatch where the coalition would maintain a more limited re intervention capacity and where the main focus will be on training and mentoring " mr brown said monday early on in the iraq fight basra in the heart of the oil rich mostly shiite south was considered a relative bright spot for the coalition occupation unlike the baghdad area and sunni regions to the north it wasnt caught in a paroxysm of insurgency and sectarian violence britains relatively hands off approach was pointed to by some as a model for winning hearts and minds of the locals since then criticism has grown however the british are now faulted by some for allowing militias to become the de facto rulers of the region and while it has been spared the worst of the sunni shiite bloodshed basra over the last year or so has been gripped by intra shiite tensions with various factions struggling to control the city they include for example the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq a powerful and well armed shiite party based in iran during saddam husseins rule and other shadowy elements linked to firebrand cleric moqtada al sadr the fate of basra and its environs is critical to iraqs future basra is the countrys only port city and also a major interface with neighboring iran but perhaps more important is the oil in the region a february report on the basra area from the washington institute for near east study said the four southernmost provinces of iraq include an estimated of iraqs proven oil reserves and over of government revenues those riches in the wrong hands could doom efforts to achieve national peace and stability "from being the heart of iraqs oil industry basra is increasingly a kleptocracy used by islamist militias to fill their war chests " wrote analysts for the washington institute militias seem to be putting such funds to use in late august fighting broke out among shiite militias at a religious festival leaving dozens dead then in late september two associates of top shiite cleric grand ayatollah ali al sistani were killed within minutes of each other in basra and another southern city diwaniyah on saturday two of the most powerful shiite leaders mr sadr and the head of the supreme islamic iraqi council abdul aziz al hakim agreed to end the bitter rivalry that has fueled recent bloodshed it remains to be seen if the compromise will stick a troop drawdown has long been thought to be a goal of mr brown among other things he is under heavy political pressure to take a different line from that of predecessor tony blair on the iraq war which remains unpopular among britons cynics will say that the withdrawal signifies recognition that achieving a good measure of security in the south is now beyond the hopes of british forces about british soldiers have died in iraq since march and the nation is also still entangled in afghanistan where some british personnel including soldiers have been killed and about troops are stationed in increasingly restive helmand province stocks sink ahead of earnings stocks moved lower monday after midday
