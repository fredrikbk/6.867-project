ceo transforms merrill but shift comes at a cost in nearly five years as merrill lynch &amp co s chief executive e stanley oneal has remade americas no stock brokerage firm he has transformed "mother merrill" into a more darwinian performance driven organization that puts greater emphasis on riskier bets and relies less on just selling stocks mr oneals higher tolerance for risk has come with a low tolerance for mistakes he has undertaken periodic sometimes brutal shakeups of top executives including one last week the cultural change has boosted merrills profits with its return on equity a key measure of profitability rising to from in just before mr oneal took command but the metamorphosis at merrill hasnt come without some heavy costs as made clear by last weeks profit warning and the firms announcement of a &# billion write down on its huge inventory of risky securities backed by subprime mortgages the write down which comes just three months after merrills finance chief had assured investors the firms exposure to subprime mortgages was "limited contained and appropriate " prompted mr oneals decision to oust two top executives in the firms fixed income business and to order another top executive who had planned to leave in may but was still on the premises to vacate his office immediately the ousters underscore how much merrill today is an institution modeled on and by one man mr oneal the result say both present and past merrill employees is a loss of institutional memory and experience that some feel makes merrill less equipped to deal with the ups and downs of the market the "cultural change" and the accompanying turnover may have cost merrill a loss of "more institutional memory than they would have liked " said analyst mike mayo of deutsche bank ag but he said that even after the loss the firms return on equity for should still comfortably exceed its historical average of merrill executives defend mr oneals management style "stan is a smart tough successful ceo and you need to be very capable and confident to interact with him he doesnt suffer fools gladly " says gregory fleming who was named merrills co president in may other executives at the firm point out that even after the multibillion dollar hit merrill is taking on its mortgage linked bonds the firm expects to report its second highest profit ever this year a testament to its ability to absorb such a big loss "hes a pretty no nonsense guy " said analyst david trone of fox pitt kelton "this was a historic loss and the buck stops with the business heads and theyre held accountable " the year old mr oneal has been comfortable being in charge and taking charge in july six months after becoming ceo he ousted two top executives including his then no thomas patrick who had helped engineer mr oneals ascent as ceo after mr patrick objected to the firing of another executive arshad zakaria who was campaigning to become the firms president in july mr oneal cleared out four executives who had led the firms fixed income business in their stead he promoted a less seasoned executive osman semerci mr semerci was one of the credit market executives merrill dismissed last week "i dont think theres a choice in the modern capital markets for firms like us not to take risks " mr oneal said in a video shown to merrill employees friday clients demand it he said and wont pay for mere "execution " the alternative he said would be to accept "sub par returns" or become part of a "larger entity " depriving merrill of the ability to "control our own destiny " mr oneal said that during the summer credit crunch that worsened dramatically in august the firm managed risk well in its other businesses such as financing commitments for risky debt financed buyouts its planned write down of &# million after offsetting fees on those commitments was less than that of some rivals while some of mr oneals moves such as acquiring a stake in bond manager blackrock inc have won praise from investors he has been criticized for others especially paying &# billion for first franklin corp an originator of subprime mortgages in january shortly before the bottom fell out of the market for such mortgages subprime mortgages are home loans aimed at borrowers with weak credit histories merrills stock has trailed that of some major rivals since december the start of mr oneals tenure merrills stock has risen compared with for goldman sachs group inc for lehman brothers holdings inc and for bear stearns cos only morgan stanley which like merrill had less exposure to bonds during a booming bond market trailed merrill lynch with a increase counting a stake shareholders received in june in morgan stanleys discover credit card business mr oneal the descendant of a former slave grew up in poverty and rose to become one of the highest ranking african americans on wall street his career started at general motors corp which helped pay for his harvard business degree he joined merrill as a banker in the junk bond department in in his early merrill jobs mr oneals role was mostly on the client contact side and seldom on a trading desk in as he vied for the ceo post from the helm of merrills army of brokers he re engineered the firms brokerage business cutting costs by shifting small accounts to less expensive call centers the rising profits at the business were a deciding factor in his capturing the top job with the backing of mr patrick then chief financial officer in mid after winning the boards nod he presided over a wrenching job cutback after the collapse of the tech stock bubble pursuing his stated goal of reducing the firms reliance on stock market revenues to down from as much as mr oneal also built up the firms exposure to bonds and commodities by he had nearly doubled the firms profit margins to and started showing quarterly profits of &# billion a quarter strengthening his hand in a boardroom showdown with mr patrick and mr zakaria which resulted in the departure of both executives amid criticism that he had pushed too many experienced merrill executives from the firm mr oneal rehired one alumnus robert mccann to oversee the firms wealth management organization including the brokerage business and merrills asset management unit but last year the scope of mr mccanns role narrowed when merrill swapped its money management business for the blackrock stake mr oneal has a harsh side that can intimidate colleagues and critics say discourage debate and dissenting views until may he was also reluctant to share power holding all three top jobs at the firm as chairman chief executive and president a turning point for merrill came last year with the ouster of a team of executives led by jeffrey kronthal who had collectively run the fixed income business mr kronthal had overseen an expansion into exotic debt instruments called collateralized debt obligations these instruments are created by buying various kinds of debt often risky mortgage backed securities pooling them together and using them to back the issuance of new bonds in mr kronthal recruited christopher ricciardi from rival credit suisse group who quickly propelled the firm to the no spot in the cdo arena after mr ricciardi left in to join an asset manager merrill kept up the pace of new cdo issues as a result it earned an estimated &# million in fees last year though this required merrill to keep more and more hard to sell mortgage assets on its balance sheet people familiar with the matter say mr kronthal and two of his deputies who oversaw structured finance instruments including cdos all sounded alarms about merrills rising mortgage exposure starting in mid when investor interest began weakening and some insurers retreated from hedging merrills risks but around the same time mr oneal and his confidant ahmass fakahany egyptian born chief administrative officer were eager to promote mr semerci a rising star with experience in derivative sales who had done well in asia that would mean removing mr kronthal and three co workers from their jobs to make room for mr semerci merrills mr fleming then the co head of the institutional securities business protested according to people close to the firm these people say he was strongly opposed to the appointment of mr semerci and complained to colleagues about the impact of losing seasoned veterans such as mr kronthal the disagreement led to some tension between mr oneal and mr fleming himself a rising star who in may was promoted to co president along with mr fakahany the problems with the rising level of risky mortgage assets which eventually topped &# billion were masked by the fact that the securities were rated triple a which some merrill executives believed meant they didnt pose as much of a loss risk as they did since the loss became apparent merrill has bolstered what mr oneal called "checks and balances" on risk by naming a companywide chief risk officer last month a post that didnt exist before he also named david sobotka chief of a commodity trading business whose profits have soared since merrill acquired it in to replace mr semerci as chief of fixed income corrections &amp amplifications merrill lynch &amp co chief financial officer jeffrey edwards said on july that the firms exposure to subprime mortgages at two bear stearns cos hedge funds was "limited contained and appropriately marked " mr edwards wasnt referring to merrills overall subprime position as incorrectly stated in a moving the market article july the same comments were cited in page one articles saturday and monday about a &# billion write down merrill announced friday without making clear the assurance was limited to the bear funds wsj oct
