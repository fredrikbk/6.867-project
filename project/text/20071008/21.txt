critics question objectivity of government lung scan study tobacco companies paid key researchers as expert witnesses in a dispute with broad implications for cancer treatment patient advocates and congressional overseers are raising questions about the objectivity of a massive federal study that is supposed to determine whether annual ct scans of smokers lungs can save lives the nine year study called the national lung screening trial is tracking smokers at a cost of &# million and is funded by the national cancer institute or nci due to be finished in the study is expected to have a major impact on whether regular ct scans for smokers will become a standard of care and whether tobacco companies could be forced to pay for them the million current and former smokers in the u s are all potential candidates for such screening since late last year the lung cancer alliance a washington d c nonprofit that supports screening has asserted in letters to the nci and its parent the national institutes of health that two of the studys key researchers have conflicts of interest because they have accepted money from tobacco companies to be expert defense witnesses in lawsuits the suits sought to force the companies to pay for annual ct screening the alliance which is funded by individual donations and corporate grants including &# from general electric co a maker of ct scanners also charged the study has design flaws that could bias its outcome against screening in recent months staffers of the u s house energy and commerce committee which oversees medical research issues have also begun making inquiries about the alleged conflicts and design issues say people familiar with the matter the question under consideration in the study is a complex one ct or computed tomography scanning is adept at detecting abnormalities that might be cancerous but once they are detected potentially risky lung biopsies are usually needed to confirm the presence of cancer in the lung often the biopsies turn up no cancer skeptics say patients may suffer health problems as a result of universal screening such as complications from biopsies or needless surgery offsetting any gains from enhanced detection the researchers that the alliance and the congressional staffers are focused on are university of california los angeles radiologist denise aberle one of the studys two national leaders and dartmouth college radiologist william black the principal investigator at one of the study sites in the country in a trial of a lawsuit brought in state court in louisiana dr aberle testified for the american tobacco co now part of reynolds american inc that "it is reckless or irresponsible to promote" ct screening court transcripts in the louisiana case show that dr aberles role as co leader of the government study was highlighted repeatedly american tobacco lawyer gary long says that what made dr aberle a good witness was "the fact she could talk about the national lung cancer screening trial that is ongoing " in a similar case in new york dr black provided an expert report for philip morris usa a unit of altria group inc in which he warned that ct screening "may do more harm than good " smokers lost their bid for screening in the louisiana case the new york case is still pending as is similar case in massachusetts the lawsuits havent been closely followed by the media and the researchers roles in the cases werent widely known until the alliance discovered them the nih doesnt have conflict of interest rules for the nongovernment researchers it funds and relies instead on the institutions where the researchers work to set guidelines universities generally require their faculty researchers to disclose consulting arrangements and other financial ties and some schools ban some relationships outright dr aberle denies any bias and says she decided to testify because the screening plan proposed by the plaintiffs in the louisiana case was "poorly constructed" and "incompletely conceived " among the flaws she said was the lack of a plan for how the patients would be treated following a screening test or any provision to track patients to find out if screening had any impact dr aberle and ucla say her expert work in the case was permissible under ucla rules american tobacco paid a total of &# for dr aberles expert work in the louisiana case according to her and ucla the money after taxes was then deposited into a ucla account ucla says she used the money for "academic enrichment " such as business related travel and entertainment expenses or subscriptions to journals dr black said he agreed to be an expert witness because he "felt an obligation that someone needed to stand up and represent the other side of the screening issue " he added "the other side is getting away with false statements that it is a proven technology and saves lives " dr black now says his decision to get involved in the court case was "naive " he has returned the &# he earned from philip morris and stopped working for the company because of his concern the expert work "would be used against me" and the study "by patient advocacy groups on the other side " dartmouth declined to comment but in a letter to the lung cancer alliance said the work was permissible under its rules in a written response to the lung cancer alliance the nci said the expert witness work was appropriate "service as an expert witness presenting independent analyses based on published medical literature is a commonly accepted activity for physicians researchers and other experts and in the instance of the specific circumstances described did not violate the required disclosure guidelines of the organizations involved " nci director john niederhuber wrote in an interview an nci spokesman said the institute has no way of knowing whether any other investigators in the center study have financial ties to tobacco or scanning companies because it does not examine such potential conflicts a spokeswoman for siemens medical solutions a big ct machine maker said the company works on collaborative research projects with several research institutions but wouldnt say if it has any relationships with individual researchers working on this study ge another large ct vendor declined to comment david rothman the director of the center on medicine as a profession at columbia university medical school said he was "stunned" to learn that the researchers in the government study had testified for tobacco companies and said the nih should overhaul its rules to prohibit such work the lung cancer alliance and others also complain about the trials design in part because it compares patients receiving ct scans with those receiving x rays if abnormalities are detected by x ray and a ct confirms cancer the x ray not the ct will be credited with the discovery critics also say that patients are too few to detect a benefit in its written response to the alliance the nci said that the there are enough patients in the study and that the study is scientifically "very well designed "
