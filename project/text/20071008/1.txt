sunshine soldiers of the gop desert but theyll return someday i think the slight decline in business managers who identify themselves as republican and the high profile businessmen who have begun giving to democrats is largely due to the continual ebb and flow of political parties "gop is losing grip on core business vote " page one oct there are a significant number of "good weather" republicans who are with the party when the sun is shining but quick to jump ship when things are less cheery lets face it there are a lot of people who just like winners they look at the prospects for and see a bad year for republicans however they dont want to be left off the white house christmas card list because they are rich and important people so they switch to who they think will be the winner the republican party will recover and when it does many of those same people will come running back after they get a good look at the democrats tom burton chippewa falls wis im an "eisenhower" republican a liberal when it comes to individual rights but a conservative when it comes to spending taxpayer money i have been dismayed at the steady takeover of the republican party by "dixiecrats" and religious fundamentalists im glad that others finally are reacting to what has been going on ive noticed the same behavior among my clients mostly lifetime republicans who are dropping out of the party i regret their action but i certainly understand it leonard w williams sunnyvale calif the gop just needs to get back to its principles of the past cutting taxes smaller government less government spending having people take responsibility for their own actions in life with the resulting mistakes and not looking for taxpayers or the government to fix their problems with financial help or new programs jeff conte austin texas your front page article notes that "some business leaders are drifting away from the republican party because of the war in iraq the growing federal debt and a conservative social agenda they dont share " those democrat talking points are worthy of a new york times editorial conservative businessmen like conservative professionals conservative moms and conservative window washers are grateful for the war on terrorists in iraq appalled at the profligate spending of congress and satisfied that bushs tax cuts have fueled a business and tax revenue boom they remain just as anti abortion as ever liberals of all occupations have "drifted away" from the republican party for the past years bob jennings baytown texas i am a fiscal conservative republican and had never voted for a democrat in my life until this past year when i and other friends gladly voted for the full democrat ticket in the florida state elections what happened to the republican party why are they involved in so many personal cultural issues and not involved in so many vital government issues why are they in womens bodies and gay peoples bedrooms why cant they get a handle on health care social security illegal immigration and government growth yes my taxes are lower but my sons will be substantially higher and his childrens still higher whats happening with our soaring national debt why are we spending a penny for homeland security in wyoming idaho kansas and other states why do republicans continually fight wars wars on drugs wars on poverty wars on crime wars on terrorism why is everything a war democrats may not be the answer but well soon see how they deal with governance because few people will be left to vote republican john a pfister st augustine fla as fiscally conservative but socially liberal voters in our s my wife and i have traditionally voted republican because we believed the party stood for a strong national defense judicial appointees who dont try to expand the constitution daily and a smaller less intrusive business friendly lower spending government we accepted the republicans social conservatism as the lesser of two evils as long as we were safe from foreign invasion and enjoyed a strong economy with a focus on unrestricted capitalism as opposed to the redistribution of wealth we were able to look the other way when the religious right of the party reared its ugly head based on the track record of the republicans over the past eight years i still feel confident on the national defense and judicial appointee side but as your article points out it is pretty tough to tell at this point the difference between the democrats and the republicans when it comes to spending on top of that while the democrats agenda still sounds like it is cobbled together from the pamphlets and web sites of a hundred different left wing groups the republicans appear more and more every day to march to the tune of the religious right which rankles me as it flies in the face of my own agnostic values we will still likely vote republican in but it is primarily because of the judicial appointee issue it appears that this country grows more ready by the day for a third party that will meet the needs of the disaffected middle those of us who arent out on the radical fringes of the left or the right maybe we could call it the common sense
