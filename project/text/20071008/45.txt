lead counsel in fannie suit is switched out in a fraud lawsuit against fannie mae there has been an unusual changing of the guard for more than two years a boston law firm was a lead counsel in the suit which was filed after federal regulators alleged accounting irregularities at the mortgage company fannie mae denies committing securities fraud on aug berman devalerio pease tabacco burt &amp pucillo of boston a securities litigation firm was replaced as lead counsel by a new york firm previously uninvolved in the case it is rare that a lead plaintiffs counsel knowledgeable about a case gets changed this far into litigation some attorneys involved in the case have speculated about whether political considerations played a role in the change the berman law firm had donated to ohio attorney general marc dann a democrat who is overseeing the case but gave more to his republican opponent a spokesman for mr dann said campaign giving wasnt involved in the decision to switch law firms "there was a professional difference on strategy and tactics so the attorney general made a decision that it was in the best interests of the case that a change needed to be made " the spokesman declined to elaborate saying office policy wasnt to comment on strategy and tactics he said the decision was made with the understanding that some might raise questions about contributions to replace the berman firm mr dann retained william titelman a partner at new yorks bernstein liebhard &amp lifshitz llp a firm that has taken the lead in many securities class action cases mr titelman has long been active in democratic politics including donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to democratic causes "i dont believe politics played a role in the switch " mr titelman said "i dont think anyone out there would say my firm isnt very well qualified to do this kind of work " contributions by law firms to the political campaigns of state and municipal officials are commonplace and not illegal law firms that specialize in class action lawsuits that allege fraud on stockholders compete with each other for the role of lead lawyer public pension funds often act as lead client in these cases so state officials overseeing the funds such as attorneys general and comptrollers receive campaign contributions from law firms "securities law firms get hit up every day for contributions " said fred isquith a new york plaintiffs lawyer the timing of the switch in this case has some questioning whether the donation record played an outsize role "the judge should call a timeout and dig into this " said james cox a securities law professor at duke university school of law who isnt involved in the case the case against fannie mae was initiated in by an individual investor in u s district court in washington d c in ohios then attorney general james petro a republican took the lead in the case on behalf of two ohio state retirement funds he selected two firms to lead the litigation berman devalerio and waite schneider bayless &amp chesley co of cincinnati mr petro left office this year after a failed gubernatorial run mr dann a democrat ran against republican betty montgomery to succeed mr petro last year attorneys at berman devalerio contributed &# to mr danns campaign firm lawyers and their spouses gave &# to ms montgomery in the same period jeffrey block the lead berman partner in the case kicked in &# to the ohio republican party in june after mr dann was in office berman donated &# to the ohio democratic party in august eight months after taking office mr dann dumped berman devalerio the firm said in a statement that it worked effectively with co lead counsel and was disappointed to have been replaced "we were in regular contact with the attorney generals office " the firm said "at no time did anyone indicate there was a disagreement over strategy or tactics " bernstein liebhard lawyers didnt contribute to mr danns campaign or to his opponent in june ethan titelman william titelmans son contributed &# to mr dann and &# to the ohio democratic party ethan titelman a vice president at a communications firm who is involved in democratic politics said his father suggested he consider making the ohio donations but that he researches candidates himself some attorneys in the case said there was friction between berman devalerio and its cincinnati co counsel waite schneider which may have contributed to bermans ouster a lead waite schneider lawyer in the case is stanley chesley one of the nations most prominent plaintiffs attorneys and a longtime backer of democrats he donated &# to the ohio democratic party in june his firm also donates to and has ties to the republican party in ohio mr chesley declined to comment last year a blue ribbon
