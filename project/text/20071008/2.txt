a new mortgage cop dann ex footballer tackles fraud cases targets wall street one of the sharpest attacks on wall street these days is coming from the midwest that is where ohio attorney general marc dann assigns much of the blame for the states record mortgage foreclosure rate a mess he calls "the largest financial scam in american history " the year old democrat has pursued several mortgage cases closer to home delaying foreclosures involving new century financial corp a home lender now operating under bankruptcy court protection he has sued more than a dozen lenders and brokers for allegedly inflating home appraisals and engaging in other practices that misled troubled homeowners mr dann a former high school football player who is known for his determination and the occasional volatile outburst also has broadened his investigation to wall street he is focusing on how investment banks packaged mortgages into securities and how credit rating companies like mcgraw hill cos standard &amp poors moodys corp s moodys investors service and fimalac sas fitch ratings evaluated those securities the three firms downgraded hundreds of the mortgage related bonds as the housing downturn grew more serious and low mortgage underwriting standards became more apparent mr dann a onetime gary hart campaign staffer and divorce lawyer says he is trying to fill a void left by federal regulators who he says havent thoroughly probed how mortgages were turned into securities and sold to investors that could become a hot button campaign issue next year in ohio a key electoral battleground with the highest home foreclosure rate in the nation mr dann has been active on other fronts pursuing investor suits on behalf of ohios pension funds against time warner inc fannie mae and unitedhealth group inc his office also has teamed up with seven states to collect information from news corp s networking web site myspace com about registered sex offenders that had used the site his campaign targeting the mortgage industry has been at the center of his efforts "everyone who helped create this crisis will be held accountable " mr dann said during a sept speech to a group of mortgage officials "my job is to be the bad cop and im comfortable with that role because i believe a terrible crime has been committed " mr dann says he wants to "punish" not only out and out criminal fraudsters but also deep pocketed parties that benefited from the problem and helped enable it his investigations roots reach back to a cleveland campaign visit in when cuyahoga county treasurer jim rokakis suggested mr dann focus on the housing crisis if he wanted to win a tight race for attorney general when mr dann started mentioning the problem in speeches the subject drew more feedback than any other part of his speech mr dann recalls mr dann won of the vote in office he quickly assigned a well known corporate lawyer he had hired to find creative ways to go after foreclosure problems the two soon decided to include rating firms in their investigation in may mr dann warned rating firms that they could face civil penalties under ohios consumer protection laws strengthened this year a couple of months later a handful of moodys representatives traveled to columbus to visit mr dann mr dann was offered a seat at the head of the crowded table but turned it down in favor of sitting closer to his lawyers according to people who attended mr dann and his colleagues said they were interested in rating companies because mortgage bonds that lost value amid the foreclosure problems wouldnt have been sold had rating firms given lower marks initially moodys explained that it has a long history of objectively rating many types of bonds including mortgage securities mr dann is one of several attorneys general focusing on the mortgage industry the attorney general of new york the securities and exchange commission and the committee of european securities regulators also are looking into these issues to his supporters mr dann is a welcome force "marc is sending the signal that there is a sheriff in the state of ohio " mr rokakis says in the past he says "lawlessness reigned " it is easy to draw parallels between mr dann and new york gov eliot spitzer who made a name for himself cracking down on faulty wall street stock research while an attorney general mr dann says he thought about framing a &# check he received during his campaign from mr spitzer unlike mr spitzer who took on big banks by releasing emails he had collected mr dann has yet to release any evidence on the rating firms or other wall street players something his detractors have pointed out he has "condemned rating firms as aiders and abetters" of mortgage problems "without a full fledged investigation " says richard morvillo a partner with mayer brown llp in washington neither mr morvillo nor his firm represent rating firms on the issues mr dann is investigating mr dann says his office has started collecting documents to shed light on the practices of rating firms these may include compensation and expense records that could show how often wall street wines and dines rating firm employees the rating firms say they have done nothing inappropriate and have policies to manage potential conflicts of interest both raters and banks benefit financially when a bond is issued because each usually collects a fee only once the deal is completed since a low rating can kill a deal both parties may have incentives to overlook problems even in risky deals the raters say prospective revenue doesnt influence the quality of ratings mr dann says he hasnt decided yet whether his case against rating companies will try to get money for embattled homeowners or big pension funds that have lost money in mortgage bonds some critics of mr dann say he is focusing on the wrong issues "the big problem is that we have a dismal economy " says david hansen president of the conservative think tank the buckeye institute who recommends lower taxes and spending to improve ohios job market others have criticized mr danns appointments saying he has shown favoritism to campaign backers a spokesman for mr dann denies this saying the office has "established an accountable and transparent process" for appointments that saves money for state taxpayers raised in the cleveland suburb of shaker heights mr dann played center on his football team despite injuries that sometimes landed him in the emergency room his determination now shows up in other ways recently he passed one of his criminal lawyers in the hall and asked "put anyone in jail today " mr dann can be more brusque when rehearsing a speech this year he threw a lectern to the ground when he was unhappy with the text the lectern broke forcing mr dann to replace it for &# in june when mr dann spotted a reporter outside a barack obama fund raiser the politician cursed the reporter for a story he had written an episode caught on tape by a local television station after working on campaigns in the s and s mr dann opened a law office in a youngstown ohio strip mall where he handled divorces and bankruptcies he won his first significant election in to the state senate where he became an outspoken critic of former republican ohio gov bob taft since then mr danns message has shifted from weeding out state corruption to helping homeowners by cracking down on mortgage abuses a lawyers path key career points for ohios attorney general marc dann  graduated from university
