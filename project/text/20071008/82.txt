the situation tell the detroit news but the union also seems to be bracing for confrontation since it moved to prepare for a possible strike the uaw set a wednesday deadline for a tentative agreement its contracts with gm chrysler and ford motor all expired sept but the latter two were extended indefinitely as the uaw bargained with gm those talks led to what both sides hoped would be a deal that makes the u s auto industry more competitive including the expensive shift of gms legacy health care costs for retirees to a trust overseen by the union but it included guarantees for workers including commitments to keep making certain products at some plants chrysler and ford may push for different accords that better fit their needs the news says chrysler which recently started its second major restructuring since could scorn a gm concession on job security and refuse to freeze outsourcing sources tell the news chrysler the wall street journal adds already has five plants closed this week in response to soft demand for its vehicles that could weaken the effect of any strike still the uaw which has to give the car companies hours before breaking a contract gave such notice to chrysler on saturday the journal says meaning a strike could come as early as tomorrow a bigger question mark than chryslers particular labor needs is how much cerberus capital management its new majority owner will go along with the management at gm and indeed the negotiating practices in an industry that isnt known for revolutionary change "chrysler officials are expected to come to the talks with a unique list of demands including health care cost concessions that would put the auto maker on equal footing with gm and ford when it comes to retiree medical expense liabilities " the

guards "sprayed gunfire in nearly every direction committed deliberate murder and should be punished accordingly " the new york times reports the statement by mr malikis spokesman was the first formal indication the government has concluded what investigators have already been saying unofficially that there is no evidence the blackwater guards came under fire and that the shootings were unprovoked

should be tried in court and the victims should be compensated " costa rica backs cafta costa rican voters have apparently given a victory to free trade narrowly approving a referendum on the central american free trade agreement with the u s still the backing with of the precincts reporting contradicts some earlier opinion poll results and politicians opposing the pact want a manual recount

series of events that included a leaked memo from pro cafta government officials advocating dirty tricks the resignation of a high level costa rican official and public pressure from the white house for costa ricans to support the agreement " the los angeles times notes "the agreement would eliminate nearly all trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas among the u s and the other six participants over the next years " the five other central american countries in the pact guatemala el salvador honduras nicaragua and the dominican republic have already ratified the accord the bbc notes and costa

officials tell the times his administration is re evaluating that stance "the issue has created sharp divisions within the afghan government among its western allies and even american officials of different agencies the matter is fraught with political danger for mr karzai whose hold on power is weak " the times says but the white house state department and many other advocates of spraying view herbicides as key to cutting afghanistans poppy crop which is a major source of revenue for the taliban "but officials said the skeptics who include american military and intelligence officials and european diplomats in afghanistan fear that any spraying of american made chemicals over afghan farms would be a boon to taliban propagandists " since the herbicide also destroys food crops planted
