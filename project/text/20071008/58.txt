among general motors corp ford motor co chrysler llc and toyota motor corp has created demand that some analysts say is both artificial and unsustainable calling into question how much sales of high profit trucks will contribute to the bottom lines of industry players contending with intense competition "were all watering down this truck market " ford sales analysis manager george pipas said "theres only so many buyers here and were not going to get more buyers from mars " through the first nine months of the year large pickup sales as a share of the total u s light vehicle market have stabilized at about after a blistering decline last year when they fell from at the beginning of the year in august discounts pushed the segment to a share a month high according to research firm j d power &amp associates of westlake village calif in september large pickups grabbed as auto makers spent an average of &# on incentives such as no interest loans and rebates for each large pickup they sold compared with &# on the average vehicle according to consumer information firm edmunds com this month the big three and toyota are offering financing on five year loans for last years model trucks still on the lots the equivalent of at least a &# to &# discount per truck in some cases the auto makers are combining the free loans with lump sum rebates of &# or more the rebates and financing deals effectively put in consumers pockets a subsidy to offset higher fuel costs at &# a gallon a base chevrolet silverado costs on average &# to fill up annually at &# the annual tab jumps to &# given the pervasiveness of no interest month loans which he calls "the new norm " fords mr pipas sees the only logical next step as offering month loans at no charge even if the auto makers move in that direction "payback is inevitable " he says mr pipas predicts a "rough fourth quarter" for pickup sales especially if the deals dont increase to keep luring people who arent necessarily buying pickups out of necessity mr pipas insists ford has tried to maintain a steady modest spending approach relative to pickup incentives but the company should theoretically be spending more than certain rivals because its f truck is set to be replaced by the end of he said modesty has hurt ford its best selling f series lineup is off this year it is unclear when or whether the deal making will dwindle each of the major players in the full size truck market is fighting to maintain market share in a segment that still offers substantially more profit opportunity and revenue than most other

toyota as a serious contender in the market is a bonanza when george smiths ford pickup truck hit miles in late summer he decided it was finally time to buy a new model the year old retired hospital administrator and horse owner from harrisburg pa knew there were "attractive" model year clearance deals floating around in the market and he had his eye on gmcs newly revamped sierra pickup but he had trouble finding the sierra he wanted and the ones he could find werent priced attractively after decades of buying american trucks and sport utility vehicles mr smith walked into a toyota dealer was offered a loan for months and took the deal "they gave me a very good price " he said though he says he was uncertain about buying a japanese truck to haul horses around americas heartland six weeks into owning the tundra he says "im thrilled to death that i bought it " toyotas aggressive efforts to sell production from its new factory in san antonio and establish itself in the large pickup market represent a big challenge for detroits three struggling auto makers particularly gm sales of the tundra have boomed since toyota unveiled its redesigned tundra and started offering no interest loans to move it gm which launched redesigned silverado and gmc sierra trucks late last year had hoped to use a new pricing strategy to keep rebates and financing discounts to a minimum thus bolstering resale value and profits pricing to minimize rebates and boost revenue per vehicle was a major part of its turnaround strategy when toyota began discounting the tundra gm officials complained the japanese auto maker was "throwing hand grenades " now gm has matched toyotas deals the sierra mr smith wanted is much less expensive thanks to gms offer of free five year loans on the models the success puts auto makers at a crossroads j d power chief economist bob schnorbus said "the decline in the housing market is clearly having an impact on the auto industry and pickups may be the most directly affected segment " he said in a report issued late last month "with consumers fearing further declines in the housing market the large pickup segment will continue to face considerable challenges and incentives will be critical in softening the blow in the months ahead "
